sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news tesla has filed its annual proxy statement with the securities and exchange commission sec in it the all electric and renewable energy company revealed that it plans to offer a three for one stock split at the august annual meeting the tesla stock split will appeal to smaller investors who may have wanted to invest with tesla but were blocked out by the higher stock price per share shares of tesla were up by more than 1 after hours at the time of this writing having closed at 696 69 on friday chip in a few dollars a month to help support independent cleantech coverage that helps to accelerate the cleantech revolution the impact of the tesla stock split on small shareholders the most important news out of the sec filing was that tesla will seek to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock by 4 000 000 000 shares the 3 for 1 stock split will be executed via a special dividend given to investors if you are a tesla stockholder this means that your financial stake will be the same the difference is that you ll be holding 3 times more shares if stockholders vote to approve the measure one of the most important reasons for such a stock split is to positively impact investor psychology as a share price goes up it can start to seem unaffordable a less expensive stock can be perceived as a weaker value even if the market cap for the company is the same for investors with a few thousand dollars for the market choosing a stock priced at hundreds and hundreds of dollars might mean that a big percentage of the portfolio would be invested in a single company investment managers tend to frown on such a move and usually direct clients to have a variety of holdings a stock split has the potential to increase share affordability with what is perceived to be a more accessible stock price investors who might not have otherwise chosen a particular stock could find it appealing such a draw could heighten demand and eventually even elevate the stock price forbes notes that companies that do stock splits have generally seen a nice run up in their share price which is often a big factor in deciding to split in the first place this will usually mean that they ve been doing well as a business and were probably already outperforming the s p 500 before the split tesla shares have dropped 34 so far this year questions have emerged about the validity of the stock valuation in comparison to the quality of production a tesla stock split may assuage those concerns tesla announced a similar 5 for 1 stock split in august 2020 the company executed a 5 for 1 stock split in 2020 leading to a 60 surge in the share price from the day of the announcement to the execution date ubs has upgraded tesla to a buy position saying it now sees more than a 50 upside for the electric vehicle stock cathie wood has been buying the dip in tesla stock following the ev company s 40 pullback the real audience for the tesla stock split small investors hold a mere fraction of tesla stock shares major institutions are the primary shareholders it seems the largest audience for the tesla stock split is the company s employees who may find a lower stock price makes it easier to manage their equity stock shares are frequently used as a recruiting tool and employees can get paid in company stock our success depends on attracting and retaining excellent talent the company wrote in the sec filing noting that highly competitive compensation packages help them achieve company goals tesla affirmed we believe the stock split would help reset the market price of our common stock so that our employees will have more flexibility in managing their equity the tesla stock split may enhance the liquidity of the stock for employees as smaller chunks can be sold off by investors what else should you know from the tesla sec filing shareholder proposals shareholders have suggested multiple proposals for review at the annual meeting these include the request to examine and disclose more information about the company s anti harassment and discrimination efforts lobbying practices supply chains and labor and details about its own water use and water related climate impacts and risks tesla recommends that shareholders vote against these shareholder proposals board member changes on june 2022 oracle co founder lawrence j ellison a class iii director determined that he will not stand for re election to the board when his current term ends at the 2022 annual meeting the board currently expects to reduce the number of board seats to seven upon the expiration of ellison s term at the 2022 annual meeting the board and the nominating and corporate governance committee will continue to frequently evaluate the optimal size and composition of the board to allow it to operate nimbly and efficiently while maintaining new ideas expertise and experience among its membership statement of major stockholders the filing says that ellison currently owns 1 5 of tesla shares tesla ceo elon musk currently holds 23 5 and vanguard holds 6 of tesla shares clarification of musk s 2018 tweet and its consequences the filing also disclosed again how on october 16 2018 the us district court for the southern district of new york entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the court on september 29 2018 this was done in connection with the actions taken by the sec relating to elon musk s august 7 2018 twitter post that he was considering taking tesla private on april 26 2019 this settlement was amended to clarify certain of its terms which was subsequently approved by the court musk did not admit or deny any of the sec s allegations and there is no restriction on musk s ability to serve as an officer or director on the board other than as its chair for a specified time final thoughts big tech and the broader market have taken a beating from rising interest rates this year and perhaps also inflation 2022 is likely to see stock splits from alphabet amazon gamestop and nintendo tesla in particular has seen its stock value tumble over the last several months with musk s professed concerns about free speech rights and twitter a distraction to many tesla stockholders questions continue to loom about whether musk should focus less on twitter and more on tesla meanwhile he sold 8 5 billion worth of tesla shares to raise cash to be used towards the twitter purchase which put additional downward pressure on the tesla

in 1928 the t eaton co unveiled plans for the biggest retail emporium in canada only the section outlined in white was ever built globe and mail 11 november 1928 in 1914 john eaton the third son of retail magnate timothy eaton began preparing plans for a massive expansion of his family s empire aged 38 john had spent almost his entire working life in various positions inside the t eaton company many of them in senior management alongside his father when his father died in 1907 john inherited the company and took over as president under his leadership the department store based at queen and yonge would he hoped go national the first t eaton store outside ontario opened in winnipeg in 1905 and john directed the company to begin secretly assembling land for a massive new toronto flagship store at yonge and carlton streets in 1912 designed by renowned chicago architect daniel burnham he and his partner john root designed much of the world s columbian exposition the initial plans for the store were magnificent in scale a 10 storey beaux arts structure with a curved frontage and massive skylit central atrium the company got as far as issuing the contracts for the structural steel when the first world war started in july 1914 john eaton ordered the project immediately halted as many of his workers joined the canadian armed forces and steel became a vital resource in the war effort it wouldn t be the only time eaton s college street store would be a victim of unfortunate timing two decades later in 1929 another soon to be abortive construction project took shape on the eve of the great depression at 26 storeys the victory building at 80 richmond street west was supposed to be the tallest all concrete structure in the british empire the exterior adorned with a multitude of artistic flourishes was specifically designed by architects baldwin and greene with input from toronto high rise specialist henry falk to emphasize height and stature new york sculptor a j goodelman was brought to the city to carve and install an elaborate indiana limestone sidewalk canopy while on the roof a massive concrete ziggurat was anticipated to crown the building a tall office building is a sort of mountain a civilized city mountain architect falk told the toronto daily star in september 1929 what impresses us in a mountain whether in nature or the city is its mass and contour not the details on its surface the victory building sprang from the ground at a tremendous pace in just five months the builders had completed the shell of the 15th floor and were continuing skyward however market forces in toronto and the rest of the world were beginning to cloud the building s outlook the october 1929 stock market crash halted work on the project at the 21st floor and rumours began to circulate about its structural and economic viability nothing short of an earthquake so severe as to destroy the whole city could shake the foundations of the victory building falk reassured the work stoppage he said was merely due to the rapid pace of construction the funds for the final stage of the project were unavailable because of the record setting pace of the build he said a very bright future can be predicted for the victory building he added unfortunately as the depression began to bite in early 1930 all work halted and the tower became a conspicuous shell despite numerous plans to fund the final eight floors and roof the victory building stayed a stump for seven years devoid of much of its promised architectural glory a new buyer finally bought the dormant structure in 1936 adding a few utilitarian additional floors and squaring off the roof tenants moved in on april 1 1937 but the victory building never did quite fulfil its architects grand ambitions perhaps toronto s most famous unfinished structure loomed like a spectre over the don valley for more than 20 years the hampton park apartments better known as the bayview ghost started life in 1959 as a controversial 800 unit residential complex when finished the development would have looked over the don valley from a perch northeast of rosedale above bayview avenue and included a swimming pool and putting green there was trouble almost from the moment east york approved hampton park the local council claimed it had acted in error and residents of the tony governor s bridge neighbourhood fretted over the introduction of apartments notes author mark osbaldeston in unbuilt toronto despite the local acrimony hampton park pushed ahead with construction putting up the shell of the first 105 suite building in 1960 in a last ditch effort to keep the project advancing east york rezoned the land for single family housing a move that triggered more than two decades of legal purgatory by the late 1970s the property surrounding the crisp white shell of the ghost still remained undeveloped the bare land and elevated location in clear sight of the don valley parkway fuelled the building s legend finally in 1979 a new proposal for the site pitched by new developers inadvertently broke the stalemate instead of rezoning the land to permit construction of two 12 storey apartment blocks as asked east york instead issued a demolition permit for the ghost and acquired provincial legislation upholding its single family housing bylaw in october 1981 a wrecking ball painted like a jack o lantern crashed through the walls of the bayview ghost ending the saga once and for all this shouldn t have been demolished said morris freedman a partner with hampton park developments ltd people should have been living here 22 years ago but it s a democracy people get what they want today the bayview ghost site is covered by two streets of single family dwellings in more recent times the concrete stump of the original bay adelaide centre provided stark warning that not all high rise projects manage to make it off the ground in 1988 toronto city council gave the go ahead to a controversial twin office tower project proposed by markborough properties the real estate arm of the hudson s bay company and developer trizec properties essentially council allowed markborough to merge density from three separate properties into just one at the northwest corner of yonge and adelaide in exchange the developers agreed to provide space for a new affordable housing and a public park toronto star writer david lewis stein called the bay adelaide deal everything that is wrong with city council a subsequent independent review however found the agreement to be satisfactory with the deal sealed architecture critics praised the design of the skyscraper the star s christopher hume predicted the towers would become instant landmarks in 1989 builders excavated and built the bay adelaide centre s six storey underground parking garage on the south side of temperance st just east of bay st the central elevator core that would have formed the spine of the building rose six storeys above ground and then the project fell apart the problem was the bay adelaide centre was promising to deliver a considerable amount of new office space at a time when surrounding towers were already partially vacant just five years earlier the toronto office vacancy rate was 13 percent and in the meantime scotia plaza and bce place had arrived in the downtown core unable to secure an anchor tenant for the bay adelaide centre markborough properties put the project on hold in 1991 in 1993 it nixed the whole thing when word came the bay adelaide centre had been killed it came as a surprise to many that it had still been alive wrote the star s christopher hume an attempt in 1998 to revive the project and build off the stump also failed because of a lack of tenants the partially complete elevator core was finally razed in 2006 when mayor david miller and brookfield properties ric clark took ceremonial first swings at the concrete monolith with the first world war a decade in the past the t eaton co was once again ready to further its ambition of building a flagship eaton store at yonge and carlton minus the man who masterminded the project john eaton died of pneumonia in 1922 aged just 45 and the company was helmed by his cousin robert young eaton in november 1928 his t eaton co revealed its plans for a retail emporium astonishing in scale and proportion instead of building the five storey beaux arts store it had announced just a few months earlier eaton unveiled a colossal structure that would consume two city blocks between yonge bay gerrard and college streets not carlton as the company had originally imagined inside would be more than 2 million square feet of retail space spread over nine floors all of eaton s administrative offices would be relocated to the building and there would be space for a theatre dining hall and a grand arcade connecting bay and yonge streets a 670 foot tower more than twice the height of the clock tower of old city hall would crown the whole thing it was to be toronto s rockerfeller center the biggest retail development in canada to date construction began as planned in 1928 but the great depression quickly scuppered progress and only the first phase of the building at the southwest corner of yonge and college materialized though only a fraction of the building was built the deep foundation pilings for the central tower lingered in the ground until the 1980s today the widened sections of yonge and college carlton in the area hint the great store that was lost in the financial crisis interestingly land on carlton street the t eaton co sold when it switched its sights to college street gave rise to another abortive high rise project in the form of the toronto hydro tower as it was originally planned the structure that presently stands just east of yonge was meant to support an 20 storey skyscraper it would take until 1977 for eaton s to get its modern toronto flagship in the eaton centre

as the campaign to unionize starbucks heats up with over 200 stores seeking representation by starbucks workers united the movement needs to draw lessons from previous battles to organize the coffee goliath in previous articles socialist alternative has pointed to ceo howard schultz s union busting history and the need for a fighting class struggle approach as organizers prepare for first contract battles the vast majority of starbucks stores are corporate owned starbucks counters in airports malls and grocery stores many of which are unionized are franchises not starbucks owned there is one corporate owned store in north america that has actually won a union contract it s on douglas street in victoria british columbia recently starbucks corporation has rolled out its propaganda machine to twist this story into a reason for its employees not to join a union this is our response to that disinformation campaign we hope it can be used everywhere that coffee workers are trying to unionize for an example of the lies that starbucks managers are telling we asked boston socialist alternative member and starbucks barista ty nolan to share what he was told in a captive audience meeting ty nolan they told me that the store in b c was the only unionized starbucks store in the world and therefore was the only example to draw on to learn what sbwu can do for workers they told me that those unionized workers make about 1 canadian less than non union starbucks workers in british columbia and that on top of being paid less and having less benefits they also have to pay union dues they said that once we unionized our pay and benefits would freeze until a contract was agreed upon and that when starbucks decides to give workers a raise we wouldn t receive it they essentially described working at the union store as hell you get paid less and you have to pay union dues partners can t pick up shifts at the non unionized stores so there s staffing issues there s constant turnover because of course workers want to work at a non union store and get paid more the truth is this on june 21st 2021 after a year long fight workers at the store in b c unanimously approved an agreement that they had negotiated with starbucks canada through their membership in the united steelworkers union this contract provided substantial raises above minimum wage which is what most of the workers were making at the time along with solid protections on issues like discipline job security and very importantly health and safety measures including protections against bullying and abusive customers as canadian media reported at the time in the past workers at the outlet would often face harassment from certain customers for weeks and weeks and weeks without receiving sufficient support from management said izzy adachi a barista and uws bargaining committee member and over the past year the coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated this type of public abuse especially over the mask wearing mandate now staff will be able to file grievances against management izzy adachi called this accountability measure the biggest win from the collective agreement i think that within the service industry there is this idea that we re supposed to let people take advantage of us or treat us poorly just because it s unskilled labor i don t see that as fair starbucks canada went to enormous lengths to prevent this one store contract from being the spark that lit a prairie fire of organizing on the next day after that contract was signed starbucks canada announced raises for all 19 000 baristas that did not work at that store these were actually measly raises considering how long these essential workers had waited for them in fact the company in raising wages for its hourly workers by around 5 made the shamefaced boast that this was the most significant investment in retail hourly pay in starbucks canada s history along with the embarrassing admission that it had only now committed to paying partners above minimum wage across the country since the steelworker contract already raised the pay for new hires 55 cents above the provincial minimum wage this did not in fact bring those other workers pay above those of the unionized workers four months later having evidently concluded that they needed to do more to stem the tide sbx canada announced another round of increases after insisting in its media releases that this had nothing to do with the union what s the real story we asked members of our sister organization socialist alternative canada to talk to the workers in victoria bc to get their side of the story one of the things we found out was that the starbucks managers claim that the unionized workers have less benefits is just a flat out lie the benefits package remains the same chris fofonoff of sa canada talked to united steelworkers unit chair sarah broad who works at the douglas street store and served on the bargaining team what sarah and her co workers won was historic many valuable rights are written into this contract which has extensive and detailed language against harassment and bullying and protecting workers rights including the basic question of job security with language that bans arbitrary discipline or dismissal and protects the rights of workers to be represented by trained union stewards while on company time it also protects workers incomes by spelling out the minimum length of a shift 3 hours and mandating that anyone called in for a shift has to be paid a minimum of 2 hours pay even if they turn out not to be needed the pay scale laid down in this contract represented a raise for all these workers at the time the contract was signed on june 22nd 2021 the contract runs for three years from that date new hires and anyone with less than one year s seniority 15 75 an hour after one year 16 20 after two years 16 65 three years 17 15 four years 17 67 shift supervisors start at 19 22 rising to 19 76 then 20 31 20 92 and 21 56 canadian dollars there was also a 175 signing bonus for everyone in the bargaining unit as of the date of ratification unfortunately the union did not get anything in this agreement that protects against inflation aka a cola or cost of living allowance strong union contracts mandate that future increases can t fall below the rate of inflation using measures like the consumer price index or cpi but the problem that starbucks managers are crowing about isn t about that because they don t want to talk about that the problem is that it only covers that one store unquestionably the united steelworkers made a strategic mistake in signing a contract that did not include a me too clause in other words a binding agreement that if any other worker in the country gets an additional raise or other benefit everyone covered by the union contract will get it too failing to include this language allowed the company starbucks of canada to then unilaterally raise the pay of all its other baristas and shift supervisors while using the contract as an excuse not to give the same raises to the union covered employees which is exactly what it did announcing these raises on june 23rd 2021 the very next day after the contract was signed and backdating them to may 31st so that all the as yet unorganized employees would see the raises in their next paycheck in the above linked media release the company bragged that this was the most significant investment in retail hourly pay in starbucks canada s history they neglected to mention that it only happened because one store had just signed a union contract and starbucks billionaire executives were desperate to stop it from inspiring workers in other stores four months later on october 27 2021 the company doubled down on this tactic announcing a round of even more dramatic increases for its workers in canada to take effect on january 1 2022 in language taken straight out of an anti union playbook starbucks announced a wave of investments for its partners employees building on its 50 year history and tradition of listening and learning starbucks canada senior vice president and general manager lori digulla emphasized the company s ongoing commitment to prioritize partner care and well being today i am very proud and excited to announce record investments in our partners said digulla these investments included the following starbucks will raise its hourly starting wage to be 1 above provincial minimum wage in canada and will also raise tenured hourly partners wages effective january 2022 canadian partners hired on or before january 3 2021 will receive a 6 10 per cent wage increase these investments represent a 11 per cent increase in incremental annual wages and benefits for retail hourly partners in the last 12 months hourly rates for baristas will range from 13 to 20 45 where hourly rates for shift supervisors will range from 15 85 to 24 95 hourly rates will range based on market and tenure as of june 1 2021 the provincial minimum wage in british columbia was 15 20 an hour 55 cents less than the 15 75 starting pay negotiated by the steelworkers union with this announcement starbucks was presumably paying every other barista in b c a starting wage of 16 20 an hour this is how badly starbucks corporation wants to stop its employees from having a union starbucks executives are absolutely fine with paying their 19 000 canadian barista 45 cents an hour more than a year long union campaign had succeeded in winning if it meant that they could stop the union organizing drive from potentially going on to win even higher wages and other gains that would eat into their profits and this was a drop in the bucket compared to how much starbucks has spent in stock buybacks or handed its failed ceo kevin johnson as a golden parachute lessons for today it s really important for workers organizing in the coffee industry but especially at starbucks to take note of these developments and draw the right conclusions from them

daily commercial conventional wisdom and history are probably not going to be good indicators on future guidance in the housing market and many future homebuyers may be reading tea leaves that no longer exists more around the house housing market is strong but now might be the time to sell home inspections inspect what you expect before buying there is an array of financial shifts and changes that many are not considering which could keep housing very tight for homebuyers and these circumstances may keep housing red hot for several years here are some factors that may be creating a sea of change in the housing markets first for more than a decade the united states has not built enough housing units to keep up with demand in areas like orlando we are seeing 3 6 people rent a home for just a bedroom as availability for affordable rental space is nonexistent and home prices are out of reach for most moderate income buyers unless those in need of a home continue with communal living or the government creates a real affordable housing policy the demand equation for housing will remain strong as the country is so far behind in unit counts the stock market and crypto world are extremely volatile and it is not uncommon that folks like warren buffett refer to both as casinos with rigged systems money in 2022 has been flooding out of those markets and it is looking for a safe haven with tangible assets and real returns housing and real estate provide both and even with the crash in 2008 housing assets have returned to full value expect to see money flood into real estate as uncertainty grows in other markets probably the biggest change is that national home builders are not just building houses for sale they are now building houses for rent there has been an epiphany by builders that building a home for rent can get more people in homes because there are no closing costs or down payments plus with the shortage of good rental properties the return in rental properties long term is greater than building homes there are national home builders presently building entire communities of rentals with eager investors wanting to finance deals even if the market declines in rent prices most of these deals will provide cash flow and return good profits to investors the private sector is also getting in on investment housing for short term vacation rentals more people want to rent homes for a week when they vacation and get away from confined high priced hotels and in most cases one week of rent can pay the monthly note for a vacation rental property there are private individuals who are making a great living holding tangible assets by building and temporarily leasing vacation properties across the country the multi family portion of the housing market was the fastest growing sector in march the demand for apartment rentals is very high with rents skyrocketing expect an abundance of construction activities in the next few years as the need for apartments accelerates plus wall street money and hedge funds are aggressively looking for projects to invest in unlike 2005 and 2006 when builders and amateur investors constructed homes for speculation for sale these properties are being constructed for long term investments and the other advantage most of these are being done with cash the demand for housing is not declining despite the tumult in the economy and there may come a time where rental prices will ease but most of these projects can take big cuts in rent to remain profitable this is why there will be no housing bust here is the bad news for conventional home buyers the investments in housing by builders investors and private sector vacation home builders will continue to keep prices high for material and labor as well as homes this surge in investment housing could put real restraints on what is built and available to private sector home buyers even with higher interest rates there is a good chance that pricing and availability will not improve as much as conventional wisdom and history would indicate this is not your daddy s housing market and cash remains king there is a lot of cash heading to housing and real estate don magruder is the ceo of ro mac lumber supply inc and he is also the host of the around the house show which can be seen at aroundthehouse tv

pinned relatives neighbors and friends paying respect to a fallen ukrainian soldier on saturday in bucha ukraine at least 100 ukrainian soldiers are dying every day under intense russian artillery fire a war in ukraine that began with a russian debacle as its forces tried and failed to take kyiv has seemingly begun to turn with russia now picking off regional targets ukraine lacking the weaponry it needs and western support for the war effort fraying in the face of rising gas prices and galloping inflation on the 108th day of president vladimir v putin s unprovoked war driven by his conviction that ukraine is territory unjustly taken from the russian empire russia appeared no closer to victory but its forces did appear to be making slow methodical and bloody progress toward control of eastern ukraine on saturday ukraine s agile president volodymyr zelensky once again promised victory we are definitely going to prevail in this war that russia has started he told a conference in singapore in a video appearance it is on the battlefields in ukraine that the future rules of this world are being decided yet the heady early days of the war when the ukrainian underdog held off a deluded and inept aggressor and mr putin s indiscriminate bombardment united the west in outrage have begun to fade in their place is a war that is evolving into what analysts increasingly say will be a long slog placing growing pressure on the governments and economies of western countries and others throughout the world nowhere is that slog more evident than in ukraine s eastern donbas region despite urgent pleas to the west for more heavy weapons ukrainian forces appear to lack what it takes to confront russian use of artillery for scorched earth shelling of towns and villages while ukraine is holding russia back in the major regional city of sievierodonetsk it is suffering heavy losses at least 100 fatalities a day though their full extent is not yet known and desperately needs more weapons and ammunition image a ukrainian police officer this week near a destroyed bridge that once connected the embattled cities of lysychansk and sievierodonetsk in the donbas region credit ivor prickett for the new york times russia also appears to be making headway in establishing control in towns it has captured including the leveled black sea port of mariupol it has set out to convince and coerce the remaining population that its future lies in what mr putin views as his restored empire citizens there and in cities like kherson and melitopol face a bleak choice if they want to work they must first obtain a russian passport a blandishment offered to secure a semblance of loyalty to moscow propaganda that compares mr putin with peter the great russia s first emperor blares from cars in mariupol in what petro andriushchenko an adviser to the city s mayor called a pseudohistorical onslaught the comparison one that mr putin has made himself is dear to the russian president s heart he has repeatedly insisted that ukraine is not a real nation and that its true identity is russian his invasion has however cemented and galvanized ukrainian national identity in ways previously unimaginable russia has its own difficulties particularly in southern ukraine where the provincial capital of kherson captured earlier in the war is still contested attacks by former ukrainian soldiers and civilians have picked up in recent weeks russian losses in the war are not yet known but certainly run into the tens of thousands a potential source of anger toward mr putin whose autocratic hold on russia keeps tightening if the russian economy has shown surprising resilience it has been hard hit by western sanctions a brain drain will undermine growth for many years mr putin s pariah status in the west appears unlikely to change elsewhere however in africa and asia support for the west and for ukraine is more nuanced many countries see little difference between mr putin s invasion of ukraine and the united states invasion of iraq in 2003 they seem unlikely to be persuaded otherwise image a ukrainian solider taking cover on friday as russian artillery shells landed near his position on the front line in the donetsk region the ukrainians are nearly defenseless against russia s long range artillery credit tyler hicks the new york times more generally there is resentment in much of the developing world of what is seen as american domination viewed as a hangover from the 20th century in this context the strong partnership between china and russia is viewed not with the hostility and anxiety it provokes in the west but rather as a salutary challenge to a western dominated global system the american defense secretary lloyd j austin iii on a visit to asia to warn of potential chinese aggression against taiwan tried on saturday to shore up support for the west s ardent backing of ukraine against the russian invasion it s what happens when big powers decide that their imperial appetites matter more than the rights of their peaceful neighbors he said and it s a preview of a possible world of chaos and turmoil that none of us would want to live in speaking at a security summit in singapore mr austin said that russia s invasion was what happens when oppressors trample the rules that protect us all he spoke after mr zelensky had expressed concern in his nightly address that the world s attention may drift away from ukraine with inflation hitting levels not seen for four decades in the united states and britain financial markets tumbling interest rates rising and food shortages looming such a drift in focus away from a long war toward more pressing domestic concerns may be inevitable the war is not to blame for all of these developments but it does exacerbate most of them and there is no end in sight image in novoselivka ukraine near the northern city of chernihiv residents waited on friday for the distribution of aid roughly 80 percent of the village s homes were damaged or destroyed this year credit nicole tung for the new york times a combination of high inflation and recession viewed as plausible by many economists would be reminiscent of the 1970s when the first oil shock devastated the global economy with midterm elections in the united states only months away president biden and the democrats can ill afford a campaign season dominated by talk of 5 a gallon gasoline and near double digit inflation yet the ingredients of a long war are clear enough there is no sign of a russian readiness for territorial compromise at the same time ukrainian resistance is still strong enough to make any formal cession of territory almost unimaginable the result is grinding deadlock a far cry from mr putin s apparent initial conviction that russian forces would stroll into kyiv ukraine s capital to a warm welcome some of the roots of the war lie in ukraine s strategic decision to draw closer to the 27 nation european union and turn away from moscow mr putin could not abide this shift now reinforced in ukraine by a brutal confrontation with russia s military methods ursula von der leyen the european commission president met with mr zelensky on saturday in kyiv in a show of support the european union is considering granting ukraine the formal status of candidate for e u membership at a summit meeting on june 23 and 24 in paris there has been talk of a possible visit by president emmanuel macron to ukraine after that meeting in ukraine and beyond mr macron who has spoken regularly with mr putin since the war began in february has been vehemently criticized for insisting on the need to avoid the humiliation of russia in order to keep diplomatic channels open a french presidential official walked that back on saturday saying we want a ukrainian victory we want ukraine s territorial integrity to be restored after the russian butchery in bucha near kyiv and in mariupol the chances of successful diplomacy appear more remote than ever it is even unclear what the very term victory would mean for either side

in the wake of russia s invasion of ukraine the world appears to be at an inflection point business leaders have declared the acceleration of deglobalization and sounded the alarm about a new period of stagflation academics have decried the return of conquest and hailed the renewal of transatlantic ties and countries are rethinking almost every aspect of their foreign policies including trade defense spending and military alliances these dramatic shifts have overshadowed another profound transformation in the global energy system for the last two decades the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions has gradually reshaped the global energy order now as a result of the war in ukraine energy security has returned to the fore joining climate change as a top concern for policymakers together these dual priorities are poised to reshape national energy planning energy trade flows and the broader global economy countries will increasingly look inward prioritizing domestic energy production and regional cooperation even as they seek to transition to net zero carbon emissions if countries retreat into strategic energy blocs a multidecade trend toward more energy interconnectedness risks giving way to an age of energy fragmentation but in addition to economic nationalism and deglobalization the coming energy order will be defined by something that few analysts have fully appreciated government intervention in the energy sector on a scale not seen in recent memory after four decades during which they generally sought to curb their activity in energy markets western governments are now recognizing the need to play a more expansive role in everything from building and retiring fossil fuel infrastructure to influencing where private companies buy and sell energy to limiting emissions through carbon pricing subsidies mandates and standards this shift is bound to invite comparisons to the 1970s when excessive government intervention in energy markets exacerbated repeated energy crises the dawning era of government intervention won t be a bad thing however if managed correctly appropriately limited and tailored to address specific market failures it can forestall the worst effects of climate change mitigate many energy security risks and help manage the biggest geopolitical challenges of the coming energy transition the current energy crisis has refocused the world s attention on geopolitical energy risks forcing a reckoning between tomorrow s climate ambitions and today s energy needs and offering a preview of the tumultuous era ahead how governments respond to these challenges brought into sharp relief by russia s invasion of ukraine will shape the new energy order for decades to come worse than the disease the story of the 1970s energy crises is in part a story of government overreach even before six gulf members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec cut production and instituted an oil embargo against the united states and other countries that supported israel during the 1973 yom kippur war washington had actively sought to manage u s oil markets in 1959 for instance president dwight eisenhower set quotas on oil imports in order to protect american producers these quotas had their intended effect allowing u s producers to flourish and boost supply throughout the 1960s but they did not protect consumers from rising costs as americans took to the suburbs buying ever larger homes and cars oil consumption outpaced supply and prices eventually began to rise to keep prices in check president richard nixon tried a number of policies in 1971 at the same time that his administration ended the gold standard he imposed a series of wage and price controls including on oil and gas but these measures only increased demand for oil while pushing down domestic supply by the winter of 1972 73 fuel shortages had forced some school districts to close on various days and the media was warning of a looming energy crisis in the spring of 1973 nixon relented and revoked eisenhower s oil import quotas at the same time urging americans to conserve gasoline yet by june several months before the arab oil embargo nearly half the gas stations in the country reported problems operating normally and drivers were struggling to find fuel instead of dialing back the government s role in energy markets nixon dialed it up and the cure proved worse than the disease in november 1973 nixon created a federal program through which government officials determined how to allocate propane heating oil jet fuel diesel and other fuels the effort according to william simon who headed the federal energy office at the time was a disaster it was against this backdrop of government intervention that the arab oil embargo led to panic buying and lines at gas stations across the country the story of the 1970s energy crises is in part a story of government overreach the end of the 1970s saw yet another oil crisis fueled by many of the same forces in late 1978 a popular uprising in iran brought oil production there to a standstill causing shortages in the united states and other countries and sending prices skyward as they had during the previous crisis federal price controls and efforts at allocation only made things worse americans waited in gas lines once again were restricted to fueling up on certain days and listened as president jimmy carter delivered his famous crisis of confidence speech among the lessons learned from these failures was that too much government micromanagement of the energy economy can backfire carter began deregulating energy prices a process that president ronald reagan then accelerated gradually over the next few decades the u s government pared back its role in the energy economy it phased out import quotas ended oil and gas price controls and scrapped the allocation system to be sure the government also enlarged its role in other energy related areas instituting fuel economy standards and lower speed limits subsidizing synthetic fuels and home weatherization initiatives creating the strategic petroleum reserve and expanding leasing for exploration and production in the gulf of mexico and alaska its increasing use of sanctions against energy producing nations has been another exception to the general rule nevertheless many of the most significant changes to the energy sector since the crises of the 1970s such as deregulating natural gas sales and creating competitive power producers and wholesale power markets have been guided by a bipartisan consensus that energy security and low costs are best ensured by simply allowing the market to operate on its own gathering storm the energy crisis triggered by russia s invasion of ukraine could become the worst in half a century many analysts have already drawn comparisons with the 1970s oil crises but there are important differences to begin with the global economy is less energy intense economic growth has outpaced growth in energy use so the world now uses much less energy per unit of gdp moreover many more companies distribute oil globally today than did in the early 1970s when just a handful of firms controlled most of the world s oil trade as a result energy supply chains are now more durable that said the current energy crisis goes well beyond oil and could thus affect a wider slice of the economy energy sources of all kinds stand to be disrupted by the turmoil russia is not only the world s largest exporter of oil and refined petroleum products but also the dominant supplier of natural gas to europe and a major exporter of coal and the low enriched uranium used to power nuclear plants not to mention many other commodities with coal gasoline diesel natural gas and other commodity prices all near record highs further disruption of russian energy supplies whether initiated by russia or europe would accelerate inflation invite recession demand energy rationing and force business shutdowns the global energy system was under stress even before russian president vladimir putin decided to invade ukraine europe and other parts of the world faced power generation challenges as more and more of their electricity came from intermittent sources such as solar and wind at the same time years of poor returns and increased climate pressures had reduced investment in oil and gas resulting in limited supplies covid 19 related supply chain problems compounded the scarcity and added to pricing pressures in 2021 and early 2022 soaring natural gas prices pushed some european utilities into bankruptcy and forced governments to subsidize energy bills things could have been even worse but warmer than expected weather in europe and asia eased some of the demand for energy a shuttered gas pump in berlin may 2022 julia zimmermann laif redux since the outbreak of the war in ukraine energy markets have been even more volatile credit markets have tightened leaving little liquidity to support the buying and selling of oil and both supply and demand have experienced large shocks many buyers have steered clear of russian oil concerned about western banking and financial sanctions as well as the potential stigma of doing business with russia already the international energy agency estimates that russia is producing around one million fewer barrels per day a number that could climb if the european union follows through with its plan to ban all russian crude oil gasoline and diesel by the end of the year speculation that more sanctions could be on the horizon coupled with opec s reluctance to backfill lost russian oil supply has pushed prices higher still as of late may oil was trading at well over 100 per barrel u s gasoline prices reached a record high that month not adjusted for inflation and rocketing diesel prices raised the costs of shipping and food u s natural gas prices climbed to their highest level since 2008 nearly doubling since the start of the year consumers in europe and elsewhere face an even sharper emergency as a result of record natural gas prices such prices would be higher still were it not for two powerful factors that are at least temporarily moving the market in the opposite direction covid 19 induced lockdowns in china have seriously dented global energy demand and the united states and its international partners have released unprecedented amounts of oil from their strategic reserves for the time being the volume flowing from strategic stockpiles roughly offsets the loss of supply from russia but the worst is likely yet to come when chinese lockdowns ease oil demand will surge pushing up prices the same will be true for natural gas prices which in turn affect electricity and heating prices although russian gas has largely continued to flow to europe moscow has cut sales to finland poland and bulgaria curbed exports through ukraine and to a gazprom subsidiary seized by germany and threatened to sever supplies to all european countries that do not pay in rubles a complete cutoff of russian gas supplies to europe is still unlikely but hardly unthinkable and would probably lead to shortages energy rationing and the shuttering of energy intensive industries any additional sanctions would have second and third order effects on the global energy system already the turmoil in markets for liquefied natural gas which has increasingly flowed toward europe because of higher prices there has left asia looking for alternative energy sources coal an abundant and comparatively cheap substitute for natural gas has won out china and other countries have boosted coal production amid rising fears of global energy shortages taking some of the pressure off global gas markets without asia s increased production of coal europe would be less able to cope with the loss of russian gas but greater reliance on coal has pushed its price to record highs as well leaving lower income countries such as india and pakistan struggling to meet their energy needs in the midst of deadly heat waves high prices for natural gas used to produce fertilizer are also driving up food prices that were already rising because of disruptions in russian and ukrainian agricultural exports safe and secure these cascading emergencies demand a reevaluation of the lessons from the 1970s about the right balance between government involvement and market autonomy reliance on market forces has yielded enormous benefits over the last 40 years making energy more affordable and accessible increasing economic efficiency and boosting energy security by enabling competitive pricing to shift supplies into markets where they are most needed today s crises however highlight certain market failures that can only be addressed with greater government intervention three market failures in particular reveal the need for a bigger role for government in the effort to achieve the dual goals of enhanced energy security and a timely transition to net zero carbon emissions first the private sector lacks sufficient incentives to build the infrastructure and other assets that most countries need to ensure their energy security second market forces alone cannot encourage the building of the infrastructure required for a more orderly energy transition infrastructure that by definition may be obsolete before private companies have achieved a full return on investment and third private firms and individuals lack strong enough incentives to curb emissions whose costs society bears the first of these failures has been painfully illustrated by europe s vulnerability to the disruption of russian energy exports to achieve energy security countries need a range of options for purchasing energy a diversity of energy supplies and adequate reserves in case of emergency all of which require greater government intervention free markets often do a good job of ensuring that consumers have a range of options for sourcing energy when supplies are disrupted in one location whether by a natural disaster or political upheaval free trade in highly integrated and well functioning commodity markets allows buyers to find alternatives and thereby avoid shortages this practice was more difficult in the early 1970s when oil was sold in long term contracts rather than traded globally as a commodity but as the current european energy crisis makes clear switching to alternative energy sources for political economic or diplomatic reasons is only possible when the infrastructure ports and terminals with excess capacity for example is in place to allow for the switch the private sector lacks incentives to invest in such infrastructure because disruptions are unpredictable and private companies will not bear the full cost to society of the resulting dislocations governments therefore need to step in the coming energy order will be defined by government intervention on a scale not seen in recent memory lithuania is a case in point nearly a decade ago the country built a floating liquefied natural gas terminal aptly named independence the terminal allowed the baltic state to reduce its dependence on russian natural gas and negotiate better prices from gazprom but the commercial operation of the terminal alone would not have justified its costs especially since it has often operated well below capacity the terminal could be financed only thanks to loan guarantees and other forms of aid from the lithuanian government in addition to loans from the european investment bank this decision to invest in energy security infrastructure is paying dividends today enabling lithuania to become the first european country to completely cease importing russian gas after putin s invasion of ukraine germany is also looking to liquefied natural gas to reduce its dependence on russian gas russia has long been germany s cheapest source of natural gas leading germany to gradually increase its imports from there and by 2021 to source more than half the gas it used from russia now to bring non russian gas into the country berlin has earmarked three billion euros to support the development of four floating liquefied natural gas import terminals businesses and consumers will have to pay more for their energy going forward but the government will have created the infrastructure to enable a more diverse natural gas supplier base these moves by lithuania and germany build on recent efforts by the european commission to ensure more competition in gas markets and provide direct funding for pipeline improvements and liquefied natural gas infrastructure investments that private firms alone had little incentive to make as a result europe s natural gas market is more resilient today than it was when russia cut gas flows in 2009 the dawning era of government intervention won t be a bad thing if managed correctly government owned stockpiles such as the u s strategic petroleum reserve are another tool for energy security that cannot be delivered solely by the market in europe many governments do not hold reserves but instead require companies to maintain above normal levels of inventory although such stockpiles can help ease shortages in a crisis they also require infrastructure that private companies are unlikely to build on their own u s president joe biden s administration has released enormous amounts of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve for instance but the government s ability to release even more to calm global prices is limited by a shortage of available ports and terminals in the past such infrastructure constraints were uncommon yet the shale boom that made the united states a net energy exporter has dramatically increased demand for port space which is now mostly claimed by the private sector for government stocks to increase total global supply rather than simply displace private sector barrels additional ports and terminals are needed that may see limited use outside of energy crunches given that there is little commercial rationale for infrastructure that is only occasionally used governments must play a role in developing it as a major report by the department of energy recommended in 2015 governments may also need to intervene in energy markets beyond those for oil and gas the critical minerals needed for a successful energy transition such as lithium nickel and cobalt are likely to be in short supply as electric vehicles become more prevalent and as solar wind batteries and other forms of low and zero carbon infrastructure proliferate one answer would be to mine more of them to date u s companies have largely avoided producing and processing critical minerals because of the environmental costs associated with doing so and the easy availability of foreign sources but having determined that several of these minerals are critical for national security the biden administration is now offering incentives to boost their domestic production additional government involvement may be needed too private developers are understandably nervous about making large investments that could take a decade or more to pay off while major efforts are underway to find alternatives to these minerals or to commercialize their recycling the u s government might consider guaranteeing such markets as it did for covid 19 vaccines to ensure the production of critical minerals on a larger scale government intervention to enhance energy security need not be limited to subsidies tax breaks and other incentives diplomacy too can help secure adequate energy supplies in a crisis when europe faced natural gas shortfalls last winter for example the united states sent envoys to japan and south korea among other places to persuade them to forgo some natural gas cargoes that could then flow to europe instead the united states also encouraged qatar to allow its gas to be sold to european buyers third party transactions that were often prohibited by destination clauses in long term contracts timed out the second market failure that necessitates government intervention in energy markets stems from the relatively short time frame that the world has to achieve its climate goals new oil and gas assets that are needed to ensure energy security during the transition may need to be retired before the companies can pay their investors back after all what company would risk capital to keep the lights and heat on in the near and medium term while policymakers make increasingly ambitious pledges to render the necessary infrastructure obsolete to the extent that any companies are willing to make those investments they should not have to bet against the world s ability to reach its climate goals moreover such investments should not create obstacles to climate action by strengthening economic forces that oppose faster progress because they have vested financial interests in today s energy system creative policymaking can help meet today s energy needs without undermining tomorrow s energy transition governments might for instance designate certain types of oil and gas installations as transition assets and take a more active role in helping private companies build them assets such as regasification terminals and pipelines that are needed today but are at risk of being stranded if the goal of net zero emissions is achieved by 2050 might also be required to be transition ready that is built equipped for carbon capture technology or for low carbon fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia and governments might bear some of the additional costs in the early years alternatively governments could develop innovative tools to plan for obsolescence for instance they might favor the permitting of hydrocarbon infrastructure investments with shorter payback periods condition that permitting on having a right to pay to wind down the asset after a specified time or shorten the payback period by lowering the cost of capital for private firms in exchange for the right to retire the asset after the investment yields a certain return building a gas pipeline in anklam germany april 2019 manfred scharnberg visum redux governments will need to take great care in adopting such policies they should be limited to hydrocarbon projects deemed necessary for near term energy security needs and they should favor projects with more versatile uses such as those that can deliver clean energy or might redirect energy to other destinations moreover policymakers must carefully assess what components of the oil and gas industry are really suitable for transition ready projects so that untested claims that some oil and gas projects can be hydrogen ready for example do not become a loophole for companies to exploit finally governments should require project developers to meet the strictest emissions standards for methane leaks for example so that infrastructure can have the smallest carbon footprint possible own the problem the third market failure that necessitates greater government intervention in the energy market is by now the most familiar private firms and individuals do not bear the full costs to society of the carbon and other pollutants they emit governments must therefore require producers and consumers to internalize these costs through carbon pricing or other mechanisms stronger government climate policy including carbon taxes subsidies mandates and standards is necessary to achieve rapid reductions in carbon emissions as the most recent report from the un intergovernmental panel on climate change made clear time is running short to avoid the most severe consequences of climate change if emissions are not slashed immediately it will not be possible to limit the rise in global temperature to 1 5 degrees celsius the threshold above which the worst environmental health economic and other effects will occur and as the impacts of climate change become more frequent and severe the urgency of government action will grow market forces alone cannot deliver a sufficiently low carbon economy without greater government intervention real and anticipated shortages of natural gas will translate into greater coal use for instance as the current crisis has already demonstrated this may have been an acceptable response to energy insecurity in the 1970s when g 7 countries committed to ramping up coal production and trade in the face of oil shortages but as the most carbon intensive fuel coal is no longer an appropriate alternative even if it is a workable substitute for russian gas as the impacts of climate change become more frequent and severe the urgency of government action will grow the problem of dirty fuels replacing cleaner ones in times of upheaval also highlights an even greater challenge that of delivering low carbon energy to developing countries whose need for energy is growing rapidly developed countries will need to help make private investment in low carbon energy for developing countries less risky to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 more than 70 percent of the clean energy investment in developing and emerging markets must originate from the private sector according to the international energy agency governments must do more to help mobilize that capital for example institutions such as the world bank and the u s development finance corporation could lend to local banks at affordable rates finance projects in local currency and expand the availability of loan guarantees these institutions could also lend to project developers directly capital from development finance institutions can go a long way toward spurring private investment the good news is that in the long term many of the government actions needed to reduce emissions in particular by reducing demand for oil and gas will also boost energy security that is in part because energy security comes not just from producing more oil but from using less of it fifteen years ago the united states imported two thirds of the oil it consumed in 2021 it exported more oil than it imported yet americans remain just as vulnerable to gasoline price hikes when global oil supplies are disrupted households in europe would similarly be more secure if they consumed less natural gas either by using substitutes or being more energy efficient here too there is a role for government public information campaigns and incentives for efficiency related investments can help drive the technological and behavioral changes needed to conserve energy during crises europe s 9 11 a more expansive role for government is likely to be a defining feature of the new global energy order that will emerge from the russia ukraine crisis and just as greater government intrusion into energy markets had profound economic political and geopolitical ramifications in the 1970s such activity will be transformational today although not in a negative way if done right structured and managed properly greater government engagement in the energy and climate realm can help smooth the volatility of markets mitigate the risks that will inevitably arise from the energy transition and shorten the path to net zero emissions to the extent that they enhance energy security for instance well crafted government policies can reduce the risk of populist backlash such as france s yellow vest protests against climate initiatives by the same token more options for sourcing energy will diminish the geopolitical leverage that may accrue to traditional oil and gas producers in the short term before the energy transition is complete as we warned in these pages earlier this year if western governments leave these decisions to the market low cost suppliers such as russia and the arab gulf countries will end up producing a greater share of the world s oil and gas during the multidecade period in which consumption falls but remains substantial this dynamic could be particularly problematic if pressures to curb fossil fuel investment lead to a decline in production by western energy firms even as demand rises or plateaus but if western governments can facilitate investment in transition assets over time they can reduce both carbon emissions and dependence on traditional producers that may exploit the transition for their own economic and geopolitical benefit government efforts to secure financing for clean energy projects in emerging markets can also reduce another set of risks those stemming from the growing rift between developed and developing countries in the absence of such measures the resentment of poor and middle income countries toward rich ones that refuse to finance fossil fuel projects in the developing world even as they scramble to secure more oil and gas to offset their own losses from the current crisis will continue to build compromising cooperation not just on climate change but on other critical issues such as pandemic preparedness conflict resolution and counterterrorism that the burden of a warming climate falls disproportionately on the very countries that have the least responsibility for global emissions only exacerbates their rancor on an offshore oil rig in pointe noire republic of the congo may 2008 giovanni porzio contrasto redu x most important government intervention to accelerate the reduction of carbon emissions can prevent some of the climate change outcomes that have the worst geopolitical and security implications as the u s national intelligence council concluded last year climate change will amplify strategic competition over the arctic stoke conflict over water resources and migration and potentially spark new kinds of geopolitical disputes as countries unilaterally test and deploy large scale geoengineering initiatives the emissions reductions needed to prevent these outcomes cannot be achieved without government action certainly greater government intervention in energy markets is not always desirable as the u s experience in the 1970s showed governments that go too far toward national planning or unconstrained industrial policy will squander the many benefits of the free market to be successful policymakers must narrowly tailor their policies toward specific market failures as alexander hamilton wrote in matters of industry human enterprise ought doubtless to be left free in the main not fettered by too much regulation but practical politicians know that it may be beneficially stimulated by prudent aids and encouragements on the part of the government some european countries have already gone too far in their response to the present crisis spain and portugal have approved caps on natural gas prices that are just a fraction of the market price some democrats in the u s congress have proposed a measure that would prohibit price increases during national energy emergencies declared by the president as recent history suggests such price controls will be counterproductive in taking a more active role in energy markets governments must resist the temptation to direct their energy sectors in the ways that those with nationally owned companies do the u s government for example allocates permits to companies that wish to export natural gas but it does not direct where that gas goes market forces do a more active role for government that favors some countries over others risks politicizing the energy trade and reducing the ability of global markets to allocate resources efficiently without government intervention the world will suffer a breakdown in energy security or the worst effects of climate change or both governments must also be careful about relying too heavily on energy diplomacy especially that which seeks to influence what should be market based decisions about buying and selling energy recent american efforts to free up supplies of liquefied natural gas for europe by discouraging asian purchases were justified in a crisis but caution should be exercised going forward injecting politics into otherwise commercial matters risks undermining the faith of u s trading partners in the sanctity of long term contracts which could ultimately hurt u s companies undermine investment or risk retaliatory efforts to politicize trade in other goods and services also risky are aggressive government efforts to achieve energy security by disconnecting from the global energy economy some members of the u s congress noting that the united states now exports more energy than it imports advocate curbing u s exports of oil and gas in order to meet american energy needs first such actions would likely backfire undermining energy security as well as free trade diversifying supply by stimulating domestic production of key commodities can bring benefits but so too does integration into a well supplied and flexible energy market energy self sufficiency may seem like a route to security but it would be highly inefficient and impose unnecessary costs it would also leave the united states without the necessary global energy linkages to meet demand in the event of a future crisis or dip in u s shale production finally governments must avoid inflaming domestic partisan divisions which in the united states are already deep with regard to the question of the role of government in the years to come a growing number of legislative proposals aimed at boosting energy security smoothing the transition to net zero emissions and coping with climate change promise more political flash points and partisan wrangling american leaders must therefore make a concerted effort to build a bipartisan and broad based coalition in support of these measures one that includes everyone from environmentalists to the oil and gas industry another coalition of strange bedfellows existed two decades ago before the shale boom when the united states imported huge quantities of oil from sometimes unstable regions that posed a national security threat a broad spectrum of interests each motivated by different arguments pulled together then to push the united states to consume less oil today a similar coalition could be built around the need for an integrated strategy that ensures both climate security and energy security europe has called the russian war in ukraine its 9 11 the terrorist attacks of that day brought about a new security order that dominated the international landscape for 20 years and is still a dominant feature of world affairs one legacy of the ukraine war will be a new energy order originating in europe but radiating to the farthest reaches of the global economy it will be defined by the dual imperatives of energy security and climate action pursuing them at the same time without allowing one to compromise the other will require harnessing the power of markets but it will also require a much more expansive role for government to leverage shape and steer those markets correcting the failures thrown into sharp relief by today s crisis without government intervention tailored and restrained but nonetheless increased the world will suffer a breakdown in energy security or the worst effects of climate change or both

loud whispers this is the latest i heard at the famous terra kulture last sunday i had gone for my fashion show tagged private parts and as it is usually the case when investment bankers met the economy under either atiku or tinubu came into focus at this point atiku had been confirmed as the candidate of the pdp and tinubu was looking good for apc a very brilliant investment banker who had just consummated one of the biggest trade transactions on the floor of the stock exchange was the one that coined the term developmental corruption his position was very clear we will see a lot of corruption but it will be infinitesimal compared to the expansion the economy will witness he went on edgar for the first time we will have someone in the villa who can read a balance sheet see the last time we achieved anything with privatisation was when atiku was the vice president yes he sold to cronies but they were able to create billionaires expand the economy and rebuild the middle class as the food was coming he was gingered edgar tinubu is the same see the massive spike in the igr of lagos see what he has done with lagos with successive governors ensuring a continuum see lagos cannot be compared to other megacities of the world but it is far far above any other city state in the country by this time i wanted to hear more so i said please bring the fresh fish and the ewa agoyin if you don t have afang go and buy it and bring how can i be eating egusi that is treason so the food flowed and he flowed even akwa ibom that is a pdp state is using the controversial alpha beta if that is true me i don t know o so he concluded by saying that for the past eight years we have had a restrictive and incestuous economic engagement with telling negative impact on standards of living a worsening unemployment rate and over 600 devaluation of the naira so for him what we will be seeing in atiku or tinubu will be development laced by guided and strategic corruption i gave up i just chopped my afang and drank water nothing more to add kai yemi osinbajo ice cream got you for me what damaged prof yemi osinbajo was the ice cream comment it was lethal well timed and delivered with precision it threw up the vice president as a weakling someone who will not be able to grapple with the insecurity that currently besets the country dropping this in the wake of the owo massacre was a massive blow that no politician no matter how adept can come out professor osinbajo in my mind s eye is the perfect candidate for a normalised nigeria not a candidate for nigeria that is under the throes of damage fear and desolation if osinbajo was a church he would be house on the rock or chris okotie s church you go to those ones when you do not have spiritual problems you go and do praise worship dance hug and kiss people but when witchcraft is disturbing you and you cannot sleep at night you will go to mfm to cast and bind that is where you will be doing violent prayers nigeria of today cannot be ruled by a gentleman it cannot be ruled by a person who has sense it can only be normalised by a mad man a man who cares nothing about decorum he will trample on some fundamental human rights and he will run wild flogging people and processes in line this no be prof i am sure at that convention he will just be weeping in his heart how can nigeria fall so low he will be wondering the charade the horse trading the mindless gerrymandering that has thrown up a candidate that perfectly suits the madness of the times he will just be weeping in his heart a man with such erudite qualifications a well spoken gentleman a well regarded person who has tremendous respect and was only voted for by about 200 people when the other person with got over one thousand votes osinbajo my brother weep not my brother nigeria still needs you we will soon call for you when all of this madness is over pele egbon mi rochas okorocha what was that me i really was not interested in the apc convention and had gone to bed early my brother idowu who is a permanent secretary in abuja suddenly called me to ask if i was watching i said no he screamed oga go and watch things are happening my tv in the room is permanently on a porn site so i went downstairs to the living room and changed the channel to arise tv that na where i sure say i will get perfect coverage it was okorocha s turn to speak be like say the man don look too many martin luther king jr speeches he started to emulate that one o complete with the shaky growling voice the lifting of a finger to the mountaintop and the proclamation of my people my people my people when a man cannot compete with jagaban in bullion van things what will he resort to but theatrics i quickly called my director who is getting ready to stage nnamdi azikiwe for me next easter i said come and watch o do you think we should cast okorocha as azikiwe watch this performance the man watched called me back and said maybe we can use him as one of azikiwe boys but certainly not azikiwe i asked why i like his posturing and his gait he has strong voice quality and his head is big enough people will see him in the theatre my director just shouted no he doesn t have the charisma his looks are all wrong he is not natural and he is performing instead of delivering a performance he is coming off as very fake and will not be convincing but he has energy and gra gra so we can use him as azikiwe s driver or something i said to him you are mad rochas as driver a former governor of the great imo state the champion of iberiberism and the only single man in the whole of igboland who understands the economic value of statues as a major tourist attraction at that point rochas bellowed i have made money before the government everybody contesting today made money from the government there was a way his mouth twisted from that statement and i began to reason with my director maybe he has a point o as the results came out and i saw that not even his pa voted for him i began to work the phones to give him a chance at a second career in theatre please anybody who is close to him or knows his efcc ipo please let them know that we are looking for him to star in our production of nnamdi azikiwe he will need it pastor bakare spit on me this one just came to spit and shout and go back home to his amala and efo riro these people do not even know the next thing about public speaking they do not know how to measure their words tailor it cajole cuddle and bring colour to the point that even if they will still lose because our delegates no come abuja for that one we the general public will go home with a warm feeling like that was a man see prof osinbajo measured and aristocratic powerful intellect and sweet delivery see bill clinton see tony blair see wole soyinka orators see me sef when i talk for command secondary school alumni all the girls will now beg me to impregnate them i tell you baba just came and was shouting down at people sweating and straining himself me i was afraid make he no go faint o with the way he was sweating and spitting it was as if i was watching a badly prepared wrestler in a bout why he even tries beats me but then again if we don t have these kinds of side attractions we will not be nigerians na that is why we are the happiest people in the world asiwaju tinubu celibacy beckons please there is one boy or should i call him man i don t even know what to call him at this point his name is osa and he used to live in magodo he now lives somewhere in obalende but he will be telling people that he is leaving in ikoyi he was the one that came to me with one yeye analysis that tinubu cannot win this nomination he spoke so confidently told me all the permutations and ended by saying that you know i have insiders who cook for buhari and they have told me it is amaechi that is how i me sef went to believe this man o i now came out and proclaimed very confidently that if tinubu win then i will go celibate for four years my people tinubu has won o see my problem o people are calling me and asking how i will do you see the wahala osa and him beer parlour analysis come put me now not only osa o most people on the duke summit said there was no way tinubu would win that he is walking like a drunken sailor and he is speaking like someone who is overdosed with kunu very unlike me i threw caution overboard and went to make the kind of statement wole soyinka made during donald trump when he threatened to tear his american passport if trump won now if he did that i am not sure o so now tinubu has won and osa will be enjoying himself in the other room with his madam and me i am here with thousands waiting to see how i will keep my oath well i have asked my lawyers to look at the word celibacy and see if we can establish any unseen clauses that can give us a way out you trust nigerian lawyers anyone that cannot do this work no go law school once they go to law school they will deliver be watching the election tribunal and you will be seeing the brilliance of nigerian lawyers that was how my lawyer came back with a solution mr edgar you can masturbate there is no penetration there is no partner you can t impregnate anybody and you are on your own i say god bless you daniel has come to judgement charly boy how soon my big brother who has refused to see me since he came to eat afang in my house with mudi and olisa adibua has said that he will go on exile in ghana if either tinubu and atiku wins the election my advice is that he should start the process because there is no way one of these two merchants will not be our president next year area fada in his submission even stated that he will beg for citizenship in ghana i say make him start next week and start early because the way it is going there will soon be a deluge nigerians don tire if you follow both conferences pdp and apc you will cry blood apart from throwing up the same kinds of people the process was fraught with everything but good and straightforward when corrupt processes throw up leadership how do you then expect that leadership to be anything but my brother please start and let us know how it is going so that some of us will consider joining na wa kingsley moghalu let s retire honourably my brother who had sworn to retire both atiku and tinubu has been shown the door by little known kachikwu kachikwu who is said to be the brother of former minister of state for petroleum dr ibe kachikwu came tops at the recent party primaries of their little known party adc mr kachikwu also beat my friend chuka monye chuka had come to our duke summit to talk about his plans for nigeria today they have been dusted by a less known individual i think mr moghalu should sha give up already before the thing give am psychological problem you know it is not everybody that has buhari and atiku mind who had turned consistent failure into a career even buhari the last time he lost he was talking about blood of baboon flowing on the street that one really pained him so moghalu before we start looking towards yaba left is it not better to just leave this thing if election contesting is your hubby why not let us go try alumni or estate elections the experience you have garnered so far will come in handy mbok no be by force

there are many reasons why businesses thrive in illinois we have a large diverse productive and educated labor force the cost of living is often cheaper than states on the coasts and there s easy access to robust transportation and of course we re home to arguably the best people in the country but being an illinois business owner is not without its challenges in the past four years illinois has passed 24 tax and fee hikes worth about 5 billion to taxpayers of those taxes and fees about 650 million has been targeted specifically at businesses why would you tax something you want more of illinois politicians have told us for decades they are going to increase jobs and support businesses yet their actions tell another story this is why illinois was the only state in the midwest to decline in the tax foundation s state business tax climate index from 2017 to 2022 illinois tax policy became less friendly for businesses dropping to 36th from 26th place meanwhile each of our neighboring states improved in the index save for indiana which held steady at ninth many states used extra revenues from federal stimulus to implement permanent pro growth reforms while illinois merely kicked the can on expected tax hikes until after the election understanding the recent business tax hikes reverse phaseout of costly corporate franchise tax 20 million in 2019 gov j b pritzker touted the phaseout elimination of this tax as an accomplishment of his first year but two years later he turned his back on businesses and reversed the law completely this tax actually has nothing to do with franchise businesses and is instead a capital stock tax which taxes businesses on their net worth regardless of their profitability only 15 other states implement this tax which is complicated and expensive to comply with especially for small businesses cap delay credits for business operating losses for three years 314 million if a business loses money in 2020 and 2021 but earns a profit in 2022 tax law allows it to deduct the two years of losses from its earnings in 2022 and pay taxes only on the difference this helps keep tax policy neutral over time and is especially important following the recent pandemic when many businesses experienced losses unfortunately pritzker signed off on a 100 000 per year limit on losses carried forward for three years business owners are still able to carry forward losses above that amount but they can t claim the deduction until 2024 which hurts their cash on hand to grow hire or give raises ultimately this means a poorer recovery for every illinoisan delay expensing of business investments 214 million illinois decoupled from federal provisions intended to promote pro growth investments federal tax reform included changes to allow full and immediate expensing or 100 bonus depreciation meaning companies can deduct the entire cost of a machinery or equipment investment in the year it was made rather than dragging out the expensing over the life cycle of an asset but now illinois businesses must use the prior system of stretching out the deduction for illinois taxes discouraging the very investments that will help the state recover from the covid 19 recession double tax profits u s companies earn abroad 107 million another aspect of federal tax reform was to end double taxation on profits u s companies earned overseas by allowing a 100 deduction for foreign dividends paid to the parent company those profits would have already faced taxation in the country where the income was earned pritzker eliminated the credit for foreign dividends which discourages those profits from being repatriated and brought to illinois if the profits would receive more favorable tax treatment overseas putting it together having a competitive tax system is important and illinois is in danger of falling out of the race completely if voters approve amendment 1 on the nov 9 ballot our businesses will be at risk for significant tax increases illinois politicians must prioritize taking care of businesses and find ways to cut the punitive tax burdens on them matt paprocki is president of the illinois policy institute

washington june 11 the prices of gas food and most other goods and services jumped in may raising inflation to a new four decade high and giving american households no respite from rising costs consumer prices surged 8 6 per cent last month from a year earlier faster than april s year over year increase of 8 3 per cent the labor department said friday the new inflation figure the highest since 1981 will heighten pressure on the federal reserve to continue raising interest rates aggressively on a month to month basis prices jumped 1 per cent from april to may much faster than the 0 3 per cent increase from march to april contributing to that surge were much higher prices for everything from airline tickets to restaurant meals to new and used cars those price spikes also elevated so called core inflation a measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices in may core prices jumped a sharp 0 6 per cent for a second straight month they re now 6 above where they were a year ago friday s report underscored fears that inflation is spreading well beyond energy and goods whose prices are being driven up by clogged supply chains and russia s invasion of ukraine it also sent stock prices tumbling the increased pressure on the fed to raises rates even faster which means higher cost loans for consumers and businesses will raise the risk of a recession too virtually every sector has higher than normal inflation said ethan harris head of global economic research at bank of america it s made its way into every nook and cranny of the economy that s the thing that makes it concerning because it means it s likely to persist gas prices rose 4 per cent just in may and have soared nearly 50 per cent in one year the national average price at the pump reached usd 4 99 friday according to aaa edging closer to an inflation adjusted record high of usd 5 40 the cost of groceries surged nearly 12 per cent last month from a year earlier the biggest such increase since 1979 rising prices for grain and fertilizer after russia s war against ukraine is intensifying that rise restaurant prices jumped 7 4 per cent in the past year the largest 12 month gain since 1981 reflecting higher costs for food and workers employers face immense pressure to raise pay in a job market that remains robust with low unemployment few layoffs and near record job openings but while average wages are rising at their fastest pace in decades they aren t increasing fast enough for most workers to keep pace with inflation many households accumulated savings from government stimulus aid during the pandemic and are now having to draw on those savings to pay bills housing costs are still climbing the government s shelter index which includes rents hotel rates and a measure of what it costs to own a home increased 5 5 per cent in the past year the most since 1991 airline fares are up nearly 38 per cent in the past year the sharpest such rise since 1980 rampant inflation is imposing severe pressures on families lower income and black and hispanic americans in particular are struggling because on average a larger proportion of their income is consumed by necessities in light of friday s inflation reading the fed is all but certain to implement the fastest series of interest rate hikes in three decades by sharply raising borrowing costs the fed hopes to cool spending and growth enough to curb inflation without tipping the economy into a recession it will be a difficult balancing act the fed has signalled that it will raise its key short term rate by a half point double the size of the usual hike next week and again in july some investors had hoped the fed would then slow its rate increases to a quarter point hike when it meets in september or perhaps even pause its credit tightening but with inflation raging hot investors now foresee yet another half point hike in september which would be the fourth since april surveys show that americans see high inflation as the nation s top problem and most disapprove of president joe biden s handling of the economy congressional republicans are hammering democrats on the issue in the run up to midterm elections this fall on friday biden responded to the latest figures in a speech at the port of los angeles which is now moving a record amount of cargo under an agreement the white house has shepherded yet even as the number of ships waiting to unload at the port has dropped sharply inflation has not my administration the president said is going to continue to do everything we can to lower the prices to the american people surging prices have forced rocky harper of tucson arizona to start doing gig work for delivery companies on top of his regular full time job with a package

inflation is a global problem that threatens to slow economies around the world for the 19 countries that use the euro currency inflation fuelled by rising food and fuel prices hit a record 8 1 per cent last month leading the european central bank to announce that it will raise interest rates for the first time in 11 years starting in july and again in september in the coming months prices in the united states may ease somewhat some large retailers including target walmart and macy s are now stuck with too much of the patio furniture electronics and other goods that suddenly are no longer in demand target said it s cutting prices due to mounds of unsold inventory though americans have soured on the economy they have largely kept up their spending they are increasingly turning to credit cards with total card debt rising sharply in april the fed reported though such debt has only barely surpassed pre pandemic levels how long these trends higher wages extra savings and rising card debt enable americans to keep spending will help determine whether a recession can be avoided to cool inflation spending growth must be slowed for lower income americans there are signs it s already

for this week s dairy focus agriland made the trip down to the kingdom to leagh holsteins and the fitzmaurice family the fitzmaurice family are behind the leagh holsteins herd based in cloghane ballyduff tralee co kerry tim and lauren fitzmaurice with leagh ali arriba she is the only daughter of ruann s miss apple aria ex95 in europe leagh holsteins pedigree breeding has been a feature of this farm for a long number of years with the first pedigree holstein registered by tim s father in 1963 the fitzmaurices exited milk production in 2007 but the passion for pedigree holstein breeding remained tim continued to breed pedigree holstein heifers but focused on introducing and developing new cow families not seen in ireland or often in europe the focus on this farm is now purchasing embryos from north america that can introduced to ireland to develop new cow families although not milking themselves the fitzmaurices have a number of cows milking in other herds that are also used for flushing the system would be described by many as unusual especially as suckler cows are being used as recipients for embryos tim said when we have bord bia inspections they struggle to get their heads around it they come to see a suckler herd and find holstein heifers cow families the selection of which cow families to introduce is important with ireland being a milk solids based market giving some insight into what they look for in a cow family lauren said the first thing we look for is protein ireland is a solids based market we do sell in the uk we recently got 8 500gns for a calf in the black and white sale but our main market is ireland with pedigree breeders fat and protein is very important continuing lauren said we are also looking for type we want cows with deep pedigree that will last cows that are coming from a number of generations of ex and will stay on farms for as long as possible we also are looking for something that no one else has we always do our research to see if there is anything from that pedigree in ireland or europe farmers are always looking for that new family the family that no one else has but has done well in north america we would also go to the world dairy expo to see what is doing well over there getting a daughter from a champion cow is exciting for people lauren added in the last number of years it has been like a race trying to get the best genetics everyone is looking for new cow families polled has taken off and red everyone wants a red heifer a few year ago we didn t have a red heifer now we are always looking for a new red family embryos the system operated by the fitzmaurices requires a lot of work first to source embryos and then to put them into cows and actually get a calf on the ground tim said people don t see the work and cost that goes into getting a heifer calf on the ground the embryos have a 60 success rate but it takes a lot of work for it to happen people always see the high price you get for a calf but they don t know about the cow family that never make it continuing tim said you re also very limited with the embryos you can bring in they don t want to flush cows to certain bulls and you can t bring in clones the most popular red bulls in the world at the minute are by clone sires in ireland we can t register calves from clones so we are restricted it is an expensive system but when it works out well it is very rewarding showing leagh holsteins also shows a number of heifers each year with the herd having recent success at the kingdom county fair the herd took home prizes for first november calf and junior champion with leagh sidekick arangatang and first january calf with leagh denver mudpile first november calf and junior champion with leagh sidekick arangatang and first january calf with leagh denver mudpile image source leagh holsteins facebook my interest in showing started from being involved in yma and then dad would take me to workshops all over the country lauren said then because we had a sale every year liam o neill showed me how to clip calves then i was able to do a lot of the work myself i then decided i would go to america to siemers holstein they had really good junior stock which is what i was interested in while i was there i learned how to feed prepare and then show calves after my time over there was when it really took off after that we started to breed some more calves for showing and a number of the calves we have sold have gone on to win shows for the farmers that purchased them seeing other people with calves we have bred is great it s sparking other children s interest in showing and keeping the pedigree alive annual sale between 20 and 25 calves are born on the farm each year with calving taking place from september to january leagh holsteins holds an annual sale where it offers the calves for sale the promise of protein sale takes place on june 22 at carnaross mart with taaffe auctions the sale offers youngstock from leagh holsteins john cunnane s lynbrook herd and brian and john o connor s herd this year a number of cow families that will be sold in ireland for the first time are on offer including two chief daughters from leagh doorman katrysha vg 2yr a direct daughter of wde champion of lovhill goldwyn katrysha ex96 there is also a heifer from the jasmine cow family another heifer from the jasmine cow family sold by leagh holsteins making 8 500gns at the black and white sale leagh doorman katrysha image source leagh holsteins social media social media plays a key role for leagh holsteins in the marketing and sale of its animals lauren works full time off farm but promotes the herd using social media particularly facebook and instagram she said the marketing and sale of animals has really moved online you can generate so much interest in your animals online through social media nearly everyone has social media now and we have sold a number of animals through it covid 19 had a big role to play but it is also a younger generation who use social media future both tim and lauren work off farm and currently have no plans to alter their system dad and myself are able to work alongside this system and it is going really well for us said lauren my brother bryan is also interested he is currently studying a masters in animal science in wageningen university he is going to triple t

the pandemic war in the ukraine and the consequent high inflation globally have impacted the lifestyle of many retirees some have returned to the work world while there are still others who are weighing their options recently i had discussions with an unretired retiree who has rejoined the workforce and plans to work for another three years realising that inflation would eat away the purchasing power of her retirement income she sought advice on how to invest her pension lump sum there are investors who want to grow their monies long term but are risk averse their focus is on preserving the principal which will over time have reduced value due to inflation financial literacy is important and retirees need to possess the right mindset in making investment decisions a quote on jamaican track and field sprinter shelly ann fraser pryce s facebook page is most fitting it says most times it s not our circumstances that hold us back it s our decisions at this time of global economic uncertainty it s not the war or the pandemic that will keep persons from investing in the stock market it is the decisions that are made during the crisis as stock markets decline little attention is paid to the impact of inflation on the future value of funds invested therefore wise financial counsel is needed for pre retirees retirees and those who chose to unretire currently in the united states there is a labour crisis this presents retirees with an opportunity to unretire and once again contribute to the economy by reducing the labour shortage according to the us bureau of labour statistics approximately 1 5 million retirees have returned to work since the pandemic it s reported that during the pandemic millions of seniors chose early retirement but are now returning to work at a faster rate than other age groups returning to work doesn t mean that retirees are returning to the former salaries or jobs that they had prior to the pandemic usually when retirees return to work they are paid less and the positions are not as lofty as before the economic situation has caused retirees to reassess their financial circumstances with the fear of covid 19 now decreased offers of flexible work conditions demand for labour and the challenge of living off a fixed income more retirees have chosen to return to work in order to increase earnings and counter the high inflation as the cost of goods and services continue to escalate the high cost of health care is another reason retirees are returning to work health insurance for a younger employee is much lower than that for a retiree healthy retirees will choose returning to work for a few more years and increase savings and investments so that they can live comfortably in retirement some retirees who have also returned to work feeling safer having taken the covid vaccines have more flexible workable hours and are able to work remotely at the same time the economic climate has forced some retirees to return to work to make ends meet others are happy to return to work as this helps with social interaction a relief from loneliness and depression after being restricted by the pandemic since 2020 in canada more retirees are returning to work opting for a blend of work and leisure the need for more earnings and in other instances the desire for social interaction are main reasons for returning to work as a financial advisor i have had meetings with retirees who have continued to work because the fixed pension is not sufficient to meet their needs or they enjoy working some transition to self employed status people who remain employed are at reduced risk of chronic diseases as they age while some studies reveal that retirement reduces stress and mental illness conditions one thing is sure the state of one s health in retirement will be influenced by the preparation or lack of preparation for retirement the current global climate has seen employers targeting retirees to return to work now than ever before decades ago it was difficult for retirees to re enter the workforce but employers have come to realise the immense experience and work ethics that retirees possess that can advance the organisation this is an interesting era with varying opportunities for retirees to make a difference in the global economy
this is roald tweet on rock island no historian is quite certain why the sauk indian leader black hawk broke a promise to remain on the iowa side of the mississippi in april of 1832 he must have known that the americans would confront him with overwhelming force what is certain is that he and a thousand followers men women and children did cross the river at oquawka illinois that april and head north toward his former village saukenuk he was met with an army of some three thousand federal troops and illinois volunteers pursued up the rock river into wisconsin in what came to be known as the black hawk war but was instead a massacre black hawk s band was trapped on august first 1832 at bad axe wisconsin on the mississippi river only about 300 sauk escaped with their lives black hawk was captured and sent to prison why try anything so foolhardy a prominent meskwaki chief tama who witnessed the war from his home just below present day chippiannock cemetery gave his explanation when it was all over the sauk indians had a choice of listening to british rumors or american promises president jackson had promised that the sauk and other tribes throughout northern illinois could remain on their tribal lands as long as they wished so long as the united states government owned the land the british however who were still trying to stir up trouble against the americans in 1832 told the sauk indians some distressing news about what the americans were going to do the americans were going to take all the sauk males and deprive them of their courage with a very simple operation then the americans were going to import slaves from the south give all the sauk women and girls to the slaves and raise a stock of slaves just like cattle chief tama was contemptuous of these foreign fables as he called them but they were widely believed among black hawk s band that tama said is why black hawk began such a desperate war it was the wrong choice for the sauk had they listened to american promises instead of british rumors they might well have been able to remain in northern illinois for perhaps one more year rock island lines with roald tweet is underwritten by augustana college rock island illinois

russia in free fall and why the success of german elites is crucial for the future of europe created 06 12 2022 09 33 by christiane kuehl russian president vladimir putin and oligarch alisher usmanov imago stock people in an interview with ippen media economist tomas casas explains how russia s oligarchs are doing and what the quality of elites means for a country s development st russia in free fall and why the success of german elites is crucial for the future of europe created 06 12 2022 09 33 by christiane kuehl russian president vladimir putin and oligarch alisher usmanov imago stock people in an interview with ippen media economist tomas casas explains how russia s oligarchs are doing and what the quality of elites means for a country s development st gallen munich the university of st gallen hsg recently presented the elite quality index 2022 for 151 countries for the third time this index measures the power and value creation of elites in the respective states the more power local elites have the worse a country performs on the index and the higher the added value of the elites the better according to the researchers led by economist dr tomas casas crucial to the progress and development of any state why casas spoke about this in an interview with merkur de from ippen media the elites represent what the researchers call coordination capacity the business models of the elite can do both create value and exploit value which model the elites choose determines the future and prosperity of a country on the other hand if a country s elites extract values from society then this has a negative impact on the ranking in the index political and economic elites are considered separately according to casas the goal of the research group is to develop a theory that can be used to understand and change the world the elite theory of economic development see info box below also this year small countries like singapore switzerland israel and the netherlands occupy the top places on the index from st gallen larger countries like the usa or france fare worse china led emerging markets ahead of the still unclear impact of the zero covid policy while russia continues to slide germany was able to move up four places in the current index and is now in eleventh place elite quality small countries at the top usa crashes in the ranking due to the corona pandemic singapore is in first place in 2022 switzerland in second place what characterizes the elites in these states how do these rankings come about because the two countries are very different tomas casas the comparison between singapore and switzerland shows that there are several paths to prosperity and to the top spots in the eqx countries like switzerland or even the usa or canada do relatively well in the area of power that means their elites have no power we see power as a potential future extraction or transfer of value into the hands of elites if you don t have power you can t force others to give up anything of value in singapore on the other hand the political elites are relatively powerful but they don t use their power for extraction or value transfer but for creating new value how dangerous is it when elites have a lot of power like in singapore is such a system unstable as long as the elites use their power well in singapore all is well elites in many countries around the world add to the whole pie these are the good the high quality elites but if they started using their power to extract stats then we d have a problem it can happen very quickly that in times of economic recession pandemics shocks war or financial crashes elites decide to use their power to maintain or increase their income in doing so however they only increase their share of the pie at the expense of society because if the whole cake shrinks and the elites don t shrink proportionally then they just extract value at the expense of others that was a problem during the pandemic in the us the us financial markets performed as well as ever despite the general economic downturn as a result some economic elites did not have to accept a slump in their business models at all that means they ve increased their slice of the pie relative to society exactly the same thing happens when inflation rises that was already a problem in the us in 2021 and is now one in europe with higher inflation those parts of the population that depend on a salary see themselves devalued but among the elites who own stocks or real assets wealth grew this could result in 60 percent of society transferring value to the top 1 10 or 20 percent is that why the usa fell ten places from 5 to 15 in the ranking from 2021 to 2022 the us is in very good shape in terms of political power and institutions they are number one in political power because the us elites have very little power and compete fiercely with each other the institutions are also very good but the value added of the elites has fallen the usa is only 29th this is not a catastrophe but it is a cause for concern this is mainly due to the fact that the political elites in the usa do very poorly when it comes to value creation they would actually be responsible for health for example the fight against covid or the big drug problem in society general education or safety on the streets but the usa is rather bad at that and that falls back on the political elites in contrast in the us as we all know there are business elites in technology finance or security who create immense value china s powerful elites create material value zero covid strategy could change development according to the eqx china has the best elites rank 27 among the upper middle income countries and does so as an authoritarian socialist one party state how is that possible we now have 120 indicators the datasets we use are very western and international we don t use chinese data we use data from the international monetary fund the world bank and similar sources we also examine datasets on human rights such as the global slavery index on justice or freedom of the press if we took chinese datasets china would do even better china s relatively high ranking is food for thought that s right as scientists we are system political agnostics we have to remain factual and neutral we only look at the business models of the elite whether they create or extract value for example we don t measure the level of democracy a democracy can create value but so can a socialist state an islamic state or a confucian state like singapore at the same time however we look at whether freedom of the press and freedom of religion are guaranteed in a country how many journalists are murdered what the position of women is in society or whether there is slavery that shows the oppression of a part of the population and thus its potential for value creation so what do you think make up china s elites china s political elites create a relatively large amount of value despite everything that could change now however because of zero covid but in the first two years of the pandemic china s approach has done very well with few deaths and a rapid economic recovery china also scores quite well on research life expectancy food safety schooling and other parameters there is also for example less crime or drug addicts than in many other countries but the data also shows how powerful the political elites are in china the country is only ranked 60th surprisingly the political elites in particular have so far used their power to create values china s economic performance and rise over the past 30 years can hardly be explained without word creating elites but as said before the situation could change at any time should there be a crisis this risk is certainly lower in western democratic countries if in democracies the elites wanted to extract values it would in principle be much more difficult russia oligarchs in free fall germany s elites with room for improvement china is considered an ally of russia in the ukraine war what about the russian elites the russian elites are ranked 67th that is mediocre and of course russia will fall very low this year we have seen that china s political elites are powerful but not nearly as powerful as russia s political elites i e the kremlin or the state owned companies they are ranked 112th for power which is a very low ranking for a european country there are 30 to 40 indicators of political power this is where russia and china differ the freedom of the press is in bad shape in china but now also in russia but russia for example is much more centralistic than china also interesting is that china s business elites have very little power they are in 14th place and thus on a european level russia s business elite the oligarchs have significantly more power ranked 81st the added value of the oligarchs is significantly greater than that of russia s political elite but despite this the powerful oligarchs have far less power than the political elites what do you say about the elites in germany 11th place the german elites fare relatively well compared to the other great powers of the eu i e france 24 italy 40 or spain 34 but worse than those in holland 5 sweden 6 or estonia 10th the problem germany as the leading economic power in europe should do even better for example the german state could create even more value the economic elites 14th place could also bring more there are no german companies among the world s top 100 companies in terms of market capitalization the german elites apparently do not have the ability to scale and understand new business models they are efficient and honest bureaucrats but bad innovators good operationally but not so strategically that s a shame because the german elite can count on the best employees technicians engineers and doctors in the world therefore we say that german elites could create much more value of course germany is already very wealthy but it will only continue to grow if the business models of its elites improve significantly otherwise there is a risk of stagnation can you give a few examples of what is imminent if we experience a stagnation of ideas in germany for example there is a danger if in ten years cars or machines will tend to be gadgets as expected germany may then be able to build the best cars and most precise machines but the brains of cars and machines i e microchips or control software this part with the greatest added value could then come from abroad from the usa or china that would mean that germany s companies would make less profits and slip down the international value chain into increasingly marginal parts elites must be willing to take risks but the german elites have no appetite for risk they don t understand risk like american chinese or israeli elites do this is an intellectual but also a cultural problem successful start up founders in berlin for example have to work with us elites for larger venture capital sums because german investors are not willing to take risks beyond a certain size it is as if a kind of fear of heights on the part of german business and political leaders suppresses the growth potential of german companies and talents english french swiss or dutch are clearly better the german elites are very important for the entire eu if the german elites don t achieve excellence the eu has no future elite theory of economic development finding ways to create sustainable value the researchers want to encourage politics the financial world and companies to carry out reforms and transformations towards sustainable value creation the team in st gallen is international and multidisciplinary economists sociologists financial experts casas himself comes from economics according to elite theory not only the power structure and the institutions in a state are important but also the incentives for elites and their business models does the environment promote sustainable growth innovation and responsible action by companies and politicians does it include the concerns of future generations or is it tolerated that everyone only strives to maximize their own profit even at the expense of weaker parts of society it is called rent seeking when elites in corrupt systems are always there immediately when the state has something to distribute in the ippen media interview tomas casas from the university of st gallen develops a new economic development theory with the help of elite research university of st gallen what do you want to achieve with your new elite theory and why do you think it is important tomas casas we want to understand and change the world so far when there is a crisis there have only been two answers monetary policy or fiscal policy i e spending money or printing money to stimulate the economy we think these two ways don t work anymore monetary policy no longer works because we have had a zero interest rate policy for so long and cannot lower interest rates any further the spending policy is also at the end because who pays all the resulting debts the new generation is paying the debts of the old generation which is a disaster and totally unfair how can we do this to the youth far too many business models transfer from the future to the present through inflation pollution climate change the next generation has to pay for it and printing money leads to rising inflation however inflation is one of the most exploitative business models ever invented so it s also about the question where will inflation rise more in the future in china or in the west this also has to do with the quality of the elites what we are saying is that all the problems of the economy and of humanity must be addressed through structural reforms instead what do you need to reform the business models of the elite this does not require a revolution but targeted reforms and a transformation from within systematic structural reforms based on sustainable value creation would be a new approach in political economy to do this we try to make a statement about the future of the countries for example we hope to be able to say that a country will get better in the future because the elites business models have measurably improved we want to develop models that allow us to forecast growth three five or even ten years in advance could you give an example china is interesting again here according to our index the value added of the elites in china corresponds roughly to that of the elites in italy or france although china s gross domestic product per capita is much lower our assumption is that if the quality of chinese elites remains the same china will continue to grow until it reaches the gdp per capita of france today in about 30 years let s look at africa good news we see that most countries will grow but not south africa the country only has further growth potential if the quality of its elites improves rwanda ghana botswana on the other hand just need to keep the elite quality constant and they will keep growing rwanda has good business people and business elites even if the political elites create relatively little value but they also have little power in countries like sudan or equatorial guinea the elites extract values these states are more likely to have problems ck

however it would be fair to say that the 2020s have just taken this to an altogether different level in a lighter vein one could wonder how the first quarter of last few years has made it a habit of making a mockery of beginning of year forecasts while 2020 was a year which began under the looming threat of geo political tensions between us and iran by the end of the first quarter the thing that had turned the world upside down was after all a virus at the start of 2022 all eyes were on the spread of omicron by the end of the first quarter the event that actually shook everyone was a geopolitical one russia ukraine war
dire predictions about the effects of global warming on maine s lobster population may be exaggerated and underestimate the potential that conservation measures have to preserve the fishery into the future rapid warming in the gulf of maine and the collapse of lobster fisheries in southern new england have fueled predictions that lobsters will likely move north out of maine waters in the coming decades but ongoing research at the university of maine is revealing a more optimistic long term view of the maine lobster fishery the umaine scientists are now projecting that temperatures in gulf of maine will likely remain within lobsters comfort zone because of the gulf s unique oceanographic features though changing ocean currents are harder to predict the researchers cautioned that the dynamics of global warming are complex and make it difficult to project far into the future with certainty ocean stratification where water of different densities separates into distinct layers is keeping the bottom temperatures colder on the gulf of maine s western side the scientists say while strong tidal mixing in the eastern gulf and the bay of fundy helps moderate the water temperature there during the summer because maine waters have historically been so cold they say even a couple of degrees of warming should keep maine s bottom waters below 68 degrees the temperature at which lobsters begin to show signs of stress according to the atlantic states fisheries management council though average sea surface temperature in the gulf of maine broke the 2012 record last year bottom temperatures remained much cooler data from the northeast regional association of coastal ocean observing systems shows when sea surface temperature peaked at 72 7 degrees fahrenheit in august at the western maine shelf observation buoy the water 50 meters below the surface was just 51 5 degrees there and would peak at only 55 6 degrees later that year kathleen reardon senior lobster scientist for the maine department of marine resources mentioned projections that maine water temperatures should stay within lobsters comfort zones at the latest lobster zone council meeting in east machias a lobsterman in attendance interrupted saying one minute it s on tv gulf of maine waters warming faster than any body of water in the world and now you re telling me it s not going to advertisement no it is warming faster reardon responded but she said even when taking warming into account hitting 70 degrees on bottom that s a really long ways away in maine we still have a very very different water temperature regime range than in southern new england so yes things are changing but we are not hopefully likely to approach those really stressful temperatures in at least the next 50 years in fact the warming has brought maine waters into the bottom range for lobster settlement she said lobsters spend the larval phase of their lives suspended in the water column feeding on zooplankton and will only settle to the bottom in water between 12 and 20 degrees celsius or around 53 to 68 degrees fahrenheit at the eastern maine shelf observation buoy temperatures ranged from 45 2 degrees to 55 3 degrees at 50 meters depth from june through november 2021 according to neracoos because water temperature has actually increased this is actually a case where warming ocean has had a positive impact reardon continued we have had more optimal conditions and especially in eastern maine i think that s what s driven the increases in lobster landings nuances of geography richard wahle a marine biologist and director of umaine s lobster institute agrees he leads lobster settlement surveys of the ocean bottom to determine how many lobsters are settling in different areas and publishes the results yearly in the american lobster settlement index advertisement wahle said that in the past couple of decades the waters in eastern maine have entered the low end of the thermal range for lobster recruitment which led to a boom in lobster settlement from 2005 to 2008 we ve sort of crossed a threshold that has just opened the floodgates for settlement in eastern maine wahle said and that in turn has really turned on the spigot for lobster production the surveys are mostly conducted by divers but the lobster institute in partnership with lobster processing company ready seafood and the department of marine resources has been deploying deep water collectors at various sites to get a sense of how settlement is occurring in deeper water they found that since the deep water is colder in western maine than in eastern maine lobster settlement has still been concentrated in shallow warmer waters there while in the eastern portion of the state newly settled lobsters were spread relatively evenly over the full range of depths in western maine more warming could open up deeper waters to lobster settlement one often cited rutgers university study predicted that lobsters could shift 200 miles north into canadian waters this century the researchers modeled future thermal habitats using data from trawl surveys and ocean circulation models based on high and low future greenhouse gas emission scenarios but that report published in the scientific journal plos one in 2018 did not take into account the nuances of maine s oceanographic features wahle said those nuances are the result of the basin s unique geography and how it amplifies the tidal heights which is independent of climate change advertisement one of wahle s former postdoctoral students arnault le bris now a faculty member at memorial university of newfoundland was lead author on another 2018 paper published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences that made projections through 2050 about the status of the fishery based on climate projections le bris forecasts predicted that southwestern parts of the gulf of maine such as massachusetts and cape cod bay may be seeing some shallower parts entering that less hospitable range of temperatures during the summer but that the eastern portion will fare much better the degree and a half of projected warming in the eastern part of the gulf of maine would still be well within the comfort zone of lobster wahle said so what kathleen reardon said mirrors a lot of what we ve been saying all along still projections are never perfect he points out while the projections le bris used captured the differences in tidal mixing they are based on standard atmospheric effects on ocean temperature and do not reflect changing ocean current patterns in the gulf of maine which wahle said are harder to model recent reports have shown that deep warm salty nutrient poor gulf stream current is pushing north into the gulf of maine and blocking the cold nutrient rich labrador current which is weakening and becoming less dense from dilution by meltwater i m not sure the oceanographic forecasting is at a place yet that can project what those conditions are going to look like with respect to the relative strength of the labrador current and the gulf stream but to the extent those trends continue we may be seeing a worsening effect he said advertisement conservation efforts can help while water temperatures themselves might not directly stress maine lobsters in the near future there are a number of other climate related factors that will likely impact their survival the shifting deep ocean current patterns have been impacting primary production in the gulf of maine and leading to declines in calanus finmarchicus and other plankton which in turn affect the whole food web le bris projections did anticipate declines in lobster abundance in the coming decades due to climate related stressors such as more predators as other fish species move northward changes in plankton abundance and increases in shell disease but his paper was optimistic that the conservation measures maine has in place to maximize the reproductive potential of the stock and simple adjustments to them could help stave off major declines or the type of fishery collapse that occurred in southern new england where conservation measures were not enacted until it was too late even though global climate change is severely impacting marine ecosystems widely adopted proactive conservation measures can increase the resilience of commercial fisheries to climate change the authors wrote advertisement maine s conservation measures include maximum harvestable size limits that protect the breeding stock minimum size limits that allow young lobsters time to breed and protections against harvesting egg bearing females through a mandatory v notching program in which a v shaped cut is made into the tail of a female bearing eggs it is illegal to keep females with this mark even if they are caught when they re not bearing eggs all those measures put our fishery in a really good position to not only stave off a collapse from potential future warming but to capitalize on great conditions for reproduction potential to build the population wahle said the le bris paper estimated how much less of the southern new england stock might have been lost if it had had conservation measures in place and how much less of an increase in lobster abundance maine might have seen without them if maine didn t have its protections for large and small lobsters and reproductive females the authors estimate lobster abundance would have increased by 242 percent rather than 515 percent since 1985 if conservation measures had been implemented earlier in southern new england it estimates the stock abundance would have decreased by only 57 percent instead of 78 percent over that time wahle said these measures helped maine take advantage of favorable conditions the increase in temperature and a decrease in groundfish that prey on young lobsters that made the coast more suitable as lobster nursery grounds and played a role in the explosion in lobster landings these could continue to help the fishery stay resilient against future threats less settlement fewer landings advertisement in addition to the american lobster settlement index the marine resources department conducts surveys to get a sense of the abundance of slightly older lobsters that are still below legally harvestable size through trawl surveys sea sampling accompanying commercial lobstermen and measuring lobsters in their traps and with ventless trap surveys commercial lobster traps must have vents that allow lobsters below legal harvest size to escape these surveys are used to predict future landings all of the surveys have been showing declines in young lobsters for several years with some exceptions the settlement survey reported a significant increase in settlement in the gulf of maine from penobscot bay to new brunswick and a lesser increase from casco bay to new hampshire in 2019 the settlement and ventless trap surveys showed lobster settlement in the western part of the state has not been declining but it has been declining for five years in the area from friendship to steuben and for two years from steuben to cutler the atlantic states marine fisheries commission board is considering whether to enact new management measures that would be triggered if these young lobster surveys show declines past a certain point with the goal of keeping the maine fishery around 100 million pounds landed annually the board may increase the minimum size of harvestable lobsters because doing so would allow lobsters more time to reproduce before being caught hearings on these measures have not been scheduled yet but are expected to be held this summer when reardon the state lobster scientist brought up the proposed increased minimum size limits at the lobster council meetings lobstermen suggested that instead other states should adopt maine s maximum size limits to protect large breeders because now a maine lobsterman can throw back an oversized lobster only to have it caught by massachusetts or rhode island fishermen but reardon explained that increasing the minimum size limit by even an eighth of an inch would have far greater impact because of the sheer numbers of lobsters that would be left to reproduce for a longer period reardon told the lobstermen that the declines in sublegal sized lobsters could be caused by a number of factors maybe we re just coming off of a settlement bubble maybe they are starting to eat each other or maybe the fish predators are coming back she said i don t know what s driving the declines advertisement one of the lobsterman in attendance said he has has been seeing a lot more codfish which prey on juvenile lobsters lobstermen also questioned the survey methods arguing that they have been seeing an increase in lobster abundance in deeper waters than the ventless surveys capture and suggesting that the trawls are not being done in the right areas most survey data do come from shallower waters and the marine resources department s lobster monitoring report of 2021 notes that the observed declines may be the result of a shift in distribution of lobsters across different depths reardon also acknowledged that the ventless trap survey does not capture deep water settlement but noted that multiple survey methods including trawls conducted at 75 fathoms are producing similar results the expansion of the deep water collector deployments in the american lobster settlement index surveys are helping scientists develop a better picture of how lobster habitat use is changing wahle has adjusted landings projections to reflect depth data resulting in projections with lesser declines and the 2020 landings did match the new projection model still wahle acknowledges that any forecasting model oversimplifies reality try as we might we can never capture all the mechanisms at work he wrote in the latest survey report they are always a work in progress still prediction remains a worthy aspiration because it equips us to consider informed choices as we confront an uncertain future send questions comments to the editors previous next filed

i raise the possibility of hyperbole around direct and indirect compliance costs associated with the rule i also argue that the disclosures currently available to an investor to assess the credibility of climate pledges made by firms and funds are not consistent comparable or even fully reliable a new residential building sits behind an empty lot in the overtown neighborhood of miami florida u s on thursday april 19 2018 around the country the government s response to extreme weather is pushing lower income people away from the waterfront often in the name of safety those homes in turn are often replaced with more costly houses such as those built higher off the ground and are better able to withstand storms photographer alicia vera bloomberg 2018 bloomberg finance lp i testified to the sec s investor advisory committee iac last week stating support for the sec s climate risk disclosures we barely had 12 15 minutes and my wi fi kept dropping mid testimony because of a weak wireless connection in my hotel room hence it is somewhat hard to communicate technical nuances on zoom with choppy wi fi i filed a detailed comment letter with the sec explaining the basis for my support i reproduce the full text of the letter your comments are welcome as always the edited text of the comment letter follows i write in support of your proposed climate risk disclosures to frame my comments it is useful to summarize what the climate risk disclosure rule would require registrants to disclose the firm s governance of climate related risks and relevant risk management processes how any climate related risks identified by the firm have had or are likely to have a material impact on its business and consolidated financial statements which may manifest over the short medium or long term how any identified climate related risks have affected or are likely to affect the firm s strategy business model and outlook and the impact of climate related events and transition activities on the line items of a registrant s consolidated financial statements as well as on the financial estimates and assumptions used in the financial statements my support is based on my assessment of the costs and benefits of the proposal let us start with the costs 1 0 compliance costs are not a significant portion of market capitalization on page 390 of the proposal the sec estimates costs in the first year of compliance to be around 640 000 and annual costs in subsequent years to be 530 000 for larger companies on page 399 the sec estimates assurance costs for large companies to be around 75 000 to 145 000 a well done academic paper by alexander et al 2013 estimated the average annual costs of complying with section 404 b for accelerated filers at 1 2 million for the sake of argument let us generously assume that the annual costs of compliance with the climate risk rule is indeed 1 2 million for all filers with the clear understanding that no one has claimed that the climate risk rule will be as expensive to implement as section 404 b was as of may 4 2022 the average price earnings ratio for i an s p 500 firm is 23 ii an s p 400 firm is 15 and iii an s p 600 small cap firm is 16 if these compliance costs were incurred into perpetuity without any reduction expected on account of learning and with no corresponding benefits whatsoever the median s p 500 firm will suffer a market capitalization loss of approximately 28 million 1 2 million 23 it is worth noting that large accelerated filers are required to report scope 1 and 2 emissions for fiscal 2023 and scope 3 emissions in fiscal 2024 accelerated filers start in fiscal 2024 and smaller reporting firms in fiscal 2025 although smaller reporting firms are exempt from scope 3 although these compliance costs will be lower for mid cap and smaller firms if we were to assume the same costs for these firms the median s p 400 mid cap firm will suffer a loss of market capitalization of 18 million 1 2 million 15 and the median s p 600 small firm would suffer a loss of market capitalization of 19 million 1 2 million 16 for simplicity i have implicitly assumed that the average price earnings ratio applies to the median firm and price earnings ratios provide a first order description of how firms are valued by investors more sophisticated valuation models can be used without any major changes in inferences drawn i focus on the median firm because average market capitalizations tend to be positively skewed i e a few large stocks with trillion dollar valuations such as apple amazon and microsoft can tilt averages but not affect medians or the middle value of the distribution of market capitalizations coming back to the task at hand it is useful to benchmark these hypothetical losses to the median market capitalizations of firms in these three indexes the median market capitalization of an s p 500 firm is 29 7 billion as of may 6 2022 and the value loss if any from compliance costs would work out to 0 09 of that median market capitalization analogous numbers work out to 0 5 of an s p midcap 400 firm median market cap is 5 1 billion as of may 6 2022 and 1 9 of the median s p small cap 600 firm median market cap is 1 39 billion as of may 6 2022 these percentages matter because these are much smaller than the stock price volatility experienced by these median companies in a trading day for instance the daily stock returns of an s p 500 firm usually fluctuate between 1 and 1 even if the 0 09 loss in market capitalization were to occur a researcher cannot statistically detect that change because 0 09 is much smaller than 1 the daily stock returns volatility of an s p 400 midcap firm and the s p 600 small cap firm is usually even higher than 1 as firm size is usually inversely related to return volatility as can be seen the capitalized value of the loss in compliance costs for an s p 400 midcap firm and for a s p 600 small cap firm comfortably fall within these volatility bands in other words the loss in market capitalization if any from compliance costs is likely too tiny for any outsider to detect and to separate from daily volatility in the stock returns for unrelated reasons 2 0 why not benchmark compliance costs to net income a critic might legitimately wonder why i have chosen to benchmark these compliance costs to market capitalization as opposed to net income the analysis sketched out in the previous paragraph implicitly does so at the portfolio level that is if compliance costs capitalized into the future is 0 09 of market capitalization of the median s p 500 firm 29 7 billion given the price earnings ratio of 23 the annual compliance costs for the median firm would also be 0 09 of the median firm s earnings analogous ratios would conceptually apply to s p mid cap and small cap firms having said that i am not in favor of benchmarking compliance costs to net income for the following three reasons first as of june 6 2022 i found 6 827 publicly listed firms listed on u s exchanges and incorporated in the u s on s p s capiq database for whom i could calculate a market value of equity of these 2 571 firms or 38 reported a loss in the year 2021 even a one dollar increase in compliance costs would arguably be onerous to around 40 of publicly listed firms hence a measure that is negative for 40 of the listed firms cannot serve as a defensible basis for enacting policy proposals second the benefits of the proposed rule change are likely to be realized via lower estimation risk as argued later and hence via lower cost of capital it is difficult to have conversations about cost of capital without considering either the market capitalization or the enterprise value debt plus market capitalization of equity of the firm third arguably the firms most likely to resist the rule change would be smaller and financially distressed firms the rule already allows slower adoption for such firms on top of that i worry that even a 25 50 basis point increase in interest rates might slip such firms into further distress surely no one is likely to argue that the federal reserve should not increase interest rates because small distressed firms will slip into further financial trouble the above arguments generally assume i no benefits whatsoever from enactment of the climate risk disclosures and ii no reduction in compliance costs on account of learning and experience neither assumption describes the situation well the biggest benefit from sec disclosures in my mind is the reduction in the estimation risk of investors 3 0 benefit related to estimation risk estimation risk can be defined as investor uncertainty about the parameters of the stock return distribution or of the cash flow process of the firm estimation risk usually increases a firm s cost of capital the market as of now absent regulation of the kind proposed by the sec does not produce the optimal amount of information on climate risk due to market failures such as information asymmetries principal agent problems between investors and issuers and coordination problems among issuers detailed below i firmly believe that the disclosures required by the proposed rule will or at least can reasonably be expected to increase stock market efficiency by enabling investors to more accurately assess the climate related financial risk faced by a firm and in turn more accurately price that firm s securities even a very modest reduction in estimation risk can decrease cost of capital by more than enough to pay for the already modest compliance costs outlined above let me elaborate a bit more on the three market failures associated with increased estimation risk should the sec s climate disclosure rules not get enacted i information asymmetry ii principal agent issues and iii coordination problems among issuers 3 1 information asymmetry climate risk can be broadly divided into two types of risk transition risk and physical risk physical risk refers to the loss of revenue streams or assets or additional investments caused by physical effects of climate change such as sea level rise wildfires or water stress for instance transition risk refers to the loss of revenue streams or assets or additional investment that arises from the firm s efforts to reduce or eliminate green house emissions that cause climate change transition risk stems sometimes from societal changes such as public policy initiatives or from competitors switching to a low carbon alternative product that consumers demand transition risk could involve for instance the efforts of auto makers to create productive capacity for electric vehicles in response to rising consumer demand or regulation imposed by states or countries mandating a switch from gas powered cars to electric ones the assets or revenue streams tied to gas powered cars would be stranded or might need to written off as consumer interest in such vehicles wanes physical and transition risks in turn can feed into several other sources of risk such as i operational risk or the risk that the firm s routine operations would be disrupted on account of property damage or business interruption ii credit risk for a financial institution as climate risk increases the probability that an affected borrower defaults on its loan obligations or interest payments iii liquidity risks such as the simultaneous run on banks or moves to withdraw deposits from banks by customers trying to tide over abrupt climate events iv insurance risk that might lead to both higher insurance premiums and the withdrawal of insurance coverage altogether from areas or regions more prone to climate risk v market risk or the probability that asset prices either gradually or abruptly price in climate risk and vi last not but least systemic risk caused by entire countries inability to cope with floods e g bangladesh and the related impact on u s banks and companies with direct or indirect exposure to such a country via customers suppliers and employees to accurately understand physical and transition risks and the associated risks detailed above the investor requires multiple types of data physical risk requires data on current and future physical hazards derived from historical data and climate models topographical data locational data of assets and information on vulnerability of these assets and the ability of the company to adapt to climate change the data for assessing physical risks from climate change for a firm are available in an incomplete manner from a mosaic of several sources with varying degrees of reliability in a few cases non profits and government agencies make macro data available for geographical constituencies climate central for instance provides data on sea level rise linked to topography world resources institute has data on water stress and max planck institute on wildfire vulnerability however there is little data on which firm has stores or distribution centers or offices or facilities in the areas identified as vulnerable to water stress or wildfires or sea level rise several for profit companies such as mckinsey moody s carbone 4 msci sell data where they estimate a particular firm s vulnerability to physical risk but the data are of varying quality and are unaffordable to individual investors or researcher teams like mine moreover these private vendors use proprietary data and methodologies as a result the ratings and scores produced by these private vendors even if an investor could afford to purchase them are un comparable across firms and might even be inconsistent across time for the same firm mandatory disclosures of the kind the sec has mandated would go a long way in addressing the difficulty investors experience with estimating the nature of climate risk affecting specific public firms an investor can begin to measure transition risks with an inventory of the scope 1 scope 2 and scope 3 emissions of a firm in our research we have found that barely 25 30 of u s companies actually disclose even scope 1 emissions see aswani et al 2021 even the company self disclosed data are collected via annual questionnaires by cdp carbon disclosure project and are most important unaudited and vary widely in terms of depth and detail some disclose scope 1 some scope 2 and 3 and some disclose nothing at all to get around these data problems data vendors such as trucost try to fit proprietary models to estimate emissions of non disclosing firms unfortunately these models appear rather naïve in that we were able to statistically uncover most of the variation in these estimates as a function of firm size growth industry membership and time aswani et al 2021 hence these estimated emissions are not all that informative to an investor interested in assessing emissions the sec s disclosure rules will mandate consistent comparable and audited disclosures of scope 1 2 and 3 disclosures on u s firms and enable investors to reduce their estimation risk related to how much a company is exposed to climate change transition risk also looks ahead to the future plans of companies to cut emissions and to manage policy and techno economic change in a decarbonizing economy a large number of u s companies has promised to get to a net zero emissions goal and a reasonable investor would want to know how these promises inform a company s strategy during the course of collecting data for another research project aimed to assessing at the credibility of such pledges desai et al 2022 my co authors and i ran into considerable challenges associated with accessibility comparability and consistency of the claimed pathways to net zero the underlying data are scattered across press releases 10 k financial reports sustainability reports and company websites we found tremendous variation in every aspect of a path to that promise of net zero emissions the reporting and the associated verifiability of a given path even for companies without specific emissions cutting pledges investors want to understand the risks posed by policy and techno economic change how they will be managed and how sensitive financial assumptions are to those risks on top of that companies follow diverse frameworks such as those proposed by the task force on climate related financial disclosures tcfd the sustainability accounting standards board sasb and the global reporting initiative gri some subscribe to the science based targets initiative sbti whereas others sign up to the transition pathway initiative tpi vendors have developed methodologies for temperature scores that provide a summary way to assess what level of warming plans a company is aligned with but these scores tend to be created from proprietary models details of which are opaque to investors the sec s disclosure rules will help by providing consistent comparable disclosures of how firms intend to manage transition risk and enable investors to reduce estimation risk associated with understanding transition plans of a company 3 2 principal agent problems the area of sustainability disclosures is rife with greenwashing or the practice of managers the agents not following through on their esg or climate promises made to providers of capital the investors or principals my co authors and i have written several academic papers on this issue for instance the business round table pledgees to stakeholder capitalism barely lived up to those promises rajgopal and raghunandan 2021 esg funds rarely appear to have processes to deliver on their promises related to investing in sustainable stocks in their prospectuses rajgopal and raghunandan 2022 despite claims that employers and senior managers wanted to cushion the blow of the pandemic on employees by sharing the pain imposed by the pandemic we see weak evidence that these claims were realized in practice afzali et al 2021 at a more micro level muscle lite companies hide potentially lower cost labor in off balance sheet entities but claim to invest generously in human capital development lodging reits manage to operate hotels without paying any significant taxes by legal engineering but claim to be stellar corporate citizens companies that take subsidies from the u s state governments barely disclose what they are supposed to do in return of the 1 715 instances of aid subsidies and grants given by various states to publicly traded companies in the u s only 15 of the grants have explicit reporting requirements on both the number of jobs that the companies initially promised to create and the number of jobs they actually created as a result of the subsidy we believe that such greenwashing is prevalent in the world of climate risk disclosures as well in work in progress we find that green bonds do not appear to be associated with lower corporate emissions in future years the carbon offset market that several companies rely on to get to net zero emissions is in urgent need of assurance and credibility for instance it is hard to know whether the renewable energy certificates recs used by companies to report lower net emissions incrementally reduce worldwide emissions it is unclear whether scope 1 2 and 3 emissions reported voluntarily by companies even measure comparable activities mandating audited climate disclosures of the kind the sec has proposed along with increased enforcement will go a long way towards addressing this principal agent problem 3 3 coordination problems among firms a few chief financial officers cfos i have spoken with complain that disclosing emissions and transition plans when competitors hesitate to do so on the margin dissuades them from making similar disclosures a mandated disclosure rule for all listed companies solves this problem 4 0 management s assumptions that affect future cash flow impact due to climate change a key strength of our financial reporting system is comparability across companies in my experience investors have little comparable information on climate related assumptions and estimates in financial statements for instance the ongoing global efforts to decarbonize whether via regulation or technological innovation will render several current products gas vehicles obsolete such impending obsolescence typically implies shorter useful lives for property plant and equipment ppe used to manufacture the cars or potential write downs of car inventory the high prices of oil and gas in today s market actually make it cheaper for consumers to switch to renewables in preparing a firm s financial statements management must implicitly or explicitly rely on assumptions and estimates regarding how decarbonization will affect the firm s future trajectory understanding these assumptions and estimates will aid investors in valuing the firm s securities to make this concrete consider the channels that british petroleum bp s auditors deloitte highlight under key audit matters as the potential impact of climate change on bp s 2021 financial statements page 138 of bp s 20 f for 2021 oil and gas price assumptions and estimates related to future emissions costs depending on the future demand and supply of oil due to climate change and the energy transition affect the value in use of bp s oil and gas ppe assets for impairment testing the timing of the decommissioning expenditures for oil and gas ppe assets and expected liabilities change depending on the trajectory of climate change potential decommissioning costs and asset retirement obligations that stem from assets divested by bp may revert back to bp if climate change concerns increase liquidity and resilience concerns in the oil and gas industry provisions for costs associated with decommissioning refining assets may need to increase if reduction in demand in oil and gas were to occur on account of climate change concerns potential viability of the exploration and appraisal costs capitalized as assets would be called into question if oil and gas prices are forecasted to fall in the future on account of concerns associated with climate change the recoverability of the carrying value of refining assets depends on i changes in demand and supply of oil on account of climate change concerns and ii adoption of electric vehicles in markets where bp has significant refining capacity bp s stated intention to reduce hydrocarbon production by around 40 in 2030 relative to 2019 would require an assessment of realization proceeds from sale to a third party relative to value in use by bp the useful lives of refining assets may shorten as society and bp moves to a net zero emissions goal such that depreciation charges are understated the goodwill balances on bp s balance sheet related to upstream oil and gas assets may have to be impaired if forecasts of future oil and gas prices due to the energy transition and the adoption of electric vehicles are likely to fall provisions for cash outflows to settle climate change related litigation brought against bp may have to increase remarkably it can be quite difficult to obtain comparable detailed impacts of climate change or transition risks for bp s american peers such as exxon and chevron and not to mention the hundreds of smaller upstream and downstream oil and gas companies in the united states section f of the sec rules explicitly requests registrants to provide contextual information including a description of the significant inputs and assumptions used and policy decisions made by the registrant to assess the implications of climate change and transition risks on financial statements i support such disclosure to enable an investor to compare how managements of exxon or chevron or other u s oil and gas companies view the impact of climate change and transition risk on their financial statements relative to say a british petroleum if we do not provide such comparability on the margin institutional investors might simply move capital from u s oil and gas firms to overseas regimes where such disclosure requirements are mandated of oil and gas and other companies scholars have documented time and again that capital tends to flee regimes characterized by opacity and greater information asymmetries between the manager and the investor section f of the new rules in my mind furthers one of the sec s key missions related to facilitating capital formation in u s markets 5 0 climate metrics in voluntary contracts such as executive compensation agreements and debt contracts climate metrics are increasingly used in contracts such as executive compensation contracts and debt agreements mandating consistency and comparability in these metrics will improve the efficiency of such contracting arrangements for instance bp s 2021 annual report states that 20 of ceo s annual bonus depends on environmental performance whereas 30 of performance shares depend on low carbon energy transition in chevron s 2021 proxy statement chevron introduced a link between annual bonus and lower carbon future defined as reducing ghg intensity increasing renewable energy and carbon offsets and investing in low carbon technologies the ceo of exxon mobil s long term incentives in its 2021 proxy statement are linked to methane reduction without comparable and consistent disclosures of the kind the sec asks for an investor will have a hard time understanding whether chevron ceo s goal of reducing methane emissions intensity is more effective than exxon ceo s goal of merely reducing methane in accomplishing the compensation committee s objectives to appreciate this point better consider compensation plans written on say roe return on equity even if companies do not rely on gaap mandated net income or shareholder s equity they clearly spell out thanks to sec regulation the differences between their non gaap number and the gaap number we do not have a regulatory arrangement to get companies to disclose what exactly is covered by their ghg intensity measure or how methane reduction is actually measured similarly u s firms are beginning to issue green bonds linked to promises associated with climate related metrics for instance verizon s green bond report states that as of february 2022 verizon has allocated over 991 million of net proceeds of its third green bond entirely to variable power purchase agreements vppas for renewable energy projects for approximately 0 9 gw of new renewable energy generating capacity these purchase agreements have a 15 year term verizon states that it avoided approximately 1 534 216 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually a footnote states that the estimated annual amount of renewable energy generated by the projects covered by the vppas was determined based on the full amount of verizon s contracted capacity with respect to those projects these disclosures are somewhat ambiguous does this mean verizon is taking credit for capacity yet to go online over the next 15 years are these emissions avoided truly accretive to the environment is verizon in effect buying carbon offsets to compensate for its brown power consumption did the counterparty that provides the renewable capacity only sell these energy credits once to verizon as opposed to someone else as well given that ppas are settled in dollars and not by the exchange of real electricity standardized sec disclosure on climate metrics would help an investor address some of these questions and lead to greater credibility efficiency and growth of the green bond market 6 0 quantifying benefits in section 1 of this letter i estimate the impact of compliance costs on market capitalizations of a median s p 500 firm to be roughly 28 million 1 2 million 23 what might the estimated magnitude of benefits from lowered estimation risk from sec disclosures be this question is harder to address from first principles as we have to go find major investors in their marketplace and survey their improved assessments of climate risk exposures of the companies they hold an alternate approach is more tractable instead of attempting to quantify the magnitude of benefits i propose we consider the capitalized value of compliance costs as the break even threshold that any estimate of benefits has to breach for the proposed sec rules to come out as a net positive in terms of benefits let us go back to the data for a minute the median market capitalization of an s p 500 firm is 29 7 billion and the price earnings ratio is 23 a loss in market capitalization due to capitalized compliance costs all else constant will reduce the earnings in price earnings by 0 09 hence all else constant the price earnings ratio will fall by 0 09 to 22 9793 simplified valuation theory suggests that price earnings ratios are defined as market capitalization of the firm cost of equity capital expected growth rate in earnings ignoring dividend payouts for now cost of equity capital is usually computed using the capm capital asset pricing model as the sum of the risk free rate beta for the individual stock risk premium for holding stocks as opposed to bonds that the representative investor expects hence the question boils down to how much of a decrease in individual beta for a stock do we need for the price earnings ratio to go back from the now reduced 22 9793 level back to 23 the decrease in beta will have to undetectably small for this to happen the point being we need a very small improvement in estimation risk for the costs of the sec climate rule to break even in terms of benefits via improved cost of capital 7 0 indirect costs and benefits i may have ignored indirect costs that represent potentially unintended consequences of the sec rules but to be fair i have also ignored many indirect benefits which may include i saving investors thousands of hours that would otherwise be spent gathering climate risk data from disparate sources and grappling with comparability and credibility of voluntary disclosures ii enabling firms to credibly differentiate their climate friendly products e g a net zero brand of gas for instance would be more credible if the oil and gas firm that claims to be net zero is credible and comparable and iii improving firms ability to attract and retain human capital due to increased confidence in employers climate disclosures in closing i reiterate why i believe the sec s climate risk disclosures as proposed would be associated with modest compliance costs these compliance costs will be more than made up by even a minimal reduction in estimation risk an investor faces in understanding the exposure of a firm to physical and transition risks associated with climate change such a reduction in estimation risk would likely lower the firm s cost of capital it is particularly important to emphasize that estimation risk exists even for a firm not materially exposed to climate risk mandatory audited disclosures that assure an investor that a particular company is not materially vulnerable to climate risk would reduce the estimation risk and cost of capital for such a firm as well shiva

dire predictions about the effects of global warming on maine s lobster population may be exaggerated and underestimate the potential that conservation measures have to preserve the fishery into the future rapid warming in the gulf of maine and the collapse of lobster fisheries in southern new england have fueled predictions that lobsters will likely move north out of maine waters in the coming decades but ongoing research at the university of maine is revealing a more optimistic long term view of the maine lobster fishery the umaine scientists are now projecting that temperatures in gulf of maine will likely remain within lobsters comfort zone because of the gulf s unique oceanographic features though changing ocean currents are harder to predict the researchers cautioned that the dynamics of global warming are complex and make it difficult to project far into the future with certainty ocean stratification where water of different densities separates into distinct layers is keeping the bottom temperatures colder on the gulf of maine s western side the scientists say while strong tidal mixing in the eastern gulf and the bay of fundy helps moderate the water temperature there during the summer because maine waters have historically been so cold they say even a couple of degrees of warming should keep maine s bottom waters below 68 degrees the temperature at which lobsters begin to show signs of stress according to the atlantic states fisheries management council though average sea surface temperature in the gulf of maine broke the 2012 record last year bottom temperatures remained much cooler data from the northeast regional association of coastal ocean observing systems shows when sea surface temperature peaked at 72 7 degrees fahrenheit in august at the western maine shelf observation buoy the water 50 meters below the surface was just 51 5 degrees there and would peak at only 55 6 degrees later that year kathleen reardon senior lobster scientist for the maine department of marine resources mentioned projections that maine water temperatures should stay within lobsters comfort zones at the latest lobster zone council meeting in east machias a lobsterman in attendance interrupted saying one minute it s on tv gulf of maine waters warming faster than any body of water in the world and now you re telling me it s not going to advertisement no it is warming faster reardon responded but she said even when taking warming into account hitting 70 degrees on bottom that s a really long ways away in maine we still have a very very different water temperature regime range than in southern new england so yes things are changing but we are not hopefully likely to approach those really stressful temperatures in at least the next 50 years in fact the warming has brought maine waters into the bottom range for lobster settlement she said lobsters spend the larval phase of their lives suspended in the water column feeding on zooplankton and will only settle to the bottom in water between 12 and 20 degrees celsius or around 53 to 68 degrees fahrenheit at the eastern maine shelf observation buoy temperatures ranged from 45 2 degrees to 55 3 degrees at 50 meters depth from june through november 2021 according to neracoos because water temperature has actually increased this is actually a case where warming ocean has had a positive impact reardon continued we have had more optimal conditions and especially in eastern maine i think that s what s driven the increases in lobster landings nuances of geography richard wahle a marine biologist and director of umaine s lobster institute agrees he leads lobster settlement surveys of the ocean bottom to determine how many lobsters are settling in different areas and publishes the results yearly in the american lobster settlement index advertisement wahle said that in the past couple of decades the waters in eastern maine have entered the low end of the thermal range for lobster recruitment which led to a boom in lobster settlement from 2005 to 2008 we ve sort of crossed a threshold that has just opened the floodgates for settlement in eastern maine wahle said and that in turn has really turned on the spigot for lobster production the surveys are mostly conducted by divers but the lobster institute in partnership with lobster processing company ready seafood and the department of marine resources has been deploying deep water collectors at various sites to get a sense of how settlement is occurring in deeper water they found that since the deep water is colder in western maine than in eastern maine lobster settlement has still been concentrated in shallow warmer waters there while in the eastern portion of the state newly settled lobsters were spread relatively evenly over the full range of depths in western maine more warming could open up deeper waters to lobster settlement one often cited rutgers university study predicted that lobsters could shift 200 miles north into canadian waters this century the researchers modeled future thermal habitats using data from trawl surveys and ocean circulation models based on high and low future greenhouse gas emission scenarios but that report published in the scientific journal plos one in 2018 did not take into account the nuances of maine s oceanographic features wahle said those nuances are the result of the basin s unique geography and how it amplifies the tidal heights which is independent of climate change advertisement one of wahle s former postdoctoral students arnault le bris now a faculty member at memorial university of newfoundland was lead author on another 2018 paper published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences that made projections through 2050 about the status of the fishery based on climate projections le bris forecasts predicted that southwestern parts of the gulf of maine such as massachusetts and cape cod bay may be seeing some shallower parts entering that less hospitable range of temperatures during the summer but that the eastern portion will fare much better the degree and a half of projected warming in the eastern part of the gulf of maine would still be well within the comfort zone of lobster wahle said so what kathleen reardon said mirrors a lot of what we ve been saying all along still projections are never perfect he points out while the projections le bris used captured the differences in tidal mixing they are based on standard atmospheric effects on ocean temperature and do not reflect changing ocean current patterns in the gulf of maine which wahle said are harder to model recent reports have shown that deep warm salty nutrient poor gulf stream current is pushing north into the gulf of maine and blocking the cold nutrient rich labrador current which is weakening and becoming less dense from dilution by meltwater i m not sure the oceanographic forecasting is at a place yet that can project what those conditions are going to look like with respect to the relative strength of the labrador current and the gulf stream but to the extent those trends continue we may be seeing a worsening effect he said advertisement conservation efforts can help while water temperatures themselves might not directly stress maine lobsters in the near future there are a number of other climate related factors that will likely impact their survival the shifting deep ocean current patterns have been impacting primary production in the gulf of maine and leading to declines in calanus finmarchicus and other plankton which in turn affect the whole food web le bris projections did anticipate declines in lobster abundance in the coming decades due to climate related stressors such as more predators as other fish species move northward changes in plankton abundance and increases in shell disease but his paper was optimistic that the conservation measures maine has in place to maximize the reproductive potential of the stock and simple adjustments to them could help stave off major declines or the type of fishery collapse that occurred in southern new england where conservation measures were not enacted until it was too late even though global climate change is severely impacting marine ecosystems widely adopted proactive conservation measures can increase the resilience of commercial fisheries to climate change the authors wrote advertisement maine s conservation measures include maximum harvestable size limits that protect the breeding stock minimum size limits that allow young lobsters time to breed and protections against harvesting egg bearing females through a mandatory v notching program in which a v shaped cut is made into the tail of a female bearing eggs it is illegal to keep females with this mark even if they are caught when they re not bearing eggs all those measures put our fishery in a really good position to not only stave off a collapse from potential future warming but to capitalize on great conditions for reproduction potential to build the population wahle said the le bris paper estimated how much less of the southern new england stock might have been lost if it had had conservation measures in place and how much less of an increase in lobster abundance maine might have seen without them if maine didn t have its protections for large and small lobsters and reproductive females the authors estimate lobster abundance would have increased by 242 percent rather than 515 percent since 1985 if conservation measures had been implemented earlier in southern new england it estimates the stock abundance would have decreased by only 57 percent instead of 78 percent over that time wahle said these measures helped maine take advantage of favorable conditions the increase in temperature and a decrease in groundfish that prey on young lobsters that made the coast more suitable as lobster nursery grounds and played a role in the explosion in lobster landings these could continue to help the fishery stay resilient against future threats less settlement fewer landings advertisement in addition to the american lobster settlement index the marine resources department conducts surveys to get a sense of the abundance of slightly older lobsters that are still below legally harvestable size through trawl surveys sea sampling accompanying commercial lobstermen and measuring lobsters in their traps and with ventless trap surveys commercial lobster traps must have vents that allow lobsters below legal harvest size to escape these surveys are used to predict future landings all of the surveys have been showing declines in young lobsters for several years with some exceptions the settlement survey reported a significant increase in settlement in the gulf of maine from penobscot bay to new brunswick and a lesser increase from casco bay to new hampshire in 2019 the settlement and ventless trap surveys showed lobster settlement in the western part of the state has not been declining but it has been declining for five years in the area from friendship to steuben and for two years from steuben to cutler the atlantic states marine fisheries commission board is considering whether to enact new management measures that would be triggered if these young lobster surveys show declines past a certain point with the goal of keeping the maine fishery around 100 million pounds landed annually the board may increase the minimum size of harvestable lobsters because doing so would allow lobsters more time to reproduce before being caught hearings on these measures have not been scheduled yet but are expected to be held this summer when reardon the state lobster scientist brought up the proposed increased minimum size limits at the lobster council meetings lobstermen suggested that instead other states should adopt maine s maximum size limits to protect large breeders because now a maine lobsterman can throw back an oversized lobster only to have it caught by massachusetts or rhode island fishermen but reardon explained that increasing the minimum size limit by even an eighth of an inch would have far greater impact because of the sheer numbers of lobsters that would be left to reproduce for a longer period reardon told the lobstermen that the declines in sublegal sized lobsters could be caused by a number of factors maybe we re just coming off of a settlement bubble maybe they are starting to eat each other or maybe the fish predators are coming back she said i don t know what s driving the declines advertisement one of the lobsterman in attendance said he has has been seeing a lot more codfish which prey on juvenile lobsters lobstermen also questioned the survey methods arguing that they have been seeing an increase in lobster abundance in deeper waters than the ventless surveys capture and suggesting that the trawls are not being done in the right areas most survey data do come from shallower waters and the marine resources department s lobster monitoring report of 2021 notes that the observed declines may be the result of a shift in distribution of lobsters across different depths reardon also acknowledged that the ventless trap survey does not capture deep water settlement but noted that multiple survey methods including trawls conducted at 75 fathoms are producing similar results the expansion of the deep water collector deployments in the american lobster settlement index surveys are helping scientists develop a better picture of how lobster habitat use is changing wahle has adjusted landings projections to reflect depth data resulting in projections with lesser declines and the 2020 landings did match the new projection model still wahle acknowledges that any forecasting model oversimplifies reality try as we might we can never capture all the mechanisms at work he wrote in the latest survey report they are always a work in progress still prediction remains a worthy aspiration because it equips us to consider informed choices as we confront an uncertain future send questions comments to the editors previous next filed

it seems only fair and natural that the inventor of a vaccine that has made a major contribution to defanging a deadly pandemic should receive considerable reward for its efforts nevertheless the meteoric rise of moderna is remarkable for its impact not just on public health but also on the stock market last year the valuation of the 12 year old harvard university spin out briefly touched 200 billion 152 billion soaring past that of long established pharmaceutical firms such as astrazeneca amgen and merck and placing it well above such household names as coca cola 67 billion ford 76 billion and general motors 129 billion i ve never cared about the valuation even if was kind of cool reflects derrick rossi the canadian stem cell biologist who co founded moderna in 2010 shortly after discovering a way to chemically tweak mrna so it could be used to fight all sorts of diseases it was more compelling when the vaccine was first approved for use so it could help people at the height of a global pandemic the campus views how to handle the jump from he to a commercial venture moderna was the most spectacular success story among academic start ups last year but it was by no means the only one fellow vaccine pioneer biontech set up by the university of mainz affiliated couple uğur şahin and özlem türeci is now valued at close to 30 billion beyond the life sciences the software company databricks which grew out of a research project at the university of california berkeley eight years ago was valued at 29 billion last year while the swedish oatly alternative milk brand founded by a lund university scientist was valued at 10 billion in may after it was listed on the nasdaq in the uk several start ups with their roots in academia also made headlines in 2021 investors snapped up shares in the cybersecurity firm darktrace founded in 2013 by university of cambridge mathematicians when it listed in april pushing its valuation to 2 2 billion meanwhile the ai drug discovery firm exscientia a 2012 university of dundee spin out now based in oxford was valued at 2 5 billion shortly after its public listing in october the dizzying success of these academic unicorns start ups worth at least 1 billion 760 million is an indication of the potential value in university discoveries and while governments have for decades urged academics to do all they can to commercialise their findings the urgency of that task is only ramping up further as nations scramble to become the knowledge economies that are expected to flourish as the fourth industrial revolution of robots and artificial intelligence unfolds in march for instance the white house gave the go ahead for a long awaited national science foundation division aimed exclusively at commercialising research findings meanwhile the uk government has announced that it will increase funding to innovate uk its research commercialisation funder by 66 per cent to 1 1 billion a year by 2025 it has also installed a former venture capitalist george freeman as science minister last month australia unveiled plans for a new research commercialisation fund worth a 2 2 billion 1 2 billion to fuse the country s world class university research capabilities with the government s modern manufacturing strategy and the european union last year set aside 10 billion 8 4 billion of horizon europe funding for a european innovation council to support the transition of promising ideas to market across the world research institutions of all kinds are being asked a difficult question so what you ve had so much funding but what is your contribution to society says david ai head of the london school of economics innovation unit unicorns can easily respond to that question by quoting their market value says ai who used to be a venture capitalist in silicon valley however in different domains we need to look at broader definitions of impact most mainstream venture capitalists have no interest in 95 per cent of the companies that the lse starts but that doesn t mean they don t have great impact so is the understandable excitement about unicorns pushing policy and funding down the right path can we really learn much from a highly unusual era when a public health emergency raised the fortunes of a handful of companies to almost unimaginable heights at record speed might an obsession with creating commercial giants distract from the less heralded task of supporting basic research or of nurturing small to medium sized enterprises plugging less lucrative but still important gaps in the market that moderna became as big as it did was not shocking to me we predicted early on that we should be able to turn this into a 100 billion company says rossi that might sound a bit cocky but as someone who believed in the potential of this technology i always believed it was achievable he says what i did not expect is that the first product would go to billions of people and play a particular role in ending lockdowns and in some sense saving humanity the company s original business model was to create a suite of drugs for treating specific genetic illnesses with each drug having a global market of perhaps 100 000 patients that would still have put moderna on the path to greatness rossi says and that belief is evidently shared by the firm s current investors who are looking beyond its 20 billion annual covid revenues and the 70 per cent decline in its share value since the 200 billion high a successful biotech drug is worth 3 to 5 billion a year so if you have 20 of these drugs then you could have 100 billion a year of income to get five or six of these drugs gives you a 20 billion a year company so our early thoughts were not unrealistic even if every pharmaceutical company and his brother are now piling into mrna says rossi that level of ambition may partly be explained by the power of the research industry nexus in cambridge massachusetts where rossi continues to live this is the mecca of the biotech industry you have the academic institutions but also world class intellectual property experts and venture capitalists looking to fund biotech rossi says the kendall square life sciences hub did not happen overnight however and while something like it could be replicated in other cities with scientific strengths given the right investment it wouldn t be easy says rossi who has also invested in several more life science start ups since stepping down from his formal roles at moderna in 2014 used to be a bunch of seedy parking lots places where you did not want to hang about it started with a few anchor companies wanting to be close to mit and harvard sometimes governments try to pitch this as a way to revive a town down on its luck but you won t get the meetings you need to happen there source shutterstock the ecosystem around the university of oxford in the mid 2000s was crucial to the success of dna sequencing company oxford nanopore which was valued at about 4 8 billion shortly after its flotation last september says hagan bayley who co founded the company in 2005 as things moved along the university had a really good tech transfer office and was very useful in terms of intellectual property and seed funding says bayley who still works as a professor of biochemistry despite pocketing a reported 32 million windfall from last year s flotation however the enormous effort of bringing science from lab to market should not be overlooked he adds in universities we like to think the research is 90 per cent of the work and companies do the other 10 per cent but in reality perhaps what we do is the easy part things that just happen to work out for us in the laboratory but he does not think that universities should be involved in commercialisation and he worries that the growing emphasis on financial returns rather than fundamental science will backfire for uk science you can see this with vaccines he says the big drug companies with research budgets of 5 10 billion didn t come up with much the real innovations came from universities in his case we didn t set out to create a billion pound company we were thinking in terms of how our platform technology for single molecule sensing might work we knew we had a world changing technology but it took seven to eight years to get to the point where we could use it similarly it would be a mistake for governments or funders to attempt to directly engineer multimillion pound companies says bayley rather they should take the long view we can facilitate commercialisation but only if there is new science to commercialise and the uk is very good at this fundamental research all these ideas that research should be focused on impact fail to take account of the serendipity that important science requires if we have curious scientists who are well funded that would be best for uk science source getty former uk science minister lord willetts is also wary of the stampede for commercialisation we create too many tiny spin outs that hit the market too soon some research projects should remain research projects he says warning against counting the number of companies that universities create as a measure of their success however he welcomes the government s increased support for research commercialisation believing that it will give more time for researchers to develop businesses based on their results historically public support for research has stopped too soon on its journey to market so the reversal of big cuts to innovate uk is very welcome says willetts he also praises the formation of a new ministerial council for science and technology headed by prime minister boris johnson which he hopes will encourage more strategic cross government thinking about science investment there is a transformed way of thinking about science with the council trying to pull it all together he says one key area that might come under review is intellectual property ip rights says willetts while some institutions might argue they should share in the success of a future unicorn that desire to stay in the picture is likely to harm a start up s chances of making it big he explains british universities are terrified of a start up being successful if it means having to explain why they only have 5 per cent or less of the company says willetts the us is much more grown up about this it s sometimes said that mit actually makes more from t shirts than it does from its spin outs whether that story is apocryphal or not mit is estimated to have been the genesis for more than 26 000 companies with a current combined annual turnover of 1 5 trillion roughly 60 per cent of the uk s annual gdp according to the kauffman foundation universities can make very bad major shareholders adds lse innovation s ai sometimes universities in the us have invested early and done quite a lot of the heavy lifting to get a company off the ground so will want to keep 30 to 50 per cent he explains but a company might need to fire its ceo overnight or respond to a takeover offer in a matter of hours so it can t wait around for university committees or councils to make up their minds universities should ask what they re adding to the spin out or whether they are deadweight making the company seem like a bit of a dinosaur in the commercial world that view is also endorsed by chris loryman senior manager at the university of california san diego s commercialisation office which in recent years has helped companies started by san diego academics to raise almost 9 billion in investment ip policies at universities absolutely make a difference he says but he agrees that they should not be drawn up with the idea of maximising university revenue the notion of universities funding themselves in a meaningful way via licensing or start up activity is ridiculous and dangerously naive he says having previously worked at several london universities he describes uk universities obsession with making money from commercialisation as unsophisticated pre industrial and self damaging he suggests that parliament change the law to limit how large a stake universities can take in spin outs source getty alamy montage so what is the answer regarding ip for some sweden s professor s privilege the right of academics to fully own the ip of their research inventions or patents explains a lot of the country s phenomenal business success in recent years with higher financial incentives it is claimed academics naturally seek to become more entrepreneurial and that mindset filters through to students resulting in stockholm s thriving graduate start up scene responsible for firms such as spotify skype the fintech firm klarna minecraft owner mojang and king the company behind candy crush researchers are the ones who will drive a project forwards with their networks and knowledge explains marcus holgersson associate professor at the entrepreneurship and strategy division of chalmers university of technology in gothenburg without the professor s privilege it can be difficult to get researchers on board the professor s privilege was introduced in sweden in the 1940s and was also common in several other european countries holgersson who was recently tasked by the european commission to review ip practices in european universities says evidence of the privilege s effectiveness can be found in a 2016 study which found that the number of university start ups and patents in norway both halved shortly after the country abolished its own professor s privilege in 2003 in pursuit of us style commercialisation success in norway universities may now claim as much as two thirds of commercialisation income rights but allowing staff to retain the full ip rights and royalties to their research can throw up problems too says lisa ericsson founder and head of kth innovation at kth royal institute of technology where times higher education s 2022 innovation and impact summit is taking place from 26 to 28 april this is because individuals can sell their future ip rights to companies in exchange for funding the rights for that individual s entire career could belong to a company explains ericsson the researcher might be happy to do this but it can make things difficult when it comes to working with other universities or laboratories in future the rise of a whole new wave of private investors in individuals future ip rights including the not for profit arcadia science and new science and the for profit molecule dao makes it more important than ever that researchers do not sign on the dotted line without taking proper advice that is particularly true given that some industry investors may seek to acquire rights to research and ideas for the very worst reasons warns oxford nanopore s bayley big companies can buy smaller ones to shut them down because they are using competing technology we consciously avoided selling the company or technology because we didn t want anything like that to happen he says ericsson s office at kth whose alumni body includes the founders of spotify skype and software company databricks contains two patent attorneys and an ip lawyer to advise researchers on such intricacies her team also spends time educating phds and postdocs about the basics of patents and licensing in some cases kth innovation will hire a chief executive to run a promising university spin out so that the academics can return to the lab it may also recruit a phd graduate to further develop a business case in the hope of attracting private investment through our investment arm we can also give them an investment offer ourselves and we will try to invest in those that we think can get big says ericsson but the stockholm university is equally willing to get behind ideas at an early stage when it is not clear whether a viable business will emerge in partnership with sweden s innovation agency vinnova kth provides proof of concept grants of up to 30 000 to allow staff and students to develop or finesse a prototype based on their research which according to holgersson s recent eu report bridges a small death valley for start ups that industry investors view as still being too risky to spend money on it s not about making money for us says ericsson whose department has supported more than 3 000 ideas from students staff and entrepreneurs since 2007 including more than 1 000 from academics those companies have employed almost 2 000 people raised 20 million in funding and generated 4 million in tax revenues it s about creating value and impact for the university which is able to attract students from abroad because they hear about our work and want to become part of the stockholm ecosystem says ericsson that mix of the right ip policies and financial support is important for commercialising research but governments could go even further by way of procurement and regulation says naomi weir director of innovation at the cbi in the uk we have some areas of strategic advantage such as space or aerospace but we may be putting the brakes on them through things like overly rigid procurement procedures says weir referring to the fact that smaller uk start ups may be turned down for government contracts in favour of large multinationals that are more experienced in jumping through the bureaucratic hoops she says the prime minister s new science council is well placed to coordinate and drive these efforts across whitehall the government could also think about its role in regulating markets so that businesses must become more energy efficient which could benefit companies based on novel technology developed in universities she says finding ways to incentivise the right investors to back the more deep tech oriented university spin offs for reasonable durations is perhaps the biggest challenge for university spin outs says ericsson it has been quite easy to raise capital both in stockholm and london but venture capitalists who are very experienced in digital companies are often not long term funders and therefore not very suitable for investments in companies with a longer time to market she says there is a clear need for more patient capital in more evergreen structured funds that understand deep tech and have the time and funds to be part of the journey even then however university spawned unicorns are likely to remain almost as rare as their mythological brethren and by the time they acquire their horns they are likely to have long left behind the university stable as california s loryman puts it flashy ipos happen from time to time and yes some of those companies have a heritage back to a university but the reality is that these 1 billion companies are one in a thousand and usually decades in the making that s not what university derived companies generally do and nor should they seek to jack grove

the assault rifle america s most popular gun has become the preferred instrument for mass murder here s everything you need to know what defines an assault rifle assault rifles often called ar 15 style weapons have been used in many mass shootings including the recent massacre of 10 black people in a buffalo supermarket and the slaughter of 19 elementary school students and two teachers in uvalde texas these weapons are identifiable by three features they re semiautomatic meaning they can be repeatedly fired with the squeeze of the trigger they have detachable magazines for easy reloading and they have components such as a pistol grip that allow shooters to fire continuously with their rifle trained on the target the ar 15 is the civilian counterpart of the u s military s m16 which has a shorter barrel and can fire three round bursts with one pull of the trigger these marvels of engineering are stunningly efficient and easy to use earning the title america s rifle from the

weekly good news newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox sign up why the term ar 15 ar 15 was originally named for the gunmaker armalite and trademarked by colt after it bought the manufacturing rights to the weapon but the patent is long expired and about 500 gunmakers sell similarly designed weapons there were about 400 000 assault weapons in circulation when a federal ban on them was passed in 1994 but sales exploded when the law expired a decade later today there are about 20 million ar 15s in the u s one in five gun purchases is now an assault weapon how deadly are they the ar 15 was engineered to cause maximum wound effect as one of its designers put it it fires needle nosed bullets that travel three times faster than handgun rounds and fragment when slamming into flesh causing enormous damage features such as second hand grips and thumb hole stocks make the weapon easy to aim and hold with both hands while firing dozens of rounds with little recoil it s the perfect killing machine says dr peter rhee a former navy trauma surgeon a study of mass shootings from 2000 to 2017 found that killers who used assault rifles caused 97 percent more deaths and wounded 81 percent more victims than those who used handguns how did assault rifles originate adolf hitler coined the term sturmgewehr storm weapon to describe a new gun with a shorter barrel than the standard nazi rifle making it easier to control because it kicked less the soviets followed with the ak 47 when american troops encountered viet cong troops armed with aks they decided to go against conventional military thinking and try the new american made ar 15 which used unusually light 223 caliber rounds the same caliber used by the uvalde shooter the results were astonishing the ar 15 mutilated enemy soldiers leaving many looking as though they had simply exploded a military report said what makes them so lethal unlike a heavier handgun bullet which punctures the body like a nail a high velocity round from an ar 15 delivers a payload of kinetic energy that radiates outward from the wound obliterating organs pulverizing bones and causing massive bleeding it can leave a jagged exit wound the diameter of a soda can when radiologist heather sher examined a teenage victim of the 2018 high school shooting in parkland florida she says she found that one organ looked like an overripe melon smashed by a sledgehammer the victim could not be saved after the uvalde shooting dna samples were needed to help identify victims many of whom were left unrecognizable by horrific wounds how are assault rifles marketed gunmakers call the ar 15 a modern sporting rifle and its fans insist it just has cosmetic differences from other semiautomatic long guns but marketing strategies have grown increasingly unsubtle after the u s invasions of iraq and afghanistan commercial ar 15s began appearing in the same desert tan used on the battlefield advertisements for daniel defense which sold the weapon used by the uvalde shooter show images of u s troops with the slogan use what they use appeals to masculine insecurity are common such as a bushmaster ad for the rifle that said consider your man card reissued gunmakers increasingly advertise their weapons as necessary tools if and when the u s descends into anarchy or tyranny the nra s magazine advised that a 5 year old boy could fire an ar if taught the two finger trigger pull method would restrictions be effective that s the subject of fierce debate with gun enthusiasts arguing that restrictions can be circumvented by determined criminals still a 2019 columbia university study found that banning large capacity magazines resulted in a 206 percent drop in the fatality rate of gun massacres one inescapable irony is that any time there is renewed discussion of banning assault weapons it triggers a boom in gun sales in fact says josh koskoff an attorney who represented victims families after the 2012 sandy hook elementary school shooting gunmakers know mass shootings help sell more assault weapons they cashed in on that imagery he said and muscularity and violence the assault weapon s role in massacres for years semiautomatic handguns were the preferred weapon of mass shooters but assault rifles have emerged over the past decade as the weapon of choice and large capacity magazines ranging from 30 to 100 rounds enable gunmen to increase their kill count without having to pause to reload adam lanza attacked sandy hook elementary school in newtown connecticut with a bushmaster

food insecurity is rising globally because of the war in ukraine according to experts with africa expected to be hit the hardest the world s superpowers china and the u s say they are trying to mitigate the fallout but at the same time are accusing each other of exacerbating the crisis a state newspaper the china daily placed blame for the situation partially on washington saying food prices have reached an all time high as russian and ukrainian grain exports are hindered by port disruptions and western sanctions the u s for its part has accused china of hoarding after president xi jinping said earlier this year that food security in china was a primary concern and urged farmers to scale up production to ensure the world s most populous country was self sufficient asked by voa if the asian giant couldn t help combat food insecurity caused by the ukraine conflict u s ambassador jim o brien head of the office of sanctions coordination replied we would love to see china act like the large power it is in helping to address the problem in the global food market we are concerned that china is building up its domestic stocks and continuing to purchase grain on the global market at a time when we would love to see it be able to help those who are in need he added china has hit back at the accusations of hoarding currently china supplies over 95 percent of its own needs for grain it is unnecessary for the country to hoard grains in the international market an article in the state affiliated global times said in contrast to china s contributions to global food security the u s is the major instigator behind the current global food crisis us rebuts sanctions narrative the worry about global food insecurity began soon after russia invaded ukraine in february russia and ukraine are the world s largest and fifth largest wheat exporters respectively since the war broke out exports of the grain as well as maize and sunflower oil have been severely disrupted many african countries depend heavily on ukrainian and russian imports for their food supply and some say u s sanctions on moscow are to blame for their woes ugandan president yoweri museveni said in may the war in ukraine and western sanctions on russia have also caused shortages of wheat likewise south african president cyril ramaphosa has said even those countries that are either bystanders or not part of the conflict are also going to suffer from the sanctions that have been imposed against russia current african union chair macky sall who met with russian president vladimir putin last week tweeted that the russian leader was ready and willing to facilitate the export of ukrainian cereals and suggested the west was hampering him i call on all partners to lift sanctions on wheat and fertilizer sall said but at a virtual press briefing organized by the u s embassy in johannesburg on thursday o brien said the narrative that sanctions were hurting food exports was misleading the u s does not sanction russian food and fertilizer he said russia has disrupted one of the most productive ways that countries received grain ukraine used to export 6 million or so tons of grain a month mostly to the global south and now that has had to stop in march and april it was very small o brien said the u s and european union are trying to facilitate exports from ukraine but that at best it will probably be about half what it was before and that s because russia has occupied or destroyed 30 odd percent of ukraine s grain producing capability it is attacking grain storage and processing facilities cary fowler the u s special envoy for global food security said at the same press event the situation in the ukraine has by all estimates pushed is pushing about 40 million additional people into the ranks of the food insecure ukraine produces enough food to feed about 400 million people fowler said and that s sitting in silos right now in ukraine unable to get out because russia is blockading the ports resultant food price spikes are going to have an impact on africa first and foremost he added the world bank said this week that as of june 1 maize and wheat prices were 42 and 60 higher respectively compared with january of last year more from u s last month u s secretary of state antony blinken pledged more money to combat food insecurity globally noting 32 of the 39 countries at greatest risk from this acute food crisis are in africa just since february the united states has pledged more than 2 3 billion of food assistance and pending final approval from our congress we ll provide more than 5 billion in additional aid including more than 760 million specifically for global food security as well as the billions in funds the u s is also boosting its domestic fertilizer production blinken added russia is the world s largest fertilizer exporter chinese officials have also been speaking about the global food crisis with some state media much like the africa union s sall blaming western sanctions chinese foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin said last month that china already feeds one fifth of the global population the global times reported the report also said china had donated 130 million to the u n s food and agriculture organization in recent years this week china s state news agency xinhua reported that african nations can leverage existing collaboration with china to transform their agricultural systems tackle hunger attributing it to quoqi wu a senior official at the u n s international fund for agriculture development wu said that among developing nations china is the biggest donor to the ifad and had helped finance numerous projects to boost agricultural best practices on the continent
noel bennett istock editorial via getty images the investment thesis the article presents my hold thesis on philip morris nyse pm you will see that the thesis took into consideration its business outlook risks and also valuation after its price bottomed in q4 2021 the sentiment has reversed and the stock reported encouraging business fundamentals and pricing power its q1 2022 earnings reported a 5 3 growth in net revenue per unit demonstrating its pricing power in the face of shipment volume decline iqos acquired more than 1 million users despite its exit from russia looking forward i have little doubt that the demand decline for combustible products will keep creating a headwind however its long term pricing power and the growth from these new products will be more than sufficient to offset the secular decline of its traditional products finally the stock is now in full valuation its 18 6x fw pe is about 9 5 above its historical average and is at about 85 to 100 premium relative to its peers such as altria mo and british american tobacco bti strong technical signs as you can see from the following chart pm stock price suffered some volatility and has bottomed in the 4th quarter of 2021 to as low as 85 since then its stock has rallied to the current level of 102 a share a 20 appreciation so far pm has delivered a 1 year total return of 10 4 in contrast the s p 500 has lost about 6 7 in addition to beating the overall market pm also outperformed the staples sector which delivered about 3 9 of return by more than 6 5 even more telling is what has transpired ytd the overall market peaked toward the end of 2021 and has lost more than 17 from the peak even the haven staples sector lost 6 3 ytd while in contrast pmâ s price retained its upward advancement and rallied by more than 9 2 ytd it is a classical sign of strong sentiment for a stockâ s price to rally against the backdrop of a market wide and or sector wide decline however as we will see next the rally is certainly supported by good fundamentals but it has brought pm to a full valuation and leaves no margin of safety seeking alpha business outlook pm has delivered an overall positive q1 2022 despite the exit from russia and it expects a robust full year ahead both topline and bottom line reported healthy organic revenue and eps growth in q1 2022 net revenues grew 9 and adjusted diluted eps grew 14 on a currency neutral basis two bright spots are of particular importance to me first net revenue per unit grew 5 3 demonstrating pmâ s pricing power over and over to navigate flat shipment of its traditional products and second iqos is another bright spot iqos acquired more than 1 million users over and reported 23 rrp pro forma organic net revenue growth looking forward i believe traditional cigarette volumes will continue to decline and its heated products are well positioned to offset such decline especially in the eu region excluding russia and ukraine and japan the heated products are gaining momentum as cfo emmanuel babeau commented abridged and emphasis added by me our iqos business delivered an excellent quarter continuing the reacceleration seen last quarter as device supply constraints continue to ease â rrp pro forma net revenues grew by 23 with pro forma smoke free net revenues over 30 of the total company importantly pro forma htu shipment volumes grew plus 18 compared to the prior year quarter this reflects excellent progress in the eu region continued growth in japan as well as over 50 growth in low and middle income markets pmi htus are now the second largest nicotine brand in markets where iqos is present as our efforts on innovation portfolio and geographic expansion drive consumer trial and adoption the impressive start for iqos iluma continues in japan and switzerland with very encouraging initial take up in our latest launch market of spain pm 2022 q1 earnings report valuation and expected return despite the sable business fundamentals the stock is now fully valued or even slightly overvalued given the sizable rally in the past year or so the chart below shows its historical fw pe multiples as you can see in the past decade its fw pe has been on average 17x and has fluctuated from a low of 14 2x to a peak of 20 1x currently it is valued at 18 6x fw pe nearly 9 5 above its long term historical average when compared to its peers like altria and british american tobacco itâ s also trading at a substantial premium as you can see from the second chart its fy1 pe of 18 6x is almost 200 of bti and 180 of mo i view such large premiums difficult to justify given their similar business models and the many common risks they face seeking alpha seeking alpha final thought and risks pm has enjoyed positive sentiment and also solid fundamentals in the past year or so its stock price staged a robust rally against the backdrop of an overall market and sector decline its business outlook is robust given its pricing power and the success of its new smoke free products i share managementâ s outlook that the growth from these new products will be more than sufficient to offset the secular decline of its traditional combustible products however the stock is now fully valued or even slightly overvalued currently its 18 6x fw pe is about 9 5 above its long term historical average and almost 2x higher than bti and mo i view such a large premium difficult to justify finally risks the russian ukraine situation represents a substantial near term risk the immediate financial impact is not that large and estimable however the implications in terms of regulations operating environments and supply chain interruptions are harder to estimate and will be more persisting as ceo jacek olczak commented below it is also clear that we cannot continue business as usual in light of regulatory and supply chain disruption which has already impacted the russian business in q1 we have taken concrete steps to scale back our operations such as the cancellation of all new investments and product launches including iqos iluma and iqos veev its 2022 guidance is also based on several key assumptions as aforementioned total shipment volume is expected to stay flat or slightly decline which is a secular trend i expect to continue pm is dealing with semiconductor shortages and may not be able to completely fulfill iqos demand finally as a global business pm is also susceptible to currency exchange rates its 2022 guidance includes an unfavorable currency impact of 0 63 under the current rates

amid the noise and clutter of the just concluded election campaign one urgent national indeed global issue went unnoticed climate change hardly surprising talking about climate change in a political rally is like delivering a speech with marbles in your mouth the subject is complicated it won t win you votes politicians prefer to talk about creating jobs raising incomes building homes or providing free medical care but unless we deal with climate change those glitzy promises will soon lose their glitter the urgency of climate change action was highlighted by the latest report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the international body for assessing the science related to climate change released on april 4 the ipcc report warned that the world was running out of time it said that unless countries acted quickly to cut greenhouse gas emissions the goal of net zero emissions by 2050 will soon be beyond reach global temperatures will rise beyond the target range of 1 5 to 2 centigrade this will result in severe changes in the climate translation think of having more typhoon yolandas and odettes every year or the water level at angat dam regularly falling below critical levels or more crops being devastated either by floods or droughts or coral reefs being destroyed and fish stocks depleted or coastal communities being flooded by rising sea levels sea level rise the consequences of climate change can be so calamitous take sea level rise according to the ipcc sea level rise globally is speeding up it rose from 1 4 millimeters per year in most of the 20th century to 3 6 millimeters per year from 2006 to 2015 it added that the population exposed to a 100 year coastal flood may rise to about 20 if the global sea level rises further this is bad news particularly for the philippines which has more than 7 640 islands about 60 of filipinos live at or near coastal areas what s more the sea level is rising much faster in this country than elsewhere according to a 2016 study sea levels in the philippines are rising at five times the global average due to regional variations in the impact of climate change on the oceans the philippine government has been ringing alarm bells at the united nations un meeting on oceans and the law of the sea in june 2021 director john francis herrera of the department of foreign affairs warned that the future survival of the country is at risk if sea level rise is allowed to go on unabated the question is what actions are being taken this comes to mind when you hear about new reclamation projects being planned for in manila cebu city and dumaguete how can such plans fare given the rising sea levels what can be done to face such a problem there are no easy answers but some of our neighboring countries are already taking action in january 2022 indonesia s parliament passed a law to relocate the nation s capital from jakarta to a jungled area of kalimantan on borneo island the relocation program will cost 32 billion and will start sometime between 2022 and 2024 a megacity of 10 million people jakarta suffers from chronic congestion air pollution and floods due to the combined impact of sea level rise and land subsidence can you imagine the philippine congress debating a law to transfer the capital from manila to the elevated plateau of bukidnon in mindanao well what can the philippines do to deal with climate change and still pursue development there are many things let s just take a look at two shift to green energy first shift from coal to renewable energy in this way the philippines can help in implementing what experts consider a key action item in the climate agenda cutting down the use of fossil fuels in power generation right now coal accounts for nearly 60 of the philippines total energy mix it has 28 operating coal fired power plants and 22 more approved for construction by the department of energy coal is preferred because it is cheap however among fossil fuels coal is the dirtiest it is no 1 in the global hit list for decommissioning at the un climate change conference in glasgow scotland last year the philippines conditionally pledged to phase out coal in the coming decades conditionally because it is asking for financial help to make that transition in line with this the philippines and indonesia have signed a deal with the asian development bank adb under which existing coal power plants will be retired and replaced by renewable energy facilities the adb s target is to retire half of southeast asia s coal plants over the next 10 to 15 years to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 200 million tons a year this transition to green energy will not be easy many of the country s existing coal fired plants are relatively new this raises resistance to retiring them early moreover the shift to renewables will also require redesigning and re equipping the power grid to handle the variable power generated by renewable energy facilities like solar and wind can the philippines make this shift to renewables the reward for this effort will be a new efficient and sustainable power industry that will help reduce our climate change woes the cost of failure we will be left behind again climate resilient agriculture another urgent action agenda item is agriculture to adapt to changing weather patterns the philippines must make its farmers not only more productive but also more climate resilient it may help that agriculture is sexy for our politicians many candidates in the last elections pledged to help the country s farmers in various ways incoming president ferdinand marcos jr said that giving agriculture a boost will be one of his top priorities to make the country food secure and resilient for that to happen farming advocates say the new president will have to reverse what they call the government s decades long bias against agriculture for many years they say the government s agriculture budget has been underfunded what complicates the situation is the food crisis that the world faces today the global food system has been hit hard by covid 19 the global energy shock and the war in ukraine price jumps and supply shortages of petroleum products have made fertilizers more scarce and expensive in many countries this forced farmers to cut back on fertilizers and feeds which in turn is reducing their output and raising the cost of crops and livestock the russian invasion of ukraine has disrupted supplies of vital food items russia and ukraine account for 28 of globally traded wheat 29 of barley and 15 of maize the longer the war lasts the larger the impact on global food supplies will be meanwhile bad weather is taking a heavy toll on farm output china the world s largest wheat producer has warned that its harvest this year will be its worst ever after major floods delayed planting last year india the world s second largest wheat producer has suspended wheat exports due to a severe drought dry weather has also hit other major wheat producing countries in north america europe and africa while supplies of rice and other key crops remain adequate the overall food situation is volatile over 20 food producing countries have imposed restrictions on food exports more than one fifth of the world s fertilizer exports have been constricted un officials warn that countries which rely on food imports may suffer shortages and high prices the most vulnerable face possible famines for now the philippines has to play a balancing act of trying to keep local food crop and livestock production from falling while maintaining access to vital food imports in the longer term the country must invest heavily to make local agriculture not only more productive but also more climate resilient how can philippine agriculture be made more climate resilient the many ways this can be done have been spelled out in the compendium of climate resilient agriculture technologies and approaches in the philippines which was published in 2020 this report provides a long checklist of action items these range from using stress tolerant varieties of rice corn and other major crops to crop diversification and the use of agroforestry in rainfed lowlands to multi story cropping livestock integration and soil conservation in upland farms the compendium also recommends the use of digital technologies such as mobile apps for remote real time pest and disease monitoring and reporting and the deployment of automated weather stations and drone aircraft to provide farmers with real time weather information all this will take time money and sustained effort the cost of inaction will be much more painful with climate change development cannot be sustained if it is not climate resilient ramon mon isberto is a former journalist and public affairs officer of pldt and smart and upon retirement is now associated with action for economic reforms
texas instruments logitech and qualcomm are reliable dividend payers and there are good reasons to expect share price growth from them too passive income money you can earn with little to no effort is one key to achieving financial flexibility and dividend paying stocks are a top choice for those who seek it plenty of companies out there reliably distribute some of their earnings to shareholders every quarter after the drubbing the stock market took in the first half of 2022 even some growing tech companies are priced such that their dividends offer lucrative yields if you re looking for fantastic long term passive income plays in this market three fool com contributors think texas instruments txn 0 01 logitech international logi 6 43 and qualcomm qcom 0 85 should be on your radar this semiconductor giant has increased its dividend 50 fold over the past 17 years billy duberstein texas instruments in this time of uncertainty and rising interest rates what would investors find attractive in an income producing asset defensive characteristics a meaningful yield supported by high free cash flow and the potential to grow through a potential downturn semiconductor giant texas instruments has these characteristics in spades first the company has been around since 1930 so it s a survivor it also has a really impressive culture and a record of adaptability yet even after 92 years texas instruments still grew revenue by 14 year over year last quarter and its earnings per share rose by 26 it also has incredibly high margins with an operating margin exceeding 51 over the past 12 months and a 68 return on equity that s in part due to the company s competitive advantages in 300mm manufacturing its deep customer relationships and broad cross selling opportunities these super high profitability metrics have allowed texas instruments to grow its free cash flow per share at a 12 annualized rate since 2004 and have allowed management to increase its dividend payouts at an even higher 25 annualized rate over that time that s more than a 50 fold increase in the company s dividend since 2004 at today s share price it yields 2 75 while i don t expect ti s payouts to grow by another 50 fold over the next 17 years i still expect them to grow significantly texas instruments produces a very broad set of mission critical analog and embedded chips for a wide array of customers and industries as part of its long term strategy it has targeted the industrial and automotive segments over the past decade that s because industrial machines and automobiles contain more and more semiconductor content with each generation propelling ti s long term growth last year sales for industrial and automotive applications accounted for 62 of its revenue up from 42 in 2013 with booming demand for auto and industrial chips today texas instruments is investing in the future it has two plants coming online in the near term its rfab2 facility in texas later this year and its lehi fab in utah early next year moreover ti began construction of a giant new four fab complex in sherman texas that s set to come online in 2025 when those facilities are producing growth should follow and high margin growth at that with a solid yield a reasonable price to earnings ratio in the high teens and solid growth prospects over at least the next decade texas instruments is a sleep at night semiconductor stock that should pay shareholders more in dividends each and every year just one check a year but it s a generous one anders bylund logitech international computer accessories maker logitech international runs an unusual dividend program instead of distributing payouts every quarter as most u s dividend payers do this swiss company issues them just once a year but those annual checks are juicy and management has been increasing the payouts every year since 2014 logitech s payouts have more than quadrupled from 0 23 per share in 2013 to 1 05 per share in september s pre announced issue this year it s coming through with a 10 step up shareholders still have to approve the proposed payout at logitech s annual meeting earlier that month but i see no reason why they would reject it it s true that logitech s business is sputtering in 2022 the company has absorbed higher costs for freight transport and rising component prices along with manufacturing halts due to covid 19 lockdowns in china then again every company is dealing with those issues now and logitech still generated 100 million in operating cash flow during its fiscal 2022 fourth quarter which ended on march 31 that s more than enough to keep its dividend payouts rolling those amounted to 159 million in fiscal 2022 while its operating cash flows added up to 298 million so logitech delivers a robust and growing dividend with an effective yield of 1 7 at today s share price fully financed by incoming cash flows even during a challenging period meanwhile the stock trades nearly 60 below its 52 week high at a valuation of just 11 times forward earnings estimates what s not to love buy this stock at a discount and start collecting those generous dividends as they grow larger year by year income and growth from the leader in mobility nicholas rossolillo qualcomm if you re looking for a semiconductor company that s well entrenched in the fabric of the economy look no further than qualcomm sure a lot of investors focus on apple s aapl 2 19 decision to start developing its own chips and other tech giants have begun experimenting with in house designs too but there s good reason why qualcomm remains so dominant in the mobile chip world it s been doing this for decades and has a technological edge over its competitors of course a consumer goods centric business like qualcomm s can have issues smartphone and tablet sales are highly cyclical and the company s booming growth over the last couple of years can be chalked up to a tidal wave of upgrades to 5g network ready devices most of the world has yet to upgrade to devices that use the faster new wireless tech but eventually the 5g growth cycle will fade but today s qualcomm is not the qualcomm of the 2010s under the leadership of ceo cristiano amon and cfo akash palkhiwala it s charging into new arenas like industrial iot and the automotive sector each of these segments currently accounts for a fairly small portion of its sales iot contributed 15 of revenue in the last quarter including its licensing and royalty business and automotive was just 3 however year over year iot sales grew by 61 and automotive sales rose by 41 beyond providing it with growth opportunities many of these new markets carry even higher profit margins for qualcomm which should provide a further boost to its already lucrative operating profit margin of 31 over the last 12 months qualcomm s dividend at current share prices yields 2 2 and it bought back 951 million worth of its stock last quarter alone if passive income is what you re after this stock should rank high on your short list of investment options

racine it started with an assignment a writing prompt asked fifth graders at julian thomas elementary how the school could improve some students wrote about food service challenges long after the assignment was done they kept pursuing the topic kashay johnson and claudia morales cruz are two of the students who have worked on the issue for several months and demanded improvements they have received more than 200 signatures from students and teachers on a petition outlining their concerns morales cruz and johnson both said they have felt sick after consuming school food and morales cruz said she once vomited after eating a school meal food was sometimes cold or burnt and they said the school served expired milk in march 2021 when students returned to in person learning julian thomas students met with their principal and racine unified school district officials on april 1 regarding the quality of school meals and some changes occurred as a result including an oven repair issues remained though and johnson called it stressful to know that school food could make her ill it s driving me crazy johnson said a letter sent to the journal times from a dozen julian thomas students including johnson and morales cruz demanded that rusd provide their students with nutritious healthy and good tasting food the students listed 10 demands including that food be freshly cooked by school staff who are paid livable wages we are the future and we deserve to be taken seriously and treated with respect the letter states food service officials said supply chain issues caused by the covid 19 pandemic and labor shortages have created challenges to providing quality meals at schools challenges that exist across the country supply chain problems began at the very beginning of covid and quite honestly i don t see that ending anytime soon cheryl herman rusd food service coordinator said in an interview when food is damaged or does not arrive in time because of supply chain challenges that results in last minute meal changes herman mentioned a recent issue with bread that did not rise properly in those instances rusd must make a menu adjustment to the best of our ability with what we have in stock and go with it herman said the 2021 22 school year ended last week starting this summer rusd is planning some changes to its meal offerings but nothing drastic nationwide challenge last month school meals were discussed by the racine unified school board multiple times the contract with the school district s food service provider aramark was also extended through the 2022 23 school year during a may 2 work session board member scott coey said he needed to address ongoing food service challenges we look incompetent as a board and as administration if we didn t acknowledge that issue coey said mary dumont aramark residential district manager said on may 2 that food service must be prioritized more in rusd including giving students more time to eat school breakfast and school lunch need to be an integral part of the school day and quite frankly it s not dumont said coey emphasized the importance of quality school food and said it is a big issue locally and elsewhere this is not limited to racine and this is not limited to aramark coey said in march milwaukee students launched a campaign demanding better meals coey said similar issues exist in kenosha where he is a teacher issues locally julian thomas elementary is not the only school with challenges on april 6 a mother with children at wadewitz elementary said in a message to the journal times my kids came home starving and told me they had carrots apple slices and three slices of cheese for lunch i thought surely they were served more but just decided not to eat what was offered i was wrong that same day a video was posted on social media of a hot lunch at gifford school that included what appeared to be a slice of american cheese a bag of goldfish pretzels raw carrots and a small bag of apple slices in an apologetic post on social media rusd said that supply chain issues have been a huge challenge for school lunches here in rusd and across the country but we have clearly missed the mark with the lunch served this wednesday we are working to correct it going forward herman said that the food served april 6 was not a good menu choice and steps were taken so that that will never ever be served again she said she can still see the gooey cheese in my sleep racine unified apologizes for having missed the mark with school lunches this week racine unified school district has apologized for having missed the mark with the lunch served to students on wednesday beth ann engelland wisconsin aramark district manager told the rusd board on may 2 that the company investigates all food complaints each occurrence that happens we investigate and take very seriously especially as it relates to food safety engelland said for example herman said the milk served to students in march 2021 was investigated and it was determined that there was a bad run from the dairy supplying the milk we had problems with several schools herman told the journal times it was not just julian thomas obviously the dairy replaced the milk immediately and to the best of our knowledge we have not had any issues since then there was also a heating issue with an oven at julian thomas which herman said was fixed shortly after school officials met with students in april we did discover that the heating element was bad on the oven herman said we should never be serving meals that are overcooked food service contract renewed herman engelland and dumont spoke during the may 2 work session because the rusd board was discussing renewing the school district s food service contract with aramark during its may 16 business meeting the rusd board renewed a contract with aramark for the 2022 23 school year the school district began contracting with the company in 2018 the 2022 23 contract includes a 7 7 price increase per meal to reflect rising labor and food costs according to a board fact sheet through participation in the community eligibility provision program breakfast and lunch will continue to be offered at no charge for all students for the 2022 23 school year engelland said on may 2 that the price increase should help aramark hire more food service workers which could lessen the challenges caused by labor shortages we have a lot of vacancies on our team and we need them filled engelland said herman said that rusd has 48 food service vacancies out of 130 positions meaning 37 of its jobs are open she added that the administrative service campus kitchen has seven of its 15 positions vacant including a cook job that is a critical shortage herman said if we don t have people to serve our students we re in a tough place because of staffing challenges herman said there is less meal variety so items like chicken patties are served more often we re repeating the same things more frequently than we would like herman said ongoing concerns during the may 16 rusd board meeting coey a teacher at kenosha bradford high school noted that quality meals are crucial to creating a good learning environment if the kids are eating poor food and or they re not eating it we can t teach therefore we can t get results coey said teaching students who refuse to eat the food because it s moldy chunky to be blunt nasty at times i can t teach them if they don t eat rusd board president jane barbian agreed our students need to learn when they come to school and to be ready to learn they need to have good nutrition and good health barbian told a reporter if a child is hungry or is having poor nutrition that s a concern they won t be able to learn according to the centers for disease control and prevention eating breakfast at school is associated with better attendance rates fewer missed school days and better test scores and the food research action center reports that students receiving free or reduced price school lunches reduces poor health by at least 29 percent based on estimates using national data the letter from julian thomas elementary students stated that they and their peers have felt the impacts of poor food our classmates have been going to the nurse and the restroom a lot because the meals that we have for lunch are incredibly disgusting the letter states the food is so bad we can t eat it and we go hungry herman said that she contacted a school district paraprofessional and the julian thomas school nurse neither of whom could support that claim in the student letter we now have everybody watching for that but we have not seen any instances of students going to the school nurse with food related illnesses herman said on may 2 herman told the rusd board that she takes that issue very seriously the last thing we want to do is make one of our children sick and we know our kids count on our food herman said we know that there are some children that this is the only opportunity that they have to eat potential improvements in addition to meeting with school district officials rusd superintendent eric gallien emailed julian thomas student gonzales cruz on april 28 about food service thank you and your classmates for reaching out regarding your concerns about school lunch gallien wrote in the email reviewed by the journal times we have worked to address the issues you and your fellow students raised and will continue to listen to your ideas for how we may improve our lunches to the best of our ability herman said rusd will have ongoing conversations to receive student feedback on food service that includes the school district conducting regular surveys of high schoolers about meals starting this fall students need to have a voice herman said herman said there will be similar steps taken at middle schools and elementary schools including working with the rusd dietitian on random student surveys during lunch a pilot program providing more food choices could also help beginning at elementary schools during summer classes which start june 20 herman said the district is offering two hot lunch entrée options instead of one i think whenever you give students a choice they re going to be able to choose something that hopefully they enjoy herman said if that program works rusd will expand it at the start of the 2022 23 school year for johnson and morales cruz this fall they will attend new middle schools however they plan to continue the work they started last year with a class assignment and keep advocating for better food at julian thomas elementary if it does get better morales cruz said then we re going to be happy for the students that come here in photos and video

the political firing line is clearly drawn bill cotterell guns haven t been a big issue in recent florida political campaigns but current events should thrust the never ending controversy into this year s races with a gun control debate roiling congress and president biden dramatizing the issues with visits to scenes of mass shootings in buffalo new york and uvalde texas the news media are eagerly promoting a cross fire of accusations and counter claims by local legislative and congressional candidates last week s vote in the u s house on some much compromised gun measures broke down along party lines and in the coming campaigns we can expect a stark republican democrat split essentially democrats are for gun control promising it will somehow keep weapons away from criminals republicans tell voters any new laws inevitably infringe on the second amendment and are an ominous first step toward disarming law abiding citizens biden s plea let us finally do something biden urges congress to pass bans on assault weapons high capacity magazines shame on us house passes gun control package to address mass shootings democrats in the florida legislature this month have tried to call a special session on guns but there s no real prospect of getting the required three fifths of the membership to sign on even if the house and senate called themselves into session the majority republicans wouldn t pass anything serious and nothing would get past gov ron desantis but the democrat republican division is good campaign fodder for both parties and both sides have legitimate talking points along with plenty of exaggeration and hyperbole u s sen marco rubio r fla sides with his party on the pro gun side just as rep val demings d fla supports legislation to raise the age for buying semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21 ban bump stocks and large magazines and crack down on illicit sales that should make for a lively discussion in the rubio demings race for the senate next november i carried a gun for 27 years as a law enforcement officer i m a gun owner today demings said getting guns out of the hands of dangerous people will protect our children as far back as his first senate race in 2010 rubio s campaign material has proclaimed i believe the right to bear arms is a constitutionally protected right the right of citizens to defend themselves by bearing arms is a fundamental human right that should be protected what pro gun activists call constitutional carry should be a source of much discussion as desantis runs for a second term he has said he hopes to sign legislation allowing the legal carrying of firearms without a state license before he leaves office incoming house speaker paul renner r palm coast recently said the house will pass such a bill although its chances in the florida senate are unclear more from bill cotterell state law now requires concealed weapon permits which require a training class the open display of weapons is widely forbidden nowhere is the partisan divide more evident than in the race for governor crist who boasted a high rating by the national rifle association when he was governor and a republican now calls for a ban on so called assault weapons in his democratic run for governor from the attack at the pulse nightclub in orlando to the mass shooting at marjory stoneman douglas high school floridians have had enough says crist s campaign website agriculture commissioner nikki fried his opponent in the democratic primary for governor wants to change the culture or america when it comes to guns much like the country changed popular attitudes toward smoking republicans of course are having none of it u s rep matt gaetz whose district is out in the conservative panhandle denounced red flag laws to confiscate guns from people found by courts to be dangerous anyone who support such a law is a traitor to the constitution in his view desantis a former congressman similarly scorned the compromise bill passed by the u s house last week and headed for likely rejection in the senate at a news conference the governor warned that leftists are gunning for the second amendment and they re aiming at the wrong target desantis said you focus on the criminal you focus on the lunatic said desantis you don t kneecap the rights of law abiding citizens aren t slam dunk issues conservative warrior desantis not as aggressive on guns or abortion support for gun control rising half of republicans support stricter gun laws a double digit jump in a year usa today ipsos poll says bill

jonathan wilson guest columnist jonathan wilson is an attorney practicing in des moines we have been witnesses to yet another senseless slaughter of 19 innocent defenseless school children and two teachers in uvalde texas a place many of us had never heard of before uvalde has overnight become a metaphor for every unnamed community anywhere in the country thoughts and prayers have been sent again the expression has become a meaningless cliche i can join in prayers seeking god s comfort and resilient strength for loved ones of those who died thoughts on the other hand need to be focused on what can actually be done about this recurring nightmare god has no hands but our hands let s start with the inescapable fact that there isn t one single thing that can be done to stop all gun violence in this country the argument is made by those opposed to regulation of guns that absent such a silver bullet there s no need to discuss the subject an equally flawed permutation of that argument is that because whatever is proposed would not have avoided the most recent example of gun violence and innocent lives being lost such a discussion isn t timely neither argument holds up under scrutiny they are mostly designed to avoid consideration of workable solutions more hundreds call for action against gun violence during march for our lives rally in downtown des moines more rekha basu as congress debates gun measures nra money distorts the arguments i think some scrutiny is warranted and it s not just timely it s long overdue there are things that can be sensibly done to reduce some of the gun violence even knowing that doing all of them won t completely eliminate gun violence we should not let perfection be the unwitting enemy of the good reasonable people should be able to agree on these measures being implemented no fly no buy that is to say anyone who cannot pass muster enough to board a commercial airplane should not be allowed to buy a gun background checks there should be no loopholes in required background checks anyone who wants to buy a gun should have a satisfactory background check completed however long that takes domestic violence anyone who has committed domestic violence used a weapon to commit a crime of any kind or has had a restraining order or no contact order entered against them by a judge should not be allowed to buy or own a gun weapon capacities just as surely as bazookas are outlawed automatic weapons those where the shooter who merely pulls the trigger once and holds it can shoot until the magazine is empty should be fully banned not just restricted bump stocks similarly bump stocks that effectively convert a semi automatic weapon to approximate automatic operational capabilities should be permanently outlawed except for military use and those already in the public domain should be taken with just compensation clip capacity six shots should be enough to dissuade a home intruder or kill a deer require a reload after six rapid fire shots and give intruders and deer the running chance they deserve ghost guns the sale of parts that buyers can assemble to create a gun without serial numbers should be illegal age restriction no one under the age of 21 should be allowed to buy or be in possession of a gun of any kind without adult supervision ok strike that a bb gun would be fine but nothing more lethal than that mental health commitment anyone who has been involuntarily committed for mental health treatment should not be allowed to buy or own a gun treatment insurance mandatory mental health coverage under medicare and medicaid should be reinstated red flag enforcement pursuant to red flag legislation local law enforcement should be able to blacklist anyone reasonably suspected of being mentally or emotionally unfit subject to the right to appeal to a judge concealed carry there should be no unlicensed concealed carrying of a gun allowed except for law enforcement bodyguard contractors and employees should also be an exception if they are first trained and certified as such parental accountability personally i d be willing to go somewhat further like holding parents and custodians liable for actions of minor children in their care who are able to access a gun at home and use it or threaten to do so that wouldn t prevent such access but it would get folks attention because of the market and premium cost it would create for an insurance policy to cover the liability exposure insurers in turn would be able to impose access restrictions as a condition of coverage those should be seen as sensible things that could be done nationwide even collectively those things would not stop all gun violence but each of them would stop the use of a gun to commit indiscriminate or targeted gun violence in some situations where it currently is too convenient collectively they would reduce the occurrence and or magnitude of gun violence we are not without options if there were to be a genuine search for a collection of steps that could help the steps i ve outlined would help without compromising the intent of the second amendment to the united states constitution journalist randy evans called for political leaders to lead on this subject in the may 18 bloomfield democrat the foregoing litany of steps that can be taken or any of them would be a good place to start and a step in the right direction with that leadership we would not have to be helplessly victimized as we are right now we are in our perpetual political season those who attend candidate town hall meetings should insistently ask candidates about these specific recommendations and maybe others and insist on knowing whether or not the candidate would support each of them and if not why jonathan wilson is an attorney practicing in des moines
investors still need to be selective despite surging oil and gas prices oil and gas prices have skyrocketed this year that s giving energy companies more money to expand their operations and pay lucrative dividends several energy stocks offer much higher dividend yields than the s p 500 s relatively paltry 1 6 payout a couple of ultra high yield energy stocks worth buying hand over fist these days are crestwood equity partners ceqp and enterprise products partners epd 1 86 crestwood currently has a 9 dividend yield while enterprise yields 6 8 however not all big time dividends in the energy sector are worth buying investors should avoid bp prudhoe bay royalty trust bpt 10 11 and its 7 1 yielding dividend plenty of fuel to keep growing crestwood equity partners is a master limited partnership mlp that operates gathering and processing infrastructure across the country s top three production regions it generates steady fee based income as oil natural gas and water flow through its pipelines and other infrastructure that gives the mlp a steady cash flow stream to support its big time dividend the company expects to generate enough cash to cover its high yielding payout by at least two times this year that s enabling it to retain half its cash flow to expand its operations and strengthen its already solid balance sheet this strong financial profile puts crestwood s payout on a sustainable foundation crestwood s financial flexibility has also enabled the mlp to make several acquisitions in the past year earlier this year it acquired fellow mlp oasis midstream partners for 1 8 billion that gave it the fuel to increase its payout by 5 meanwhile the company recently bulked up its position in the delaware basin by purchasing sendero midstream partners and buying out its partner s stake in a joint venture these deals will help grow crestwood s cash flow which should help support future distribution increases remarkable consistency enterprise products partners is a large scale mlp with diversified operations that provide very stable cash flow the company generates enough cash to cover its ultra high yielding payout by a comfortable 1 8 times that enables it to retain some money to fund its expansion program the mlp also boasts one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector enterprise has a long history of growing its distribution the mlp notched its 23rd straight year of raising the payout in 2022 that upward trend should continue well into the future enterprise currently has 4 6 billion of major expansion projects under construction that should help grow its cash flow over the next several years in addition its strong balance sheet gives it the financial flexibility to make acquisitions enterprise spent 3 25 billion to buy navitas midstream partners earlier this year these investments should expand its cash flow to support continued distribution growth this big time dividend will come to an end bp prudhoe bay royalty trust has a much different business model than crestwood and enterprise as a royalty trust it earns royalties from oil produced out of alaska s prudhoe bay as such it makes more money during periods of high oil prices giving it more cash to pay dividends while the royalty trust provides investors with income upside potential there are several drawbacks due to production costs and other expenses the trust doesn t always generate enough revenue to pay a distribution that has happened several times in the past few years meanwhile the oil fueled revenue stream in prudhoe bay will eventually run dry when that happens the royalty trust s dividend will cease as it is the royalty trust didn t expect to be able to pay dividends in 2022 according to its latest annual report however it was able to because crude prices were high enough to make it profitable to produce from the region that might not always be the case oil needs to be above 76 69 a barrel in 2023 to produce royalties for the trust and even higher to support future dividend payouts which will fluctuate with crude prices and the trust s costs because of that it doesn t offer a sustainable income stream like enterprise and crestwood sustainability matters more than yield energy stocks are often a great place for investors seeking to collect a big time dividend yield however they still need to be choosy because not all high yielding energy stocks can maintain their payouts let alone grow them which is undoubtedly the case with bp prudhoe bay royalty trust because of that income investors should avoid that stock and load up on enterprise and crestwood instead
