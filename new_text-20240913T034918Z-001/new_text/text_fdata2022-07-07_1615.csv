to wash off without creating a public spectacle so she created shower toga which users put over their clothes before pulling them off from underneath with campers bikers endurance athletes and more in mind it s washable and reusable while at least one of the investors on shark tank likened it to a plastic trash bag cuban and guest shark alli webb saw the value and plunked down 80 000 for a 40 ownership of the company ready set eat founded in 2017 the company ready set eat introduces children as young as four months old to peanut egg and milk allergens with the goal of reducing kids risk of developing allergies to them by as much as 80 that is achieved by supplementing a baby s bottle or food with a packet of the allergens cuban made an initial investment of 350 000 through shark tank and then took part in a 3 million financing round as a parent of a child with a severe peanut allergy i know firsthand the impact it has on families across the country we will work on making sure every parent knows about early allergen introduction cuban said in a news release he is a father of three the living christmas co as a teenager in southern california scott martin used to deliver christmas trees to customers because i worked in a nursery i thought why do people cut down trees to bring in the house when there are perfectly good living trees that can be brought in the house and afterwards they keep on living he told spectrum news in 2019 so as an adult he founded the living christmas co which delivers live potted trees that families care for during the holidays and he ll return to pick them up then he will rent the same tree to another family next year saving the life of a tree needing money for capital and infrastructure he went on shark tank and found some disbelievers but cuban calling himself a believer in convenience with a conscience invested 150 000 for 40 of the company the company is still in business but not much is known about its growth and revenues so how does a business owner get their idea in front of cuban and perhaps score some venture capital email is the key you can find his address online with a bit of digging cuban told raising the bar podcast hosts alli webb and adrian koehler that he spends hours glancing through emails and responding to those that catch his attention your best bet for avoiding cuban s email trash can and his auto delete filter is not to waste a second of his time you ve got one paragraph to get my attention he told webb and koehler get to the point about what your product does and avoid making exaggerated claims if your product is viable and your email is one of the 10 or so cuban reads in depth your business could make its way into cuban s investment portfolio more from gobankingrates

the trade war between the united states and china is beginning to affect the share prices of us based companies as stocks of asml holding fell on tuesday asml holding which is one of the largest suppliers to the semiconductor industry around the world suffered losses in the stock market as bloomberg news reported that the us government is planning to restrict the company from selling any products to china the chinese market is very vital for asml holding as almost 16 of overall sales of the company came from china in financial year 2021 in monetary terms chinese market is worth 2 1 billion euros for asml holdings even though there have been restrictions on the company to supply vital and advanced products to china the company is making a large amount of money by selling older and not so important tools and machines to china if the reports are true even those transactions would be affected which will result in very serious economic repercussions for the company asml supplies machines which can produce deep ultraviolet to the chinese companies who are into the production of semiconductors chips this deep ultraviolet technology is kind of outdated when compared to extreme ultraviolet lithography technology united states and netherlands came into an agreement few years ago which restricted supply of advanced machinery related to semiconductor industry to china even since that from 2019 onwards asml has not been able to sell advanced machines and tools to china governments have not granted asnl for sales like that this information is expected to have caused a disruption in shares of asml holdings after the report got released asml shares in nasdaq sank by nearly 7 as of now the shares are being traded at 433 33 this was 450 on july 1st 2022 friday wedbush securities inc reduced its stake in asml holding by almost 5 there is no confirmation regarding whether the reduction was part of or related to the news report shares of other semiconductor equipment producers also fell lam research suffered a 3 6 decrease while applied materials a lost 2 4 share value according to a spokesperson from asml there has been no information or any messages from the government of the united states of america regarding any such changes in the policy the company does not want to speculate and make comments based on rumours asml holdings is one of very few companies in the world that is into the manufacturing lithography systems and other such vital machines and tools for the semiconductor industry various chip making companies such as tsmc samsung and intel are being supplied with vital machinery by asml markets and companies are also concerned regarding the after effects of any restrictions on the sales of machines to china any kind of restrictions on machinery supply will have direct impact on chip production in china even though it will hurt chinese companies badly the world is again going to face a chip shortage which would be economically challenging
the deep state is sadistic remember the old days of the clinton administration it came to power riding a center left push against the messes of the bush administration clinton was careful to distance himself from the crazies with a series of high profile rebuffs of the worst among them the hope was to advertise as a moderate but govern slightly to the left but then the polls and the markets started to speak and loudly the clinton white house was highly sensitive to them the president himself was said to have cursed the bond market more than once demanding to know who precisely was running this country himself or bond traders nonetheless the administration responded to all inputs the federal budget did not expand dramatically indeed the budget was temporarily balanced and then welfare itself was reformed to cut it out with the generous benefits for sheer laziness that had characterized the welfare state since the 1960s an economic boom commenced and these days people look back rather fondly on the whole experience choosing only to remember the president s dalliance with an intern times change the single strangest feature of the existing regime is how utterly impervious it is from input from either markets or polls the polls are showing the biden regime at an 18 1 split between disapproving and approving these are composite numbers some polls show a situation much worse i take it as axiomatic that one third of the public will believe anything no matter how stupid we are approaching that level in terms of job approval meanwhile the markets are in solid bear territory a new survey from an insurance company shows that 93 of americans have taken up second and third jobs just to stay ahead of the inflationary trap jpmorgan has a new poll of medium sized business owners that shows an unprecedented level of pessimism about the future what is going on right now is revealed in the following chart that shows household income declining even as debt service as a percent of income is on the rise that is a crucial moment in modern economic history it reveals the current impoverishment taking place it also reveals an amazing trick government gave everyone money and then took it away many people have just dropped out of the workforce we are still not up to the old levels of labor participation meanwhile people are maxing out their credit cards even as the more well to do are taking on new mortgages in hopes of paying them back in cheaper dollars what s more we are looking at 2½ more years of this hell there seems to be no chance of turning the corner not so long as biden denies that inflation has anything to do with money printing even as the administration continues to inveigh against fossil fuels while suggesting that instead we live off the wind and the sun and even given all of this we are seeing no change from the top they are blind to it all the 30 something ivies who work there are so convinced of their insane ideology that they are pressing it no matter what they are behaving like bolsheviks in 1920 thrilled for their revolution clinging to power and utterly disregarding the sufferings of the people at all levels of society it s a sadistic state one that seems to thrive in direct proportion to the pain it inflicts on the american people why why why i was just on a radio show in which the host made a speculation he said that the biden administration is literally seeking to destroy the american middle class and this is for two reasons first they want to punish people who voted for trump and see them suffer forever for having done so second they want to gut the middle class and promote dependency and demoralization to stop it ever from happening again i usually resist the kind of interpretation that relies on pure malice versus sheer stupidity but in this case i simply cannot shake off and dismiss this opinion evil does exist it explains a lot it is not necessary to believe that government has our best interests at heart but just gets confused at how to promote them he might actually be correct i don t know i ve never been a trump superfan but i still struggle to understand what s called trump derangement syndrome it s a real thing and is truly boundless the fix however the other day i ran across an interesting fact of history that could account for the unmitigated hate three months before trump left office he passed executive order 13957 the purpose was to create a new category of federal employment called schedule f schedule f employees could be fired by the president they would no longer have civil service protection due to their positions as policymakers and influencers the executive order demanded a thorough review of all federal employees to see who would qualify only one agency responded in time before the election was called for biden and concluded that it would pertain to 88 of its employees in other words this action would have gutted the power of the administrative state it would have been the biggest change to hit washington in 100 years absolutely astonishing what was biden s first action in office you guessed it he issued a new executive order reversing this one he saved the deep state none of this made the news but you can be darn sure that it was a huge deal in the belly of the beast imagine the cdc irs nsa cia fda doj and so on all subject to normal standards of hiring and firing that would have gone a very long way to ending the tyranny in america it absolutely had to be stopped the point is that trump with this order raised the stakes enormously he figured out the problem and the solution they must never allow it to happen again this is why they are behaving this way like cornered rats they will do anything to prevent something like this i ve never been one for the theory that the election was stolen simply because i don t have enough information to say either way but i will say this if there ever were an election to steal this would have been it the entire deep state stood on the precipice of dismemberment so yeah plenty of people would have been willing to take the risk we live in exceedingly dangerous times with multiple beasts on the loose looking for wealth and liberties to devour they are proving themselves impossible to train or deter no matter how bad it gets out there they really are sadistic

is a rebound around the corner the stock market is enduring its poorest first half since 1932 what does this evil fact portend for the year s second half your choices are these a the stock market will thunder back with fantastic vigor b the stock market terrors will extend throughout the year c this year s grim first half will exert no gravity whatsoever on the second the stock market is as likely to rise as it is likely to fall history holds the answer which is it the all important answer soon but first to the present first green then red the stock market bounced along in positive numbers much of the day yet it lost its courage and its oomph by late afternoon the dow jones lost 47 points by closing whistle the s p 500 surrendered five points the nasdaq composite 16 explains robert schein chief investment officer with blanke schein wealth management the fed will continue to raise interest rates until inflation begins to wane until then a sustainable rally for risk assets is hard to imagine tight monetary conditions will continue to be a headwind to financial markets until the fed gives the green light yet what was the source of today s initial optimism powell speaks federal reserve chairman powell sat down before the united states senate banking committee today there he babbled these words we are not trying to provoke and i don t think we will need to provoke a recession we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate the pace of those changes will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy and so the stock market made a meal of this morsel as explains mr karim basta chief economist with iii capital management seems significant and may herald a slower pace of rate hikes ahead thus we may have witnessed the return of our old friend today bad news is good news many fear the united states economy skids toward recession inexorably and inevitably more on which below and bad news for main street is often good news for wall street bad economic news means the federal reserve will re spike wall street s beautiful bowl of fruit punch wall street thrives on main street s bad news as doctors prosper from cancers as auto repairmen prosper from wrecks as undertakers prosper from murders indeed as moonshine merchants prosper from drunks drumroll and so we return to today s question what does the stock market s ghastly first half imply for the year s second half once again your choices are a the stock market will thunder back with fantastic vigor b the stock market terrors will extend throughout the year c this year s grim first half will exert no gravity whatsoever on the second the stock market is as likely to rise as it is likely to fall perhaps you require additional information to inform your decision we refer you then to zero hedge the s p 500 is currently on track for its worst h1 performance since 1932 at the depths of the great depression having shed 22 3 so far this year in total return terms that just edges out 1962 when the index lost 22 2 over the first six months of the year have you selected the surprising history here is your answer the answer is a the stock market will thunder back with fantastic vigor that is correct history indicates the stock market will undergo a sort of trampolining in the year s second half zero hedge readers looking for some positives may be comforted to learn that the five worst h1 performances for the s p 500 before this year all saw very good h2 performance indeed on four of those five occasions the index went on to gain at least 17 with the other seeing a 10 gain in order of h1 declines we saw 1932 h1 45 h2 56 1962 h1 22 h2 17 1970 h1 19 h2 29 1940 h1 17 h2 10 1939 h1 15 h2 18 this year s first half 22 3 plunging most approximates 1962 s 22 2 plunging can you then expect an approximate 17 rebounding in the second half perhaps you can yet there is a joker card in this deck a confounding and worrying variable the joker card is recession recession changes the calculus a second half recession likely reduces the rebound hypothesis to nothing recession would tug too forcibly upon the stock market once again zero hedge still what happens in h2 is quite binary if we don t see a recession materialize over that period it might be tough for markets to continue to be as bearish as they have been and a bounceback resembling history might be possible however it s hard to see markets recovering if we see firm evidence of the recession our emphasis hence this question does firm evidence for recession presently exist this morning our economic sherlock holmes argued no no evidence exists mr powell i don t see the likelihood of a recession as particularly elevated right now is very strong and well positioned thus our skin goose pimples and our blood freezes the fellow has a record of inaccuracy second to none or second to few at most he is not after all the first chairman of the federal reserve recession is defined officially as two consecutive quarters of minus growth first quarter growth came in at minus 1 5 meantime gdpnow a forecasting contraption of the federal reserve s atlanta outpost projects zero second quarter growth zero is but one rounding error removed from the minus numbers should second quarter gdp turn in a beneath zero reading the economy will officially pass into recession yet what if the economy already languishes in recession an ill omen weisenheimers with the firm piper sandler inform us that bear markets generally follow a recession s onset by an average three months 95 days for precision s sake that is recession generally emerges some three months before the bear market emerges the s p 500 crossed over earlier this month we therefore conclude that recession commenced in early march if the historical pattern holds true the recessionary bear market generally hemorrhages some 40 of its value before getting patched the s p 500 has shed 22 to date approximately history therefore suggests another 18 shedding before recovery of course the stock market may lose more than 18 and the stock market may lose less than 18 history may not necessarily repeat but as the great scalawag mark twain observed it rhymes the mills of the gods given the vast excesses of the past several years we would not be the least surprised if the purging is greater and persists longer we do not pretend to know of course the ultimate answer rests in the laps of the gods the inscrutable gods yet we are fond to cite the warning of ancient philosopher sextus empiricus which we do once again today the mills of the gods grind slowly yet they grind exceedingly fine regards brian maher managing editor the daily reckoning
the market s greatest fear what the market is worried about argues lpl financial s chief equity strategist is that the fed breaks something his co worker chief market strategist at the firm continues the fed has a very tight needle to thread here and i think investors and the market in general are losing a good deal of confidence that the fed might be able to do that we hazard the market is justifiably a jitter the federal reserve is an accidental menace it is a bovine amok among the porcelain soon or late china will shatter upon the flooring yesterday s 0 75 rate increase broke no dishes the dow jones leapt 303 points by closing whistle yet it proved merely a brief reprieve a shattering delayed markets tank once again today the dow jones broke 741 points the s p 500 123 points the nasdaq composite a china shattered 453 points to what can we attribute the delayed breaks the digestive capacities of investors argues ms susan schmidt of aviva investors investor sentiment seems to only be able to focus on one thing at a time yesterday the fed delivered as people expected it was combating the consumer price index data that was much higher than people expected and raised concerns about inflation being so aggressive investors are now remembering that the counter to this is a slowing of the economy and the economy gives off multiple signs of slowing cnbc there are myriad signs of a slowdown on thursday alone real estate data for may showed a 14 4 monthly slowdown in housing starts at a time when there is a chronic shortage of homes a fed manufacturing reading showed continued contraction weekly jobless claims were higher than expected as well that data piles onto other recent points inflation at 41 year highs consumer confidence at historic lows and retail spending falling amid dramatically higher prices more broken china meantime the federal reserve hints strongly at substantial rate increases to come it also pledges significant balance sheet drainings for a wobbling economy an economy potentially entering recession as is additional tightening promises shattered china if the economy does descend into recession will the federal reserve exit the china shop and will it attempt to glue the shattered dishes together through renewed rate slashings and balance sheet reflatings under other circumstances it likely would yet there is a joker card in play sky shooting inflation if inflation continues raging will the federal reserve simply concede defeat and let inflation run riot the federal reserve cannot possibly choke off today s inflation without breaking each and every dish bowl vase and cup on the shelves yet even modest tightening can work substantial damages the central question again is whether the federal reserve will capitulate a great awakening we have argued repeatedly that the federal reserve will capitulate once it breaks enough china allianz s mohamed el erian disagrees evidently he believes the federal reserve and the other central banks are experiencing a great awakening it s about time we exit this artificial world of predictable massive liquidity injections where everybody gets used to zero interest rates where we do silly things whether it s investing in parts of the market we shouldn t be investing in or investing in the economy in ways that don t make sense we are exiting that regime and it s going to be bumpy time will reveal whether mr el erian is correct or incorrect meantime repeated calls go issuing for monetary reform the federal reserve should do this and not that do that and not this this is the reformer s cry the eternal cry yet the late libertarian frank chodorov said most reform aspires to clean up the whorehouse while keeping the business intact for a more fitting analogy we seek in vain we file only this one caveat the whorehouse for all its sin at least does an honest trade a fellow vacates the premises somewhat lighter in the pocket but often lighter in spirits to match he has gotten value for money can the same be said for the federal reserve false interest rates false markets false economies the federal reserve s very business is false as we have maintained before for years the federal reserve twisted the road signs on the road to price discovery east is west west is east north is south and south is north or is north west is west south no one can say the federal reserve has blocked off every southbound lane and detoured all traffic into one single lane heading north and so it inflates bubble after bubble see for example the technology boom of the late 1990s see for example the housing bubble that preceded the great financial crisis see for example the everything bubble presently in collapse we would have the federal reserve cease its manipulation of interest rates altogether that is cease distorting the price of credit that is cease distorting the price of capital that is cease distorting the price of time itself that is cease shattering china but since we have entered the benevolent spirit of reform let us propose our own modest reform restore the federal reserve to its original purpose of providing liquidity to otherwise solvent banks in case of financial crisis strike from the books its twin mandates of price stability and full employment real reform or if it is true reform you seek this we suggest in seven short words the federal reserve act is hereby repealed this incidentally is within the lawful power of the congress of the united states reform the entire business off the earth no more setting influencing or in any way monkeying short term interest rates long term interest rates intermediate interest rates or any other interest rates let the market find its own level high low all points between them turn the credit business over to borrowers and lenders on the free market as the prices of chewing gum floor mops and catcher s mitts are turned over to the free market let the devil take the hindmost when we ll see real reform will there be losers of course there will be losers but does not the current arrangement yield its losers there will also be winners and likely among them will be many of today s losers most importantly it would likely wring the wild excesses from the financial system the booms would not thunder nearly as loudly or for nearly as long nor would the busts bust too much china thus our simple proposal of reform offered today in the highest spirit of public service it will be enacted the instant hell becomes a block of ice regards brian maher managing editor the daily reckoning
photo credit dragon images shutterstock the u s economy today has no lack of opportunities for architects an ongoing shortage of housing stock contributed to the dramatic spike in housing prices over the last two years illustrating a need for professionals who can help make design and construction more affordable and efficient the threat of climate change has increased interest in designers with expertise in energy efficiency sustainability and resilience and the landmark bipartisan infrastructure law passed in 2021 will pour billions of dollars into projects requiring the services of architects engineers and other design professionals while demand for architects services appears likely to remain high and even grow in coming years the future of overall employment in the field is more uncertain the bureau of labor statistics projects 3 growth in employment for architects by 2030 a rate slower than the average for all occupations while retirements and transitions to different industries will continue to create job openings improved software and technologies have made architects more productive this means that fewer architects will be needed to handle similar volumes of work recent employment data has already shown signs of potential decline in the field like many other construction related occupations total employment for architects fell sharply when the housing bubble burst and the great recession began from 2008 to 2012 the number of architects in the u s declined by more than a quarter a rate of employment loss far greater than the economy as a whole experienced but even after recovering to near pre recession levels in 2019 total employment for architects has remained down over the past two years strong educational and licensure requirements for practitioners also constrains the supply of new architects to practice as an architect one must usually obtain a bachelor s or master s degree in the field complete a multi year internship pass a licensing exam and meet continuing education requirements but because of the specialized knowledge and training required to practice in the field architects tend to be well compensated compared to other occupations from 2001 to 2020 the median wage for an architect was more than double the median wage for all occupations though this gap narrowed slightly in 2021 the overall median wage for an architect today sits at 80 180 however architects earning potential can vary significantly between locations in the u s when adjusted for cost of living the typical salary for an architect is highest in arizona where the median adjusted wage is 97 153 per year the list of best paying states also includes alaska massachusetts california and new york these top states also host many of the best paying cities for architects locations like phoenix boston the bay area and new york city are fast growing areas that provide plentiful opportunities for architects median wages in these locations far exceed the national median for architects in some cases approaching six figures annually to determine the best paying locations for architects researchers at construction coverage analyzed the latest

we are only a year and a half into joe biden s presidential tenure and things are not going well and that s not my opinion that s the opinion of a full 85 percent of the american public who believe the country is headed in the wrong direction it s impossible to hide the sky rocketing inflation the crashing stock market the record gas prices and all the foreign policy failures biden has objectively been a disaster advertisement so what is a president to do when his administration is collapsing around him blame donald trump of course while speaking in ohio on wednesday biden let it be known that trump still lives rent free in his head and that the lease has just been renewed biden the previous administration lost more jobs on its watch than any administration since herbert hoover that s a fact all based on failed trickle down economics we came in with a different economic vision pic twitter com dae2bijzpa townhall com townhallcom july 6 2022 i get that biden s brain is mush but you d think he d remember the global pandemic that took place in 2020 before spouting off about job losses state level lockdowns happened across the country putting the economy into an artificial coma apparently biden recalls none of that though instead choosing to blame trickle down economics for the job losses under trump a contention so devoid of reality as to make an asylum patient ask joe what the heck he s talking about does he think it s 1985 and ronald reagan is still president trickle down economics really never mind that the economy was booming under trump until covid hit making biden s critique rather absurd things just got weirder from there at another point a phone started to ring in the audience biden then proceeded to joke that it was trump calling him that s probably trump calling me says biden when he hears a phone ring in the audience pic twitter com lpyvxvgnpv greg price greg_price11 july 6 2022 advertisement everything about that clip is just odd the first thing you see is biden struggling to read his teleprompter looking intently ahead doing his best to not jumble his words while using his working man voice then he suddenly starts talking about trump calling him before spitting out something that sounds like vi shirt on ha lie is he speaking some kind of arabic derived tongue i don t know as i m admittedly not fluent in biden he then scratches his nose before grinning and putting his angry eyes back on to keep reading the teleprompter but when someone tells a joke it s worth asking what the joke actually was why would trump be calling him and how is that funny the crowd did their part in making the old man feel good about himself though acting as if he had just delivered the greatest line of comedic genius in history biden mentioned trump yet again while talking about pensions claiming trumpsters would literally take them out the trumpers would literally take them out says joe biden about government payments for union pensions charlie spiering charliespiering july 6 2022 i ll admit that biden isn t wrong about that yes trump supporters would take out government payments for union pensions because they are a giant grift unfairly paid for by taxpayers was that supposed to be some kind of own besides i m pretty sure there are a lot more people than just trump supporters who oppose taxpayer funded union bailouts advertisement rounding things out biden also did his creepy whispering things again because none of his handlers can get him under control to put it succinctly when the current president is spending all his time obsessing over the former guy that current president is losing biden may not perceive much these days given his mental decline but he knows enough to know he s been an abject failure with no accomplishments to talk about all he has left is making awkward false mentions of donald trump and look while i don t agree with biden s politics it s still sad to watch a guy crumble like this he can barely speak his jokes make no sense and he s been reduced to squinting at a teleprompter just hoping to get through another event someone should really step in and stop this elder abuse

vancouver bc accesswire july 6 2022 faraday copper corp faraday or the company cse fdy is pleased to announce an updated mineral resource estimate mre for the copper creek project located in arizona u s copper creek the mre was prepared by srk consulting u s inc srk in accordance with the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum cim definition standards and national instrument 43 101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects ni 43 101 paul harbidge president and ceo commented the delivery of the first combined open pit and underground resource for copper creek marks another key milestone in the advancement of the project with over 355 million tonnes of measured and indicated mineral resources the project has the potential to provide a u s domestic supply of copper for decades supporting the decarbonization of the global economy the geological model completed earlier this year provided the foundation to accurately segregate and estimate the updated resources the deposit remains open along strike and at depth with the recent completion of the 6 000 metre phase i drilling program which was not included in this mre there exists the potential for an increase to the resources as part of the technical work for the upcoming copper creek preliminary economic assessment expected to be issued in q2 2023 mineral resource estimate highlights measured mineral

kilometres km northeast of tucson arizona and 24 km northeast of the town of san manuel arizona the current resource area is 3 km in length and open in all directions the property consists of 41 square km of contiguous patented and unpatented mining claims and state prospecting permits the area is in a mining friendly and politically stable jurisdiction with extensive infrastructure including power rail water roads and access to skilled personnel the property is in the prolific southwest porphyry copper region at the projected intersection of a major northwest belt of copper deposits ray miami globe superior resolution johnson camp and a major east northeast belt of copper deposits san manuel kalamazoo silver bell lakeshore safford morenci the project hosts a porphyry copper deposit in addition to high grade near surface breccia mineralization with over 200 000 m of historical drilling and modest past production the company believes significant exploration upside remains there are over 400 known breccia occurrences mapped at surface of which only 35 have been drilled and 14 are included in the mre geological model the geological model see news release dated may 12 2022 was used to constrain the mineralization in the mre the geological model is based on the relogging of approximately 15 000 metres m of historical core observations from new drilling short wave infrared spectral data and multi element geochemistry this data was modeled in seequent leapfrog geo to generate three dimensional wireframe models moreover the copper creek geological model and mre are delineated at surface by newly acquired detailed one metre contour topography the copper creek batholith intruded paleocoene glory hole volcanics and proterozoic to paleozoic sedimentary rocks and is the main mineralization host some of the breccias also crosscut the glory hole volcanics the batholith is compositionally zoned and contains a shallowly west dipping monzogranite domain at depth and a dioritic border phase with the bulk being granodioritic composition four main types of granodiorite to quartz diorite porphyry dykes and plugs have been recognized these largely intruded as narrow steeply dipping dikes and plugs before and during mineralization the underground resource occurs largely in early halo porphyry style veins and magmatic cupola zones while the open pit resource is dominantly hosted in magmatic hydrothermal breccias hypogene copper is predominantly contained in chalcopyrite and bornite data verification the data used in this mre is supported by industry standard quality assurance and quality control qa qc procedures such as the insertion of certified standards and blanks into the sample stream and the utilization of certified independent analytical laboratories for all assays historical qa qc data and methodology on the project were reviewed and will be summarized in the ni 43 101 technical report no significant qa qc issues were discovered during review of the data all geological data used in the mre was reviewed and verified by berkley tracy pg cpg p geo srk principal consultant mr tracy visited the copper creek project from march 7 to 10 2022 the site visit included review of the geology available outcrop exposures and general geological understanding review of historical and recent drill core and procedures used to collect record store and analyze project exploration data independent audit of the drilling logging and sampling techniques in practice during faraday s phase 1 drill campaign and observation of drill hole locations and an overview of claim property boundaries in the field srk compared a portion of the original laboratory data certificates geological logs and downhole deviation surveys to entries in the faraday database the database subset was compared line by line to the fundamental data and no material errors were observed during the review the verification data was chosen randomly and contained over 11 100 m of drilling in 13 drill holes which represents approximately 5 of total drilling additional discussion on the data verification will be included in the ni 43 101 technical report for the mre mineral resource estimation methodology sixteen individual breccias were modeled in leapfrog geo software version 2021 2 4 by faraday and verified as suitable estimation domains by srk fourteen of these breccias contained mineralization above cut off grade and were included in the mre samples were analyzed for potential outlier capping by metal on a global basis and no top cuts were applied historical sample collection was in imperial units and averaged 3 05 m per sample raw assay samples were averaged into 6 10 m composites broken on breccia domain boundaries with residual lengths up to 3 05 m added to the previous interval certain historical drill holes were selectively sampled within the breccias during previous drilling campaigns and any unsampled intervals were ignored during primary compositing the estimation was constrained within discrete breccia domains interpreted by faraday based on geological logging and assay grades grade estimation was based on parent block dimensions of 20 m in x y z and sub blocked along the domain boundaries to 1 m in x y z the sub blocked resource models and block grade estimates were created using leapfrog edge software version 2021 2 4 the resource was estimated for copper molybdenum and silver using inverse distance weighting cubed and considering hard boundaries at the breccia unit outer contacts the grade estimation evaluated all parent blocks with centroids within the estimation domains and sub blocks are coded based on the parent block centroid estimation outside of the defined breccia units within the deeper porphyry style mineralization and halo zones around the near surface breccias considered a 5 m soft boundary with the breccia units bulk density was scripted by general domain based on analysis of specific gravity measurements collected by faraday and previous project operators a two pass search was used to optimize block estimation so that well informed blocks are interpolated using a tighter search ellipse than less informed blocks the estimation search neighborhood was defined for individual breccia units based on the copper data population as the key economic variable estimation parameters for the minor elements were identical to copper to assess the impact of missing data additional copper variables were estimated using null and nominal assignments for unsampled data in separate composited data sets un estimated blocks outside of the search neighborhood were scripted with null values equal to one half of the lower limit of detection the selection criteria used for search ellipsoid size number of samples and other conditions are derived based on data spacing to ensure appropriate interpolation as well as visual and statistical evaluation during iterative trial estimation runs across all breccias the estimation is informed by an average of nine composites from at least two drill holes with average sample distance of 49 m although this varies for individual estimation domains outside of the breccias the estimation is informed by an average of 11 composites at average sample distance of 134 m limited historical mining has occurred at copper creek mainly in the old reliable and childs aldwinkle breccias block grades were depleted in the model according to available records of historical mining which have inherent limitations for mineral resource classification a confidence variable was defined as follows class 1 reflects the highest confidence in grade and potential measured classification these blocks were estimated with seven or more composites in three or more drill holes the average distance to samples is 40 m or less within breccia domains and 60 m outside class 2 reflects potential indicated classification blocks are estimated with four or more composites from two or more drill holes the average distance to samples is 80 m or less within breccia domains and 100 m outside class 3 reflects potential inferred classification blocks are estimated with two or more composites from at least one drill hole the average distance to samples is 200 m or less class 4 delineates blocks within the modelled estimation domains that are not classified as mineral resources these areas of the model may have exploration potential technical report the effective date of the mineral resource estimate is july 6 2022 a ni 43 101 technical report prepared by

investors in glaxosmith kline have waved through the planned demerger of its consumer health business paving the way for one of the biggest london stock market debuts in more than a decade a vote on the split was almost unanimously backed at a general meeting meaning the newly demerged division called haleon will list on the market as planned on july 18 the demerger is a key plank of a turnaround strategy spearheaded by gsk boss emma walmsley as she tries to shift its focus towards drugs and vaccines and boost its flagging share price amid pressure from investors left in the dust gsk boss emma walmsley pictured who has overseen a flagging share price wants to shift the company s focus towards drugs and vaccines haleon which owns brands including sensodyne toothpaste and panadol painkiller was previously expected by the city to be valued at between 38billion and 45billion when it makes its market debut enough to catapult it straight into the ftse 100 however this valuation came under question from some analysts as the split drew closer analysts at credit suisse estimate haleon would have a value of just over 33billion haleon will take on 10 3billion worth of gsk debt as part of the demerger according to analysts at barclays around four times its estimated earnings for this year there is also speculation the firm could immediately become a takeover target after a 50billion offer by consumer goods giant unilever was slapped down in january swiss giant nestle also considered making a bid this year but backed out the demerger is expected to generate bumper paydays for its new boss and advisers who worked on the deal brian mcnamara the current boss of the consumer division who will head haleon after the demerger will see his maximum pay packet expand to 10 4million per year from its level of 4 4million meanwhile dave lewis the former head of tesco who has been recruited as haleon s chairman will be paid 700 000 a year bankers and lawyers are expected to rake in around 500million from costs related to the split the stock market listing and other transactions walmsley 53 has battled criticism from shareholders who have criticised her plans activist investor elliott advisors pushed for gsk to sell haleon rather than pursue a stock market listing and questioned walmsley s ability to lead citing her lack of a scientific background a failure to get ahead in the race for a covid vaccine also irritated shareholders as gsk was left in the dust by its main uk rival astrazeneca but walmsley has mostly seen off critics and pushed ahead with plans to bolster a pipeline of new drugs and vaccines it has embarked on a flurry of acquisitions snapping up boston vaccine maker affinivax for 2 4billion in may and cancer drug group sierra oncology for 1 5billion in april

about economic growth the russell 2000 gave up 0 8 percent bond yields rose significantly the yield on the 10 year treasury which helps set mortgage rates jumped to 2 93 percent from 2 81 percent late tuesday the minutes from the fed s two day meeting last month show that the central bank s policymakers concluded higher interest rates could be needed to restrain what they saw as a worrying trend consumers starting to anticipate higher inflation the policymakers also acknowledged that more rate hikes could weaken the economy the fed s minutes offered no major surprises for wall street said tom martin senior portfolio manager with globalt investments what s going to be much more interesting is what the fed says in july martin said the s p 500 rose 13 69 points to 3 845 08 the dow gained 69 86 points to 31 037 68 the nasdaq rose 39 61 points to 11 361 85 the russell 2000 fell 13 78 points to 1 727 55 major indexes have swung from sharp losses to gains on a day to day and even hour to hour basis lately reflecting investors worries about inflation rising interest rates and a potential recession the broader market though is still mired in a deep slump that has dragged the s p 500 into a bear market over 20 percent below its most recent high wall street s key concern centers around the federal reserve s effort to rein in inflation and the risk its plan could send the economy into a recession inflation has squeezed businesses and consumers throughout the year surging oil prices worsened inflation by sending gasoline prices in the united states to record highs the price of u s crude oil is still up 36 percent for the year but has been slipping throughout the week in a welcome sign for a market hoping for any signal that inflation could be easing u s crude oil fell 1 percent wednesday the price on tuesday settled below 100 a barrel for the first time since early may central banks have been raising interest rates in an attempt to temper inflation the fed has been particularly aggressive in its shift from historically low interest rates at the height of the pandemic to unusually big rate increases now that has raised concerns that the central bank could go too far hitting the brakes too hard on economic growth and bringing on a recession after last month s meeting the fed raised its rate by three quarters of a point to a range of 1 5 percent to 1 75 percent the biggest single increase in nearly three decades and signaled that further large hikes would likely be needed the minutes from the fed s june 14 15 meeting show that officials agreed that the central bank needed to raise its benchmark interest rate to restrictive levels that would slow the economy s growth and recognized that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if inflation persisted the recent pullback in energy prices could mean lower gas prices in a few weeks and could signal that inflation is peaking along with a cooling housing market this takes the pressure off the fed said katie nixon chief investment officer for northern trust wealth management if we can see gas prices go down that will pull through to consumer sentiment and that could give the fed the ability to at least take some of the pressure off investors are closely monitoring economic data for clues about inflation s impact its trajectory and what that means for the fed s position moving forward a government report on job openings in may beat economists expectations in a sign that the employment market remains healthy a report on the u s services industry showed that

jamie squire in a recent report i marked shares of delta air lines nyse dal a strong sell and that s something that did attract some comment from readers admittedly the timing was unfortunate for that call as shares dropped less than the broader market drop but it was not completely inaccurate as i argued that airlines don t make for sound long term investments as the airline industry quite often finds a reason to sell off and that showed to be the case this time as well while airlines are aligning for very strong earnings airline shares have started to underperform the broader market especially for a company such as delta air lines that s extremely unfortunate because if i feel there s one airline with a strong execution it s delta air lines as i discuss in this report wall street is bullish on dal delta air lines price target delta air lines i m not saying analysts or investors should be a wall street weathervane but wall street analysts have a 55 17 price target for shares of delta air lines implying an 87 upside even the lowest price target points at significant upside of at least 50 delta air lines june investor update delta air lines delta s june investor update also provides some reason to be somewhat upbeat capacity guidance came down by 1 percentage point while revenue was expected to be comparable to the same quarter in 2019 helped by stronger than expected unit revenues casm ex costs are 20 to 22 percent higher than 2019 levels suggesting there are significant unit cost savings to be realized as fleet utilization improves further nevertheless helped by strong unit revenues operating margins of 13 to 14 are expected that is below the 17 margin from q2 2019 but still quite good considering the elevated unit costs and higher fuel prices delta air lines shares near 52 week low despite the upbeat expectations for the second quarter shares of delta air lines are trading near a 52 week low and that is not completely unexpected delta air lines preemptively slashed 100 flights per day this summer season to improve the reliability in its schedule and that did not seem to be enough as cancellations and delays carried on forcing delta air lines ceo ed bastian to apologize not all of these issues are because of staffing issues as widely suffered by airlines but also because of staffing issues at air traffic control centers which have tripled however combined with increasing oil prices and 1 200 delta staff members picketing at seven airports that increases fears of not being able to benefit from the current pent up demand being released to the market instead delta offered passengers up to 10 000 to give up seats on overbooked flights staff members are seeking higher pay and to be less overworked as the airline operates more flights than its workforce can handle so there s potential pressure on top and bottom line due to the demands from pilots and further pressure originates from high oil prices and recession fears recession fears likely are providing the biggest downward pressure on share prices as it raises concern on continued strength in ticket revenue which currently is absorbing part of the increased oil prices the delta air lines double hedge there are three things that prevent airline stocks from flying high at this point those three elements are staffing oil prices and recession fears staffing is not something that delta can deal with immediately the airline can bring its operations in line with the size of its workforce which means reducing flights and also reducing revenue on constant unit revenues a recession also is not something that delta air lines can control but on high oil prices i believe delta air lines has an extremely underappreciated strategy high oil prices are bad for airline business not just because high oil prices increase costs but maybe even more so because high oil prices often are precursor of a recession which results in a weaker pricing environment currently we re looking at whether that strong uptick in unit revenue and demand will outlive the elevated jet fuel price levels but in a normal environment with high oil prices as an indicator of an upcoming recession we will see oil prices and unit revenues decline both as demand for both lose momentum in a recession but delta air lines has the more appreciable mix to deal with oil prices the company has its own oil refinery which in the second quarter already improved it fuel price by 0 37 per gallon it s not to say that this is the most risk free fuel price hedge but it certainly is a creative one that s paying off for delta air lines at this point and allows delta to be creative in an environment where demand for oil related products might shift overall i don t believe the refinery is on the longer term going to be extremely profitable or extremely lossmaking but it s a tool for delta to reduce the impact of oil price volatility on its cost balances where delta air lines is executing impressively is its fleet strategy which if you do it well can be a major contributor to fuel cost savings during the pandemic delta air lines removed the boeing 737 700 from its fleet and replaced it with the fuel efficient airbus a220 which should burn around 20 less fuel and similar replacements took place for the md 88s and md 90s which were replaced by the airbus a220 airbus a321 and boeing 737 900er delta air lines airbus a350 delta air lines in the wide body fleet delta replaced the boeing 777 fleet with the airbus a350 900 providing fuel savings that should be around 20 per seat while the airline previously also took delivery of a significant number of airbus a330neo jets introduction of fuel efficient jets doesn t make an airline an exception but the way delta air lines does it is bold delta air lines was the first us main carrier to order and operate the airbus a220 back when the program was still under bombardier s wings and that s benefiting the airline now in terms of having obtained attractive pricing for the jets and fuel savings the airline also adopted airbus a321ceo aircraft from airbus at attractive prices as well as the fuel efficient which delta air lines has recently started to take deliveries similarly while many airlines had been eyeballing the boeing 787 to provide a next leg of fuel consumption benefits delta air lines looked for a more price conscious approach and ordered the airbus a330neo instead and opted for the airbus a350 while competition in north america has been hesitant to introduce the jet and actually still operates the less efficient boeing 777 so we re seeing an extremely cost conscious approach where delta air lines weighs the overall economic life cycle costs of aircraft but also invests in fuel efficiency providing a fuel cost hedge it s an impressive strategy that grants delta growth replacement and fuel hedging at the most attractive prices conclusion for the second quarter delta air lines is expected to report 13 6 billion in revenues and earnings per share of 1 66 it seems that despite pressures delta air lines will be having a strong quarter and i feel like the current pricing levels offers a compelling entry point as the company should be able to present strong q2 results and has an incredibly strong strategic focus for the longer term i don t feel like that the current price of around 30 per share which is just 60 higher than what delta traded at during the pandemic reflects the long term success the company should be able to book even when the economy cools off it simply can t get much worse than having 90 of the global fleet grounded like we saw during the pandemic certainly if you think that a recession is near which it very much looks like and believe it will be hitting airlines hard then airline investment is not your cup of tea in the same way it s not my cup of tea for years now but we shouldn t forget that the delta strategy has often made it a preferred investment in the airline space and the current price point is pricing delta as if we are on the verge of another collapse similar in scale to what we saw during the pandemic and that is simply not the case delta is not there yet and there are pressures but it also has made significant changes to its fleet that should render it more cost efficient going forward

policymakers backed raising interest rates at their next meeting in july by either 50 or 75 basis points show the fed s june meeting minutes federal reserve officials agreed last month that interest rates may need to keep rising for longer to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched even if that slowed the us economy policy makers backed raising rates at their next meeting in july by either 50 or 75 basis points according to minutes of the federal open market committee s june 14 15 policy meeting released wednesday in washington they viewed maintaining the central bank s credibility to control inflation as crucial many participants judged that a significant risk now facing the committee was that elevated inflation could become entrenched if the public began to question the committee s resolve to adjust the stance of policy as warranted the minutes showed officials also recognized that policy firming could slow the pace of economic growth for a time but they saw the return of inflation to 2 as critical to achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis the fed s aggressive push to curb the hottest inflation in 40 years has convulsed financial markets as investors fret that tighter monetary policy will tip the us economy into recession officials hiked rates by 75 basis points in june the most since 1994 lifting their benchmark to a target range of 1 5 to 1 75 and chair jerome powell suggested they could do the same thing again in july he told reporters at a post meeting press conference that another 75 basis point increase or a 50 basis point move was most likely on the table when policy makers gather july 26 27 officials went big in june despite previously signaling they favored a 50 basis point hike after inflation data came in hot and a key indicator hinted that expectations for future price pressures could be accelerating among us consumers kansas city fed president esther george who dissented against the increase in favor of a smaller hike was the only one of the 18 policy makers who did not back moving by 75 basis points in june the minutes showed central bankers in june recognized the possibility that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if elevated inflation pressures were to persist the minutes said policy makers noted that if inflation expectations were to become unanchored it would be more costly to bring inflation back down to the committee s objective several officials since that gathering have echoed powell s characterization of the likely outcome of the july rate decision even as recession fears mount the personal consumption expenditures price index which the fed uses for its inflation target has risen 6 3 since may 2021 more than three times the central bank s 2 target powell has said there are pathways for bringing inflation down while keeping the labor market strong but acknowledged it will be a challenge economists have downgraded growth forecasts on the heels of data showing weakness in consumer spending a tightening of financial conditions and a decline in us manufacturing activity mortgage rates which have doubled since the start of the year are also cooling the housing market and some businesses are seeing lower demand odds of a us recession in the next year are now roughly one in three according to bloomberg economics similar pessimism is evident in interest rate future markets investors bet the fed will reverse course next year halting rate hikes sooner than officials forecast and beginning to cut rates by mid 2023

washington federal reserve officials were concerned at their meeting last month that consumers were increasingly anticipating higher inflation and they signaled that much higher interest rates could be needed to restrain it the policymakers also acknowledged in minutes from their june 14 15 meeting released wednesday that their rate hikes could weaken the economy but they suggested that such steps were necessary to slow price increases back to the fed s 2 percent annual target the officials agreed that the central bank needed to raise its benchmark interest rate to restrictive levels that would slow the economy s growth and recognized that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if inflation persisted after last month s meeting the fed raised its key rate by three quarters of a point to a range of 1 5 to 1 75 percent the biggest single increase in nearly three decades and signaled that further large hikes would likely be needed the fed has been ramping up its drive to tighten credit and slow growth with inflation having reached a four decade high of 8 6 percent spreading to more areas of the economy americans are also starting to expect high inflation to last longer than they had before a sentiment that could embed an inflationary psychology and make it harder to slow price increases and with midterm elections nearing high inflation has surged to the top of americans concerns posing a threat to president joe biden and democrats in congress at a news conference after last month s fed meeting chair jerome powell suggested that a rate hike of either one half or three quarters of a point was likely when the policymakers next meet late this month the minutes released wednesday confirmed that other officials agreed that such an increase would likely be appropriate a rate hike of either size would exceed the quarter point increase that the fed has typically carried out advertisement last month the fed released projections that showed that the officials expect to raise their benchmark rate to 3 4 percent by the end of this year at that level the fed s key rate would no longer stimulate growth and could weaken the economy the minutes suggest that the policymakers could potentially raise rates above that level at the time of last month s meeting the policymakers said the economy appeared to be expanding in the april june quarter with consumer spending remaining strong since then though the economy has shown signs of slowing with consumer spending falling in may after adjusting for inflation for the first time this year home sales are plunging as mortgage rates have jumped accelerated by the fed s rate increases the signs of economic sluggishness have intensified fears that high prices and rising rates could send the economy into a recession late this year or next year such concern has further complicated the fed s policymaking because a recession would normally lead it to cut rates to stimulate growth some economists described the fed s assessment of the economy as laid out in wednesday s minutes as outdated even though it is only three weeks old prices for oil wheat and other commodities are falling wage gains are moderating and growth is slowing those trends may mean that the fed s policymakers who have said they will be nimble in responding to economic data won t raise rates as fast as financial markets expect we very much hope that the sobering data since the june meeting will push members towards the smaller hike of a half point rather than three quarters in july said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics they wanted to send a clear signal that they will not accommodate permanently higher inflation but that job is done the fed had been expected to raise rates by a half point at last month s meeting but ended up announcing a three quarter point hike instead at his news conference afterward powell mentioned recent economic reports that had heightened concerns about high inflation those reports included inflation data for may which showed that the pace of price increases reached a 40 year high advertisement powell also cited a survey of consumer sentiment conducted by the university of michigan that said consumers longer term inflation expectations were starting to rise more quickly that unnerved powell and other fed officials because if people expect higher inflation that sentiment can lead to an acceleration of prices workers could for example demand higher pay to cover their expectation of rising bills and expenses leading companies in turn to raise prices further to offset their higher labor costs the fed is seeking to convince the public that it will rise to the challenge and tame the pace of price increases with the goal of keeping americans inflation expectations in check there is a significant risk now facing the fed that elevated inflation could become entrenched if the public began to question the resolve of fed officials to combat higher prices the minutes said as a result the minutes said tighter credit and clear and effective communications are critical to controlling inflation send questions comments to the editors
nascar penalizes las vegas s gragson for intentional road america crash john raoux ap nascar on wednesday penalized noah gragson for a deliberate and dangerous crash he caused in the xfinity series race at road america gragson who turns 24 later this month was docked 30 points and fined 35 000 by nascar for intentionally crashing into sage karam on saturday at the road course in wisconsin nascar cited a rule against intentionally wrecking another vehicle and actions by a nascar member that nascar finds to be detrimental to stock car racing or nascar gragson s swerve into karam triggered a frightening multicar crash that was so egregious gragson was criticized publicly by dale earnhardt jr ahead of the penalty announcement the nascar hall of famer and co owner of the jr motorsports team gragson has represented since 2019 was surprised nascar didn t immediately penalize his driver i was shocked to be honest with you when i saw noah make that decision earnhardt said wednesday morning on siriusxm nascar radio i was just completely shocked and in a bit of a disbelief not only that he made that choice but that he you know that it created such an accident and got so many other guys involved that was tough to watch really tough i think that nascar doesn t want to over officiate the races but i think in some situations there s some things that do cross over a line and i felt like that was definitely one of those situations where had i been in the booth directing the race i think i would ve had to bring noah to pit road and hold him there for a while nascar said it did not immediately issue the penalty after the 13 car crash because the racing saturday on the road course had been so aggressive that it wanted to speak with gragson and examine his chevrolet to ensure he had not suffered a mechanical failure obviously nothing was wrong with the car and it was clear it was intentional nascar said in a statement parking the number 9 during the event was an option but we felt that more information was needed before making a decision on any disciplinary measures the points deduction did not drop gragson in the standings he has two victories this season kelley earnhardt miller who was initially defiant against calls for gragson to be punished said on twitter the team she co owns with her brother understands the nascar penalty noah is a passionate race car driver and his actions occurred in the heat of the moment she wrote learning how and when to keep emotions in check is all part of the learning experience gragson lost his temper after he and karam banged several times shortly after the start of the third stage gragson turned right deliberately to hook karam on the straightaway between turns 3 and 5 which triggered other crashes karam was immediately critical of the danger gragson s action caused other drivers and gragson was unapologetic for crashing karam it s one thing if you re faster than someone gragson said but to throw it off in there and run you off the racetrack in the corner door you run you off the track finally after the third time i m over it it s not the ideal situation for him and his team but two or three times i m done with it earnhardt on wednesday said wrecking karam never should have been an option he needs to take that out of his choices he cannot be intentionally turning into guys on straightaways i just hope that he realizes that that really is something that he needs to be careful about going forward earnhardt said noah wants to race in the cup level he wants to get to the cup level and we want to help him get there whether he s driving a cup car for us one day or someone else when he makes those type of decisions and this is what i told him i said you re hurting that opportunity you re tarnishing staining your reputation and that s the last thing you want to do when you re trying to get job offers i told him that i could stand behind him through just about anything but i could not defend that karam crashed in 2015 while leading an indycar race at pocono raceway and a piece of broken debris from his car bounced up and struck justin wilson s helmet delivering a fatal blow karam is now trying a mix of both nascar and indycar and has been unimpressed with gragson in his time in nascar s second tier series i knew i was faster than noah and he didn t like that a little team was doing that to him karam said he can go out there and drive however he wants and it s not a worry for him it affects us a lot more than it affects him karam is entered in saturday s race at atlanta motor speedway where he will face gragson again but said he won t retaliate i m not going to intentionally drive into somebody or take somebody out karam said that s just not the type of driver i am twenty something years of racing that s never happened to me until road america i would say that s racing but to me that wasn t racing he also wasn t sure if gragson would change the las vegas native has been involved in myriad on track aggressions throughout his short career in the short time i ve been xfinity racing i have not heard a lot of great things about noah and he has not shown a lot of great racing with me on track karam said i m not sure noah can change this is something that noah needs to look in the mirror he needs to look at himself and want to make a change back to top

the louisiana supreme court s decision wednesday means that women can continue to legally have abortions in the state at present example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video new orleans the louisiana supreme court rejected the state attorney general s request to allow immediate enforcement of state laws against most abortions in a 4 to 2 ruling late wednesday the majority said only that the court declined to get involved at this preliminary stage louisiana s new laws included so called triggers to make them take effect as soon as the u s supreme court reversed abortion rights but a state judge in new orleans blocked enforcement until he could hear a lawsuit claiming the law is unclear about medical exceptions and when the ban takes effect we look forward to the preliminary injunction hearing on friday in district court said joanna wright an attorney for the north louisiana abortion clinic that filed the suit along with others attorney general jeff landry tweeted louisiana supreme court is delaying the inevitable our legislature fulfilled their constitutional duties and now the judiciary must it is disappointing that time is not immediate landry s request to lift the hold is premature justice jefferson hughes iii one of the majority wrote in a concurring opinion he said the case should go through district and appellate courts before coming to the state s high court justices william crain and jay mccallum disagreed with hughes and chief justice john weimer stepped aside from the case mccallum wrote that plaintiffs hadn t shown that enforcing the laws before the case could be heard would cause immediate irreparable injury so the hold should be dissolved crain wrote that these circumstances are at least as compelling as others where the state s highest court has stepped in while whether these doctors will suffer irreparable harm by being prohibited from performing abortions is debatable terminating alleged life during the period of the temporary restraining order is irreparable he wrote he also said the justices should step in now to analyze whether the laws were unconstitutionally vague landry s july 1 filing contended that abortion rights advocates who filed the suit are willfully misreading clear terms in the law in an attempt to manufacture arguments that the statutes are unconstitutionally vague abortion rights supporters responded that the district court or a state appeal court needed to fully consider and rule before the case goes to the louisiana supreme court
four days is an optimal time for wireless reflux monitoring to determine which patients can stop taking proton pump inhibitors ppis and which ones need long term antireflux therapy researchers report dr rena yadlapati this first of its kind double blinded clinical trial demonstrates the comparable and in some cases better performance of a simple assessment of daily acid exposure from multiple days of recording compared to other composite or complex assessments write rena yadlapati md with the division of gastroenterology at the university of california san diego in la jolla and her co authors their findings were published online in the american journal of gastroenterology a substantial percentage of patients who have esophageal reflux symptoms do not have gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd and can stop taking ppis wireless reflux monitoring performed while patients are not taking ppis is the gold standard for determining whether a patient has abnormal acid from gerd but the optimal daily acid exposure time aet and the optimal duration of monitoring have not been well studied aiming to fill this knowledge gap yadlapati and her colleagues conducted a single arm double blinded clinical trial over 4 years at two tertiary care centers they enrolled adult patients who had demonstrated an inadequate response to more than 8 weeks treatment with ppis study participants were asked to stop taking their ppi for 3 weeks in order that the investigators could to determine the rate of relapse after ppi use and could establish the study reference standard to discontinue therapy during the 3 week period after having stopped taking ppis for at least a week patients underwent 96 hour wireless reflux monitoring they were then told to continue not taking ppis for an additional 2 weeks they could use over the counter antacids for symptom relief the primary outcome was whether ppis could be successfully discontinued or restarted within 3 weeks of the 132 patients 30 were able to stop taking ppis aet less than 4 0 best discontinuation predictor the team came to two key conclusions they found that acid exposure time of less than 4 0 was the best predictor of when stopping ppis will be effective without worsening symptoms odds ratio 2 9 95 ci 1 4 6 4 comparatively 45 22 of 49 patients with total aet of 4 0 or less discontinued taking ppis vs 22 18 of 83 patients with total aet of more than 4 0 additionally the investigators concluded that 96 hours of monitoring was better than 48 hours or fewer in predicting whether patients could stop taking ppis area under curve for 96 hours 0 63 vs auc for 48 hours 0 57 yadlapati told medscape medical news that the findings should be practice changing you really need to test for 4 days she said she noted that the battery life of the monitor is 96 hours and clinicians commonly only test for 2 days with only 1 2 days of monitoring there is too much variability in how much acid is in the esophagus from one day to another monitoring over a 4 day period gives a clearer picture of acid exposure burden she said her advice if you have a patient with heartburn or chest pain and you think it might be from reflux and they re not responding to a trial of ppi get the reflux monitoring don t wait after 4 days of monitoring if exposure to acid is low they should really be taken off their ppi therapy she said they likely have a condition that requires a different therapy she added it is very consistent with what we have thought to be the case and what some lower quality studies have shown she said it just hadn t been done in a clinical trial with a large patient population and with a full outcome ppi often used inappropriately interest is high both in discontinuing ppi in light of widespread and often inappropriate use and in not starting treatment with ppis for patients who need a different therapy as medscape medical news has reported some studies have linked long term ppi use with intestinal infections pneumonia stomach cancer osteoporosis related bone fractures chronic kidney disease vitamin deficiencies heart attacks strokes dementia and early death dr avin aggarwal avin aggarwal md a gastroenterologist and medical director of banner health s south campus endoscopy services and clinical assistant professor at the university of arizona in tucson told medscape medical news that this study provides the evidence needed to push for practice change he said his center has been using 48 hour reflux monitoring he said anecdotally they had gotten better data with 4 day monitoring but evidence was not directly tied to a measurable outcome such as this study provides with 4 day monitoring we get way more symptoms on the recorder to actually correlate them with reflux or not he said he said he will now push for the 96 hour monitoring in his clinic he added that part of the problem is in assuming patients have gerd and initiating ppis in the first place without a specific diagnosis of acid reflux patients he said are often aware of the long term side effects of ppis and are approaching their physicians to see whether they can discontinue them the data from this study he said will help guide physicians on when it is appropriate to discontinue treatment yadlapati is a consultant for medtronic phathom pharmaceuticals and statlinkmd and receives research support from ironwood pharmaceuticals

the rising fear of a global recession emanating from the big interest rate rises in the us and other smaller countries to beat down inflation and the negative consequences of the ukraine war such as spiking petrol and energy prices has created some odd consequences like what well try the afr telling us to get ready for lower petrol prices and the smh suggesting that it s too early to expect petrol price relief it won t surprise you to learn that oil companies have learnt from banks to be fast increasers but slow price decreasers yesterday we saw all four big banks passing on the full 0 5 interest rate rise following tuesday s cash rate hike from the rba this will bump up the repayments on a 450 000 loan by 119 a month and surprise surprise some bank term deposit rates have also been increased by 0 5 meanwhile yesterday we saw wall street react to recession fears by selling quality miners like bhp to buy recently smashed up tech stocks but why well in a recession affected world interest rates would fall already we ve seen bond markets cut down their yields interest rates that s good news for tech companies whose share prices are crazily dependent on what interest rates are doing of course i m happy to see that my tech stock prices are improving but i m not convinced about the rationality and good sense of the way stock markets value tech companies but it is what it is and i m powerless to change what drives stock markets so i deal with it by sticking to what i believe is great investing advice in fact after looking at the less than impressive year for investing only yesterday shane oliver amp s chief economist and head of investment strategy reminded us of this important lesson some key things for investors to keep bearing in mind are that share pullbacks are healthy and normal selling shares after a fall locks in a loss share pullbacks provide opportunities for investors to buy them more cheaply and to avoid getting thrown off a long term investment strategy it s best to turn down the noise and he said that just after reminding us that shares could fall further this year and it wouldn t surprise me either with company reporting season starting in august the latest inflation number for australia coming out in late july and even the us job numbers on friday could do anything to stocks on wall street think about it on tuesday the us stock market was rattled by recession fears but the impact of lowering interest rates led them to buy tech stocks and we followed suit with tyro up 9 46 eml up 10 51 megaport 14 03 higher and xero putting on 6 65 all in one day of course you can t trust day to day stock price moves but after you take out these ups and downs the key lesson is that eventually stocks on the outer provided they re good companies will be on the inner and their stock prices will rise you just have to be patient and sure they are quality businesses and remember that the double digit fall in the stock market over the financial year was driven by inflation recession and too many interest rate rise fears however these fears won t last forever when they dissipate stock market sentiment will go from excessively negative to excessively positive it always does that but what about the conflict on what will happen to petrol prices the afr s jacob greber told us that west texas intermediate crude fell 10 per cent overnight before steadying just below us100 a barrel citi said brent crude could fall to us65 by the end of the year if the us economy slides into recession if that happens and it s not certain it will that s when petrol prices will really come down and when it comes to economics you have to remember there are lag periods before big changes deliver benefits it often doesn t work that way in the other direction because fear takes over when the possible change looks like it will deliver bad news but if the change promises good news suspicion seems to prevail until the good stuff actually happens it seems to be a psychological thing that we take pessimism more seriously than optimism that pessimism is bound to hover around stock markets for a few months after that i expect we will learn that the recession fears like the inflation fears and the fears about too many interest rate rises will all prove to be excessive stock markets will like these developments which should take share prices higher in the december quarter which should roll into 2023 and lower petrol prices will be a part of that story by the way if we can see the end of the ukraine war then the good news would go on steroids and that should be a nice change for stock prices

slide even further today oil prices nosedived alongside the broader market on tuesday with u s crude dipping to the psychologically important level of 100 bbl as growing recession fears coupled with concerns over weakening demand outweigh a fundamentally tight supply market wti crude tumbled 8 2 to 99 50 bbl the lowest since april 25 and the first close below the 100 bbl level in more than a month at one point wti crumbled more than 10 to trade as low as 97 43 meanwhile front month brent crude fell by even more losing 9 4 to 102 77 bbl its lowest settlement since may 10 a growing number of analysts are expecting that many of the world s leading economies will suffer negative growth in the next few months and this will drag the u s into a recession fawad razaqzada market analyst at city index has told bloomberg in the very near term the dow s p will have a major factor on crude direction as recession fears remain bok financial s dennis kissler has told bloomberg he has also voiced concerns that fuel demand could drop significantly now that the 4th of july holiday is behind us a brawny dollar has also not been helping oil and commodity prices as the leading currency continues to be the world s preferred safe haven during these turbulent times capital flooding into u s dollars which has sent soaring appears to be putting a headwind in front of commodity prices

apa corporation nasdaq apa 7 4 conocophillips nyse cop 6 9 and hess corp nyse hes 6 8 the biggest decliners citi analysts have warned that crude prices could collapse to 65 bbl this year in the event of a recession the experts say that oil prices could plunge even lower to 45 in another year as supplies hold up but a global economic slowdown causes demand to decline luckily for the bulls the bank has placed a mere 10 probability on this outcome still citi clearly belongs to the bear camp and has assigned a 50 likelihood that brent crude will drop to 85 bbl by the end of 2022 limited downside indeed bullish sentiment in the oil markets remains strong despite the latest correction with many analysts saying the downside for crude should remain capped by tight supplies while there are demand concerns given the gloomier macro outlook the market is still expected to be tight for the remainder of the year opec producers have limited room to increase output significantly and so are unable to provide much relief to the market says ing head of commodity strategy warren patterson related china continues to buy record levels of russian crude although the oil price rally appears to have stalled over the past month thus capping further gains for the energy sector a cross section of wall street believes that oil prices still have plenty of upside one such bull is j p morgan chase who last week warned global oil prices could climb to a stratospheric 380 bbl if g7 nations succeed in imposing caps on the price of russian oil and prompt vladimir putin to inflict retaliatory production cuts according to jpm russia s robust fiscal position means the country can afford to slash crude output by as much as 5m bbl day without excessively damaging its economy however such a drastic reduction would be bad news for oil consumers as it would push brent crude prices to 380 bbl the most obvious and likely risk with a price cap is that russia might choose not to participate and instead retaliate by reducing exports it is likely that the government could retaliate by cutting output as a way to inflict pain on the west the tightness of the global oil market is on russia s side

federal reserve officials concluded at their meeting last month that their battle to fight inflation would require deliberately slowing economic growth through restrictive levels of interest rates the fed on wednesday released the minutes of the federal open market committee s june meeting officials at the meeting voted to raise the fed s target rate by three quarters of a percentage point a bigger move than the half point hike a month earlier and the largest increase at a single meeting since november 1994 the minutes show that fed officials anticipated another hike of 50 or 75 basis points would be appropriate at the meeting scheduled to begin on july 26th the minutes note that the economic outlook warranted moving to a restrictive stance of policy and they recognized the possibility that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if elevated inflation pressures were to persist up until a few days before the june meeting fed officials had been signaling with unusual clarity that they planned another 50 basis point hike that shifted rapidly after the consumer price index inflation report for may showed that prices rose 8 6 percent the most in over 40 years the near term inflation outlook had deteriorated since the time of the may meeting the minutes said participants were concerned that the may cpi release indicated that inflation pressures had yet to show signs of abating and a number of them saw it as solidifying the view that inflation would be more persistent than they had previously anticipated the minutes also show that fed officials view fighting inflation in egalitarian or progressive terms believing that inflation hurts low and moderate income americans they commented on the hardship caused by elevated inflation with low and moderate income households especially affected these households had to spend more of their budgets on essentials such as food energy and housing and were less able to bear the rapidly rising costs of these essentials the minutes said that s a stark contrast to the traditional view in which progressives tended to take a dovish view on inflation believing that higher unemployment hurts more than rising prices fed chair jerome powell and other officials have stated the belief that persistently high inflation actually would impede their ability to achieve maximum employment over the longterm on the same day that the department of labor released the cpi report for may the mid june preliminary results from the university of michigan s survey of consumers showed expectations for inflation over the year ahead stood at 5 4 percent a bit above the may level and matching what was recorded in march and april the expectation for inflation over the next five to 10 years jumped from three percent to 3 3 percent those readings especially the jump in longer run expectations worried fed officials the central bank s economists and officials believe that inflation expectations play a crucial role in inflation outcomes effectively becoming a self fulfilling prophecy not all economists agree with the expectations theory of inflation but it nonetheless plays a role in fed policy making with fed officials keenly attuned to keeping inflation expectations anchored to a level consistent with their goals of averaging two percent inflation over time the minutes noted that many participants raised the concern that longer run inflation expectations could be beginning to drift up to levels inconsistent with the 2 percent objective these participants noted that if inflation expectations were to become unanchored it would be more costly to bring inflation back down to the committee s objective in their discussion of risks participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and were closely monitoring developments regarding both inflation and inflation expectations most agreed that risks to inflation were skewed to the upside the minutes said the end of june report from the university of michigan issued weeks after the fed s meeting tempered the inflation expectations reading lowering the one year rate to 5 3 percent and the longer run rate to 3 1 percent financial markets seem convinced that the fed is determined to raise rates at least for the remainder of this year and the start of next year the yield on two year treasuries rose to 2 975 percent a big move from yesterday s closing yield of 2 816 percent the yield on the 10 year treasury however moved upon by a smaller amount to 2 921 leaving the yield curve inverted

sri lanka has run out of fuel and is facing the worst economic crisis in decades a chemical fertilizer ban in 2021 part of an initiative to cut nitrogen waste and implement greener farming practices drastically reduced crop yields and damaged sri lanka s trade balance the decision to overnight shift away from synthetic fertilizers was an absolute disaster economist peter earle told the daily caller news foundation sri lanka is in a last ditch effort to stave off economic collapse after an allegedly climate friendly ban on artificial fertilizers devastated one of the country s largest industries according to experts sri lanka has been wracked with poverty inflation and fuel shortages on a massive scale with the prime minister declaring tuesday that the country has gone bankrupt according to business insider a ban on chemical fertilizers implemented april 2021 in an effort to promote organic farming proved the final straw after a string of missteps decimating sri lanka s primary source of income and forcing it into bankruptcy experts told the daily caller news foundation our economy has faced a complete collapse prime minister ranil wickremesinghe said on june 23 according to cnn the government lifted the fertilizer ban in november 2021 but the damage had already been done peter earle a former financial markets trader and economist at the american institute for economic research told thedcnf the decision to overnight shift away from synthetic fertilizers was an absolute disaster he said a 2019 bombing and covid 19 lockdowns crushed tourism in sri lanka and lead to a dearth of foreign exchange reserves putting a strain on imports of fuel and other necessities according to data from the cia world factbook but a loss of foreign currency only set the stage for catastrophe according to earle when the fertilizer ban devastated sri lanka s domestic crops agriculture is built not just on science but it s built on decades and centuries of trial and error and hard won experience said earle there s a certain degree of know how in markets and in certain areas where the government should defer to the expertise of people in markets people who are practitioners rather than letting bureaucrats rule earle s comments accorded with those of breakthrough institute founder and leading climate policy thinker ted nordhaus who argued that synthetic fertilizers represent the most economically and environmentally efficient way to sustain sri lanka s demanding agricultural sector in an essay from march the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs estimated in the report that crop production for the 2021 2022 season decreased by 40 to 50 and so far farmers have only utilized a quarter of the available land for the upcoming season according to a report dated june 9 environment minister mahinda amaweera declared a government initiative to save the earth from our own geoengineering misuse greed and selfishness in 2020 ahead of a forum on halving nitrogen waste the move was part of sri lanka s effort to pursue environmental social and governance esg goals the country signed onto a green finance taxonomy with the international finance corporation in may that included a commitment to organic fertilizers if you want to go organic you have to cut down more forests to have enough production because fertilizer use enhances crop production vijay jayaraj a research associate at the co2 coalition explained to thedcnf and if you re cutting down fertilizers then it means that you need more land to produce enough crops to even meet the domestic demand sri lanka gets a significant portion of its revenues from the tourism industry and nearly a third of sri lanka s population is involved in the agricultural industry according to the world factbook inflation in sri lanka stood at 54 6 in june according to trading economics with food prices rising 80 1 and transportation 128 since may reuters reported half a million people have sunk into poverty as of early 2022 the guardian reported to the extent that any part of this organic agriculture decision was made based upon some version of green or green from the ideologies this is just the first of many unintended consequences we ve seen from these kinds of policies said earle the sri lankan government restricted supplies and activities to only those deemed essential on june 28 in the face of fuel shortages until new shipments arrive in two weeks cnn reported shipments for which energy minister kanchana wijesekera said the government cannot afford to pay according to the guardian wijesekera warned monday that the country had less than a day s worth of fuel left under normal demand related is the global climate agenda dead g7 turns to fossil fuels amid energy crisis protesters have been flooding the streets for months demanding the officials reform the government or step down punishment for historic bank deficits import shortages and greed amongst those in power according to reuters meanwhile indian and china have vied to bail out sri lanka and deprive one another of an opportunity to expand its global influence the associated press reported the international monetary fund visited sri lanka from june 20 30 ending with constructive and productive discussions on reform and loans including an extended fund facility arrangement to be worked out in detail over the coming weeks according to a press release sri lanka has an almost perfect esg score at 98 1 tied with tajikistan according to data from world economics for comparison sweden sits at 96 1 and the united states at 50 7 sri lanka can recover from the economic collapse but it will take severe austerity measures and possibly switching to an alternative currency for domestic use to cap inflation according to earle the sri lankan ministries of agriculture and environment did not respond to thedcnf s requests for comments all content created by the

japan has been stuck in a low growth low inflation and at times deflationary environment for many years the boj has reiterated its commitment to avoiding deflation which remains the dominant policy hurdle in japan the central bank expects consumer price rises to decelerate in the medium term once the influence of energy prices on the headline figure begins to wane should this assessment prove misguided and the boj be forced to shift its policy stance this could send a ripple effect through global markets japan s central bank is nearing an inflection point it comes as policymakers around the world scramble to tighten monetary policy in an effort to rein in record high inflation the swiss national bank was one of the latest major central banks to get in on the act surprising markets last month by delivering its first interest rate hike in 15 years the snb leapt out of the blocks with a 50 basis point increase and the shock move sent the swiss franc soaring to its strongest level against the euro for almost two months get south florida local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc south florida newsletters japan however has sought to remain loose and prioritize yield curve control the world s third largest economy has been stuck in a low growth low inflation and at times deflationary environment for many years meaning the bank of japan has kept policy accommodative in a bid to stimulate the country s sluggish economy the central bank was on track to purchase around 15 trillion japanese yen 110 billion of government debt in june rendering it the only major central bank still embarking on a significant asset purchase program headline cpi is running just above the 2 target in japan while core inflation sits at 0 8 so the central bank does not face the same inflationary pressure as many counterparts in the west the boj has reiterated its commitment to avoiding deflation which remains the dominant policy hurdle in japan the central bank expects consumer price rises to decelerate in the medium term once the influence of energy prices on the headline figure begins to wane but should this assessment prove misguided and the boj be forced to hike interest rates either as a result of inflation or upward pressure from other monetary tightening moves around the world this could send a ripple effect through global markets according to neil shearing group chief economist at capital economics much depends on the openness of the country s capital account its balance of payments and the extent to which flows are buffeted by changes in interest rates elsewhere japan is open to global capital flows and so as bond yields in other countries have moved up the boj has found that its commitment to a policy of yield curve control keeping 10 year jgb japanese government bond yields within a 25 basis point band either side of zero has been tested by global investors shearing said in a note monday yield curve control tested the bank of japan s self imposed bond yield ceiling helps to hold down borrowing costs throughout the economy in principle supporting growth the recent sell off in global bond markets has pushed the 10 year jgb yield right to the upper limit of the boj s range forcing it to purchase increasing amounts of government debt to maintain its target by some measures if it carried on buying at this month s pace it would own the entire market of outstanding jgbs within a year shearing said the bank of japan has continued to defend its yield target even as the global momentum pushes toward higher rates and its divergence has driven the japanese yen sharply downward shearing pointed out that while the people s bank of china imposes capital controls to retain influence over its currency and monetary policy japan s relatively open capital account means it cannot control the yen while maintaining sovereignty over monetary policy in essence the bank of japan can prop up the bond yield peg by buying boundless quantities of bonds sending the yen into a downward spiral or it can shield the currency against a destabilizing depreciation but it cannot manage both simultaneously capital economics expects japan to give some ground in its yield curve control by widening the target range which could then see investors testing its resolve to hold the line at the new range against a backdrop of rising rates around the world this could further weaken the yen of course a markedly weaker currency might be a positive development for an economy struggling to emerge from three decades of deflation but large and rapid currency moves can be destabilizing shearing said at some point something gives either because balance sheets start to come under strain or because imported inflation becomes a problem since deflation generally leads companies and consumers to delay investments and purchases the bank of japan has been working for years to return inflation to its 2 target to reignite its productive capacity and growth rate violent adjustment the boj s persistent quantitative easing could also have a number of significant consequences for both domestic and global markets by capping the increase in long duration interest rates the central bank risks pushing up inflation beyond its initial targets according to charles henry monchau chief investment officer at syz bank monchau noted that the boj buying bonds implies it would need to lend the equivalent amount further exacerbating price rises the divergence in yields compared to other developed countries which are tightening monetary policy weakens the yen meanwhile the boj keeping bond yields artificially low by purchasing so many jgbs prevents it from raising interest rates the main method of containing higher inflation cumulatively he suggested that these dynamics could create conditions for inflation to suddenly spiral out of control implying an inexorable and violent adjustment in the bond market the maintenance of loose policy at all costs could also create risks on the international stage the weakening of the yen could lead to a currency war in asia which could in turn fuel rising inflation in neighbouring countries increase the cost of servicing their dollar denominated debts and so increase the risks of default by less creditworthy countries monchau told cnbc on tuesday another international consequence with even greater ramifications is the risk of a sudden unwinding of the carry trade the carry trade is a strategy in which investors borrow from a low interest rate currency to finance the purchase of a higher yielding currency capturing the difference between the rates monchau argued that with the boj obliged to lend the equivalent amount of the bonds it buys this market context of access to very low rate financing in a constantly depreciating currency favors the use of carry trades for example a long brazilian real short yen strategy has already generated gains of 35 this year but the risk of this type of strategy is a sudden reversal of the trend in place monchau explained indeed if the yen strengthens and or if jgb yields rise due to the boj abandoning the ycc there is a risk of a sudden and massive unwinding of carry trades with a cascade liquidation of risky assets this would facilitate the panic selling of stocks forced selling of the u s dollar and a spike in u s bond yields due to the rise in jgb yields he suggested the type of sudden financial accident that could worsen the pain for risky assets and heighten the risk of recession the bleak scenario described above is far from a certainty first the imbalances created by the japanese authorities over indebtedness and manipulation of the bond market have been pointed out for many years now without ever leading to a major accident monchau noted however the current situation in jgbs in a context of high market volatility is perilous to say the least and any market stress due to the end of the qe in japan may have another consequence for international financial markets the loss of confidence in major central banks monetary policies

most the impact of eleven years of conflict has left syria s health system struggling to cope across the country syrian communities are now without sufficient functional health facilities essential medical supplies or qualified personnel when cross border access was cut off to northeast syria in january 2020 the negative impact on people s daily lives was immediate millions now stand to lose access to healthcare when they need it most for syrians living in the northwest of the country failing to reauthorize the only remaining border crossing could represent the biggest attack on healthcare since the humanitarian crisis began that is why irc is unequivocal in our call for the un security council to put principles above politics the un s cross border mechanism must be reauthorized for 12 months to ensure more lives are not needlessly lost end notes to editors we have spokespeople in the region available to do interviews the new irc study among communities in northwest syria conducted between march and april this year showed a significant increase in the number of people reporting challenges when accessing health services in comparison with the same period last year almost all women interviewed said that medicines were not available a 50 increase from last year whereas for men the numbers grew 30 with 90 of men reporting lack of medicines as a barrier when accessing health services further consequences of non renewal will include significant disruption to life saving health services these include the treatment for chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension mental health and psychosocial support services treatment of malnutrition for children and sexual and reproductive healthcare for women and girls the irc and its partners in northwest syria reached over 474 000 patients in 2021 through 20 health facilities 2 hospitals including 1 covid isolation hospital 4 mobile clinics 13 primary health care centers and 1 mental health center additionally we have an ambulatory system that contains 10 ambulances 6 of which are dedicated to the covid 19 response transporting suspected cases to testing facilities and then transferring them

photo credit dragon images shutterstock the u s economy today has no lack of opportunities for architects an ongoing shortage of housing stock contributed to the dramatic spike in housing prices over the last two years illustrating a need for professionals who can help make design and construction more affordable and efficient the threat of climate change has increased interest in designers with expertise in energy efficiency sustainability and resilience and the landmark bipartisan infrastructure law passed in 2021 will pour billions of dollars into projects requiring the services of architects engineers and other design professionals while demand for architects services appears likely to remain high and even grow in coming years the future of overall employment in the field is more uncertain the bureau of labor statistics projects 3 growth in employment for architects by 2030 a rate slower than the average for all occupations while retirements and transitions to different industries will continue to create job openings improved software and technologies have made architects more productive this means that fewer architects will be needed to handle similar volumes of work recent employment data has already shown signs of potential decline in the field like many other construction related occupations total employment for architects fell sharply when the housing bubble burst and the great recession began from 2008 to 2012 the number of architects in the u s declined by more than a quarter a rate of employment loss far greater than the economy as a whole experienced but even after recovering to near pre recession levels in 2019 total employment for architects has remained down over the past two years strong educational and licensure requirements for practitioners also constrains the supply of new architects to practice as an architect one must usually obtain a bachelor s or master s degree in the field complete a multi year internship pass a licensing exam and meet continuing education requirements but because of the specialized knowledge and training required to practice in the field architects tend to be well compensated compared to other occupations from 2001 to 2020 the median wage for an architect was more than double the median wage for all occupations though this gap narrowed slightly in 2021 the overall median wage for an architect today sits at 80 180 however architects earning potential can vary significantly between locations in the u s when adjusted for cost of living the typical salary for an architect is highest in arizona where the median adjusted wage is 97 153 per year the list of best paying states also includes alaska massachusetts california and new york these top states also host many of the best paying cities for architects locations like phoenix boston the bay area and new york city are fast growing areas that provide plentiful opportunities for architects median wages in these locations far

prime minister jacinda ardern has underlined new zealand s commitment to maintaining truly independent foreign policy in a world that s bloody messy delivering a speech at an event hosted by the lowy institute a prestigious sydney based foreign affairs think tank ardern discussed how new zealand is managing its various economic and geopolitical relationships in her speech she had a few key messages saying while new zealand will stand in support of ukraine in the face of illegal and unjustifiable invasion from russia fundamentally this is russia s war let us not otherwise characterise this as a war of the west vs russia or democracy vs autocracy it is not ardern said nor should we naturally assume it is a demonstration of the inevitable trajectory in other areas of geostrategic contest she said likely referring to china taking a more aggressive approach towards foreign affairs in the wake of the tensions we see rising including in our indo pacific region diplomacy must become the strongest tool and de escalation the loudest call we won t succeed however if those parties we seek to engage with are increasingly isolated and the region we inhabit becomes increasingly divided and polarised we must not allow the risk of a self fulfilling prophecy to become an inevitable outcome for our region ardern said this is one of the reasons new zealand is intensifying its engagement with the pacific she said economic architecture would build resilience in the region she stressed the pacific islands forum which will in coming days see leaders from across the pacific meet is the vehicle for addressing regional challenge we see local security challenges being resolved locally with pacific islands forum members security being addressed first and foremost by the forum family ardern said ardern said it would be wrong to characterise china s engagement in the pacific as new it would also be wrong to position the pacific in such a way that they have to pick sides these are democratic nations with their own sovereign right to determine their foreign policy engagements priorities should be set by the pacific they should be free from coercion coming back to russia s invasion of ukraine ardern said in the face of global conflict and tension we continue to position ourselves based on the principle of upholding the rules based order through multilateral institutions and when seeking solutions to issues be it war or dispute new zealand will turn to these same institutions to act as mediator and when necessary as judge however she noted the united nations has failed to appropriately respond to the war in ukraine because of the position taken by russia in the security council here when the system fails we seek partnerships and approaches based on the second principle of our independent foreign policy our values ardern said a conviction that we have a moral responsibility to do our part to maintain the rules based order that regardless of whether a collective approach is possible maintaining the basic values of human rights gender equality state sovereignty climate action that falls on each of us to defend and uphold turning to the pacific ardern said climate change must also be a foreign policy priority while we all have a concern and rightly so about any moves towards militarisation of our region that must surely be matched by a concern for those who experience the violence of climate change ardern noted new zealand investment in climate change mitigation in the pacific our home and that makes you our cousins ardern told the australian audience but more importantly over many years it has made you our friend you are our second largest trading partner you are our only formal ally you are our largest market for foreign direct investment forty per cent of arrivals into new zealand in 2019 were from australia it s lucky we like you so much we share our people our problems and our solutions in fact when we look to our principles co operation values and place we naturally find you within them we won t always agree and nor should we but it s true that in the messy world we live friendship matters ardern concluded in this messy world still full of opportunities and optimism i hope you will find us both on our own terms pulling in the same direction addressing the media following her speech ardern said comments she made about not isolating china were not aimed at any country in particular but seeking stability in the region was about keeping dialogue open she said of her comments that countries such as china had a role to play in the ukraine war we seek everyone to take a firm position on that and china was on the security council you will have seen some reference the relationship between china and russia but china had also highlighted issues about territorial integrity and she called on china to take a firm position individual nations will take their own position we will raise consistently with anyone our position on ukraine asked if china could be doing more she said as a member of the security council there is a responsibility there and new zealand had voiced that to china there are a range of reasons why nations regardless of their ideology should be concerned about the war in europe when asked about tightening new zealand s covid 19 restrictions ardern said it was not unexpected that there was another wave she said other countries had also had surges that is not for a moment to be dismissive or trivialise it however she said many other countries did not use isolation periods or mask use which did have an impact on the spread while reiterating her earlier comments that the advice was that gathering limits would not necessarily make much difference on her upcoming meeting with anthony albanese she said her meeting tomorrow would be an extension of the earlier discussions they had but would include other ministers so progress was possible however she was not expecting instant results on boris johnson she said i d just like to reiterate this is in no way related to my recent visit ardern recently met johnson in london she said the current situation unravelling around johnson s position was a domestic issue for the uk and she did not expect it to have ramifications for the relationship between the two countries the last major speech by a new zealand politician at the nonpartisan international policy group was in 2018 when then foreign minister winston peters outlined the pacific reset approach peters spoke then of building resilience in the pacific and moving away from donor recipient interaction and into genuine mature political partnerships current foreign minister nanaia mahuta has built on this approach and ardern has also spoken at length about respecting and encouraging the autonomy of pacific nations as a core part of new zealand s relations the backdrop to her speech includes rising geopolitical tensions in the pacific sparked by a security arrangement between the solomon islands and china at the start of the year tensions have been further stoked as china toured the region seeking to drum up support for a broader security and trade agreement which was ultimately turned down by pacific countries with the caveat that it would be discussed at the pacific islands forum the united states has also entered the fray conducting its own tour and seeking closer security ties with new zealand and allies including the establishment of the partners in the blue pacific ardern s comments today will set the scene for the pacific islands forum leaders meetings in fiji next week where issues around china and climate change will really be thrashed out ardern will also talk to other australian government ministers as a part of the australia new zealand leadership forum and has a formal bilateral meeting with prime minister anthony albanese

stock image photo by eternalcreative istock getty images plus st george news contributed content antioxidants are a buzzword in health circles that sometimes deliver empty promises but when it comes to autoimmune hashimoto s hypothyroidism one antioxidant is a must have in your protocol kit glutathione glutathione is considered the body s master antioxidant and you need it to dampen autoimmune disease and lower your risk of developing new autoimmune diseases glutathione protects cells from damage supports general detoxification acts as a natural chelator for toxic heavy metals and environmental toxins and supports healthy immune system function glutathione works by protect energy producing factories inside cells called mitochondria antioxidants are molecules that inhibit other molecules from going through oxidation a chemical reaction that produces toxins called free radicals free radicals are unstable molecules that occur naturally but also enter our bodies through toxins in food air water and even medications left unchecked free radicals damage cells destabilize the immune system and contribute to the development of serious health problems glutathione is a compound made by the body that protects cells and tissues from damage by free radicals while the body makes glutathione it can also be supplemented in absorbable forms or via nutrients that boost glutathione production normally our bodies should make enough glutathione to protect us however it s common for glutathione to drop too low in our modern world we cope with thousands of toxic chemicals in our daily environment our food and our water even if we lead a very clean non toxic life sugary diets full of processed foods food intolerances leaky gut and undiagnosed infections are other examples of things that can deplete glutathione due to the chronic inflammatory assaults on the cells glutathione levels also decrease as we age and our need for supplemental glutathione increases significantly when glutathione production drops you are more vulnerable to developing autoimmune disease chronic pain chemical sensitivities leaky gut and other immune related disorders in fact glutathione depletion is linked with a number of disease states and groups including the following aging athletic overtraining major injuries and trauma patients with wasting diseases such as hiv and aids lung cancer gut based diseases such as crohn s and ulcerative colitis chronic fatigue syndrome alcoholism and fatty liver disease diabetes and low glucose tolerance cancer one of the most important things you can do to improve glutathione status is to remove or mitigate stressors that deplete glutathione these may include lack of sleep smoking food intolerances diets high in sugars and processed foods excess alcohol intake and hormone or immune imbalances if you have hashimoto s this typically also means going on a gluten free diet as many studies show a connection between hashimoto s and a gluten intolerance or celiac disease additionally research shows a link between poor glutathione status and autoimmune hashimoto s hypothyroidism recycle glutathione to manage hashimoto s hypothyroidism one of the most effective approaches to dampen autoimmune related inflammation is to support your body s ability to recycle glutathione recycling glutathione means your body takes existing glutathione the body has already used in self defense and rebuilds it so it can work again to protect the body for glutathione to be recycled it must be reduced there are two main forms of glutathione in the body reduced glutathione and oxidized glutathione when there is sufficient reduced glutathione in the cells they sacrifice themselves to free radicals to protect cellular mitochondria an enzyme called glutathione peroxidase then sparks the conversion of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione a free radical itself if there is sufficient glutathione in the cell the newly unstable oxidized glutathione pairs with available glutathione with the help of an enzyme called glutathione reductase this sends it back to reduced glutathione status and ready to return to service protecting cells glutathione recycling helps balance immune function and shield thyroid tissue from inflammation and autoimmune attacks glutathione also helps repair damaged tissues such as in the case of leaky gut supplementing to increase glutathione levels the redriver clinical research observations between all of our clinics we see several hundred patients each day which puts us at an unparalleled advantage when it comes to finding the best support for patients below is an overview of what s available to boost glutathione levels and what we have seen work the best for our patients glutathione recycling is a good place to start increasing glutathione activity inside cells a variety of nutritional and botanical compounds have been shown to support glutathione recycling including the following n acetyl cysteine which quickly metabolizes into intracellular glutathione l glutamine which helps generate glutathione alpha lipoic acid which recycles and extends the life spans of vitamin c glutathione and coenzyme q10 all of which are needed for glutathione recycling selenium a cofactor for the enzyme glutathione peroxidase which converts reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione to protect cells milk thistle which significantly increases glutathione and improves the ratios of reduced and oxidized glutathione gotu kola which increases glutathione peroxidase and glutathione in general cordyceps which supports glutathione synthesis activates the glutathione enzyme cycle taken together these botanicals and compounds activate the glutathione peroxidase and reductase enzymes to promote a healthy glutathione recycling system i use a stand alone product to support glutathione recycling containing all of these ingredients called glutathione recycler by apex energetics this product was developed by dr datis kharrazian who pioneered our modern understanding of hashimoto s and glutathione we have found this product works best when used in conjunction with a liposomal glutathione blend which i discuss below liposomal glutathione we re very impressed with patients results from a liquid liposomal glutathione blend called trizomal glutathione by apex energetics also formulated by kharrazian trizomal glutathione provides both bioactive glutathione and the glutathione precursor n acetyl cysteine meaning it s for comprehensive glutathione support although dosages vary depending on the degree of inflammation we generally start people at 10 milliliters three times a day to calm inflammation autoimmune flares and neurodegeneration symptoms memory loss brain fog fatigue then people can generally move to a maintenance dose of 5 milliliters three times a day or whichever dose works best to keep their inflammation dampened in addition to glutathione recycler we also recommend ample vitamin d and two anti inflammatory products called resvero active and turmero active which are liposomal resveratrol and turmeric formulas respectively for people over 60 the need for glutathione increases significantly we recommend daily maintenance doses of both trizomal glutathione and glutathione recycler it s worth noting that glutathione has a profound protective effect on the brain and helps slow neurodegeneration dampen brain inflammation and lower the risk of neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer s and parkinson s we have seen outstanding results using glutathione recycler in combination with trizomal glutathione especially compared to other glutathione supplements on the market and we have tried quite a few that said here are some other ways to get glutathione first taking straight glutathione orally is not that effective because it doesn t make it past the digestive tract into the bloodstream therefore choose other forms of glutathione your body can absorb the following are absorbable forms of glutathione available s acetyl glutathione is probably the most accessible form of glutathione and comes in capsules that the intestinal tract can efficiently absorb it can be helpful in managing hashimoto s liposomal cream is used in localized areas for inflammation such as over the thyroid i use oxicell by apex energetics oxicell by apex energetics iv drips are effective but expensive and difficult to access other less traditional but effective routes of delivery you can use at home include glutathione suppositories and glutathione nebulizers diy glutathione y ou can also make your own glutathione formula at home affordably although i cannot attest to how effective it is if you search diy glutathione on the internet you may find some instructions contact

photo credit alamy stock photo photo credit artazum shutterstock despite many economic experts worst fears early in the covid 19 pandemic state and local government budgets have proven resilient over the last two years with much of the economy shut down or hobbled as a result of the pandemic forecasters initially worried that states and localities would collect substantially lower amounts of sales and income tax and face major budget shortfalls as a result but behind falling unemployment rising wages and strong consumer spending income and sales taxes have produced stronger than expected revenues since the initial shock of the pandemic one factor that has helped protect state and especially local revenues over this period is property taxes which are taxes levied on real property like land and buildings or certain forms of personal property property taxes tend to be more stable over time because property values are less susceptible to economic volatility than income and sales tax depending on when taxes are assessed it could take years for any significant changes in property values to become apparent in a government s tax collections this certainly helped keep property tax revenues steady during the pandemic and for some communities collections could potentially grow in coming years due to the skyrocketing values of residential real estate advertisement article continues below this ad property taxes stability could help continue to protect state and local budgets if the u s is headed toward a recession in the near future property tax collections represent 16 6 of state and local general tax revenues which makes it the largest form of own source revenue generated by states and localities ahead of individual income 12 9 and general sales taxes 12 5 and among all revenue sources property tax trails only intergovernmental funds 22 which comprises funds transferred from one government to another most frequently federal to state or local through grants loans and other agreements however the overall mix of state and local revenue sources looks different across the u s each state and local government offers a unique collection of revenue sources that weights income sales property and other taxes differently for example nine states have no state income tax while five have no state sales tax others have caps on property tax rates or restrictions around how property valuations are conducted that limit the amount of revenue from property taxes this means that individuals specific tax burdens will look different depending on what state and local tax laws are in place where they live advertisement article continues below this ad property tax collections across the states show these differences in action at the low end only 6 9 of general tax revenue collected in alabama comes from property tax while at the high end property tax is 36 5 of general tax revenue in new hampshire new hampshire stands out in part because the state has neither an income nor a sales tax so many services are funded at the local level through property taxes many of the other locations highly dependent on property taxes are nearby northeastern states including

program protecting multiemployer pension plans at max s hayes high school in cleveland ohio july 6 2022 a lot of politicians like to talk about how they re going to do something about it biden said well i m here today to say we ve done something about it the roughly 200 pension plans receiving assistance faced possible insolvency without government aid and without the full benefits workers and retirees could struggle to pay for housing food and other essentials the financial support should help keep the pension funds solvent for roughly 30 years until 2051 that s important several retirees said bill devito who introduced biden was an iron worker for almost 50 years before retiring a decade ago when his pension was cut 40 in 2017 he said it was devastating the thing of it is we had a lot of politicians over the years saying hey we ll try to help you we ll do everything we can and nobody s ever done anything for us until joe biden come along said devito 73 he said that other ohio

benefit guaranty corporation pbgc in 2014 congress passed the multiemployer pension reform act that allowed plans for the first time to cut workers and retirees benefits in order to ensure that pensions projected to run out of money remained solvent the american rescue plan passed in march 2021 included a special finance assistance program that allows struggling multiemployer pension plans to apply to the pbgc for assistance the final rule being unveiled by the biden administration is designed to make it easier for the pensions investments to receive a higher rate of return the effort
