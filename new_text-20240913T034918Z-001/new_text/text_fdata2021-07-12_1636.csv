the covid 19 crisis has increased public debt to unprecedented levels yet falling demand and lower commodity prices have reduced inflation rates globally but in recent months inflationary pressures have re emerged driven by base effects supply bottlenecks and the recovery in demand in some cases boosted by fiscal stimuli ball et al 2021 while many advanced economies maintain a very accommodative policy stance some central banks in emerging market economies are reversing the interest rates cuts of last year to bring inflation back on target the question is how effective these moves will be standard open economy models predict that a higher interest rate will lift the exchange rate a stronger currency in turn will reduce import prices and help to bring down domestic inflation for emerging market economies however the empirical evidence does not support this prediction kohlscheen 2014 hnatkovska et al 2016 while most of the research has focused on the unconditional response of the exchange rate in a recent paper alberola et al 2021 we emphasise its contingent behaviour our results suggest that the exchange rate responds to domestic policy shocks in a state contingent way depending on the backing of government bonds or the lack thereof in a ricardian fiscal regime when debt is fully backed by future fiscal surpluses monetary tightening strengthens the exchange rate in a non ricardian regime by contrast the fiscal authority cannot credibly commit to levy taxes for an amount equal to the outstanding value of its obligation in this case an increase in the policy rate leads to a depreciation of the currency evidence from brazil if we wish to test the link between the exchange rate monetary policy and the fiscal regime brazil makes a good case study thanks to the combination of a flexible exchange rate regime its independent central bank and a history of recurrent debt crises in the 1980s fiscal profligacy led to recurrent debt crises leading the brazilian government to default four times on its domestic and or foreign debt since the mid 1990s brazil has significantly improved its monetary and fiscal policies adopting an inflation targeting framework with a flexible exchange rate regime nevertheless fiscal concerns resurface from time to time figure 1 shows the evolution of fiscal variables the exchange rate and sovereign credit risk since 2001 two episodes reflect the reawakening of fiscal concerns the run up to the 2002 general election and the period of economic weakness and political turbulence between 2012 and 2015 while differing in their duration and severity 1 the two episodes had some features in common fiscal fundamentals were weak and market participants doubted whether fiscal policy could be sustainable i e it was non ricardian figure 1 episodes of fiscal turbulence in brazil did the exchange rate react differently to monetary policy during those periods we look at daily movements of the brazilian real around monetary policy decisions between 2001 and 2017 and their covariance with monetary policy surprises we compute monetary surprises as the difference between the announced selic target rate the policy rate and its expected value the day before the announcement as surveyed among professional forecasters the scatter plot in the left hand panel of figure 2 shows that there is no clear relationship between exchange rate changes and monetary policy shocks across the whole sample but once we treat the periods of fiscal distress separately a different picture emerges simple regressions show that positive interest rate surprises lift the exchange rate in normal times but depress it during the periods of fiscal distress both results are statistically significant we corroborate these findings with a reverse exercise rather than determining the regime a priori we assume that it is unobservable and evolves according to a two state markov chain the estimation procedure determines the likelihood of the two regimes based on the changes in the exchange rate to monetary shocks the right hand panel of figure 2 plots the probability of the regime state 2 in which the covariance between exchange rate changes and monetary policy surprises is positive as we observe during non ricardian fiscal regimes consistent with our narrative identification the probability is high in 2002 and between 2012 and 2015 this result supports our hypothesis that changes in the fiscal regime explain the differing responses of the exchange rate to monetary policy shocks figure 2 exchange rate response to monetary policy shocks depends on the fiscal regime sovereign risk and the exchange rate to rationalise these findings and building on the idea of blanchard 2004 we develop a model in which sovereign risk drives exchange rate movements while fiscal policy switches between a ricardian and non ricardian regime in the ricardian regime an increase in the domestic policy rate makes the local currency sovereign bond more attractive vis Ã  vis foreign assets increasing its demand and lifting the exchange rate conversely in the non ricardian regime an increase in the policy rate makes the bond less attractive reducing demand for it and weakening the domestic currency this occurs because the government does not adjust the primary surplus to offset the higher debt servicing cost as a result sovereign risk increases the model s key feature is that foreign investors fear they will be subject to higher haircuts than domestic investors if sovereign debt is restructured there are different reasons why non residents may expect to suffer higher losses plain discrimination the imposition of capital controls or the use of sweeteners that are particularly attractive to domestic investors see gelpern and setser 2004 and sturzenegger and zettelmeyer 2008 for examples sovereigns might attempt to treat residents more favourably in order to soften the impact of the restructuring on the domestic economy or to avoid measures that domestic constituents will find unpalatable erce 2013 if the expected losses for domestic and foreign investors are different the premia investors will demand for holding the debt will differ too when sovereign risk rises the increase in the local currency bond yield will not suffice to compensate foreign investors the resulting fall in demand weakens the exchange rate giving rise to an expected appreciation that increases the expected return for foreign investors 2 this mechanism is consistent with the recent empirical evidence on the link between currency premia and sovereign risk della corte et al 2021 concluding remarks given the critical importance of the exchange rate for emerging market economies internal and external stability bis 2019 understanding its response to domestic policies is fundamental for policymakers for all the progress made during the last decades our work underlines the importance of fiscal sustainability for monetary policy to operate effectively in the post pandemic context where fiscal fundamentals have worsened and inflationary concerns are on the rise a virtuous interaction between monetary and

by cara bayles the conservatorship of pop star britney spears has drawn fresh criticism to incapacity a designation that s part medical diagnosis part legal determination and can strip people of their rights to make their own financial and health care decisions frederic j brown afp via getty images abusing the system by the numbers statistics on financial abuse by guardians are hard to come by but over the past four years a statewide investigation alliance among florida s clerks of courts has looked into abuses in 41 counties across the state 342 investigations were completed most looking into cases that contained several allegations 191 of the 1 505 allegations lodged were found to be true 8 24m was mishandled in those proven cases 11 guardians had their registrations permanently revoked source clerk of the circuit court comptroller palm beach county florida statistics as of june 14 2021 wanted a good agent the majority of people who financially abuse older adults are family members says pamela teaster director of virginia tech s center for gerontology often because people give power to the wrong agents people make decisions about delegating their power of attorney for some wacky reasons she said maybe don t pick the child who can t manage money don t give it to your girlfriend boyfriend friend of the week because that is not a long standing relationship don t give it to someone because you feel sorry for them she said in guardianship the biggest problem is a lack of oversight by the courts and guardians who try to take on an impossibly large caseload i frankly believe that the exploiting abusive guardians are few or far between that said there s probably one in every state teaster told law360 but even agents and guardians trying to follow the rules can run into a tension between adhering to someone s wishes and best interests generally under a power of attorney an agent has both a fiduciary duty and a duty of loyalty to the grantor which means they must act reasonably and can t engage in self interested transactions syracuse university law professor nina kohn said some state statutes specify that an agent must also make the decisions that the grantor would make she said that raises the question of whether agents must consult the grantor about the grantor s finances that s not typically required by statute but kohn thinks it ought to be common practice it may be inconsistent with fiduciary duty not to consult with the principal she said if you think about the underlying duty of what it means to use proper care and what it means to behave in a loyal manner that might require you to consult even if the state statute doesn t say so on its face advocates say that level of input should be the standard for guardianship reform as well legislation from the uniform law center would set the standard of substituted decision making ben orzeske chief counsel at the uniform law center said if a man with dementia has always played at monthly poker night with his friends and now tends to lose money it might not be a fiscally sound decision to keep playing but it might be worth it to him to keep up the tradition traditionally guardians were supposed to make decisions for the person under guardianship based on what s in their best interest he said the substituted judgement standard says instead you make the decision that the person would do for themselves if they were able to do so the old best interest standard is kind of paternalistic slow support for reforms since it was first proposed in 2006 the uniform law center s power of attorney act has been adopted in 29 states and legislation is pending in washington d c and massachusetts an act to reform state guardianship systems has not caught on as quickly since it was promulgated in 2017 only two states washington and maine have adopted the uniform bill in its entirety power of attorney act enacted in 2007 2021 introduced in 2021 source the uniform law center in the summer of 2018 four years into his guardianship doug keegan kept breaking into his own house he walked eight miles from his senior living facility to retrieve his bicycle from his orlando home he rode back to get suits to wear to his court hearings he was also trying he told law360 to reestablish his residency there at first he smashed the back window easily and climbed in he said but his guardian kept fixing it with thicker glass so he used a brick then he javelined the window with a 10 foot pole he said he broke in six times according to court records some of these break ins ended with him being detained under the baker act a florida law allowing for temporary detention of people with mental illness he told law360 he d be placed in a psych ward for about a week and during one of those stays his guardian sold his house keegan who had struggled with alcoholism for decades was put into guardianship at the age of 57 his brother had introduced him to a guardianship attorney who filed a petition of incapacity in probate court in october 2014 claiming keegan s memory and ability to care for himself were slipping and noting that in 2012 keegan drank so much his kidneys shut down and he was in a medically induced coma for 30 days keegan suspects his brother was after his money and was disappointed when keegan married in september 2014 keegan s wife had immigrated to the united states from kenya and he suspects his family s intervention they also claimed his wife was financially exploiting him was fueled by racial bigotry when keegan s family introduced him to the guardianship attorney dean turman who did not respond to a request for comment keegan says he didn t realize what they had in mind this guy turman shows up at my house he really came there targeting guardianship and what he really wanted was access to all my financial data and my health records keegan told law360 my brother and my mother were begging me to have a lawyer protect my assets i thought it was a waste but i was just trying to keep them from whining so much i didn t see any harm i said well what s the worst that s going to happen for seven years keegan fought the plenary guardianship that stripped him of his rights to make his own health care and finance decisions arguing he d been fraudulently declared incapacitated in april after an eighth doctor s examination he was found capable of managing his own affairs but in the interim about 300 000 of his savings were spent on attorney and guardianship fees according to court filings they ve robbed years of my life they ve stolen my house my car chased my wife away broke up my marriage they ve stolen so much from me he said keegan s entire case hinged on incapacity a legal finding that in florida is based on the assessment of three examiners one of whom must be a doctor incapacity can be based on a mental health assessment as was the case with britney spears conservatorship or a diagnosis of a degenerative disease like alzheimer s as was true of disgraced trial lawyer tom girardi a medical professional can make the assessment in the span of an hour even though people s functionality can wax and wane depending on medication support or even the time of day but the effects of a finding of incapacity can be long lasting it can mean that a person loses control over their own financial and health care decisions it can also prevent someone from driving working voting marrying who they wish or pursuing their interests in court and the standard for stripping a person of those rights is vague according to dr sam sugar an internal medicine specialist who served as a probate court medical examiner for several years and is the founder of americans against abusive probate guardianship the term incapacity does not exist in the medical literature he told law360 if you ask me what is the definition of incapacity it s just about anything you want it to be it could be anything from being in an absolute coma to not being able to find your car keys an estimated 1 3 million adults and about 50 billion in assets are under the control of guardians according to the national center for state courts and while exact national statistics on guardianship and abuse are hard to come by older adults are particularly vulnerable to financial exploitation according to data from the national adult maltreatment reporting system a federal abuse tracker for the past several years the elderly have made up the lion s share of financial exploitation reports with adults older than 70 accounting for 66 of such cases in 2019 according to namrs and with the number of adults older than 85 expected to more than double between 2018 and 2040 growing from 6 5 million to 14 4 million that problem could become more widespread financial exploitation is a very real concern for older adults especially older adults with resources according to syracuse university law professor nina kohn a distinguished scholar in elder law at yale law school s solomon center for health law and policy unfortunately sometimes the legal tools meant to protect older adults can be used to exploit them even people who plan ahead can end up in court gerald halpin amassed a fortune as a real estate magnate in the washington d c area and counted former solicitor general ken starr and former vice president dick cheney as his friends he was considered the father of the beltway community of tysons corner but by 2013 he was approaching 90 and began preparing for the inevitable he put several assets into trust accounts he moved to wyoming where there were fewer taxes he signed a power of attorney that would make his wife helen his attorney christopher hawks and his accountant shawn evans hawkins his attorneys in fact should two doctors deem him incapacitated power of attorney a document by which a person can sign over the right to manage personal health care and financial decisions to an agent is considered an important legal tool in life planning it can go into effect immediately or be springing triggered by some event like a finding of incapacity as was the case with halpin a grantor can choose someone they know and trust and put some limitations on their powers according to kohn powers of attorney can be a wonderful tool for promoting self determination for making sure people s affairs will be handled if they need help and for avoiding guardianship she said at the same time they are extraordinarily powerful and can be a helpful tool for unscrupulous agents the problems are so significant some have referred to them as a license to steal in spite of all his planning halpin s assets were the subject of four different lawsuits in his final years and after his death including several alleging undue influence one suit filed in 2016 raised the question of who controlled the majority voting stock for world resources co a metal salvaging operation owned by gerald halpin and his son peter gerald had been diagnosed with dementia and letters from two doctors in 2015 said he was not capable and could not effectively manage his property personal or financial affairs peter sought to get his father off the company s board according to court filings litigation filed by hawks and hawkins suing on behalf of gerald as his attorneys in fact asked a wyoming state court judge to delay a board meeting at which peter was planning to oust his father they said they were representing gerald s desire to sell his wrc stock so he d have cash to pay off debts give money to his children and donate to philanthropic causes gerald s attorneys in fact asked the judge to give him enough time to meet with licensed physicians for purposes of rescinding a prior determination of incapacity in a court filing peter shot back that regardless of the absurd allegations dementia is not reversible eventually two new doctors certified that gerald was competent after all and his attorneys in fact sought to drop the lawsuit halpin had never wanted to be declared incapacitated in the first place according to evidence that came to light in an undue influence lawsuit filed by gerald s out of wedlock daughter stasia reisfield who sued hawks and halpin s son michael claiming they blocked her from receiving real estate her father had promised her according to his agents in fact gerald decided to ask his wife attorney and accountant to assume responsibility for the day to day administration of his affairs and sought the letters of incapacity himself but discovery in the reisfield lawsuit suggested otherwise it revealed that michael hawks and hawkins debated about how to break the news of his incapacity to gerald in an email to hawks the day after he received the second doctor s letter michael said that his father wouldn t accept the doctors opinions and would either change his attorneys in fact under the power of attorney or sue us all in response hawks suggested possible guardianship hawks later testified that he never thought the power of attorney was properly triggered in the first place because neither of the two doctors were board certified in neurology nor was there a court ruling on halpin s incapacity but hawks said in a deposition that gerald had acquiesced to leaving the power of attorney in place court filings allege hawks continued to act as halpin s agent even after two doctors found he was capable of managing his affairs hawks declined to comment on pending litigation during a july 2016 visit with reisfield her husband surreptitiously recorded gerald telling his daughter that he d put most of his assets into trusts and that some of those trusts have hired attorneys to fight me they re now saying i m mentally not capable he said in the recording so they got attorneys and it s between 10 and 15 attorneys battling over stuff that s absolutely nonsense in my mind it s not uncommon for a person to be declared incapacitated and then have their capacity restored according to rick black founder of the center for estate administration reform who was moved to activism after his father in law became mired in the guardianship system nor is it unusual for someone who s done extensive estate planning to end up in court you can do everything right and end up in this system black said anyone can be abused by this system no matter what your estate documents say keegan and his guardian sparred over which doctors would evaluate him keegan told law360 that he was initially declared incapacitated because turman and his first guardian brought in a doctor to completely rig it h kyle fletcher the attorney for one of keegan s subsequent guardians said that keegan s attorney leslie ferderigos who could not be reached for comment sent the judge a proposed order approving her preferred doctor to evaluate keegan without conferring with fletcher that doctor was not on a court approved list the evaluation that found keegan competent and got him out of guardianship was sophomoric fletcher told law360 all he really did was give him the mini test he passed it but all kinds of people pass it it doesn t mean they don t have psychotic issues or frontal lobe problems fletcher said at the hearing i asked doesn t it matter to you that he s been diagnosed with he said it s how he stands in front of me that day that s not a proper diagnosis but the judge thought it was fletcher also noted that keegan had since been arrested for writing an email threatening to slit fletcher s throat and that of a probate judge he said that keegan s only defense in that criminal case might be a finding of incapacity keegan was evaluated by at least eight medical professionals over the course of his guardianship saga based on their assessments of his competency three recommended no guardianship two recommended limited guardianship and two recommended plenary guardianship one said keegan s home was a mess noted a stain on his shirt and reported he was in need of a shave one said he was psychotic and delusional another said he performed above normal on cognitive tests when asked to name presidents who d served during his lifetime keegan started with jfk and recited every president in chronological order to the present in december of 2014 two different doctors evaluated him on the same day one said keegan s prognosis was good if he sought alcohol treatment adding that his drinking choices and activities rise to the level of guardianship the other doctor recommended full guardianship stating while this man initially presents himself well his history of questionable decisions and tendency to minimize his problems significantly impair his ability to make informed decisions in all areas of his life assessments of competence aren t only subjective they exist in a space that straddles the medical and the legal according to sandra glazier an estate planning attorney at lipson neilson and author of the book undue influence and vulnerable adults if you go to a medical professional they re not a lawyer they don t understand nor do they distinguish between levels of capacity she said we re getting a little more astute about the science but it still is more art when it comes to these psychological issues than a black and white determination sometimes that may have been the case with gerald halpin it wasn t only medical professionals who couldn t agree on his ability to make decisions james mcnair of reed smith llp who helped halpin write his estate planning documents said in deposition testimony that even in the final years of his life halpin was brilliant and knew exactly what was going on a doctor who assisted in the second round of evaluations that found halpin capable testified that she wasn t convinced halpin had lost his decision making capacity in 2015 and that his rights may have been terminated way too early in process but other evidence suggested that he was slipping emails between his children revealed that as his business responsibilities waned he grew interested in sweepstakes scams was spending thousands of dollars on them and at one point was planning to fly to london to collect his winnings his daughter christina wrote her brothers an email saying she worried their father s short term memory shot in september 2015 he was prescribed donepezil an alzheimer s medication halpin s liminal capacity is not so uncommon among older adults according to glazier somebody s capacity to engage in a transaction can fluctuate some individuals with alzheimer s may have lucid moments or days when they function pretty darn well and others when they do not she said so when you talk about removing their rights i always say what is the least restrictive approach we can take when the national guardianship network a coalition of industry groups held its 10 year summit in may it too issued a recommendation allowing for more self determination the summit recommended to in essence ban plenary guardianship in favor of guardianships that are specifically tailored to the individual to ensure each individual is able to exercise autonomy as much as possible according to anthony palmieri president elect of the national guardianship association one of the network s 12 member organizations the summit also endorsed the guardianship conservatorship and other protective arrangements act legislation that the uniform law center has been promulgating since 2017 the act does away with the concept of capacity altogether instead the bill s language recommends that courts make particularized findings about the adult s individual needs in light of what the adult can and cannot do it even strikes common probate court terms like alleged incapacitated person which are

by cara bayles the conservatorship of pop star britney spears has drawn fresh criticism to incapacity a designation that s part medical diagnosis part legal determination and can strip people of their rights to make their own financial and health care decisions frederic j brown afp via getty images abusing the system by the numbers statistics on financial abuse by guardians are hard to come by but over the past four years a statewide investigation alliance among florida s clerks of courts has looked into abuses in 41 counties across the state 342 investigations were completed most looking into cases that contained several allegations 191 of the 1 505 allegations lodged were found to be true 8 24m was mishandled in those proven cases 11 guardians had their registrations permanently revoked source clerk of the circuit court comptroller palm beach county florida statistics as of june 14 2021 wanted a good agent the majority of people who financially abuse older adults are family members says pamela teaster director of virginia tech s center for gerontology often because people give power to the wrong agents people make decisions about delegating their power of attorney for some wacky reasons she said maybe don t pick the child who can t manage money don t give it to your girlfriend boyfriend friend of the week because that is not a long standing relationship don t give it to someone because you feel sorry for them she said in guardianship the biggest problem is a lack of oversight by the courts and guardians who try to take on an impossibly large caseload i frankly believe that the exploiting abusive guardians are few or far between that said there s probably one in every state teaster told law360 but even agents and guardians trying to follow the rules can run into a tension between adhering to someone s wishes and best interests generally under a power of attorney an agent has both a fiduciary duty and a duty of loyalty to the grantor which means they must act reasonably and can t engage in self interested transactions syracuse university law professor nina kohn said some state statutes specify that an agent must also make the decisions that the grantor would make she said that raises the question of whether agents must consult the grantor about the grantor s finances that s not typically required by statute but kohn thinks it ought to be common practice it may be inconsistent with fiduciary duty not to consult with the principal she said if you think about the underlying duty of what it means to use proper care and what it means to behave in a loyal manner that might require you to consult even if the state statute doesn t say so on its face advocates say that level of input should be the standard for guardianship reform as well legislation from the uniform law center would set the standard of substituted decision making ben orzeske chief counsel at the uniform law center said if a man with dementia has always played at monthly poker night with his friends and now tends to lose money it might not be a fiscally sound decision to keep playing but it might be worth it to him to keep up the tradition traditionally guardians were supposed to make decisions for the person under guardianship based on what s in their best interest he said the substituted judgement standard says instead you make the decision that the person would do for themselves if they were able to do so the old best interest standard is kind of paternalistic slow support for reforms since it was first proposed in 2006 the uniform law center s power of attorney act has been adopted in 29 states and legislation is pending in washington d c and massachusetts an act to reform state guardianship systems has not caught on as quickly since it was promulgated in 2017 only two states washington and maine have adopted the uniform bill in its entirety power of attorney act enacted in 2007 2021 introduced in 2021 source the uniform law center in the summer of 2018 four years into his guardianship doug keegan kept breaking into his own house he walked eight miles from his senior living facility to retrieve his bicycle from his orlando home he rode back to get suits to wear to his court hearings he was also trying he told law360 to reestablish his residency there at first he smashed the back window easily and climbed in he said but his guardian kept fixing it with thicker glass so he used a brick then he javelined the window with a 10 foot pole he said he broke in six times according to court records some of these break ins ended with him being detained under the baker act a florida law allowing for temporary detention of people with mental illness he told law360 he d be placed in a psych ward for about a week and during one of those stays his guardian sold his house keegan who had struggled with alcoholism for decades was put into guardianship at the age of 57 his brother had introduced him to a guardianship attorney who filed a petition of incapacity in probate court in october 2014 claiming keegan s memory and ability to care for himself were slipping and noting that in 2012 keegan drank so much his kidneys shut down and he was in a medically induced coma for 30 days keegan suspects his brother was after his money and was disappointed when keegan married in september 2014 keegan s wife had immigrated to the united states from kenya and he suspects his family s intervention they also claimed his wife was financially exploiting him was fueled by racial bigotry when keegan s family introduced him to the guardianship attorney dean turman who did not respond to a request for comment keegan says he didn t realize what they had in mind this guy turman shows up at my house he really came there targeting guardianship and what he really wanted was access to all my financial data and my health records keegan told law360 my brother and my mother were begging me to have a lawyer protect my assets i thought it was a waste but i was just trying to keep them from whining so much i didn t see any harm i said well what s the worst that s going to happen for seven years keegan fought the plenary guardianship that stripped him of his rights to make his own health care and finance decisions arguing he d been fraudulently declared incapacitated in april after an eighth doctor s examination he was found capable of managing his own affairs but in the interim about 300 000 of his savings were spent on attorney and guardianship fees according to court filings they ve robbed years of my life they ve stolen my house my car chased my wife away broke up my marriage they ve stolen so much from me he said keegan s entire case hinged on incapacity a legal finding that in florida is based on the assessment of three examiners one of whom must be a doctor incapacity can be based on a mental health assessment as was the case with britney spears conservatorship or a diagnosis of a degenerative disease like alzheimer s as was true of disgraced trial lawyer tom girardi a medical professional can make the assessment in the span of an hour even though people s functionality can wax and wane depending on medication support or even the time of day but the effects of a finding of incapacity can be long lasting it can mean that a person loses control over their own financial and health care decisions it can also prevent someone from driving working voting marrying who they wish or pursuing their interests in court and the standard for stripping a person of those rights is vague according to dr sam sugar an internal medicine specialist who served as a probate court medical examiner for several years and is the founder of americans against abusive probate guardianship the term incapacity does not exist in the medical literature he told law360 if you ask me what is the definition of incapacity it s just about anything you want it to be it could be anything from being in an absolute coma to not being able to find your car keys an estimated 1 3 million adults and about 50 billion in assets are under the control of guardians according to the national center for state courts and while exact national statistics on guardianship and abuse are hard to come by older adults are particularly vulnerable to financial exploitation according to data from the national adult maltreatment reporting system a federal abuse tracker for the past several years the elderly have made up the lion s share of financial exploitation reports with adults older than 70 accounting for 66 of such cases in 2019 according to namrs and with the number of adults older than 85 expected to more than double between 2018 and 2040 growing from 6 5 million to 14 4 million that problem could become more widespread financial exploitation is a very real concern for older adults especially older adults with resources according to syracuse university law professor nina kohn a distinguished scholar in elder law at yale law school s solomon center for health law and policy unfortunately sometimes the legal tools meant to protect older adults can be used to exploit them even people who plan ahead can end up in court gerald halpin amassed a fortune as a real estate magnate in the washington d c area and counted former solicitor general ken starr and former vice president dick cheney as his friends he was considered the father of the beltway community of tysons corner but by 2013 he was approaching 90 and began preparing for the inevitable he put several assets into trust accounts he moved to wyoming where there were fewer taxes he signed a power of attorney that would make his wife helen his attorney christopher hawks and his accountant shawn evans hawkins his attorneys in fact should two doctors deem him incapacitated power of attorney a document by which a person can sign over the right to manage personal health care and financial decisions to an agent is considered an important legal tool in life planning it can go into effect immediately or be springing triggered by some event like a finding of incapacity as was the case with halpin a grantor can choose someone they know and trust and put some limitations on their powers according to kohn powers of attorney can be a wonderful tool for promoting self determination for making sure people s affairs will be handled if they need help and for avoiding guardianship she said at the same time they are extraordinarily powerful and can be a helpful tool for unscrupulous agents the problems are so significant some have referred to them as a license to steal in spite of all his planning halpin s assets were the subject of four different lawsuits in his final years and after his death including several alleging undue influence one suit filed in 2016 raised the question of who controlled the majority voting stock for world resources co a metal salvaging operation owned by gerald halpin and his son peter gerald had been diagnosed with dementia and letters from two doctors in 2015 said he was not capable and could not effectively manage his property personal or financial affairs peter sought to get his father off the company s board according to court filings litigation filed by hawks and hawkins suing on behalf of gerald as his attorneys in fact asked a wyoming state court judge to delay a board meeting at which peter was planning to oust his father they said they were representing gerald s desire to sell his wrc stock so he d have cash to pay off debts give money to his children and donate to philanthropic causes gerald s attorneys in fact asked the judge to give him enough time to meet with licensed physicians for purposes of rescinding a prior determination of incapacity in a court filing peter shot back that regardless of the absurd allegations dementia is not reversible eventually two new doctors certified that gerald was competent after all and his attorneys in fact sought to drop the lawsuit halpin had never wanted to be declared incapacitated in the first place according to evidence that came to light in an undue influence lawsuit filed by gerald s out of wedlock daughter stasia reisfield who sued hawks and halpin s son michael claiming they blocked her from receiving real estate her father had promised her according to his agents in fact gerald decided to ask his wife attorney and accountant to assume responsibility for the day to day administration of his affairs and sought the letters of incapacity himself but discovery in the reisfield lawsuit suggested otherwise it revealed that michael hawks and hawkins debated about how to break the news of his incapacity to gerald in an email to hawks the day after he received the second doctor s letter michael said that his father wouldn t accept the doctors opinions and would either change his attorneys in fact under the power of attorney or sue us all in response hawks suggested possible guardianship hawks later testified that he never thought the power of attorney was properly triggered in the first place because neither of the two doctors were board certified in neurology nor was there a court ruling on halpin s incapacity but hawks said in a deposition that gerald had acquiesced to leaving the power of attorney in place court filings allege hawks continued to act as halpin s agent even after two doctors found he was capable of managing his affairs hawks declined to comment on pending litigation during a july 2016 visit with reisfield her husband surreptitiously recorded gerald telling his daughter that he d put most of his assets into trusts and that some of those trusts have hired attorneys to fight me they re now saying i m mentally not capable he said in the recording so they got attorneys and it s between 10 and 15 attorneys battling over stuff that s absolutely nonsense in my mind it s not uncommon for a person to be declared incapacitated and then have their capacity restored according to rick black founder of the center for estate administration reform who was moved to activism after his father in law became mired in the guardianship system nor is it unusual for someone who s done extensive estate planning to end up in court you can do everything right and end up in this system black said anyone can be abused by this system no matter what your estate documents say keegan and his guardian sparred over which doctors would evaluate him keegan told law360 that he was initially declared incapacitated because turman and his first guardian brought in a doctor to completely rig it h kyle fletcher the attorney for one of keegan s subsequent guardians said that keegan s attorney leslie ferderigos who could not be reached for comment sent the judge a proposed order approving her preferred doctor to evaluate keegan without conferring with fletcher that doctor was not on a court approved list the evaluation that found keegan competent and got him out of guardianship was sophomoric fletcher told law360 all he really did was give him the mini test he passed it but all kinds of people pass it it doesn t mean they don t have psychotic issues or frontal lobe problems fletcher said at the hearing i asked doesn t it matter to you that he s been diagnosed with he said it s how he stands in front of me that day that s not a proper diagnosis but the judge thought it was fletcher also noted that keegan had since been arrested for writing an email threatening to slit fletcher s throat and that of a probate judge he said that keegan s only defense in that criminal case might be a finding of incapacity keegan was evaluated by at least eight medical professionals over the course of his guardianship saga based on their assessments of his competency three recommended no guardianship two recommended limited guardianship and two recommended plenary guardianship one said keegan s home was a mess noted a stain on his shirt and reported he was in need of a shave one said he was psychotic and delusional another said he performed above normal on cognitive tests when asked to name presidents who d served during his lifetime keegan started with jfk and recited every president in chronological order to the present in december of 2014 two different doctors evaluated him on the same day one said keegan s prognosis was good if he sought alcohol treatment adding that his drinking choices and activities rise to the level of guardianship the other doctor recommended full guardianship stating while this man initially presents himself well his history of questionable decisions and tendency to minimize his problems significantly impair his ability to make informed decisions in all areas of his life assessments of competence aren t only subjective they exist in a space that straddles the medical and the legal according to sandra glazier an estate planning attorney at lipson neilson and author of the book undue influence and vulnerable adults if you go to a medical professional they re not a lawyer they don t understand nor do they distinguish between levels of capacity she said we re getting a little more astute about the science but it still is more art when it comes to these psychological issues than a black and white determination sometimes that may have been the case with gerald halpin it wasn t only medical professionals who couldn t agree on his ability to make decisions james mcnair of reed smith llp who helped halpin write his estate planning documents said in deposition testimony that even in the final years of his life halpin was brilliant and knew exactly what was going on a doctor who assisted in the second round of evaluations that found halpin capable testified that she wasn t convinced halpin had lost his decision making capacity in 2015 and that his rights may have been terminated way too early in process but other evidence suggested that he was slipping emails between his children revealed that as his business responsibilities waned he grew interested in sweepstakes scams was spending thousands of dollars on them and at one point was planning to fly to london to collect his winnings his daughter christina wrote her brothers an email saying she worried their father s short term memory shot in september 2015 he was prescribed donepezil an alzheimer s medication halpin s liminal capacity is not so uncommon among older adults according to glazier somebody s capacity to engage in a transaction can fluctuate some individuals with alzheimer s may have lucid moments or days when they function pretty darn well and others when they do not she said so when you talk about removing their rights i always say what is the least restrictive approach we can take when the national guardianship network a coalition of industry groups held its 10 year summit in may it too issued a recommendation allowing for more self determination the summit recommended to in essence ban plenary guardianship in favor of guardianships that are specifically tailored to the individual to ensure each individual is able to exercise autonomy as much as possible according to anthony palmieri president elect of the national guardianship association one of the network s 12 member organizations the summit also endorsed the guardianship conservatorship and other protective arrangements act legislation that the uniform law center has been promulgating since 2017 the act does away with the concept of capacity altogether instead the bill s language recommends that courts make particularized findings about the adult s individual needs in light of what the adult can and cannot do it even strikes common probate court terms like alleged incapacitated person which are considered stigmatizing and can bias judges according to ben orzeske chief counsel at the uniform law center the uniform guardianship act encourages the use of less restrictive solutions particularly supported decision making which allows people to maintain control over their own health care and finances but have someone to talk through those decisions with but in the four years since it was

over 90 000 americans died from opioids in the year ending november 2020 bringing the death total since 1999 to over 850 000 1 opioids have killed far less quickly than covid 19 but the scale of the carnage is similar opioid mortality is a significant reason why americans have stopped living longer lives as first highlighted by case and deaton 2015 there are two competing perspectives about the cause of the opioid explosion and they lead to different policy prescriptions one view emphasises the demand for opioids which has perhaps risen either because of an epidemic of physical pain or economic traumas such as inequality and joblessness to fix the epidemic then requires addressing those root causes which could require fundamental reforms of our economic system the alternative view is that supply side innovations in the legal and illegal drug markets increased opioid consumption that possibility leads to calls for tighter restrictions on prescribing and access a recent paper of ours cutler and glaeser 2021 finds that while both theories have some validity the supply side explanation is far more important see also maclean et al 2021 physical pain certainly predicts who got opioids in the 2009 2010 wave of the medical expenditure panel survey about 60 of people reporting two or more painful conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or interverterbral disc disorders said that they had received two or more opioid prescriptions during their 2 5 years on the panel only 10 of individuals with no painful conditions and 20 of individuals with one painful condition had received two or more opioid prescriptions similarly the share of a county s population receiving disability insurance in 1990 or the share with end stage cancer arteaga and barone 2021 strongly predicts the flow of opioids and opioid related deaths across place between 1997 and 2010 but the national opioid epidemic cannot be explained by a secular increase in physical pain the share of americans reporting two or more painful conditions increased only slightly between 1999 and 2009 the number of emergency department visits for injuries declined over that period and so did the share of americans who reported moderate or severe pain in our analysis we estimated that changing levels of reported pain can explain only one fifth of the increase in opioid use if we control for pain that is severe enough to interfere with work we find that only explains 4 of the rise in opioid use while opioids are meant to treat physical pain many social scientists including case and deaton 2020 themselves have emphasised that economic dislocation can led to despair which in turn can push people towards opioids yet opioid shipments were rising most quickly between 1999 and 2006 and gallup data shows little change in life satisfaction during those years life satisfaction dropped during the great recession and then rose again after 2012 but those data don t correspond to the time series for opioid shipments which peak in 2010 and then begin a secular decline moreover the flow of opioid shipments between 1999 2010 is uncorrelated with the share of people at the county level who report that they are dissatisfied with their lives the great shift was not in the level of reported pain or in feelings of despair but in the willingness of doctors to prescribe opioids for pain humans have had a complex relationship with the poppy plant the harmful effects of opioids have been known for millenia yet there are periodic cycles where opioid use skyrockets and many become addicted cycles tend to begin with a new way of delivering opioids that is different enough from pre existing variants that its makers can claim that it comes without risk thus freidrich sertuner an austrian chemist isolated morphine in 1804 it was incorrectly seen as being safer than opium serturner himself and thousands of others including many civil war veterans became addicts felix hoffman a german chemist working at bayer discovered heroin in 1897 the company told its customers that heroin is completely devoid of the unpleasant and toxic effects of opium derivatives this claim also was untrue after a first optimistic phase reality sets in and doctors and pharmacists realise the new formulation is not risk free policy actions are often taken to relock the barn door the harrison narcotics tax act of 1914 made it illegal to sell certain opiates even with a prescription yet even when doctors refuse to prescribe morphine and heroin to addicts they leave behind a stock of addicted consumers many of whom turn to illegal suppliers the french connection was infamous in the 1970s though it was not unique the current wave of opioid deaths is much like the past it began when purdue pharma began heavily marketing oxycontin in 1996 figure 1 the contin system delayed the release of the drug into the body which supposedly provided long term pain relief and simultaneously alleviated the risk of addiction purdue had long been a marketing powerhouse and it promoted oxycontin s supposed safety relentlessly the company widely broadcast a 1980 letter to the new england journal of medicine which was not peer reviewed and involved only inpatients claimed that among 11 882 patients who received at least one narcotic preparation there were only four cases of reasonably well documented addition in patients who had no history of addiction porter and jick 1990 their sales pitch fell on fertile soil in part because of a growing medical movement that focused on alleviating pain rather than just on treating illness it did not take long for the first hints of failure to emerge by the early 2000s increased opioid related deaths were noted in maine west virginia and kentucky tough 2001 all areas with lots of manual labour and thus high rates of pre existing pain deaths rose apace with opioid prescriptions throughout the 2000s figure 1 trends in age adjusted drug deaths and opioid deaths 1990 2020 source data through 2018 are from cutler and glaeser 2021 data for 2019 are extrapolated from growth rates from cdc data for 2020 are extrapolated from deaths in the first 11 months of 2020 relative to 2019 the rising death toll eventually generated a regulatory response under pressure purdue pharma produced an abuse deterrent form of oxycontin in 2010 that made crushing and injecting the drug harder as law enforcement cracked down on pill mills and doctors again became skittish about prescribing opioids users turned to illegal drug markets entrepreneurs were more than ready to supply customers cicero and ellis 2015 found that one third of opioid users switched to other drugs immediately after the reformulation of oxycontin the majority of those who specified a preferred alternative named heroin similarly evans et al 2019 found no impact of the reformulation of oxycontin on overall drug related mortality an increase in the number of deaths from illegal substances offset the decrease in the number of deaths from prescription opioids quinones 2015 describes the highly efficient distribution network for heroin dealers used a system of drivers to carry mexican produced heroin right to one s doorstep yet heroin was not the ultimate endpoint fentanyl is more potent still and cheaper to produce it does not require access to poppy plants the precursor chemicals to fentanyl often come from china though mexico remains an important assembly and distribution point because the potency of fentanyl varies greatly from batch to batch it is particularly deadly since 2014 fentanyl has become the most commonly implicated opioid in overdoses with the realisation yet again that opioids are not benign the flow of new opioid prescriptions has fallen dramatically it shows every sign of remaining low but there is a large stock of existing users many of whom will continue to use opioids illegally unfortunately the pandemic made life worse for addicts social isolation made escape into oblivion particularly attractive pandemic induced changes in suppliers made potency more variable and reduced access to addiction treatment made supervised withdrawal harder hopefully economic normalcy will reduce opioid mortality that said addiction treatment will need to be massively scaled up to safely reduce addiction lopez 2017 the opioid cycle is a cautionary tale about how technological innovation can go terribly awry if we want to reduce the risk of the cycle repeating anytime soon we will need to change our approach to technology this will require more collective scepticism about innovations that allegedly cleanse pleasure inducing drugs of their addictive properties in addition we will need stronger penalties for companies that mislead the public about the risks of their products to be sure purdue pharma will likely cough up billions for its handling of oxycontin but the sackler family became fabulously wealthy from opioids and it is unclear how much the family will be penalised lopez 2019 health is too valuable and addiction too consequential to leave life and death decisions to the market alone authors note cutler is involved in the

a weekend visit to the public library is an ordinary trip for most kansas city families but for overland park resident nikki rogers saturday marked the first time her children have participated in an indoor activity since the pandemic began we really have just now started getting back out a little bit we pretty much turned into hermits for the year 2020 rogers said there is no coronavirus vaccine authorized for kids under the age of 12 with four children under eight reed said she has been hesitant to take her family out in public for more than a year when case numbers began to dwindle in the spring she began considering enrolling them in in person classes for the upcoming school year but with the highly contagious delta variant now accounting for more than 73 of covid 19 cases in missouri she says she is now looking at keeping her two youngest kids home ages two and four with the older kids i can kind of trust that they can wear their mask and wash their hands properly and everything but with the two year old and the four year old i m a bit more nervous about that rogers said after exhausting their stock of books at home rogers decided it was safe to head to the kansas city public library which has kept its mask mandate in place talia evans kcpl s media specialist says they decided to keep their mask mandate because they serve vulnerable populations especially children under 12 she said the surge of the delta variant only reinforced that the library made the right decision we knew that we needed to do everything we could to still protect them and make them feel comfortable make parents feel comfortable because they have no choice evans said the library has moved storytimes for children online and is holding in person events outdoors schools summer camps and other spots frequented by children are taking a range of different approaches a kansas news service report found that several large school districts in johnson county including olathe and blue valley have lifted their mask mandates others like shawnee mission have yet to decide whether they will require masks in the fall the ymca of greater kansas city is following the masking policies in place in five different counties all ymca facilities activities and summer camps follow the guidelines of the counties that they are located in if a camp or activity is held in a local school district s facilities ymca operates under their rules steven scraggs senior vice president of youth services said this means masks are only recommended not required at some ymca locations scraggs said he d received mixed feedback from parents on their protocols some would like to see more precautions in place while others are more lax about covid 19 precautions we try to do our best to kind of balance the approach to both of those circumstances and let parents know we re doing our very best to try to keep kids in a fun and active environment but at the same time safe as they possibly can be scraggs said precautions taken at all locations include keeping children outside when possible dividing kids into smaller cohorts and requiring masks when transporting by bus weighing the risks lindsey harju also visited the kansas city public library this weekend with her three children she said she s looking for precautions like mask mandates when choosing where it is safe to take them indoor versus outdoor is a big consideration if there s an event that s happening outdoors that makes it a lot easier mask requirements are nice it makes it just hey we re all on the same page harju said dr angela myers is division director of pediatric infectious diseases at children s mercy hospital she recommends parents check what rules are in place at daycares preschools and summer camps she also said parents should avoid summer trips to any hotspots for the variant like springfield missouri i think there s a lot of information that parents can kind of gather when they make these decisions for their kids that can help them kind of determine where the risks are and how they re being mitigated myers said according to myers other precautions to look out for also include screenings for kids and adults and vaccination policies for those older than 12 she said that keeping children in cohorts also helps minimize potential exposure to the virus she said it s up to parents to weigh the risk benefit of activities to determine if they are comfortable with their child participating rogers said she was ready to continue keeping her children at home but she began seeing changes in their eight year old daughter we re starting to see her personality change a little bit and where she used to be super social now she s got a lot of big emotions rogers said rogers said she s making an effort to get out more for her child s social wellbeing but she said it could be difficult to take her children out in public when many places have dropped masking and other precautions i would personally like to see masks still be mandated not to protect the mask wearer but to protect those that cannot get vaccinated rogers said jodi fortino kcur 89 3 lindsey harju s three year old daughter picks out a book at the kansas city public library vaccines are key to protecting the unvaccinated just 39 5 of missouri residents have been fully vaccinated harju said she is frustrated by the vaccination rate and waited to return to in person church services with her children until she could confirm that more attendees were getting their shot she said she s concerned not only that her children could be exposed to the variant but that they could spread it to their elderly neighbors who they frequently visit rogers said she s also concerned about her children bringing home the virus to their grandparents who live with them myers said there is an increased risk of infection from in home exposures compared to exposures in the community especially with the more contagious delta variant that s why she said that the vaccine is key in preventing the spread of the variant people who are fully vaccinated are protected from severe illness and death including from the delta variant according to the centers for disease control and prevention and the food and drug administration myers said the chances of a child spreading the virus or a parent bringing it home to them isn t a zero scenario but getting all household members their shot will significantly lower those chances until we get enough people vaccinated including the younger children we re going to have to remain on our guard because the more we allow pockets of unvaccinated people the more likely we are to continue to get more and more variants to happen myers said myers said it appears that the variant is not linked to an increase in pediatric multi system inflammatory syndrome a rare illness associated with covid 19 it also does not appear to cause a more severe form of covid 19 but it may not be too long before a vaccine becomes available to the under 12 age group as pharmaceutical companies continue their trials in younger children according to myers

elon musk may have a rat problem fans of the south african billionaire s electric cars say rats mice and rodents are chomping down on their teslas and despite having dropped tens of thousands of dollars to buy the pricey vehicles tesla refuses to cover the damage stocks in this article tsla 171 76 2 89 sarah williams a 41 year old physician who lives in manhattan and uses her tesla to commute to work in the bronx told the post of an alarming incident when she took her 2018 model 3 into tesla s paramus nj dealership in mid may after her air conditioner had stopped working musk under fire again ceo to testify over tesla acquisition they opened the glove compartment and a rodent fell out she said it s crazy the pest apparently found its way into williams tesla and gobbled through several internal wires that were insulated with soy rather than oil which critics claim makes them more appealing to rodents when williams who paid 59 200 for her car complained the company refused to help the repair has taken more than a month and estimated costs have soared over 5 000 she said despite repeated promises that the pricey vehicle will be ready soon williams was unable to pick up her tesla at the time of this publication almost two months later most auto manufacturers use the soybean vs oil in their wire insulation for newer vehicles because it is less expensive and better for the environment tesla service advisor jose solis wrote in an e mail to williams that she shared with the post the use of this material would not be considered a defect in design or use considering there are too many factors outside of tesla s control we cannot cover this under a warranty or repair solis is right that it s not just telsa tesla energy partners eye austin texas as site for first solar neighborhood report automakers have been getting slammed for years with complaints of their allegedly rat friendly soy based wiring and like tesla they have all refused to cover the damage claiming that rats chewing on car innards is the result of nature and therefore not their problem it is a long established fact that rodents are drawn to chew on electrical wiring in homes cars or anywhere else they may choose to nest honda told the chicago sun times in june about an illinois man s efforts to bring a class action case against it tesla so far only appears to be unique in having escaped legal action tied to its use of soy materials but that could change as complaints about rats in teslas appear to rise along with the popularity of the brand now valued at 632 billion toby bateson a uk based inventor who came up with a product designed to keep rats out of vehicles said his company has seen special interest from tesla drivers we re getting a lot of inquiries form tesla owners because they seem to be vulnerable to the problem he said adding that his company has been contacted by about 150 tesla owners with rodent issues over the past year bateson sells a product called the ratmat which he describes as a horizontal electric fence that keeps rodents from entering vehicles in new york the ratmat is distributed by a kips bay company called honeydoboys which charges about 1 500 to 1 700 for a single parking spot sized system the company s owner paul turzio told the post bateson said that in addition to wiring damage some tesla owners had also told him their brake cables were chewed by rodents to the point of the car becoming unusable tesla recalls over 285 000 vehicles in china most of them locally made other tesla owners who have complained of rats include a user of the tesla motors club forum who griped that his 5 month old electric vehicle went haywire after a mouse chewed through the coolant hose which may also be made from soy based materials although its unclear if this is the case for tesla apparently this is not uncommon especially with electric cars the user lamented and this year an apparent tesla owner complained on reddit that his brand new model 3 was un drivable just two weeks after it was delivered due to rat damage several other users have complained about damage from mice and squirrels on the forum as well the post did not immediately receive a reply to a request for comment from tesla which is owned by elon musk who went by the nickname muskrat as a child according to a 2009 new yorker profile the complaints come as concerns about rats have risen generally the number of rodent complaints to new york city s 311 hotline surged by 80 percent in march as the economy reopened to 2 906 over and above even march 2019 levels of 2 395 bloomberg recently reported one reason may be that rats were forced to change their habits during the pandemic when their normal sources of food dried up including by moving into emptied out office buildings according to pest co uk we are gearing up for a busy year in 2021 jenny rathbone of pest co uk said meanwhile more tesla s are being introduced to rat infested areas like the big apple at least one model 3 is currently in use as a yellow cab and hundreds more are expected to enter service in the coming years according to business insider click here to read more on fox business williams says she would not recommend any other new yorkers buy teslas until the company rodent proofs its vehicles for me if i m going really fast on the highway and i reach for something in my glove compartment and a rat crawls out it could be a catastrophe she said who cares if you have this great technology if a rat is in there eating the wires
more than us 2billion hinges on that question as a trial kicks off today shareholders allege that musk used his control of tesla to force the company in 2016 to rescue solarcity saving the solar panel maker and musk s investment in the company from bankruptcy the union pension funds and asset managers leading the case want musk to repay to tesla the cost of the 2 6 billion deal and to disgorge the profits on his solarcity stock if they win it would be one of the largest judgments against an individual the two week trial in the court of chancery in wilmington delaware will boil down to whether musk who owned about 22 percent of tesla at the time of the deal is that rare controlling stockholder who does not hold a majority stake i think it s going to be very hard for the court to ignore the reality that elon musk is elon musk and his relationship with tesla said ann lipton a professor at tulane university law school she said the case might present an unusual situation given musk s celebrity status his personal ties to tesla board members and those board members financial ties to solarcity put it all together and it might be enough to count as a controlling shareholder she said few executives dominate their company s image as much as musk known for taunting regulators battling naysayers and personally engaging with his 57 million twitter followers we are highly dependent on the services of elon musk technoking of tesla and our chief executive officer said tesla s 2020 annual report plaintiffs allege that musk drove the negotiations and even pushed tesla s board to raise not lower the price for solarcity a higher price benefited musk who was the largest shareholder of solarcity with a stake of about 22 percent as well as four members of tesla s board who directly or indirectly owned solarcity stock according to court records board members settled allegations against them last year for 60 million and did not admit to any fault plaintiffs also allege the deal benefited two of musk s cousins who founded solarcity saving a company that was rapidly running low on cash musk has said he was fully recused from board negotiations and that shareholders voted to approve the deal because it was central to his master plan part deux that aims to integrate sustainable solar energy with electric self driving cars he has said that what plaintiffs see as evidence of control is little more than strong management taken to its natural conclusion virtually all hands on and inspirational ceos with minority stock ownership would be deemed controllers musk s lawyers wrote in a court filing if vice chancellor joseph slights determines musk was a controlling shareholder it will fall to musk to prove the solarcity deal met the high bar of the entire fairness standard which examines process and price said legal experts musk has noted in court papers that the solarcity deal has been a huge success for tesla shareholders demonstrating the deal was not only fair but a boon after tesla split its stock 5 1 in 2020 it has risen to 652 on thursday from nearly 37 a share when the deal closed in november 2016 if the vice chancellor thinks this deal was awful and was not effectively negotiated on behalf of the company he ll strike it down said larry hamermesh a professor at delaware law school reuters
source stock photo id 498786229 upload date june 23 2014 the united states of america almost did not happen in 1787 as our country s founders debated for months over what the us should be it became clear that the northern and southern colonies had very different visions for nationhood visions that were in some ways irreconcilable what made one nation the usa possible was the three fifths compromise a concession by northern founding fathers to legally formally and systemically dehumanize black bodies in order to get southern states to sign on to the new us constitution northern delegates at the constitutional convention agreed to count each enslaved african or african american as three fifths of a human being not a full member of the human species this was hardly a new or revolutionary idea it reinforced the definition of whiteness as humanness that had been written into law a century earlier in the colony of virginia here is the tradeoff as northern founding fathers saw it we can have a nation if and only if we throw all black people under a horse drawn bus so we ll take that bargain we can revisit and fix things for black americans later but that s not the bargain the southern founding fathers thought they d forged to them the bargain said this we ve been given carte blanche to make white body supremacy the center of law culture and life in perpetuity legally constitutionally and systemically the north can do otherwise if it wants but the southern states are formally and officially dedicated to white body supremacy as the years and decades passed some northerners thought our task and obligation is to make this a steadily more perfect union step by step others however especially northern merchants who made big profits from manufacturing selling and shipping textiles woven from the cotton picked by enslaved southern blacks felt that a more perfect union could wait a while longer meanwhile white southerners thought screw you you promised us white people that we could own chattel forever you made a sacred promise to us and you break it at your peril we would rather die or leave the union than give up white body supremacy in another effort to hold the country together as part of the compromise of 1850 the u s congress passed the fugitive slave act the act required that any enslaved person who had made their way to a northern free state not only could be returned to their owner but had to be the act also made the federal government responsible for finding returning and trying these enslaved people in addition under this law fugitives could not testify on their own behalf nor were they permitted a trial by jury heavy penalties were imposed upon federal marshals who refused to enforce the law penalties were also imposed on people who helped the enslaved to escape once again an extension of white body supremacy was the glue used to hold the country together at the expense of black lives liberation and autonomy nevertheless this compromise proved insufficient for many white southerners and the two irreconcilable visions remained fully intact beginning in 1861 eleven southern states seceded fort sumter south carolina was attacked and the american civil war began after four years that war ended with a northern victory but the two mutually exclusive visions lived on since then northern leaders have repeatedly faced the exact same dilemma either divide the union or save it by throwing african americans and other bodies of culture under first horse drawn then motorized buses every time they have chosen to save the country by harming bodies of culture here are just two of many further examples after the intensely disputed 1876 presidential election congress held the country together through the compromise of 1877 which pulled federal troops out of the south this resulted in the end of reconstruction the beginning of mandatory segregation in the south and the widespread disenfranchisement of african american voters in 1938 in order to pass the fair labor standards act which was part of the new deal president franklin roosevelt agreed to specifically exclude protections for professions practiced by large numbers of bodies of culture in all of these cases which span over 150 years the only way that white leaders with differing views were able to forge a compromise was by writing into law an additional new aspect of white body supremacy fast forward to today the divide is no longer quite so geographical but we are still having the same fight and many white hearts and minds and the unmetabolized racialized trauma stuck in many white bodies have not changed in one deeply important way however our situation today is quite different for perhaps the first time in our nation s history many northerners know that they cannot address the divide by throwing bodies of culture under a high speed rail car doing this will tear the country to pieces too many americans of all skin tones simply will not permit another mass sacrifice of bodies of culture in general and black bodies especially to the faux cause of a more perfect union as a country we have reached critical mass now finally we are having the fight that we should have resolved in 1787 this fight cannot be avoided it cannot be addressed by compromise no reconciliation of two long held irreconcilable visions is possible yet somehow america must find a way through this conflict not around it it is a situation rife with possibility and rife with peril i don t know what will happen no one does but i do know what each of us can do live into events as they unfold with as much compassion and discernment as we can muster and consistently act from the best parts of ourselves human history is never as simple as the rough retrospective arcs we draw including the arc i ve drawn here in real time and real life human bodies live breathe hope hurt make decisions face peril and possibilities act upon one another and try to make a difference only later do people look back on our lived experience and create history from it nevertheless the energies that forged virginia law the three fifths compromise the compromise of 1877 and the fair labor standards act continue to live in our american bodies today bodies of all skin hues the body practice below can help you acknowledge experience and begin to untangle these energies in your own body this untangling may help you live into the events to come with compassion discernment and a more emergent more settled body the two faces of compromise sit comfortably with your back straight with paper and a pen or some other writing implement nearby pen and paper will make you more much aware of your body than a keyboard take a few slow deep breaths let your body settle for half a minute or so think back to an incident in your life when you were asked or expected to compromise and you said yes even though you knew that the compromise would hurt someone possibly even you this might involve your family your work or some other context mentally relive that incident from beginning to end including what other people said and did what you said and did and what events unfolded as a result of your compromise or appeasement as you do pay close attention to what you experience in your body especially any physical sensations urges and impulses images movements or actions judgments meanings or explanations take a few more deep slow breaths let your body resettle as best it can now think back to a different event in your life one in which you forged a compromise based not on appeasement but on your own integrity this compromise might or might not have involved negotiation or reframing the situation or letting go of one of your hopes or desires more notably this compromise harmed no one created a win win situation for all parties and perhaps had other positive results as well as before mentally relive this incident from beginning to end once again pay close attention to what your body experiences including physical sensations urges and impulses images movements or actions judgments meanings or explanations be sure to also review how that compromise played out what events or changes did it engender whose lives were changed because of it and in what ways now pick up the pen and write down what you experienced in your body as you relived each compromise then write down what your body is experiencing right now lastly read aloud what you ve just written what is different about how your body responds to the two different compromises

liz weston nerdwallet few economists predict we ll return to the double digit price increases of the late 1970s and early 1980s but knowing some of the ways consumers coped back then and how things are different now can help you formulate a plan to deal with rising prices first a primer inflation shrinks your purchasing power so you need more money to buy the same goods and services when inflation averages less than 2 as it did from 2010 to 2020 it would take more than 35 years for prices to double when inflation averages 5 which was the annualized rate reported in may prices would double in less than 15 years that is a huge deal if you live on a fixed income or are trying to calculate how much you ll need in retirement people forget about the potential impact of inflation since we really haven t seen very much says penelope wang deputy money editor for consumer reports here are some strategies that may prove helpful buy strategically with persistent inflation delaying a purchase could be costly since the price is likely to rise in the future with today s inflation that s less clear jerome powell chairman of the federal reserve says pandemic related shortages and bottlenecks are behind recent price spikes he predicts inflation will ease as the nation s economy continues to reopen that certainly seems to be the case for lumber prices the cost of lumber increased more than 300 from april 2020 to may 2021 adding 36 000 to the cost of the average house according to the national association of home builders but lumber prices have retreated substantially from those peaks as pandemic related shortages ease if you rushed into a remodeling project or otherwise locked in the high prices you re likely regretting it now on the other hand you may want to stock up on meat poultry eggs dairy products and fresh fruits and vegetables when those go on sale wang says buying on sale is a smart consumer move in any economy and the department of agriculture recently predicted prices of those foods will continue to rise this year embrace substitution high inflation 40 years ago led to the birth of generic groceries products with stark black and white labels that saved consumers money by forgoing fancy packaging today you can get similar savings by substituting store brand products for name brands warehouse stores such as costco and sam s club also got their starts during that period and remain a good source for bargain hunters acquiring used items instead of new is another potential way to save money back in the day that meant yard sales and thrift shops today we can buy used goods from craigslist facebook marketplace mercari and letgo among other sites or there s facebook buy nothing groups where people give their neighbors items for free then again thrift stores have benefited from lockdown clutter cleanouts certified financial planner barbara o neill of ocala florida volunteers at a local thrift store and recently scored a large curved monitor for her husband s computer i picked it up for 10 and then got half off for being a volunteer says o neill author of flipping a switch your guide to happiness and financial security in later life lock in fixed rates on debt the fed has so far resisted calls to raise interest rates to slow the economy and cool inflation if that changes variable rate debt could cost more if you have an adjustable rate mortgage and good credit for example it could make sense to refinance into a fixed rate loan o neill says for credit card debt consolidating it with a personal loan could give you a fixed rate and level payments also be careful about adding any new debt inflation theoretically makes paying fixed rate debt easier since you re paying back the loan with cheaper dollars but new loan payments lock in a new obligation when you may need flexibility inflation isn t all bad those unaccustomed to rising prices may be surprised to discover that inflation has some advantages it s often easier to get a raise because employers can pass along the cost in higher prices although that can start to feed on itself with higher prices triggering more demands for raises in addition many tax rules and government benefits are influenced by the consumer price index the nation s official inflation measure social security benefits include cost of living increases so higher inflation can mean bigger checks the amount you can contribute to retirement funds including iras and 401 k s is also likely to rise there are a lot of things that are tied to the cpi that can benefit some people and help them get a little bit higher income next year o neill says

businesses in modern china in the latest salvo regulators unveiled new draft rules on saturday that would require nearly all domestic companies to undergo a cybersecurity review before listing in a foreign country beijing s motivations for the crackdown are varied they include concerns about anticompetitive behavior in the tech industry risks to financial stability from lightly regulated lending platforms and the rapid proliferation of sensitive personal information in the hands of large corporations but another undercurrent running through many of the government s latest initiatives is a not so secret desire to rein in the power of china s tycoons some of whom have amassed an enormous amount of influence over the 14 trillion economy as one government official familiar with the leadership s thinking described it beijing wants to prevent its billionaires from becoming a force as strong as the family run chaebol that dominate south korea s economy and many aspects of its politics advertisement don t want to see this remove ads adding to beijing s resolve is the chinese public s growing concern over rising inequality at a major speech on his economic plans in october president xi jinping acknowledged that the country s development was unbalanced and said common prosperity should be the ultimate goal the upshot is a new era for the country s billionaires and the investors who back them gone are the days when tycoons like ma could confidently bend the rules to supercharge their companies growth and challenge entrenched interests like state owned banks outsized public personas long seen as an asset for tech company founders now look like a liability the new playbook for china s ultra rich calls for more deference to the communist party more charitable donations and more focus on the wellbeing of rank and file employees even if it hurts the bottom line some of the tech companies became larger than life said allan zeman a property tycoon who gave up his canadian passport to become a naturalized citizen of china in 2008 one big lesson from the crackdown don t get bigger than the government zeman said shortly after attending the communist party s 100th anniversary celebration in beijing on july 1 didi notwithstanding the message appears to be getting through ma who criticized chinese financial regulators in his last public speech before ant s ipo was abruptly suspended has since resurfaced only a handful of times in carefully choreographed appearances colin huang whose e commerce giant pinduoduo inc has come under scrutiny for its relentless working schedules has given up his roles as chairman and ceo and donated shares worth billions of dollars bytedance ltd founder zhang yiming said in may he would step down as ceo and spend more time on educational charity wang xing the chairman of food delivery giant meituan has mostly steered clear of the public spotlight since he posted a 1 100 year old poem in may that some regarded as an implicit criticism of the government wang who later issued a clarification saying the post had been targeted at the shortsightedness of his own industry was advised by beijing officials to keep a low profile according to people with knowledge of the matter the new environment will fundamentally change china s tech sector partly because investors will become more wary of funding entrepreneurs who could end up on a collision course with beijing said eric schiffer ceo of patriarch organization a los angeles based private equity firm u s president joe biden has also taken aim at the billionaire class calling for increased taxes on the rich and signing an executive order on friday that aims to weaken dominance of america s biggest companies the move echoed an ongoing antitrust campaign in china that has ensnared giants including alibaba group holding ltd and arch rival tencent holdings ltd read more china watchdog rejects tencent led game streaming deal one key difference is that chinese authorities unrestrained by western style checks and balances can act more forcefully than their u s counterparts said angela zhang director of the centre for chinese law at the university of hong kong and author of chinese antitrust exceptionalism zuckerberg s hydrofoil joyride came just a few days after a judge dismissed two monopoly lawsuits against facebook inc that had been filed by the u s government and a coalition of states in the case of china the pendulum swings very quickly zhang said beijing has a variety of tools for reining in billionaires including detention in the most extreme cases an internal disciplinary process for party members known as shuanggui has been used for some tycoons in the past investigations by antitrust cybersecurity and other regulators are more common ways to influence the behavior of tech giants the government also uses soft methods including state media campaigns zhang said in the days after regulators halted ant s ipo xi visited a museum in the eastern city of nantong that was created by zhang jian a 19th century capitalist the chinese president described zhang as a patriotic nation builder and philanthropist rather than disrupt the financial system with unregulated loans he built factories and hundreds of schools when you see a virtuous person follow his example xi was quoted as saying by chinese media calling on private entrepreneurs to strengthen their feelings for the country and assume social responsibilities read more china s fading first in first out rebound sends global warning while china s crackdown has been most visible in the tech industry the country s property billionaires have also come under increased pressure in recent years authorities have steadily restricted the industry s access to funding in an attempt to rein in home prices and reduce systemic risks to the financial system china evergrande group chairman hui ka yan has been among the biggest casualties of the campaign this year losing 6 7 billion or nearly 30 of his fortune as evergrande s stock tumbled on concerns the company faces a liquidity crunch a more subtle sign of billionaires waning influence can be seen in their shrinking share of political appointments data from the hurun report which produces wealth rankings shows that rich entrepreneurs accounted for 5 8 of delegates in the chinese people s political consultative conference and the national people s congress the lowest in at least eight years and down from 15 3 in 2013 there is an evolution in the thinking of which type of people should be within the mix said rupert hoogewerf the hurun report s chairman it s becoming much harder for entrepreneurs the big question is whether all of this will be good for china in the long run one risk is that the onslaught of regulatory probes and rule changes undermines investor confidence hku s zhang said that could make it less likely that the entrepreneurs behind the next potential alibaba or tencent get the funding they need to make their ideas a reality global venture capital firms will likely think twice about investing in chinese companies if beijing prevents them from listing overseas a crucial exit route for early international backers yet some of beijing s new policies may foster competition in the oligopolistic tech industry clearing the way for a new class of billionaires to rise stricter regulations on fintech firms will help reduce systemic risks even if they slow down innovation china s crackdown on ant won praise last month from berkshire hathaway inc vice chairman charlie munger who said in an interview with cnbc that the communists did the right thing by letting ma know he couldn t wade into banking and just do whatever he pleased either way china s entrepreneurs will have little choice but to embrace the new normal said chen long a partner at consulting firm plenum the good old days of savage growth are gone

jill voyles and her husband brendan mcclarney pack up their and their three daughters belongings in their rental home in crested butte south in preparation to move on may 24 2021 voyles a body worker and mcclarney who manages a local restaurant lost the lease on their rental home when the owner decided to retire to it dean krakel special to the colorado sun when adam maestle s last landlord put the place up for sale the nine year resident of the gunnison valley thought he d camp out for a little while before finding his next home but one week turned into two and then three with no luck and one day as he was fixing a flat tire it hit him i realized there is literally nothing maestle said this light bulb went off in my brain well if i m going to put a bunch of miles on my car and camp then i may as well hit the road for a while and not do it here that was last summer maestle spent time with friends out east through the fall and winter looking for housing back in gunnison along the way every single day i looked at papers i called realtors i was on facebook said maestle who s made a living working in restaurants and on construction sites there s still nothing maestle came back to the gunnison valley this spring and has been sleeping in his vehicle ever since gunnison wasn t always this way thirty minutes north of gunnison in crested butte affordable housing has been difficult to find for years while some crested buttians prefer to see their last great ski town as a funky alternative to vail and aspen that view is getting harder to believe as the median home price reached 1 million in 2020 a 38 percent increase in just a year we used to joke that the billionaires pushed the millionaires out of aspen and they came over the crested butte said kelly mckinnis the owner and broker of gunnison real estate and rentals now even some of those millionaires are not able to stay in crested butte because of the housing prices and crested butte s red hot housing market has ignited gunnison s too threatening its status as an affordable home for up valley service workers the average price for a two bedroom rental in and near gunnison has jumped more than 400 since 2016 according to a recent report commissioned by the gunnison valley regional housing authority now nearly matching crested butte prices gunnison home prices have risen 57 percent in that time too those higher home prices are leading some landlords to sell rental properties to new homeowners who are unlikely to lease them out long term mckinnis said contributing to the housing shortage vacation rentals in up valley homes are also putting pressure on availability across the region the recent housing report said the valley needs about 1 000 new homes by 2026 i haven t seen it this bad in years and years probably never mckinnis said gunnison has made it easier to build accessory dwelling units small homes in backyards and is supporting a new development of 44 affordable homes and 21 market rate homes said mayor jim gelwicks the city also has enough land on its eastern borders for about 1 700 new homes a 35 percent increase over the city s current stock but it will take years to line up builders and investors he said infrastructure is costly he said it s not something where you can put it all in and put it on the first guy who builds a house out there and say hey you now own a 400 square foot house that only cost you 40 million gelwicks who moved to the area in 1981 said like many other mountain valleys in colorado gunnison is experiencing a culture change the area s history of mining ranching and agriculture isn t as evident as it once was and that s not necessarily bad he said it s just different it s been awhile since i ve seen a cattle drive through the city limits of gunnison he said but you see now spandex and bicycles we have world class bike races that happen in this community the pandemic intensified what was already a tight housing market up and down the gunnison valley one big reason mckinnis said is gunnison s popularity with remote workers and wealthy second homeowners who are able to afford higher real estate prices one of those new residents is doug campbell the ceo of louisville based solid power he bought a second home in gunnison earlier this year even though he could have afforded crested butte that just doesn t appeal to me he said the community of gunnison is what s always appealed to me campbell said he loves to ski and mountain bike and chose gunnison because he didn t want to live in a resort town he hopes to live in his new home six months out of the year and eventually retire to gunnison he s also continued leasing out his adjoining apartment to a long term tenant and said he has no interest in renting it to tourists as a vacation rental but you know at the end of the day one individual one homeowner there s only so much you can do campbell said i m already renting out a portion of my space so i m doing my part not all of gunnison s new residents are affluent michael salat and his wife left northern wisconsin to follow their son to the gunnison valley last year they stretched to buy a townhome in gunnison and are glad they landed there they ve worked seasonal jobs doing trail building home cleaning ski instruction and more i m not wealthy i m piecing it together too i know what the struggle is salat said adding that they re trying to contribute to the community but gunnison s new exclusivity is leaving some pondering their future madison fink and her husband james are trying to move to gunnison so james can finish a graduate degree in recreation and outdoor education at western colorado university they ve been looking for a new home remotely from california since last year with no luck we both have a lot riding on this and are hoping and going to any length that we can to make it work out fink said it s definitely definitely something that we re trying to make happen with all our hearts adam maestle said he ll leave the gunnison valley at the end of the summer if he can t find a new place he originally gave himself a deadline of the end of june then spent an entire morning backtracking i m not ready to go anywhere yet he said but the months long struggle is taking a toll maestle said the gunnison valley is where he d planned to settle down build a house and raise a family and now that s uncertain i m afraid to commit to anything anywhere because it ll be the wrong decision he said no matter what i do i feel like if i stay it ll be the wrong decision if i go it ll be the wrong decision and now i just feel like i m lost he isn t ready to give up on the gunnison valley yet he and some friends want to buy an empty piece of land out of town and put a bunch of rvs on it there might be some legal issues to work out with that but maestle said if he s going to sleep in a vehicle it d be nice to do it on his own land

clashes between farmers and herders in nigeria has become a recurring incidence and the rate seems to be in the increase in recent times it appears the word forgiveness is not in the dictionary of both parties hence the almost vicious cycle of attacks and counter attacks this prompted the historic meeting of southern governors in asaba recently it is a pointer to the gravity of the problem and the desperation by everybody to find a permanent and lasting solution to the problem the governors took a decision to ban open grazing in their states this is in tandem with an earlier northern governors declaration that open grazing has outlived its usefulness that is an indication of a de facto consensus however the federal government according to the president s aids has preference for grazing reserves even though we did not hear it from the horses mouth well whether it is ranching or grazing reserve the important thing is that both parties have now agreed that this is the beginning of the end for open grazing in nigeria the two methods can co exist seamlessly in the country and it is now a matter of preference by individuals or groups a state may even decide that both ranching and grazing reserve can co exist side by side as the hausa saying goes kowa da nasa ai ba fada
by w a wijewardena the new finance minister basil rajapaksa known in political circles by his first name basil is reported to have made an especially important confession on assuming duties last week he is said to have pronounced our priority is to serve the people we have identified all the key priorities and requirements of the general public however at times we will have to take certain unpopular decisions just like how a father would for the betterment of his children and family but these out of favour decisions are taken with so much honesty and consideration for the betterment of the entire nation therefore i urge you all to support our efforts in these trying times the habit of all the previous finance ministers has been to mollycoddle the people with sugar coated words when they assumed that important job by the time they assumed office the respective economies have been in the depth of the depths but finance ministers had promised sun and moon to people but within days all of them had to swallow their bold utterances and were compelled to pass economic burdens on to people when they encountered the empty treasuries they had inherited basil has deviated from this practice and been frank about the nature of economic reforms he was planning to introduce that is a good sign and it is good for sri lanka s long term economic growth deep economic crisis sri lanka s economy is in a deep crisis today besieged from all economic fronts external fiscal monetary growth and employment it should perforce introduce some painful and sacrificing economic reforms if it is to be rescued from the current malaise in this context hiding the facts from the people is not the proper method of communicating with them in all sincerity truth must be told to people it reminds me of how sirimavo bandaranaike the then prime minister came on the sri lanka broadcasting corporation in 1973 and warned the people that the country was sitting on a volcano and it could erupt at any time this was a time when the country had faced a severe food crisis foreign exchange crisis fiscal crisis and a political crisis it forewarned people that some painful measures were to be introduced by the government to take the economy out of the crisis of course her modus operandi for rescuing the economy was not the best for the country but she was truthful and did not want to hide anything from the people failure to keep people informed of the gravity of the crisis the problem with the gotabaya rajapaksa administration from day one of assuming office was that it had hidden the true facts from the people its top leaders had been pronouncing ad infinitum that they possessed a magic wand to deliver prosperity to people whereas the reality was completely different hence when unpopular policies like the fuel price increase were introduced there were country wide protest campaigns against them by affected people basil has therefore started his job with a clear warning to people he had said that the country was going through the most difficult period in its history and solicited everyone s cooperation to come out of it what it means is that they should not expect free handouts from the government no free lunches in the path to prosperity

this debate spilled out into the public arena after the fed s meeting with some fed officials questioning whether the us central bank should be stoking the booming us housing market by buying mortgage backed bonds the fed is buying us40 billion of mortgage backed securities each month which helps keep mortgage rates low all eyes on powell but this view was countered by the influential head of the new york fed john williams he argued that although the us economy had improved with inflation and employment picking up the progress had not been sufficient to warrant the fed dialling back its ultra easy monetary policies williams added that although fed officials had begun to discuss the possibility of paring back the us central bank s bond purchases they had yet to discuss the tactics for doing so there s a widespread expectation in financial markets that fed chairman jerome powell will outline these tactics when he delivers his keynote address at the central bankers meeting in jackson hole next month but the general view is that the fed is unlikely to begin tapering its bond purchases until early 2022 advertisement a similar although more heated debate is being played out at the top level of the european central bank judging from the minutes of its board meeting in june some ecb members argued in favour of winding back the bank s bond purchasing as a matter of symmetry and consistency given the brighter economic outlook and improved financing conditions but others resisted arguing that the recovery was still at an early stage and lacked robustness and they pointed out that the ecb s commitment to bringing inflation back to target could be questioned if it scaled back its bond purchases even though the medium term inflation outlook had not improved in the end a broad consensus emerged in favour of maintaining the ecb s 1 85 trillion 2 9 trillion emergency bond buying program which is expected to last until at least march next year and again the disagreement spilled outside the confines of the ecb boardroom in late june jens weidmann the head of the powerful bundesbank argued the ecb s bond purchases should be reduced step by step and warned that inflationary pressures were rising in the euro zone

a day before two days of selling begin at fasig tipton s newtown paddocks in lexington a panel of veterinarians and horsemen gathered in the sales pavilion to discuss what issues in veterinarian reports buyers may be able to overcome when purchasing a sales horse called deal or no deal the question and answer panel held july 11 on vet findings in sale yearlings was presented by the consignors and commercial breeders association and the kentucky thoroughbred farm managers club speakers dr nathan chaney dr robert cook dr keith latson trainer kenny mcpeek and watercress farm bloodstock adviser rob tribbett responded to questions presented by cba members the panel was offered as an educational opportunity ahead of the july sale fasig tipton s selected yearlings sale to be held july 13 and was also streamed online mcpeek who has a strong reputation for buying overlooked horses that become successful on the racetrack said he tries to avoid analysis paralysis when examining horses vet reports on the sales grounds i think that buyers need to be a little more open minded they need to listen to their veterinarians but they need to not let small findings keep them from their chance of maybe buying the next champion he said mcpeek said the conformation of a horse comes first for him then he checks the information on a vet report to see how a horse should be handled i m lucky in that over the course of my career when i buy a horse i get to take it through the process of developing and seeing which horses and where they have problems he said nathan does my vet work when i get a horse that i m really crazy about and he comes back and says ocd osteochondritis dissecans in the stifle i m like ok that s not one i can go for but i believe swiss skydiver had ocds in her hocks something like that it wasn t enough to turn me off swiss skydiver a 35 000 keeneland september yearling sale purchase in 2018 earned champion 3 year old filly honors for 2020 after defeating males in the preakness stakes g1 i m more worried about the physical structure of the horse then it s more of a matter of what can i handle what can i deal with mcpeek added can i deal with spurs in the knees eskimo kisses had spurs in the knees they turned her down completely curlin had an ocd in an ankle the size of a dime and when i bought him i had two vets come and look and said what s the prognosis and they said give him time he ll be fine eskimo kisses won the 2018 alabama stakes g1 and the following year sold to shadai farm for 2 3 million at the keeneland november breeding stock sale mcpeek as agent bought curlin for 57 000 at the 2005 keeneland september sale and the horse went on to be a two time horse of the year that earned more than 10 5 million and is now a leading sire the panel across the board noted many buyers are looking for a perfect specimen with no issues on its vet report at sales often bypassing horses who later have no problem performing on the racetrack photo anne m eberhardt people come up and look at a horse s sheets and see comments on the reports they either don t understand and they think the horse has problems that make the horse unsuitable for purchase said cook who noted any radiograph findings must be reported i think everybody that buys horses needs to understand that these reports are radiographic findings that may or may not be significant to the horse s soundness long term or ability to pinhook cook said often buyers will see a report with a lot of writing on it and walk away from a horse not purchasing a horse because it has an ocd or a p1 chip those are to me in my mind not often a good choice if you like the horse otherwise because you can often buy it at a slightly reduced rate he said once the horse is cleaned up most of those lesions are never significant for the horse particularly hock ocds which are probably the most common ones ocds off the back of p1 in the hind fetlock are often quite common those are easily removed and the horses rarely have an issue with them once removed if we can fix it with an excellent prognosis i don t see any reason not to purchase it cook also suggested looking for words such as moderate mild or severe to help determine the extent of a finding on a horse s vet report such as with sesamoiditis latson noted that the sesamoid bones are pulled in two directions as a horse takes a step what we have to expect is that a bone under that kind of stress and that small of a bone has got to have some adaptive change over time when i see sesamoiditis in a yearling i expect to see some level of sesamoiditis i expect to see some level of sesamoiditis although at a reduced rate in a 2 year old latson said sesamoiditis is not a four letter word for me when i m looking at horses it can be a sentinel for other things that are going on when we start getting into mild to moderate and moderate to severe sesmoiditis it s very rare that i ll look at a horse that has severe sesamoiditis in my view latson said he scans about 20 of the sales horses he looks at for sesamoiditis looking for irregularities in the radiographs when deciding if to do so he estimated 80 of radiographs he sees at sales show horses going through regular adaptive change yearlings are healing machines he said even if we have a finding of sesamoiditis if it scans well then we may be in a good position if we have that conversation with our client and say look in terms of longevity we re still in good shape here but it may affect how we manage this horse out of the sale photo anne m eberhardt tribbett represented commercial breeders on the panel and advises the successful breeding partnership of fred hertrich iii and john fielding as part of the team at hertrich s watercress farm he emphasized the importance of a good relationship between buyer and vet which could help a buyer determine what problems they are able to manage or those that are likely to resolve in a sales horse in the last few years hertrich and fielding have been represented as breeders by grade 1 winners catholic boy diversify maxim rate and rushing fall even with the reputation of producing top runners they have sales horses on a regular basis that are punished in the auction ring for small issues on their reports tribbett said what impacts a horse on the track and what impacts him in the ring have unfortunately become very disparate things he said every horse that goes through the ring has a lot of risk in its future racing performance how much of that can we really tie back to a yearling survey that we re taking one snapshot of the horse right before a sale and we re trying to look in a crystal ball and say this horse will make it to the track will not make it to the track asked about well performing 2 year olds that prove their soundness at juvenile sales but had questionable radiographs as a yearling chaney said he would still recommend a buyer pursue a horse if it had an issue such as hind ankle chips upper knee joint spurs or sesamoiditis and scanned well most of the time i found other than a couple lesions on x rays that what we see at the sale especially as yearlings don t really stop a horse on the racetrack chaney said a lot of these lesions that we see on these x rays are really not that significant as yearlings especially if they can make it to a 2 year old sale and perform well and have a normal physical he added the panel also covered scoping horses at sales and not getting scared off when a horse does not have a grade 1 throat that being a throat in which the arytenoids open symmetrically people are looking for that grade 1 throat cook commented i think scott pierce published a really good research paper on throats and how they change over time a vast majority of them don t they stay the same or get better most of them don t get worse cook added that most horses fall in the 2a range mild asymmetry for throats and that many in the 2a and 2b moderate asymmetry range go on to race while the grade might make it worth checking a video endoscopic exam at a sale it s not a reason to turn away from a sales horse latson added that most of the horses he had scoped in the 2a or 2b range did not require tieback surgery a 2a throat is a perfectly fine racing throat he said a 2b throat if i include that nostril and that horse has a nice huge throat that doesn t take the horse off the table for me

in the 1980s british prime minister margaret thatcher liked to say there is no alternative to her market driven economic reform ideas she said it so much people began abbreviating it as tina whatever you think of lady thatcher s policies the slogan was certainly effective politics if victory is inevitable you can either cooperate or be left behind but her phrase actually goes back further to an 1851 book by herbert spencer who also famously coined survival of the fittest more recently tina has been applied to investing you must buy stocks because tina you can t make money any other way just close your eyes buy and hold forever or at least through a full market cycle frankly i think that s stupid it isn t true first of all buying and holding stocks isn t guaranteed to work no matter how long you give it there have been periods where stock market returns were less than zero for 20 years starting in 1966 it took 16 years for the market to recover back to its original level and in inflation adjusted terms it was 26 years the first decade of this century was essentially flat see chart below however there is nothing like a roaring bull market to make everybody forget the past we all know it s different this time note sarcasm i mean the fed has the wind at our back and all we have to do is to unfurl the sails and move ever forward thus tina it helps if you somehow had the wisdom to avoid the 2000s up until the magic point of march 2009 and then jump in but what happened if you weren t quite so prescient and invested at the beginning of 2000 if you invested 100 in the s p 500 at the beginning of 2000 you would have about 394 90 at the beginning of 2021 assuming you reinvested all dividends in 2013 dollars to average the currency fluctuation this is a return on investment of 294 9 about 7 yearly this investment result beat inflation for a 152 6 cumulative real return roughly 4 5 per year by the way those returns assume you had no taxes investment management fees platform fees etf and mutual fund fees etc the chart below shows what s happening for the last 21 years and the sheer awesome power of a roaring bull market for the last 12 years even with the greenspan put the first 10 years of the 2000s ended essentially flat and then the financial crisis qes 1 2 and 3 with jerome powell adding another still continuing qe after the covid meltdown please note i m not saying the returns are artificial or are not real because quantitative easing was involved they absolutely are source in2013dollars com source in2013dollars com you need to be incredibly lucky to only invest in bull markets the odds still aren t great unless you a have a longer time horizon than most people do and 2 don t get scared out by the inevitable downturns but more important and the point to this week s letter is that there are alternatives to the kind of stock investing wall street usually peddles and some of them are in my opinion far more likely to help investors achieve their goals typically potential investors are shown stock market returns over 60 to 80 years which includes three or four full cycles and then take those returns projected into the future save your money you are told accumulate 1 million and then you can take 5 a year for a 30 year retirement just keep your money invested and it will grow faster than your withdrawal rate because the average return is over 7 well not so fast my friend ed easterling at crestmont research says it makes a great deal of difference when you start your retirement if you start at a time of high valuations like now the chance your money will run out before 30 years is also quite high in fact in the chart below if you start at the top 25 of valuation quartiles you would run out of money in an average of 21 8 years your money only lasts 30 years 47 of the time not exactly good odds starting at low valuations well the force is with you source crestmont research but taking these risks is precisely what tina advocates suggest you do for something as serious as retirement i think that s insane there is no reason to take such risks you have alternatives today we ll think about this tina nonsense and look at some of the alternatives tina advocates claim or at least pretend don t even exist they do exist and you deserve to know about them getting lucky financial planning is really a giant math problem you can know some of the variables your current age how much money you have right now how much you can add to savings each year when you want to retire or buy that house etc others you can only guess your lifespan the inflation rate market returns and volatility future tax policies and so on nevertheless a good planner can crunch all those numbers and inform you what level of return you need then you can look for investments that give you the best shot at reaching it many investors go wrong by overreaching if all you need is 5 annual gains and you re plunging most of your money into say tech stocks or bitcoin you may get lucky and earn a lot more than 5 but you may also experience losses that prevent you from achieving an otherwise reasonable goal the other and perhaps more common problem is excessive goals that raise your return target thereby forcing you to take more risk if you are age 60 with no savings and you want to stop working in 5 years you will have an uphill climb those high tech stock returns you hear about will seem pretty attractive but in reaching for the stars you run a high risk of falling back to earth the answer there is to dial back your expectations but that s not fun so few people do it all this is much harder than it used to be because interest rates are so low not so long ago those with modest goals could almost guarantee success with a portfolio of long term bonds or cds treasury bonds blue chip corporate bonds even some tax exempt muni bonds had decent returns and low risk profiles it was possible to invest a lump sum and be pretty certain of the outcome you can still do that but the outcome won t help you nearly as much tina advocates say none of this matters just buy stocks because nothing else is better at least that s been the case for the last 12 years let me state this clearly because it s important tina advocates know stocks go down sometimes they just don t care they ve convinced themselves any losses are temporary that may be true especially for the last 12 years but also irrelevant if the losses occur right when you need the money artificial reality the non tina reality is both simpler and more complex stocks are a tool but different jobs require different tools if stocks are what you need you still have to use them in a way that matches your goals and risk tolerance note i am not against holding stocks i personally own a handful of stocks that are long term investments for me but that s another story now there are people who can buy a concentrated stock portfolio ignore the ups and downs and hold on for years while they climb to a sustainably high level it happens but i can tell you after decades in the business and thousands of client meetings such people are rare having an advisor to encourage you through hard times helps but then all too often they stop believing the advisor what most people really need is consistent growth if your bogey is 7 annual returns you re better off getting as close as you can to 7 every year even if it means missing some upside in strong years you ll make it up by missing downside in other years in other words you want the predictability of bonds combined with the upside of stocks the statistical reality you can end up in the top 10 of investors over 10 years if you simply are in the top 50 every year for 10 straight years you don t have to knock out the lights to win just avoid losing there was a survey done in 2000 the average investor expected to make 15 per year for the next 10 years oops they got zero especially after inflation i daresay that if that survey was done today it would have a similar higher expectation than a full market cycle average certainly nothing like 7 portfolio strategists have long tried to deliver on that dream with ideas like the 60 40 stock bond allocation in theory the bond part will gain value when the stocks are weak thereby smoothing the overall return and reducing total portfolio volatility a nice idea and one that used to work fairly well it hasn t done so recently because yields are so low and the fed s qe has distorted bond prices beyond economic fundamentals we can t be confident they will zig or zag at the right times this new and artificial reality is becoming more obvious and it s a big problem trillions of dollars are invested in variations of the 60 40 idea almost every large pension plan and endowment keeps its money in some combination of stocks and bonds but the bond part no longer behaves like it s supposed to bond portfolios average 3 if you re lucky it s probably more like 2 and in a rising interest rate market could be a lot less it s become dead weight contributing little or nothing to overall returns and maybe even adding a new kind of risk suppose just for example the fed decides the economy is doing well enough to aggressively taper its various support programs this could easily make stock prices fall because liquidity will shrink while long term interest rates rise because the economy is growing that s the worst of both worlds for a stock bond strategy i m not predicting that scenario to be clear though i think it s possible i mention it to illustrate how this new upside down world may not work the way we expect locked in so what can you do what s the alternative to stocks one answer is stocks but not all the time market timing is anathema to many financial advisors and they re not entirely wrong done badly and most people do it badly and with the wrong expectations it will be worse than buy and hold the key is to realize what timing can and can t do i don t know anyone who captures all the upside and misses all the downside but you don t need to simply avoiding the worst part of major downturns helps it helps even if it causes you to miss some gains when the cycle turns similarly rotation strategies that stay fully invested but actively shift between market segments to follow momentum can have good results too part of my personal strategy is using diversified trading strategies not necessarily diversified stock portfolios you used to be able to get diversification in various sectors of the market small cap versus large cap international versus emerging markets versus us etc now all stock market sectors seemed to move together in a bear market i have personally identified a handful of etf trading strategies and managers that i feel comfortable with other alternatives exist too sadly some of the best hedge funds and private investments aren t publicly available our government has decided they are too dangerous for small investors but accredited investors who meet certain income and net worth requirements can jump right in like tina that is also stupid wealth doesn t prove intelligence nor does lack of it mean one needs protection nevertheless it is the law for now so we have to follow it if you qualify i have personally had pleasant results in private credit funds these are non bank non traded lending programs investors can get high single digit returns or more with increased risk i don t like to use the term fixed income to describe them thinking of them as more cash flow investments typically investors receive higher returns because they give up liquidity investing in these is a multi year commitment you can t get your money back until the defined period ends it s not like a bond fund you can redeem or an etf you can sell on an exchange you are locked in but it turns out that sacrificing liquidity if you can do it is an excellent way to boost your returns the investment itself earns more but maybe more important it removes the temptation to bail out at the wrong time investors in a three or five year private credit fund actually stick around for the full period the same is true for many alternative private investments the variety is endless name an asset class and several hedge funds probably trade it they may not trade it successfully but if you can get those who do to take your money you may have found a good opportunity in the last few years new platforms have expanded access to hedge funds for smaller accredited investors let s say a hedge fund has a 10 million minimum investment a platform would create a feeder fund into it taking investments as small as 100 000 and aggregating them for a fee they offer access to funds with very long term track records some of the most famous managers in the world and potentially better returns i have had a portfolio like that for some time now we change funds over time but not very often switching is a months long process some years the diversified portfolio doesn t look very smart with low returns then again last year everybody seemed to hit a homerun at least in my portfolio at least for one year my portfolio looked brilliant but over time it smooths out the returns and helps me achieve my goals there are literally scores of different alternative investment strategies besides private credit hedge funds there are closed end funds which offer decent returns along with volatility various funds utilizing a particular manager s edge and focused dividend yield strategies many dividend oriented etf s and mutual funds have scores if not hundreds of underlying investments which drag down the average return there are very good dividend strategy managers who build concentrated portfolios of what they feel are the best dividend paying companies with us or international companies or both and are worth the fees they charge over a full cycle the better managers can outperform the market with about half the volatility pair them up with some of the private credit strategies i mentioned above you have a real chance of getting that 7 without being too promotional at team mauldin we like to break our strategies down into two components core and explore in a presentation we might say that 80 of your assets should be in core and 20 in explore you want 80 in low volatility steady eddy investments that will get you back to your 100 in 4 5 years then you get more aggressive with your explore bucket diversifying into investments which have much higher return potential where you are looking for multiples and not 7 that 80 20 is just an example the older you are the less risk you should take how much risk you should be taking when you re young depends on what your income levels are are you going to inherit wealth a hundred questions have to be asked to determine the right portfolio design for you there is no one size fits all which is why i never try to put something like that in a letter creating an explore portion of your portfolio is complex takes time and a lot depends on your personality but in general you need a plan my companies offer some of these products and i have compliance restrictions which keep me from getting too specific the broader point whatever your net worth is to not accept this tina fantasy you have lots of alternatives to simply holding stocks you may need professional help finding and accessing them but they re out there in fairness there are hundreds of good advisors who generally do the same thing we do just with their own flavor do your own search but i would suggest avoiding advisors whose idea of portfolio construction is to buy and hold traditional stocks and or etfs in a tina like fashion i mentioned ed easterling above if you are a serious investor and thinking about retiring or simply want to understand the markets you should read everything at ed s crestmont research site plus his books especially unexpected returns then and only then talk to your financial advisor i m really quite serious about that most advisors rely on some form of tina it s hard to predict anything in this zero rate rising inflation world but you still have some good choices washington dc maine and colorado my schedule is firming up somewhat i plan to go to washington dc for a few days before heading out to bangor maine and then grand lake stream for camp kotok the annual fishing and economic fest this year my youngest son trey who is now 26 will once again accompany me which he has done for most years since he was 12 then i will go to steamboat colorado for a speaking engagement before heading back to puerto rico trey will be coming to puerto rico in late july along with a friend he feels should meet the parents tiffani and my granddaughter lively will show up a few days later shane and i are really looking forward to that her son dakota has been with us for the last week or so i get asked all the time about what it s like to live in puerto rico i have to say that it is far better than i ever imagined it would be the weather is typically fabulous although it will get hot in august but ironically nowhere near as hot as it does in texas i have met so many new friends shane is at the beach nearly every day snorkeling and getting her exercise i have a great gym and i even get in a little golf i am looking forward to traveling some again but it is nice to come home to paradise and with that let me hit the send button and wish you a great week take some time to meet with friends and avoid fewer people your happy

there has been a fair bit of catching up to do after the past week spent outside of the financial market s matrix the biggest takeaways appear to be that the us dollar rally has run its course for now and that the us bond market refuses to taper tantrums in fact us bond yields have turned about face and headed south the latter appears to be vexing the minds of inflationists everywhere as pantheon macroeconomics notes federal reserve buying has run ahead of us government issuance in q2 and the end of the us debt ceiling suspension looms at the end of the month throw in a relentless ocean of capital looking for a home in a zero percent world and the answer to the bond market rally and consequent fall of the us dollar and rally in stock markets is likely right in front of our faces one thing is for sure the debt ceiling won t be resolved by july 31st is past years are anything to go buy meaning new issuance will be constrained given the fed won t stop buying treasuries and mortgage back securities either the underlying bid in the bond market will remain one could wring one s hands at the illogical nature of it all and let s face it what s been logical since march 2020 a less stressful strategy is to accept the momentum for what it is and run with it that likely means capped us yields a lower us dollar higher stocks off course and a solid bid on commodities and precious metals the momentum will be what it will be until it isn t that doesn t mean that everything is well in the state of denmark though the asia pacific remains down a covid 19 rabbit hole and if the situation that i have experienced first hand in jakarta last week is anything to go by some downward revisions of growth are inevitable for the region similarly cases are rising in the us the uk and europe even as those regions ease restrictions on their fresh mrna vaccinated populations time will tell on how that bet will work out it is easy to look at the northern hemisphere big three and their summer holiday instagram photos and assume the world is saved however the rest of the world remains mostly in a very different place one thing that is noticeable is the waning momentum in the global reflation recovery trade as the haves have and the have nots most of us have not china sprung a surprise rrr cut on markets late friday which to my mind is a strong signal from beijing that they are nervous about the fading momentum i had penciled in one and five year loan prime rate hikes for q4 in china i am now reassessing that of course china may have shot itself in the foot with its ever expanding technology company and foreign ipo clampdown restricted lending to the property sector won t have helped and it s quiet but relentless withdrawal of liquidity via the mtf and repo market may have proven premature throw in the constant head butting on trade and geopolitics a strong yuan stubbornly high energy and commodity prices and perhaps it s not such a surprise the pboc has blinked it should all be wonderful news for mainland equities though and those countries in its nearby event horizon the world suddenly looks like october 2020 again pre pfizer biontech announcing they had saved the world as long as you were american or european at this stage i really can t tell you if we are temporarily back to the future or a colder reality about the global recovery looms either way though it should be good for the fomo gnomes of the stock market the picture will muddy further this week if us core inflation yoy climbs above 4 0 that may increase the taper talk again and federal reserve chairman powell also gives semi annual testimony in congress this week further hints on a tapering schedule could appear during this address potentially signaling the us could be moving out of monetary policy sync with the rest of the world fed qe buying and the debt ceiling expiry mean that the us bond market is unlikely to react but emerging markets notably in asia may not fare so well dm is likely to outperform em this week that disquiet may deepen if china s trade balance industrial output retail sales and gdp data released this week show a slowing down of the pace of the china recovery singapore gdp malaysian industrial output indonesia trade and india industrial output and trade balance may tell a similar story asian fx is likely to fade at the expense of dm currencies and the post china rrr cut rally we are seeing in northern asian equities today could quickly fade we have a few central bank policy decisions in the mix as well this week the bank of canada will buck the trend by further tapering its bond buying along with firm commodity and oil prices that should see the canadian dollar outperform this week the bank of japan and bank of korea will remain unchanged especially after the china rrr cut and the ongoing pandemic woes at home and across the region those same factors along with the extended sydney lockdown will also stay in the reserve bank of new zealand s hands china rrr cut boosts asian equities asian equities are higher today after a surprise rrr cut by china on friday and an upbeat wall street session lifted sentiment the nikkei 225 has raced 2 20 higher while the kospi has rallied by 1 0 notably china s mainland markets and its nearby neighbors are outperforming china s shanghai composite is 1 0 higher with the csi 300 leaping by 1 60 us index futures have eased slightly by around 0 20 this morning but the move looks corrective after a powerful wall street session on friday the s p 500 nasdaq and dow jones all hit record highs on friday the s p 500 rose 1 13 the nasdaq climbed 0 98 and the dow jones rose 1 30 across regional asia stocks are also higher although less so than in northern asia the expanding china tech clampdown has muted sentiment in hing kong which is just 0 40 higher singapore is 0 25 higher with taipei climbing 0 85 jakarta has risen 0 80 on commodity prices and ipo fever but kuala lumpur has fallen by 0 40 with politics and covid 19 cases weighing on sentiment australian markets are shrugging off the sydney lockdown for now following us markets and the china rrr rally higher the asx 200 has risen 0 80 while the all ordinaries has climbed higher by 0 70 northern asian markets with high beta and geographic location to china are outperforming today however that rally may run out of steam as the week progresses if china s tier 1 data releases suggest the pace of the recovery there is slowing it would inevitably weigh on sentiment across the rest of the region with the asia pacific as a whole ex china grappling with the cold hard realities of covid 19 additionally a 4 0 plus us core cpi this week is likely to see em outflows increase and dm markets outperform notably the northern hemisphere heavyweights fading sentiment fading us dollar the us dollar underperformed last week as us bond yields continued to fall notably us yields staged a corrective jump on friday the first in eight sessions yet the us dollar continued to move lower that suggests that friday s us yield jump is temporary and that momentum has well and truly turned for now for the firmer us dollar trade fading expectations about the pace of the global reflation trade appear to be the main culprit although i suspect technical issues in the us bond market capping yields are also playing their part having topped out just above 92 80 last week the dollar index has fallen to 92 17 as of this morning in asia falling by 0 27 on friday the 91 50 level looms as the critical support pivot point for the index now a daily close below 91 50 and its 100 and 200 day moving averages dmas just below will signal an extended period of dollar weakness that would target 90 00 that said nerves ahead of the us cpi data tomorrow should limit the downside for the greenback for now an em equity washout this week would also limit losses there with the greenback most likely to feel the pressure versus the major currency space eur usd still languishes at 1 1870 today ahead of inflation data tomorrow as well eur usd needs to close above 1 1900 to regain upward momentum gbp usd looks more constructive at 1 3890 today with uk data expected to be positive this week a close above 1 3900 this evening sets the scene for a test of its main pivot level at 1 4000 later this week although asian currencies have regained some lost ground versus the us dollar over the last week they face data related challenges in the coming week suppose china india malaysian singapore and indonesian data suggest that the regional recovery pace is slowing or has halted in that case the afx space is likely to retreats versus the greenback as investors rotate into the dm space similarly a us core cpi print above 4 0 will increase concerns that us monetary policy and asian monetary policy will soon diverge in their respective tracks again that risks afx underperformance versus the greenback oil prices remain firm markets can t seem to decide what the opec standoff between the uae and saudi arabia means for oil prices on the one hand a fracturing of opec unity could lead to an open the pumps free for all an obvious price negative on the other hand opec s present agreement remains in force with the grouping in compliance and opec usually manages to overcome intra group disagreements eventually that expectation has supported prices the net result seems to have locked brent and wti into range trading mode for now albeit a relatively wide and volatile one brent crude rose 1 65 to 75 55 a barrel on friday easing to 75 25 in asia with virus fears eroding recovery confidence brent crude looks supported under 73 00 a barrel in the bigger picture but capped at 78 00 a barrel for now wti spiked 1 95 higher to 74 65 a barrel on friday before easing to 74 30 a barrel in asia this morning wti looks supported on dips to 71 00 a barrel while prices looked capped ahead of 77 00 a barrel looking at the ranges and volatility in oil markets last week it is clear that much positioning culling and tail chasing is going on oil s fundamentals remain positive albeit perhaps slightly less so than last month as covid 19 keeps on giving that all makes for a great day traders market at the moment but a less appealing one for investors until we get opec clarity i expect the wide ranging chop fest day trading frenzy to continue unless one has an appetite for tail chasing intra day risk patiently waiting for the whipsaw dips or just watching the fun and games from the sidelines might be the most intelligent strategy at the moment gold awaits us dollar developments gold has managed to reclaim 1800 00 an ounce over the last week but it looks very much like a function of us dollar weakness instead of bright new dawn for gold as an asset class the fact that gold has spent the last five sessions quietly ranging between 1800 00 to 1820 00 an ounce after its initial spike suggests that gold is in a holding pattern waiting for events to transpire elsewhere gold has fallen 0 40 to 1801 00 an ounce today giving up all of its range trading gains from friday until the us dollar breaks higher or lower emphatically this status quo is likely to continue broadly speaking i expect gold to remain contained this week bound by support at its 100 dma at 1791 00 an ounce and its 200 dma above at 1828 00 an ounce

there has been much conjecture but little evidence as to why the u s is experiencing a labor shortage some say it s because people are lazy and are exploiting the system some say it s because greedy employers aren t paying enough many people have made up their minds about why there is a labor shortage before enough evidence has been gathered to support any hypothesis i possess a third consideration but i ll try to stay out of that ideological dog fight and report the facts and maybe a few opinions if we are intellectually honest about it we know that people have their reasons why they are not yet back in the labor force and some of those reasons may not be the ones we want to hear it serves no purpose to lump people and their motives together there were 850 000 jobs filled in june 2021 the best monthly gain since august 2020 half of those gains were at salons hotels retail stores restaurants and similar in person roles the workers in those industries received more significant raises than other employees from february 2020 to june 2021 average hourly earnings increased for the entire private sector by 6 6 for leisure and hospitality jobs the growth was 7 9 for retail jobs the increase was 8 6 but it s not all about the money keep in mind that we re still going through a pandemic vaccination success has seemingly helped ease pandemic fears as a result more people are willing to go back to work according to the labor department in june 2021 1 6 million said that the pandemic prevented them from looking for jobs down from 2 5 million a month prior but yeah it s also a little about the money there have been reports of businesses offering lower wage workers the type of benefits and courtship typically reserved for the white collar world such as sign on bonuses and out bidding other employment offers it feels like that must be part of the reason why people are taking jobs then again it s not about the money for instance working from home is the new raise the company blind found that 64 of employees at some of america s largest companies would turn down a 30 000 annual raise to keep working from home indefinitely doesn t that make it seem as if people do care about things other than the almighty dollar and then again it is about the money a university of chicago study found that 42 of workers receiving unemployment benefits are receiving more than they did at their previous jobs it can t be an easy choice to take a job you would not enjoy if you can get paid more to stay out of work as you look for something better even with 7 1 million fewer employees now compared to february 2020 u s gross domestic product gdp is about 22 trillion that s more than the 21 5 trillion pre pandemic people will use that data to support their narratives businesses ask too much of employees or corporations have figured out how to do more with less whatever your interpretation the data is incredible us gdp is essentially a combination of population growth plus labor productivity over the next year population growth won t be anything astounding however i assess that labor productivity will be better than at the end of previous recessions typically the rehires after a recession are the economy s least productive workers that might not be as true this time as health concerns fade further and childcare and schooling issues are resolved throughout the next few months skilled workers will reenter the labor force and fill the nearly 9 3 million job openings i have a high conviction that the economy will grow above trend for the next 12 months the only thing i see stopping that growth it is a resurgence of covid 19 hospitalizations or a federal reserve mishap the nasdaq 100 must rest for the week ending july 2 2021 the nasdaq 100 was up seven weeks in a row according to cornerstone macro the inception date of the nasdaq 100 index was february 4 1985 since then there have been 17 previous instances when the index was up seven weeks in a row on average as well as the median the index was up in weeks eight last week nine and 10 but barely up ranging from up 0 01 the median of week 10 to up 0 89 the average of week eight the typically hot month of july looks to be a cool one for large cap growth stocks in fact goldman sachs said on july 6 2021 that stocks are more likely to be lower at the end of the year than higher specifically they expect the s p 500 to finish 2021 at 4 300 points that s just 50 points lower than when they made that claim i don t want you to be fooled into thinking that a lull is a time to sell sure we may have some moments that are less than cool and are downright chilling but those 5 10 pullbacks are to be expected for now it s okay to maintain your equity allocation historically some of the best times to sell have been when the federal reserve makes a misstep in monetary policy or when things like high oil prices or excess inventory have nudged the u s into recession we have more of a supply chain issue than an excess of inventory so that s not a problem however oil prices are high and probably will go higher that s also partially a supply chain issue which opec the organization of petroleum exporting countries plus 10 of the world s major non opec oil exporting nations is already working on albeit slowly opec cut 5 8 million barrels per day b d from production in response to the pandemic induced recession in the u s the 2020 decrease of oil production from 12 2 million barrels per day to 11 3 million b d was the country s largest annual decline per the u s energy information administration s records if prices get much higher oil producers may bring more rigs online as prices inch higher opec will likely move more quickly to increase output so that higher prices don t encourage more drilling from around the world i believe that higher oil prices will be resolved by supply catching up to demand at least resolved to the point where higher prices won t be recession inducing the other thing that causes a bear market is a contraction of earnings growth however as i said last week earnings expectations may be overly ambitious but they are solidly higher nonetheless i will watch this closely though because it s not all about the level of earnings it s also about earnings meeting or missing expectations i am willing to endure a correction because i don t yet see what will stop the market s momentum the stock market looks exhausted and needs to rest but the bull market isn t sleeping with the fishes allen harris is the owner of

table of contents that europe now needs to rebuild its economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic is a given the pressing question is how this can best be done the eu green deal marks a significant change in the union s vision for its economic future as it commits the region to decarbonization ecosystem restoration and social inclusion but as implementation begins in earnest the eu must consider how longer term benefits in relation to systemic resilience and regeneration can be generated and optimized an economically weaker europe will face new internal and external security risks so the ways in which the region addresses climate and ecology related issues will be critical previous chapters in this compilation have shown that the links between recovery pathways and the security agenda also need proper timely consideration in particular the trending assumption that decarbonization in the energy sector will be the primary means of jump starting economic growth could obscure the parallel needs to secure an ecological future and address the geopolitical and human security risks inherent in a poorly executed green deal in this context eu policymakers appear rather too comfortable with the belief that the internationalization of the green deal approach will be a sufficient response to wider geopolitical and human security challenges exporting tested green deal style solutions would be a useful start no question but even if the green deal were to be fully and effectively delivered which currently seems unlikely it would still fall considerably short of what is needed 1 a new integrated economic and security paradigm is needed to guide the eu s thinking investment and action a paradigm configured not just around responsibility and efficiency but also around resilience and regeneration interest in the concepts of resilience and regeneration has grown noticeably since the pandemic began but it is time to take action and rewire the union s policies incentives and market mechanisms so that they reinforce all three goals responsibility resilience and regeneration both at home and abroad john elkington john elkington is the founder and chief pollinator of volans and has helped create and incubate movements including the b team the dow jones sustainability indexes the global reporting initiative and b lab uk the shift toward regenerative economics and economies alongside linked macroeconomic and geopolitical policies requires europe to position itself internationally in ways that foster mutual ecological socioeconomic and security benefits and this positioning in turn requires a different baseline from which to assess the design and progress of eu climate policies and geopolitical strategy while adding new climate elements to existing approaches of the common foreign and security policy and the common security and defence policy will certainly be necessary this step alone will not be sufficient for long term success still there are other promising ways to achieve a genuinely systemic approach such as by embracing the regenerative economy paradigm expanding the change agenda and exporting the regenerative economy model green stepping stones toward a new scenario it is far from certain that the green deal will act as a stepping stone to broader systemic change it is likely that the eu will take narrow incremental steps rather than designing structural solutions in this case the green deal could be left as an aspirational benchmark designed in earlier better times with decarbonization discussed more than it is actually implemented the eu needs a fundamentally different scenario from this one of european regeneration under this scenario new types of leadership drive inclusive clean and ultimately regenerative growth virtuous cycles kick in expansion beyond net zero ambitions in major economies coupled with major state directed investment in key sectors opens up new markets that thrive 2 increased and widespread inclusion of female leadership helps spur this european regeneration 3 the green deal proves to be the first stage of a fundamental reworking of the european project both at home and abroad this scenario would spur rising generations to actively help put their nations regions and the wider world on the path to a systemic multidimensional recovery and ultimately a global regenerative economy 4 thammy evans thammy evans has worked in environmental sustainability energy efficiency and climate insecurity holds a master s in political science from the graduate institute of international studies geneva and has worked much of the past twenty years in the field of security and defense sector reform and governance the likelihood of this scenario occurring depends not just on reimagined continent wide frameworks rules and regulations but also on a new spirit of radical innovation fearless entrepreneurship and financial risk taking achieving success would require a new economic paradigm fit for the twenty first century and very different priorities in terms of how to generate wealth value and well being the scenario s ultimate outcomes however would increasingly be shaped by evolving power dynamics among the five dominant economic blocs china india the united states the eu and over time africa as explained in chapter 5 5 in a period of geopolitical reordering these dynamics are likely to be destabilizing without stronger coordination it is possible to draw many different conclusions from such projections but one trend seems beyond dispute as the decarbonization and wider sustainability agendas become mainstream they must increasingly influence all forms of politics already we see climate action being sold by some european media in terms of green nationalism systemic progress will only be possible if these agendas are linked with all efforts related to security health and well being as pointed out in chapter 4 again the green deal represents a robust start but the challenges now facing europe are increasingly systemic and thus demand systemic responses green swans exponential progress nassim nicholas taleb asserts that the challenges that drive eventual systemic change typically hit out of the blue have an off the scale impact and are then critically misunderstood by many of those charged with ensuring that history does not repeat itself 6 however the coronavirus pandemic he concluded was not an unpredictable event what he terms a black swan coronavirus outbreaks were foreseen and the risks were largely ignored very much like the risks associated with climate and biodiversity emergencies have been in support of the green deal s do no harm oath the eu should seek to leverage green swans or in other words profoundly positive market shifts although opposite to often catastrophic black swans they are generally catalysed by some combination of black or gray swan challenges and changing paradigms values mindsets politics policies technologies business models and other key factors 7 at best a green swan could deliver exponential progress in the form of economic social and environmental wealth creation at worst it could achieve progress in two dimensions while holding the third steady there may be a period of adjustment where one or more dimensions underperform but the aim must be an integrated breakthrough in all three dimensions leveraging a green swan will be easier to discuss than do although many hope that the pandemic s aftershocks will soon fade this decade s social economic and political quakes are likely just beginning and will be difficult to effectively manage populism has not yet run its course and an economy built on fossil fuels is being rudely pushed into a future powered by electrons in the process core elements of the european economy are being disrupted brands like mercedes and bmw are encountering radically different competitors most notably tesla but also burgeoning chinese electric vehicle companies an era of physics and chemistry is giving way to an era of information biology and ecology in which there will be major winners and inevitably serious losers embracing regenerative economics a united europe that is economically thriving would be better equipped for turbulent times than one that is politically fragmented socially fractious and economically challenged europe s goals of the last century were unification expansion democratization and integration this century s challenge will be the rebuilding of economies based on technologies business practices and policies that are socially inclusive and via radical decarbonization and increasingly circular dynamics environmentally sustainable this time the most obvious goals are social inclusion decarbonization and environmental regeneration but others will become more pressing over time such as human security energy justice and ecological security see chapter 4 the risks involved in ignoring or discounting the drivers and triggers of this century s security and defense challenges are growing particularly in areas where there is undue reliance on automatic u s intervention on europe s behalf the region s willingness and ability to invest in preemptive security defense and intelligence efforts that aim to avert conflict will be critical as the post world war period has been marked by increasingly troubled international relations to leverage relevant green swans in this context the eu must pursue three priorities priority 1 embrace the regenerative economy paradigm only through a timely sustained and effective push to shift the fundamentals of the european economy can the eu benefit from european regeneration the spotlight must shift conclusively and deliberately to economic and business models that actively regenerate critical political economic social and environmental systems in short eu member states must co evolve a regional version of the regenerative economy 8 stretching current circular economy formulations that have become increasingly central to policy discussions 9 europe must also rise to the challenge collectively wherever possible with investors and business leaders workers and trade unions and local national and international government agencies pulling together nationalism is still very much a force to be reckoned with and unless democratic states create a united front populism and nationalism will further feed on the intense social and economic dislocations likely to follow the full scale deployment of technologies like autonomous vehicles advanced robotics and precision fermentation of cultured proteins 10 leaders of older fossil fuel based industries sense the coming shifts and are trying to adapt to avoid being left on the wrong side of history 11 fatih birol head of the international energy agency iea was recently quoted in a financial times magazine article stating that our numbers show that renewables are set to become the largest source of generation by 2025 overtaking coal and ending the fossil fuel domination of the last decades 12 the iea originally formed to expand the use of fossil fuels subsequently suggested an end to investment in fossil fuels by 2030 13 the energy and resource configurations of tomorrow s economies will have huge implications for the security of most people on earth the more fossil energy used history suggests the more conflict prone and resource insecure the world will become to avoid this future it is imperative to create renewable circular energy systems however this will require deep and ongoing systemic assessments of risk and opportunity related to such areas as carbon leakage external to the eu russia known to routinely play a disruptive role in climate negotiations is now relishing climate adaptation 14 while many of the gulf states are pouring their oil money into solar export research among other things via investment in the hydrogen economy 15 meanwhile the international renewable energy agency underscores where the clean energy future seems to be erupting china the country is aided by the giant size of its domestic market and by state directed investment in research and development and solutions now linked to green recoveries as a result china is expected to account for almost half of the global increase in renewable electricity in 2021 16 accelerating the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy is crucial but does not guarantee less violence new points of vulnerability will emerge such as submarine cables transporting renewable energy to foreign markets subject to both natural hazards and to sabotage and as the move toward renewables progresses violence around mineral extraction versus oil production will likely increase further accelerating decarbonization alone will not address all the fronts of the climate crisis europe could decarbonize industry and its cities successfully yet still leave substantial proportions of the continent s agricultural soils locked in degenerative spirals some decarbonization efforts for example replacing woodlands or wetlands with solar farms could also be ecologically problematic counterintuitively displacing natural carbon sinks and destroying biodiversity 17 the uncomfortable truth is that european economies have often drawn on progressively larger hinterlands as empires colonies frontiers and markets have expanded historically much of the region s wealth was extracted with intergenerational consequences but the intergenerational consequences of issues like climate change and the loss of healthy soils forests reefs and species globally are not only pressing in but galvanizing the public whatever humanity may intend people s lifestyles are increasingly colonizing the future as roman krznaric has argued 18 there is a risk that private enterprise and newly formed space commands for example will serve to colonize new planetary frontiers in the name of rare earth exploration and resource sovereignty 19 in addition there are the economic challenges related to both aging and declining populations alongside looming pressures on europe to handle forced migration brought on by the threat multiplier of climate change 20 much study has been done on sectors like automobiles aviation chemicals fossil fuels nuclear energy and tourism but much less effort has gone into exploring the economic and ecological links with conflict defense policing and security the coming climatization of security may herald the securitization of climate in which militaries must find a regenerative role in the former rather than a degenerative role in the latter 21 so expect to see an accelerating convergence between the sustainability and security agendas the security and defense sectors are becoming increasingly interested in sustainability issues related to climate change water scarcity and the spread of exotic diseases and further signaling the growing overlap of these agendas the sustainability sector is becoming increasingly interested in the links between issues like forced migration and in the wake of conflicts that cannot be averted economic social and environmental recovery and regeneration 22 priority 2 expand the change agenda to include regenerative economics so what would a truly regenerative economy look like no question it would be increasingly circular to use today s policy mantra but according to the capital institute it would also be resilient sustainable and supportive of integrated economic social and environmental recoveries market mechanisms would remain central but would be nested within political social and economic systems that take longer term and pre financial priorities into account one example here would be the imposition of carbon taxes and linked tariffs self regulation will be vital instead of pursuing greater government regulation as the only realistic solution to markets run amok the capital institute concludes policymakers in a regenerative economy understand the importance of designing incentive driven self regulating systems that embody the critical balance between the freedom upon which innovation thrives and the constraints necessary for effective collaborative communities to work 23 take food production for instance while the eu s farm to fork strategy embraces agroecology to challenge industrialized organic farming the eu has yet to capitalize on regenerative agriculture progress toward regenerative economics could be made by linking the strategy more holistically to the eu biodiversity strategy for 2030 24 lessons can be learned from developments in the united states where some fast food chains are experimenting with a shift from feed lot cattle production which compacts and destroys soils to new forms of pasturing that mimic the movement of buffalo herds as soils recover they capture and store more atmospheric carbon opening up the possibility of harvesting carbon credits potentially creating virtuous regenerative cycles to ensure that the eu spurs market not just business innovation new policy frameworks will be essential for example the eu could adopt a carbon takeback obligation a policy instrument to ensure that carbon dioxide from fossil energy no longer ends up in the atmosphere 25 it would require producers and importers of fossil fuels such as oil coal and gas to permanently store an increasing percentage of the carbon extracted this can be done by among other things carbon capture and storage critical work is now being done in the pivotal discipline of economics economists like mariana mazzucato and kate raworth are among those investigating new ways of thinking about value 26 to get a better sense of what economic regeneration might involve in practice the green swans observatory developed by volans to help make business sense of the regenerative economy is also focusing on potential solutions through four lenses cities electricity food and money 27 futures lenses will also include education and security the sort of questions the observatory is raising include the following what would it take for buildings and cities to become increasingly indistinguishable from their ecological context how could electricity supply systems move toward and then beyond net zero carbon emissions how could agricultural systems regenerate rather than degenerate soils and surrounding ecosystems and how might financial markets fund the relevant transformations some parts of europe s economy may progress in good order but there are real question marks over the region s capacity to embrace the coming flood tide of new technologies and business models for example there are growing concerns that the eu lags in areas like autonomous vehicles robotics artificial intelligence and synthetic biology the eu green deal insists that reskilling will be crucial ideally leaving no one behind but for many reskilling will be fraught with structural and cultural hurdles educational systems must instill the ability to learn and relearn from an early age regenerative education practices enable people to nimbly self reskill to transition into the emerging regenerative economy 28 priority 3 export the regenerative economy model implementing the eu green deal will elicit unintended consequences some good some bad and some ugly the eu s relative safety nets and do no harm aspirations of the green deal can help mitigate negative outcomes internally however externalities including carbon leakage pollution displacement and human rights infractions abroad may well undercut any good regenerative outcomes and could exacerbate already widening climate injustices 29 meanwhile the stakeholder engagement challenge has only grown both inside and outside the eu the move toward more socially inclusive economies that espouse local ownership of the problems and solutions requires engaging previously excluded ethnic religious gender and minority groups and the poor as well as nature itself as a legal entity or even personality 30 in times of economic disruption the rewards will not simply go to the quick responders occasions will also arise for europe to draw on its inclusive legacy to generate comprehensive solutions including inclusive market opportunities abroad in the process the region can develop refine and export new models of regenerative economics but history suggests that the ultimate winners in times like these are often those with less to lose because they are less vested in the old order and readier to experiment and if new order insurgents increasingly outflank old order incumbents there is a real risk that europeans could become rule takers rather than rule makers while the eu needs to keep a focus on good governance accountability and transparency it should not stifle large scale innovation through heavy handed use of its precautionary principle 31 next steps it is clear that the responsibility oriented measures the eu has encouraged businesses to adopt in recent decades are necessary but no longer sufficient conditions for the long term success of decarbonization and economic sociopolitical and environmental regeneration efforts transparency accountability stakeholder engagement and supply chain initiatives are all crucial but on their own they are not turning the tide on our economic social environmental and governance challenges the eu must also work to build greater long term resilience into all its systems even if it is sometimes at the expense of efficiency 32 and ultimately the only way to do this is to actively restore the health of these systems to regenerate them here are five early actions europe needs to take make regeneration a central stated objective this will require harder edged policy instruments including clearly stated and effectively enforced national and regional carbon budgets it also demands a massive sustained investment in education and reskilling so starting at home how can the eu move beyond decarbonization to create tomorrow s regenerative economies how can it actively decolonize the future with its lifestyle related footprints unduly constraining the choices of future generations and how can the three dimensional mindset of responsibility resilience and regeneration be infused into europe s foreign policy aid programs and security systems prioritize multilateral solutions as the pressure to act on the climate emergency intensifies the likelihood of solutions like carbon border taxes triggering trade disputes will only grow but at a time when solutions at the level of the word trade organization seem improbable the need for clusters of countries to act in concert is increasingly clear europe has considerable potential leverage economically and politically but this needs to be carefully managed if trade disputes are not to devolve into intensifying public calls for protectionism achieving a climate version of the bretton woods agreement may seem impossible today but then so did that 1944 outcome even a few days before the final deal was signed work at all levels of government to shrink green premiums effective government action is now make or break with business leaders lobbying for action bill gates for example notes the urgent need to drive down green premiums the additional costs of choosing a cleaner technology payable on climate friendly solutions of all sorts 33 he concludes that 1 governments can use policies to either make the carbon based version of something more expensive make the clean version cheaper or ideally both 2 companies and investors can commit to buying and using cleaner alternatives such as through the re100 initiative for renewable electricity investing in research and development supporting clean energy entrepreneurs and start ups and advocating for helpful government policies and 3 individuals can help create markets for better cleaner alternatives these efforts he argues will drive investment in research which helps decrease the price and ultimately makes clean products more affordable and available for everyone prioritize the ecological emergency alongside the climate one there is no way to stabilize the climate without restoring natural systems at a global scale so how can the eu help regenerate biodiversity ecosystems and economies what instruments can the eu use in this endeavor from treasury to private finance and from military partnerships to civil society and perhaps controversially at a time of growing superpower tensions the eu could more deeply engage with china on its vision of an ecological civilization for mutual benefit 34 deliver local environmental quality improvements alongside global ones at a time when the links between air quality and health including mental health are increasingly painfully obvious every effort must be made to ensure european citizens experience early discernible improvements in their local environments as the region works to improve the global situation people may like to believe that they are all in this together but continuing and increasingly mainstreaming political support and investment will depend on a palpable sense that there are real returns on the short term sacrifices individual countries
