coming year diligent interest expense and balance sheet management high asset quality and a focus on efficiency supported quality earnings which were among the highest quarterly earnings in the company s history commercial banking reflected a gradual but steady return to more normal conditions and activity generating stable year over year interest income from commercial loans receivable we continue to build the commercial loan pipeline providing confidence that we will have growth opportunities in the coming quarters commercial real estate lending has been the strongest loan growth sector commercial industrial lending has been stable although it continues to reflect cautious attitudes among businesses and the fact that many are still drawing down on accumulated cash reserves to fund operations noninterest income for the past several quarters has been driven by exceptionally strong residential mortgage originations and subsequent gains on sale of mortgages to the secondary market rising rates lack of housing inventory and longer construction periods suggest a slowing of residential lending activity nonetheless we anticipate our superior service and digital capabilities will continue to support essa s leadership in residential mortgage lending and origination our bankers continued to efficiently serve customers through a variety of channels from digital delivery to safe personal interactions we believe fiscal 2022 first quarter results affirmed our commitment to reimagining the future of banking that will incorporate increased digital capabilities new ways of collaborating with customers less reliance on physical facilities and new ways to educate and communicate with customers during the first quarter the paycheck protection program ppp continued to wind down as loans were forgiven we recognized fees for making these loans in the first quarter and expect additional fee income in the second quarter as the program concludes with pandemic related risks and challenges lessening to some extent but still present we continue to operate with the strictest commitment to protecting the health and safety of employees and customers we continue to be mindful of economic conditions such as inflation supply chain issues that may affect some of our business customers and anticipated federal reserve interest rate increases many of the company s commercial

generally accepted in the united states of america gaap management periodically supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non gaap financial measures that are intended to provide the reader with additional perspectives on operating results financial condition and performance trends while facilitating comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions non gaap financial measures are not a substitute for gaap measures rather they should be read and used in conjunction with the company s gaap financial information the efficiency ratio is used as a common measure by banks as a comparable metric to understand the company s expense structure relative to its total revenue in other words for every dollar of total revenue recognized how much of that dollar is expended to improve the comparability of the ratio to our peers non core items are excluded to improve transparency and acknowledging that banks are not consistent in their definition of the efficiency ratio we include our calculation of this non gaap measure return on average assets before income tax provision provision for loan losses and goodwill impairment is a measure that the company uses to understand fundamental operating performance before these expenses used as a ratio relative to average assets we believe it demonstrates the core performance and can be viewed as an alternative measure of how efficiently the company services its asset base used as a ratio relative to average equity it can function as an alternative measure of the company s earnings performance in relationship to its equity tangible common equity and related measures are non gaap financial measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets net of deferred taxes and their related amortization these financial measures are useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently whether acquired or developed internally return on average tangible common equity is used by management and readers of our financial statements to understand how efficiently the company is deploying its common equity companies that are able to demonstrate more efficient use of common equity are more likely to be viewed favorably by current and prospective investors the company believes that disclosing these non gaap financial measures is both useful internally and is expected by our investors and analysts in order to understand the overall performance of the company other companies may calculate and define their non gaap financial measures and supplemental data differently a reconciliation of gaap financial measures to non gaap measures and other performance ratios as adjusted are included in table 8 in the following press release tables conference call and webcast equity chairman and

updated january 26 2022 at 6 49 pm et faced with mounting pressure from rapidly rising consumer prices the federal reserve is preparing to raise interest rates sooner and perhaps more aggressively than had been expected just a few months ago at the conclusion of a two day meeting wednesday fed chairman jerome powell signaled that he and his colleagues are likely to begin raising rates in march the central bank is trying to prevent stubbornly high inflation from becoming a permanent feature of the economy prices in december were up 7 from a year earlier the sharpest jump in nearly four decades inflation has persisted longer than we thought and of course we re prepared to use our tools to ensure that higher inflation does not become entrenched powell told reporters policymakers previously said they would wait to raise rates until the economy had reached maximum employment powell suggested that threshold has been met even though about 3 6 million fewer people are working now than were before the pandemic there is a pool of people out there who could come back into the labor force powell acknowledged but it s not happening very quickly and it may continue to not happen very quickly as long as the pandemic is on in the meantime the fed chairman has argued the central bank cannot afford to leave inflation unchecked to get the kind of very strong labor market we want with high participation it s going to take a long expansion powell told lawmakers this month and to get a long expansion we re going to need price stability frederic j brown afp via getty images afp via getty images a store in hollywood calif displays a sign showing a raised price for one of its offers consumer prices are rising at their fastest annual pace in nearly 40 years why inflation is on the rise prices during the pandemic have been far from stable consumers have spent freely thanks in part to generous government relief payments but with workers and supplies often scarce many businesses have struggled to keep pace with that demand the resulting price hikes have proved to be much more persistent than the fed initially expected much like the pandemic itself the price of new cars for example has jumped 12 in the past year as automakers have struggled with a shortage of semiconductors that s had a spillover effect in the used car market where prices have soared 37 the commerce department warned this week that it doesn t expect the semiconductor shortage to ease in the near future gasoline and groceries have also gotten more expensive price checkers point to elevated inflation in more than 2 out of every 3 categories the government tracks powell acknowledged that s particularly hard on people with limited incomes living paycheck to paycheck they re spending most or all of what they re earning on food rent gasoline powell said basic necessities so inflation right away right away forces people like that to make very difficult decisions raising interest rates would not solve the supply chain woes but is intended to tamp down consumer demand delphine touitou afp via getty images afp via getty images shelves at a supermarket in bethesda md look empty on jan 13 supply chain woes the spike in the omicron variant of the coronavirus and bad weather have been key factors behind the empty shelves seen at many supermarkets across the united states the fed is also pursuing other actions to fight inflation in addition to raising interest rates the fed is expected to gradually begin shrinking its portfolio of government debt and mortgage backed securities later this year doing so is another way to fight inflation by pushing up long term borrowing costs across the economy mortgage rates have already risen to their highest level since the start of the pandemic in anticipation of the central bank s moves investors concern about rising prices and the fed s response have contributed to extreme volatility in the stock market this week the fed expects inflation will cool this year provided the public health outlook improves easing shortages of both workers and supplies but powell acknowledged that similar hopes have been dashed in the past i don t think two years ago we thought we d still be having record levels of cases powell told lawmakers at the height of the omicron wave getting past the pandemic is the single most important thing we can do fed policymakers predicted in december that inflation would fall to around 2 6 by the end of this year less than half its current rate the fed s preferred yardstick for inflation is the commerce department s index of personal consumption expenditures which was 5 7 in november the central bank says it s prepared to adjust interest rates more or less aggressively if actual inflation turns out to be higher or lower than forecast we re going to have to be just very attentive to what s happening in the economy and willing to adapt pretty nimbly our policy as we go through the year powell said earlier this month copyright 2023 npr to see more visit
an early market rally gave way to a broad slide for stocks and a surge in bond yields wednesday after the federal reserve signaled it plans to begin raising interest rates soon to fight a spike in inflation that the central bank says is probably getting worse fed chair jerome powell took repeated questions about how and when the fed will start letting its balance sheet shrink after buying trillions of dollars of bonds through the pandemic the s p 500 fell 0 2 after giving up an early gain of 2 2 the yield on the 10 year treasury rose to 1 86 stocks fell giving up their gains from an early rally and treasury yields climbed wednesday as investors weighed the federal reserve s decision to leave its key interest rate unchanged while signaling that it plans to begin raising interest rates soon as the central bank moves to fight inflation in a statement issued after its latest policy meeting the fed said it expects it will soon be appropriate to raise rates though the statement didn t specifically mention march half the fed s policymakers have expressed a willingness to raise rates by then including some members who have long favored low rates to support hiring the fed also said it would phase out its monthly bond purchases which have been intended to lower longer term rates in march stock indexes initially rose then eased back to just below where they were before the fed s statement was released at 2 00 p m et then flipped into the red as fed chair jerome powell took repeated questions about how and when the central bank will start letting its balance sheet shrink after buying trillions of dollars of bonds through the pandemic powell said several times that policy makers have not set a timetable for when it will start reducing its balance sheet and that the fed sees short term rates as the main lever it will use to adjust monetary policy but he also acknowledged that the balance sheet is substantially larger than it needs to be and that the economy no longer needs to have such highly supportive action the s p 500 was down 0 4 as of 3 28 p m eastern the benchmark index had been up 2 2 earlier in the day the dow jones industrial average was down 206 points or 0 6 to 34 058 after having been up by more than 500 points the nasdaq was little changed after after having been up 3 4 earlier in the day the market had been solidly higher prior to the release of the fed statement a turnaround following several days of volatile swings as investors try to gauge whether the fed will succeed in its new effort to fight inflation the central bank had been widely expected to continue drawing back its stimulus measures ahead of raising interest rates in the coming months bond yields rose following the fed s statement the yield on the 10 year treasury rose to 1 84 from 1 78 from late tuesday pressure from inflation on businesses and consumers is what is driving the fed to raise interest rates this year there was some concern on wall street that powell could suggest that the central bank will raise interest rates this year more than the four times that most economists currently expect for nearly two years investors had poured money into stocks confident that the federal reserve would help keep share prices upright with that support going away markets have been hit with a bout of volatility the s p 500 is down 9 5 so far this year markets rose following the fed s last policy meeting in mid december it wasn t until three weeks later in early january that stocks turned jittery that s when minutes released from that meeting suggested fed policymakers may be more zealous about fighting inflation through higher interest rates than many had been expecting investors knew that higher rates were on the way but the minutes showed that the fed was likely to raise rates faster than in prior efforts to get rates back to normal perhaps more impactfully the fed also said it was likely to be quicker than in the past to reduce its huge holdings of bonds it had bought up through the pandemic to keep longer term interest rates low that would have a similar effect as additional rate increases the 11 sectors in the s p 500 turned lower with communication health care and industrial stocks weighing down the index the most strong earnings reports and financial forecasts underpinned gains for some stocks microsoft rose 2 1 after reporting standout results for its latest quarter on solid demand for its cloud computing services and work software chipmaker texas instruments rose 1 5 after giving investors a solid earnings report and financial forecast investors are also gauging the threat from covid 19 and the omicron wave s impact on economic growth the international monetary fund cited the omicron variant as the reason it downgraded its forecast for global economic growth this year wall street is also carefully watching the potential conflict between russia and ukraine which could push energy prices higher and force nations to focus on a war just as they are trying to focus on keeping the virus pandemic in check along with economic growth

barely started down the path toward the first elections conducted under voting restrictions enacted last year by republican lawmakers texas voters and local election officials have found themselves enveloped in a fog of errors delays and miscommunications as they navigate new rules for casting votes by mail only a small slice of the state s electorate is allowed to cast absentee ballots and the trickle of requests for mail in ballots that began in early january is now swelling into the usual pre election flood but hundreds of applications are being rejected in many cases because voters appear to not know the new rules local election workers themselves are still deciphering the procedures and say they ve been hampered by a paucity of help and information from the texas secretary of state s office meanwhile the state is scrambling to provide training under the crush of advising counties on implementing a multitude of election changes we are bombarded said yvonne ramon the hidalgo county elections administrator to try to review senate bill 1 alone was a monster and it wasn t just on us it was on the state it was on every at every level signed into law by gov greg abbott in september the voting law known as senate bill 1 contained an array of new restrictions on the state s voting process and narrowed local control of elections among its many provisions and the earliest to be tested are new rules for voting by mail absentee voters are now required to include a state identification number like a driver s license number or a partial social security number on their applications for a mail in ballot those numbers must match information in a voter s record or their application will be rejected regular mail in voters must submit new applications each year and when counties began accepting them this year the rejection rates were staggering hundreds of applications were deficient in some cases missing an id number in other cases voters had listed a number that didn t appear to be on file with the local elections office the secretary of state s office has been working to backfill its records to include both driver s license numbers and social security numbers for most voters but various texas counties including some of the state s largest did not know they were supposed to check the state s database along with their own when trying to validate an application election officials across the state said they either weren t aware the driver s license numbers had been uploaded to the state database known by election administrators as team or weren t aware that the new numbers would not sync with their local databases to them it appeared the numbers were missing from a voter s record there were several large counties that are offline that were not aware that they d have to go beyond their internal systems and i m one of them said chris davis the williamson county elections administrator counties that use a local database are known as offline counties the discrepancy helped drive an initial 50 rejection rate of applications in travis county the vast majority of which officials attributed to the new rules before offline counties learned the new driver s license numbers had not been pushed to their local databases the rejection rate had dropped to 27 in figures travis county clerk dana debeauvoir released tuesday though the total number of applications the county received had more than doubled by then the rejection issues led to a public spat between debeauvoir a democrat who criticized the state for not providing counties with comprehensive guidance and the secretary of state s office which zeroed in on the county s rejection of an unusually large share of applications in a press release calling on officials to correct erroneous rejections but the information gap over matching id numbers went beyond travis county while waiting to get clear instructions from the state vona hudson the election administrator in rural tom green county said she was running into id issues with 40 to 50 of the applications coming in hudson didn t get clarity on the syncing problems until a last minute webinar held by the secretary of state s office tuesday morning to address frequently asked questions about the new id requirements in a statement this week the governor s office put the blame for issues with the new rules on county officials erroneously interpreting the law instead of asking the state for assistance the bottom line is that counties should not be rejecting valid mail ballot applications said nan tolson a spokesperson for the governor the secretary of state s office will continue to work with counties across the state to combat the misinformation being spread by county election officials and ensure that all valid mail ballot applications are processed but beyond the confusion over how to match numbers early figures released by some of the state s largest counties showed that a bigger problem was applications coming in with no id numbers on them at all for example bexar county initially rejected 125 applications because voters provided a driver s license number that was not in their voter record while 200 were rejected because the id section was not filled out thirty applications were rejected because the voter submitted an outdated application form that didn t include the new id field of the 208 applications harris county initially rejected based on the new rules 137 were rejected because voters had not filled out the new id requirements as of jan 14 county officials said they had rejected another 172 applications that lacked id numbers in its update tuesday travis county said about half of the 509 applications it had rejected did not include any id information county officials said they were also hamstrung in how much education they could provide voters about the new requirements in sb 1 republican lawmakers made it a state jail felony for an election official to solicit the submission of an application to vote by mail if the voter did not request it a broad prohibition election officials said has made them fearful that once unremarkable voter outreach efforts could now be construed as criminal sb 1 also made it a state jail felony for local election officials to proactively send applications to voters who did not request them even if voters automatically qualify to vote by mail because of age political parties can still send out unsolicited applications on their own dime it s understandable if you re focusing on what s most important in a given week or a given month that you might lose track of some of these other issues and i think that goes for secretary of state as well remi garza the president of the texas association of election administrators said of the miscommunication between the state and the counties but this was a foreseeable situation said garza who serves as the elections administrator for cameron county voting rights advocates have panned state republican leadership over the issues both because the problems were forewarned and because the law s implementation date has not allowed election officials enough time to roll out its new requirements over the last year advocates questioned how voters were expected to know which id number might be on their voter record when they aren t required to provide both while registering to vote lawmakers bear the responsibility to foresee problems in the implementation of a law said james slattery a senior staff attorney with the texas civil rights project who testified on the id issues at the legislature they are now reaping what they ve sown said slattery though i should say it s really the voter reaping what they ve sown which is the tragedy of all this at the moment it s the voters that are facing the consequences texas election officials have had a relatively short window to implement sb 1 s raft of requirements the legislation was passed in the fall instead of the spring s regular legislative session the state and counties were also redrawing political boundaries that election officials then needed to incorporate into their systems interpreting the law and providing guidance on how to enforce it falls to the secretary of state the state s chief elections officer whose office in the last few months has been responsible for updating hundreds of election forms revising various handbooks for election workers creating checklists and advisories to address various changes to the ballot counting process and providing technical and legal support to both party and county officials ahead of the primaries the compressed timeline has specifically compounded the challenges around the new id requirements the state was responsible for the creation of a new online portal mail in voters can use to track and fix issues with their applications and ballots but when the new online system launched mid january counties had not yet received training from the state on how to use it the secretary of state s office hosted its first webinar for counties on how to use the ballot tracker on thursday a week after it went live the office had also created a new form for county officials to use to inform voters of defective applications with instructions on how to fix errors including through the new tracker on the state s website but the letter pointed voters to a voting homepage that until last week lacked a direct link to the tracker a spokesperson for the secretary of state s office said earlier this month that they were in the process of updating the layout of the website additionally the revised application for a mail in ballot and the specialized envelope to return completed ballots which now must also include the id numbers were not finalized until december this meant county officials were unable to order updated mailing materials until soon before they needed to start sending them to voters tarrant county felt the time crunch in preparing to mail out ballots to overseas voters which counties were required to do by jan 15 speaking before the county commissioners court last week elections administrator heider garcia said the envelopes weren t delivered to the election office until the afternoon before the deadline there have been a lot of things with these changes to the law that have been kind of a photograph finish over the last few weeks garcia said at the hearing the pressure to implement the law has been felt intensely by election administrators in counties that are running local special elections before the march primary in tom green county hudson has been scrambling to obtain updated materials for a jan 29 election to fill a spot on the san angelo city council the county has been waiting on its printing vendor who has been waiting on an order of the specific paper stock needed to print the voting materials the new id rules have also forced new specialized printing jobs of the applications and envelopes for mail in ballots so that they can be sealed to protect a voter s sensitive information while the materials travel through the mail when she couldn t get new applications from the vendor in time hudson made xerox copies of a print out on regular paper and mailed them to voters with a postage paid self addressed envelope to place them in when it became clear she wouldn t receive the revised ballot envelopes with enough time to get them to voters she created a separate document for voters to record their id numbers that she s sending out with old envelopes hudson said the implementation of sb 1 has left her between a rock and a hard place her proposed resolution means she can t use the state s prescribed forms but she knows the voters in her county who rely on mail in ballots including many who are homebound won t be able to participate in the election otherwise i think all of us including the secretary of state are kind of in a perfect storm if you will trying to get this implemented as quickly as we can when also facing shortages in equipment paper hudson said i wouldn t want to be implementing as much as the secretary of the state is having to do but do i wish we had gotten some things a little faster absolutely because i think it would be better for our voters disclosure the texas secretary of state has been a financial supporter of the texas

after months of covid policies and growing inflation the central bank will begin phasing out its monthly bond purchases intended to lower long term rates example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington the federal reserve signaled wednesday that it plans to begin raising its benchmark interest rate as soon as march a key step in reversing its pandemic era low rate policies that have fueled hiring and growth but also escalated inflation with high inflation squeezing consumers and businesses and unemployment falling steadily the fed also said it would phase out its monthly bond purchases which have been intended to lower longer term rates in march the central bank s actions are sure to make a wide range of borrowing from mortgages and credit cards to auto loans and corporate credit costlier over time those higher borrowing costs in turn could slow consumer spending and hiring the gravest risk is that the fed s abandonment of low rates could trigger another recession in a statement issued after its latest policy meeting the fed it expects it will soon be appropriate to raise rates though the statement didn t specifically mention march half the fed s policymakers have expressed a willingness to raise rates by then including some members who have long favored low rates to support hiring by raising rates the fed will be betting that it can slow inflation without weakening the economy too much speaking at a news conference chair jerome powell expressed his view as he has before that controlling inflation is itself vital to a strong job market the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains powell said is to promote a long expansion and that will require price stability i think there s quite a bit of room he added to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market this is by so many measures an historically tight labor market the fed on wednesday also set out principles it will follow once it decides to reduce its nearly 9 trillion in bond holdings a sum that has more than doubled since the pandemic struck nearly two years ago some analysts expect the fed to begin doing so as soon as july a move that would contribute to tighter credit the central bank s latest policy statement follows dizzying gyrations in the stock market as investors have been gripped by fear and uncertainty over just how fast and far the fed will go to reverse its low rate policies which have nurtured the economy and the markets for years the broad s p 500 index fell nearly 10 this month before rebounding slightly wednesday stock prices which had been solidly higher before powell spoke tumbled during his news conference the market swoon coincided with powell acknowledgement that the fed s balance sheet is substantially larger than it needs to be and that the economy no longer requires such highly supportive action that suggested that the fed might act sooner and faster than expected to shrink its balance sheet which would contribute to tighter credit conditions the fed s bond purchases which have swollen the central bank s balance sheet had been intended to reduce longer term interest rates to spur borrowing and spending many investors also saw the bond buying as helping fuel stock market gains by pouring cash into the financial system asked about the stock market s wild volatility powell stressed that the fed s ultimate focus is on the real economy but he added we feel like the communications we have with market participants and the general public are working monetary policy works significantly through expectations high inflation has become a serious political threat to president joe biden and congressional democrats with republicans pointing to rising prices as one of their principal lines of attack as they look toward the november elections yet biden said last week that it was appropriate for powell to adjust the fed s policies and congressional republicans have endorsed powell s plans to raise rates providing the fed with rare bipartisan support for tightening credit earlier this month minutes of the fed s december meeting revealed that the central bank was considering reducing its bond holdings by not replacing bonds that mature a more aggressive step than merely ending its purchases the impact of the reducing the fed s bond stockpile isn t well known but the last time that the fed raised rates and reduced its balance sheet simultaneously was in 2018 the s p 500 stock index fell 20 in three months by not replacing some of its bond holdings the fed in effect reduces demand for treasuries this raises their yields and makes borrowing more expensive some analysts have said they aren t sure how big the impact on interest rates will be or how much the fed will rely on reducing its balance sheet to affect interest rates all of which means the powell fed faces a delicate and even risky balancing act if the stock market is engulfed by more chaotic declines economists say the fed might decide to delay some of its credit tightening plans modest drops in share prices though won t likely affect the fed s thinking some economists have expressed concern that the fed is already moving too late to combat high inflation others say they worry that the fed may act too aggressively they argue that numerous rate hikes could unnecessarily slow hiring in this view high prices mostly reflect snarled supply chains that the fed s rate hikes are powerless to cure this week s fed meeting comes against the backdrop of not only high inflation consumer prices have surged 7 in the past year the fastest pace in nearly four decades but also an economy gripped by another wave of covid 19 infections powell has acknowledged that he failed to foresee the persistence of high inflation having long expressed the belief that it would prove temporary the inflation spike has broadened to areas beyond those that were affected by supply shortages to apartment rents for example which suggests it could endure even after goods and parts flow more freely

square books on oxford s courthouse square at street level this is the building the store has been in since the 1980s gif by kate kimberlin the daily mississippian when walking around oxford s courthouse square the red brick book filled windows and stone marquee reading square books are hard to miss it s hard to believe that such a charming and welcoming building is a cornerstone for storytellers in the south and how long the store has been giving authors this platform square books and its branches just like any other brick and mortar bookstore have not been immune to the changing book buying landscape amazon the ongoing pandemic and supply chain issues with publishers have all been a part of a list of issues that most bookstores have been facing over the past couple of years despite this the family of four bookstores with rare square books making its most recent addition in 2020 seems to be unshaken by the challenges that have landed on their front door a sign at the front door of square books encourages patrons to wear a mask the square books businesses are some of the only businesses on the square that require a mask gif by kate kimberlin the daily mississippian an ever present companion in the year of being alone the city of oxford and the state of mississippi have seen their own challenges since the beginning of the pandemic in march of 2020 and the family of bookstores that have found their homes around the square have not been immune to these challenges with the constant changes made at city and state level richard howorth one of the owners and founders of the family of square books stores said that the stores simply did what they could at the beginning well you know necessity is the mother of invention and we really just tried to take everything one day at a time howorth said before the pandemic square books primarily focused on selling books at their storefront they had a functioning website but not one that kept up with their current stock on hand and no way to deliver books this was the first of many changes that the team at square books had to adapt to in the pivot howorth said that they saw an increase in the number of gift cards bought in march 2020 when everything began to shut down we saw we had twice as many sales in gift cards last year than we had this year and that s because people wanted to support us and knew that they could use a gift card a month later howorth said both richard howorth and his wife business partner were thankful for the wave of support that appeared during the pandemic although there wasn t any lack of support before march 2020 they were touched by the gesture during this hard time this is not the case for most american bookstores according to a vox article citing the american bookstore association 35 member stores have closed since october of 2020 i think there s a lot to be said about the support we got during the first part of the pandemic howorth said both howorth and his wife business partner were thankful for the wave of support that appeared during the pandemic although there wasn t any lack of support before march 2020 they were touched by the gesture during this hard time amazingly we ve had really consistent great community support and now we have a lot of tourist support it s amazing that we ve been able to do that during the pandemic lisa howorth the co founder of the original bookstore and richard howorth s wife said despite the fair share of support square books had faced challenges up to current times lisa howorth said that the two biggest setbacks that the store has had were the opening of the barnes and noble at the university in the early 2000s and the launching of amazon in 1995 lisa howorth emphasized the importance of supporting local brick and mortar stores regardless of what they sell if you don t support your brick and mortar independent stores in your town you re not going to have them and that includes places like sneed s hardware stores you know nelson s department store all kinds of stuff all kinds of businesses and of course it affects us but we kind of clambered out of the original setback lisa howorth said like many independent bookstores all prior setbacks came to a head in march 2020 general manager at square books for over 20 years lyn roberts said she had a similar experience that many students had i went away for spring break and then came back and like a day later we shut down roberts said on march 18 2020 the business took to instagram to announce that because of covid 19 all in store business would be suspended until further notice the post encouraged supporters of the store to continue to purchase books through other methods whether that be shipping over the phone or local deliveries we embrace the challenge ahead to be smart be safe and be done with this virus the post said roberts said that the most frightening part of the weeks after was how little was known about the virus on all ends we didn t really know how long this was going to last i had a good idea about how long the store can last without business what sort of reserves we have and we just didn t know whether the pandemic was gonna last longer than that roberts said numbers continued to fluctuate with online and eventually in store sales as early as june of last year this shows up in a more recent report that the american bookstore association a nonprofit organization for booksellers did to track numbers on black friday small business saturday and cyber monday in 2021 the report cited highest annual spike in online traffic and sales revenue for the year and said that e commerce bookstore sales were up 217 51 despite numbers continuing to fluctuate over the next couple of months and years roberts said that there was an international scale of support that had been outpoured since the initial shift in march we have customers all over the world and we ship things and everyone was very supportive then and i don t think that was just us i think people were very sort of outgoing and very supportive of local independent businesses roberts said in the onslaught of the pandemic roberts believes that many people have realized the value in local businesses especially local and independent bookstores i think more people recognize that local independent businesses are actually sort of the backbone of the economy and certainly of communities roberts said that s really kind of what makes some communities special is their independent stores that they have that sense of community and coming together was extraordinary a shelf inside square books this section is near the restored balcony that richard howorth planned when the store first moved into the building gif by kate kimberlin the daily mississippian these four walls and beyond a cornerstone of the store has been its support of authors far and wide often bringing these successful authors to the store s readers in oxford founding director of the center for southern studies and culture at the university of mississippi bill ferris took his position around the same time square books opened in 1979 bill was a friend and an ardent supporter of the store and he was very well connected richard howorth said ferris s connections in the literary world and love for southern culture brought authors like toni morrison other authors all come to the bookstore interact with readers and in many cases teach a semester at the university through various programs while ace atkins former pulitzer prize nominee known for his quinn coulson novels became a guest lecturer for the school of journalism in 2001 he followed suit with many of the other authors that have come to oxford i did not intend on staying but a semester turned into two and that turned into a few years and my wife and i bought a house atkins said atkins said that while he knew people in oxford before he decided to take the teaching position he was eventually drawn to the career from the support square books had given him since the beginning of his writing career square books was one of the very first bookstores to hand sell me and that s what initially brought me to oxford atkins said we ve had a connection with them being really you know great proponents for my stories as an established and well published author atkins recognized the changes the industry has faced in the 20 years since he began writing even with the rise and proverbial fall of conglomerates like and barnes and noble the community that comes with local independent bookstores is something that can t be found anywhere else i think what you get at an independent bookstore is you have people that know their stuff and i m not saying every independent bookstore is that way but the best ones are atkins said despite many independent bookstores not being able to survive the pandemic many bookstores have pushed through just because of the community they make and that people value i love walking into square books and coming out with something i never even heard of atkins said i think that s what the local independent bookstore does that you cannot get online and you certainly can t get from a chain place while atkins is a supporter of independent bookstores he also mentioned what stores like square books mean for publishers financially i do feel like the publisher is better off selling through an independent bookstore than they are to sell to a place like amazon because they re so demanding and take a larger percentage they don t get as much money out of an amazon sale as they do if they re being sold by five independent stores atkins said in the wake of pandemic induced zoom events that many bookstores including square books have hosted over the last 21 months atkins said that authors physically coming and meeting their readers and booksellers in person is much more valuable you know you not only meet the owners and the booksellers themselves but also to meet the people who are excited about your new book coming out atkins said i think it s a way of really kind of paying your respect to the bookstores that work so hard for you another long time friend of the bookstore award winning legal novelist john grisham shares the same love for independent bookstores he even was told that indies were important to his success when he first began publishing i have a strong bias in favor of independent bookstores first i love them i love to buy books in the indies to eat and drink to hang out with booksellers and the people who run the stores and to say hello to readers grisham said when asked one message he wanted to give to um students who are looking to become writers he said to cherish the store to um students you have easy access to one of the greatest bookstores in the world enjoy it even savor it because one day soon you ll miss it grisham said the section for ace atkins at square books atkin s is also a patron of the store gif by kate kimberlin the daily mississippian commitment to the community additionally atkins and grisham said that without square books hosting their in person events they might not have been able to meet many writers that they were able to have a conversation with and relate to just like any other attendee i ve met so many great writers that have come through here like jay mcinerney and i ve been able to relate with and talk with and so i think that s just great for the community i don t think everyone has that community atkins said we re kind of spoiled here at oxford as far as the kind of talent that just comes here on a random thursday night grisham who has been a friend of square books for 35 years said that he attended many of the bookstore s signature events in the late 80s there was a lively literary culture still is and everything revolved around square books willie morris was the writer in residence at ole miss barry hannah was teaching larry brown had just broken out and his career was taking off grisham said richard and lisa knew the publishers and pulled strings to get the big writers who were touring i met many of them on the porch upstairs looking out over the square i spent a lot of time up there drinking coffee and dreaming of getting published the store still continues to support a myriad of student programs even in the face of its own challenges in the days before the pandemic off square books hosted anything from students reading their own plays to masters of fine arts presentations that are required of the program this has continued as much as possible and has helped numerous students like ph d student joshua nyguen nyguen a current ph d student for english at the university and multi awarding winning poet and writer was scheduled to have an event at the bookstore of his own at the beginning of october it got postponed however due to supply chain issues with his publisher thankfully he was still able to have his first ever book signing at the beginning of november it was the first time seeing my book stacked like a bookstore it was very exciting nyguen said this was not nyguen s first time sharing his writing with the bookstore as a former mfa student he attended events like broken english a showcase for all graduating english mfa students he said that this event is one of many ways that they can come in contact with local writers as well as support the community they re very open they re always open to host the third year reading at the end of the year which is a big deal and they re always supportive of any books that

we hope you love the products we recommend all of them were independently selected by our editors just so you know buzzfeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them oh and fyi prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication thanks to the utter travesty that is sex education in america and the lack of realism in porn or really any media depictions of sex sexual pleasure can be hard to come by without some serious research and exploration if you re interested in taking the steps to learn what you might actually like it may be time to bring on the sex toys we still live in a culture that tends to normalize certain kinds of sex and make that expected for everyone said carol queen staff sexologist at good vibrations a sex positive adult toy shop founded in 1977 many people don t understand even now that the clitoris for people who have one is the focus of sexual sensation and the path to orgasm many people think it s the vagina and while plenty of people love vaginal penetration it s not the primary way most people with vaginas orgasm in fact a 2017 study of more than 1 000 people ages 18 to 94 published in the journal of sex marital therapy found that only 18 percent of people with vulvas could orgasm from internal stimulation alone aside from targeting the clitoris there are countless other ways to arouse people no matter what lies below the belt our whole body is covered in nerve endings so we can experience pleasure in our whole body not just genitals brooklyn based sex therapist carolanne marcantonio explained oftentimes we go right for the genitals but there s a whole world of pleasure to experience from head to toe the number of nerve endings on your body vary which is why some areas may feel more sensitive than others but marcantonio maintains that the brain is the largest erogenous zone how to find choose and use sex toys people s erotic interests and curiosity are the biggest guideposts to what they might like said queen who has a phd in sexology from the institute for advanced study of human sexuality in discussing how to find props that work for you if you re turned on to the idea of playing with just about anything it s a sex toy that said she emphasizes that it s not safe to insert or use just any item you find around the house on your body instead queen recommends visiting sex toy shops that were founded to make better quality sexual products available especially to women marcantonio started her career on the sales floor at sex toy shop babeland which requires a monthlong training in the anatomy of pleasure and how to use appropriate language to respect customers genders expressions and sexualities visiting a sex shop is a great way to find inspiration and consult with knowledgeable staff before making a purchase if you don t find exactly what you re looking for in stores or want to compare different brands and types of products you can then take your search online these days you can also find sex toys at mainstream stores in the two years since erica minor became the marketing and communications manager intimate lifestyle company lelo has partnered with brands like anthropologie urban outfitters and neiman marcus we really work hard especially with our marketing campaigns to break down the shame and stigma around sex and pleasure but also provide representation minor said in the past it s only been socially acceptable for a certain minority of the population to talk about sex and express themselves sexually so we really want to open that up to everybody regardless of their sexual expression gender identity race or sex i love being able to introduce people to the many ways you can use these vibrators said julia lopez lead product engineer at dame people assume it s just one way but men love vibrators too queen agrees whatever you got whatever you call it anybody might like vibration she said in terms of use most modern sex toys are fairly versatile in how they can come into play whether used solo or partnered we re only limited by how limited our creativity is marcantonio said the sky s the limit so really anything can be a couple s toy anything there are also toys that target multiple erogenous zones to help facilitate blended orgasms which are not as likely to occur from penetration alone blended orgasms are when more than one erogenous area gets stimulated at the same time and it can increase the odds of orgasm or strong orgasm queen said that thinking allows for us to sort of normalize and explore toys during intercourse or other kinds of sex play to add to the experience not only can incorporating toys into partnered sex lead to more satisfying experiences but stepping outside of your comfort zone in a safe space may also have the added benefit of strengthening your connection with a partner exploring the building of trust and bonding and communication is also a heightened way to experience and build your coupledom marcantonio said what materials are best for sex toys it s essential for any sex toy to be made of something hypoallergenic and nonporous substances that are able to break down or contain irritants should be avoided that list may include jelly rubber which is made from polyvinyl chloride or other compounds that could contain phthalates which are potentially carcinogenic chemicals added to plastics to give them flexibility and longevity a lot of sex toys have been made with that and because sex toys aren t regulated there s no one telling companies not to use it lopez said it s kind of on the consumer to make sure they are looking up what material the product is made out of and pretty much every website will tell you what material it is and then making sure that material is a stable nontoxic one experts agree that silicone is the way to go particularly medical grade silicone though borosilicate glass which is shatterproof and medical grade stainless steel are also good options if you re interested in temperature play however keep in mind that some types of lubricants can break down sex toys made of silicone so use a water based product in those cases how to clean sex toys another perk of silicone is that you can sometimes boil them once you remove the motor for maximum disinfection though in most cases a sex toy cleaner or mild soap and warm water will be sufficient if you do choose to opt for a toy cleaner queen advises against using any with triclosan which is an antibacterial compound that can be absorbed through your skin or mouth toy cleaners are usable on those made from stainless steel or shatterproof glass as well but the soap and water method should be sufficiently effective for any kind of waterproof sex toy
updated january 26 2022 at 6 49 pm et faced with mounting pressure from rapidly rising consumer prices the federal reserve is preparing to raise interest rates sooner and perhaps more aggressively than had been expected just a few months ago at the conclusion of a two day meeting wednesday fed chairman jerome powell signaled that he and his colleagues are likely to begin raising rates in march the central bank is trying to prevent stubbornly high inflation from becoming a permanent feature of the economy prices in december were up 7 from a year earlier the sharpest jump in nearly four decades inflation has persisted longer than we thought and of course we re prepared to use our tools to ensure that higher inflation does not become entrenched powell told reporters policymakers previously said they would wait to raise rates until the economy had reached maximum employment powell suggested that threshold has been met even though about 3 6 million fewer people are working now than were before the pandemic there is a pool of people out there who could come back into the labor force powell acknowledged but it s not happening very quickly and it may continue to not happen very quickly as long as the pandemic is on in the meantime the fed chairman has argued the central bank cannot afford to leave inflation unchecked to get the kind of very strong labor market we want with high participation it s going to take a long expansion powell told lawmakers this month and to get a long expansion we re going to need price stability frederic j brown afp via getty images afp via getty images a store in hollywood calif displays a sign showing a raised price for one of its offers consumer prices are rising at their fastest annual pace in nearly 40 years why inflation is on the rise prices during the pandemic have been far from stable consumers have spent freely thanks in part to generous government relief payments but with workers and supplies often scarce many businesses have struggled to keep pace with that demand the resulting price hikes have proved to be much more persistent than the fed initially expected much like the pandemic itself the price of new cars for example has jumped 12 in the past year as automakers have struggled with a shortage of semiconductors that s had a spillover effect in the used car market where prices have soared 37 the commerce department warned this week that it doesn t expect the semiconductor shortage to ease in the near future gasoline and groceries have also gotten more expensive price checkers point to elevated inflation in more than 2 out of every 3 categories the government tracks powell acknowledged that s particularly hard on people with limited incomes living paycheck to paycheck they re spending most or all of what they re earning on food rent gasoline powell said basic necessities so inflation right away right away forces people like that to make very difficult decisions raising interest rates would not solve the supply chain woes but is intended to tamp down consumer demand delphine touitou afp via getty images afp via getty images shelves at a supermarket in bethesda md look empty on jan 13 supply chain woes the spike in the omicron variant of the coronavirus and bad weather have been key factors behind the empty shelves seen at many supermarkets across the united states the fed is also pursuing other actions to fight inflation in addition to raising interest rates the fed is expected to gradually begin shrinking its portfolio of government debt and mortgage backed securities later this year doing so is another way to fight inflation by pushing up long term borrowing costs across the economy mortgage rates have already risen to their highest level since the start of the pandemic in anticipation of the central bank s moves investors concern about rising prices and the fed s response have contributed to extreme volatility in the stock market this week the fed expects inflation will cool this year provided the public health outlook improves easing shortages of both workers and supplies but powell acknowledged that similar hopes have been dashed in the past i don t think two years ago we thought we d still be having record levels of cases powell told lawmakers at the height of the omicron wave getting past the pandemic is the single most important thing we can do fed policymakers predicted in december that inflation would fall to around 2 6 by the end of this year less than half its current rate the fed s preferred yardstick for inflation is the commerce department s index of personal consumption expenditures which was 5 7 in november the central bank says it s prepared to adjust interest rates more or less aggressively if actual inflation turns out to be higher or lower than forecast we re going to have to be just very attentive to what s happening in the economy and willing to adapt pretty nimbly our policy as we go

by katie pask soranews24 when it comes to the term convenience store it s hard to think of a place where they live up to their name better than right here in japan whether you re in the market for a tasty snack or something to drink your local convenience store has always got your back but while convenience stores are full of food drinks and other amenities they aren t the first place that springs to mind when people think of specialty stores for example if you were struck by a sudden urge to drink craft beer you might find yourself looking up breweries nearby luckily those who live near the yokohama hammerhead complex in kanagawa prefecture need look no further than their local convenience store which has over three hundred different craft beers in stock from all over the world yokohama hammerhead is a seaside shopping complex located about 12 minutes away from yokohama s minato mirai station yokohama hammerhead is a stylish bayside complex that is also a popular sightseeing spot and also doubles up as a cruise ship terminal it was at around 7 a m that our reporter haruka takagi strolling around the bay spotted the convenience store in question while it might not be immediately clear the store in question is a famous american chain of convenience stores with two numbers in its name and rhymes with schmeven eleven the convenience store may look like a regular run of the mill store there s the usual supply of things like ice cream and snacks but that s not why haruka was there no haruka had heard a rumor that this very convenience store might be home to the widest selection of a certain thing in all of japan and as haruka wandered around the store her eyes came across a colorful cabinet yes this was a convenience store with an impressive selection of craft beers at a quick glance haruka counted around 50 varieties of craft beer with brands from both japan and abroad and while haruka was impressed with the sheer amount of beer available certainly a considerable amount more than your average convenience store selection but haruka didn t have much time to marvel at the large variety of beers on offer before she spotted a sign nearby but wait there s more beers from japan and around the world the sign promised even more craft beers and provided a mini map to their location so haruka made her way to the back left corner of the store to continue her craft beer adventure even more refrigerated cans plus a selection of bottled beers with some beer snacks close by according to haruka the photos she took don t even come close to capturing just how much beer was available in this store the sheer variety of craft beer was much more than that of even a liquor store and she couldn t help but wonder about the person who owned such a convenience store surely it was someone who loved beer as much as haruka loves wine so haruka hunted down the owner mr nakayama and asked him a few questions haruka this is a little different than your average convenience store why so many beers nakayama well when the yokohama hammerhead first opened back in 2019 this was originally just a regular convenience store with a couple of yokohama souvenirs but we weren t selling much and then the coronavirus hit a few months after we opened and our sales got even worse haruka yokohama now that i think of it the diamond princess quarantined cruise ship was stuck in yokohama too right nakayama right our store is mostly aimed at tourists and once covid 19 hit japan the number of tourists dropped it got so bad that we had to close the store and while we were closed we came up with a plan to drum up business that s when we came up with the idea to sell craft beer haruka so the idea didn t necessarily come about because you re a huge fan of craft beers nakayama not at all in fact i hardly used to drink at all but beer always sells well and yokohama is said to be the birth place of japanese beer so i thought why not haruka i m pretty surprised that someone who isn t into beer decided to open a specialty craft beer convenience store nakayama well since re opening the store i ve fallen in love with craft beer i m pretty addicted to it now haha haruka so what made you decide to have such a huge selection nakayama there s a brewery here in yokohama called yokohama beer we started selling their products and from there we got in touch with more and more breweries and beer importers we set a goal to be the best beer convenience store in japan haruka i really don t think you d find a store with such a wide selection like this anywhere else in japan it s like a paradise for beer lovers nakayama it s a place where beer lovers and also newcomers are welcome specialist craft beer stores can be a bit intimidating to some people especially if you re not familiar with craft beer as we are also a convenience store we hope people can come in and look around at their own pace we hope our store can act as a starting point to anyone wanting to get into craft beer haruka by the way how often do you change the line up of beers on sale nakayama we restock about three or four times a week and the turnover is quite fast we probably have a whole new selection of beers every one to two months haruka that makes it quite hard to find your favorite beer then right nakayama perhaps but just choosing and sticking with one kind of beer is a waste there are so many different flavors of craft beer available so it might be fun to try out a new flavor every now and then you can have fun picking a new beer by its flavor or where it s from or even what the can looks like depending on when you visit the store can have between 300 to 500 different varieties of beer on sale some beers are rare and difficult to procure even in the countries where they originally came from so mr nakayama recommended that haruka take her time choosing the right beer and to treat the experience like a sort of treasure hunt haruka tested four completely different craft beers from all around the world and not only got to enjoy some delicious drinks but also learned that there s a whole world of beers outside her stereotypical image of what a beer should be she recommends this store whether you re a fan of craft beer or not as it s a good chance to experience new flavors and tastes and who knows you might even end up falling in love with craft beer like mr nakayama did read more stories from soranews24 here s what happens if you buy all the drinks in the combini and mix them together video sapporo breweries reveals ginza brown the only beer in the world

the federal reserve signaled wednesday that it plans to begin raising its benchmark interest rate as soon as march a key step in reversing its pandemic era low rate policies that have fueled hiring and growth but also escalated inflation with high inflation squeezing consumers and businesses and unemployment falling steadily the fed also said it would phase out its monthly bond purchases which have been intended to lower longer term rates in march in a statement issued after its latest policy meeting the fed it expects it will soon be appropriate to raise rates though the statement didn t specifically mention march half the fed s policymakers have expressed a willingness to raise rates by then including some members who have long favored low rates to support hiring speaking at a news conference chair jerome powell expressed his view as he has before that controlling inflation is vital to a strong job market we believe that the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains powell said is to promote a long expansion and that will require price stability file a view of the marriner s eccles federal reserve building on jan 26 2022 in washington dc the fed on wednesday also set out principles it will follow once it decides to reduce its nearly 9 trillion in bond holdings a sum that has more than doubled since the pandemic struck nearly two years ago some analysts expect the fed to begin doing so as soon as july a move that would contribute to tighter credit the central bank s actions are sure to make a wide range of borrowing from mortgages and credit cards to auto loans and corporate credit costlier over time those higher borrowing costs in turn could slow consumer spending and hiring the gravest risk is that the fed s abandonment of low rates could trigger another recession the central bank s latest policy statement follows dizzying gyrations in the stock market as investors have been gripped by fear and uncertainty over just how fast and far the fed will go to reverse its low rate policies which have nurtured the economy and the markets for years the broad s p 500 index fell nearly 10 this month before rebounding slightly wednesday high inflation has also become a serious political threat to president joe biden and congressional democrats with republicans pointing to rising prices as one of their principal lines of attack as they look toward the november elections yet biden said last week that it was appropriate for powell to adjust the fed s policies and congressional republicans have endorsed powell s plans to raise rates providing the fed with rare bipartisan support for tightening credit the fed s bond purchases have been intended to reduce longer term interest rates to spur borrowing and spending many investors also saw the bond buying as helping fuel stock market gains by pouring cash into the financial system earlier this month minutes of the fed s december meeting revealed that the central bank was considering reducing its bond holdings by not replacing bonds that mature a more aggressive step than merely ending its purchases the impact of the reducing the fed s bond stockpile isn t well known but the last time that the fed raised rates and reduced its balance sheet simultaneously was in 2018 the s p 500 stock index fell 20 in three months by not replacing some of its bond holdings the fed in effect reduces demand for treasuries this raises their yields and makes borrowing more expensive some analysts have said they aren t sure how big the impact on interest rates will be or how much the fed will rely on reducing its balance sheet to affect interest rates all of which means the powell fed faces a delicate and even risky balancing act if the stock market is engulfed by more chaotic declines economists say the fed might decide to delay some of its credit tightening plans modest drops in share prices though won t likely affect the fed s thinking some economists have expressed concern that the fed is already moving too late to combat high inflation others say they worry that the fed may act too aggressively they argue that numerous rate hikes could unnecessarily slow hiring in this view high prices mostly reflect snarled supply chains that the fed s rate hikes are powerless to cure this week s fed meeting comes against the backdrop of not only high inflation consumer prices have surged 7 in the past year the fastest pace in nearly four decades but also an economy gripped by another wave of covid 19 infections powell has acknowledged that he failed to foresee the persistence of high inflation having long expressed the belief that it would prove temporary the inflation spike has broadened to areas beyond those that were affected by supply shortages to apartment rents for example which suggests it could endure even after goods and parts flow more freely

non gaap financial measures to supplement the companyâ s unaudited selected financial results calculated in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles â œgaapâ the company discloses certain non gaap financial measures that exclude stock based compensation and other items including gross profit non gaap operating expenses non gaap operating profit non gaap net income non gaap and earnings per diluted ads non gaap these non gaap measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to gaap and may be different from non gaap measures used by other companies we believe that these non gaap measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with the companyâ s results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the companyâ s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable gaap measure we compensate for the limitations of our non gaap financial measures by relying upon gaap results to gain a complete picture of our performance our non gaap financial measures are provided to enhance the userâ s overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future specifically we believe the non gaap results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non gaap results exclude certain expenses gains and losses that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results and because they are consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the company we use non gaap measures to evaluate the operating performance of our business for comparison with our forecasts and for benchmarking our performance externally against our competitors also when evaluating potential acquisitions we exclude the items described below from our consideration of the targetâ s performance and valuation since we find these measures to be useful we believe that our investors benefit from seeing the results from managementâ s perspective in addition to seeing our gaap results we believe that these non gaap measures when read in conjunction with the companyâ s gaap financials provide useful information to investors by offering the ability to make more meaningful period to period comparisons of the companyâ s on going operating results the ability to better identify trends in the companyâ s underlying business and perform related trend analysis a better understanding of how management plans and measures the companyâ s underlying business and an easier way to compare the companyâ s operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of our competitors that supplement their gaap results with non gaap financial measures the following are explanations of each of the adjustments that we incorporate into our non gaap measures as well as the reasons for excluding each of these individual items in our reconciliation of these non gaap financial measures stock based compensation expense consists of non cash charges related to the fair value of restricted stock units awarded to employees the company believes that the exclusion of these non cash charges provides for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies due to the varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types in addition the company believes it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of share based compensation on its operating results ssd solutions restructuring are charges relate to the restructuring of our underperforming shannon and bigtera product lines and include goodwill and intangible assets impairment expenses the write down of nand flash and ssd inventory valuation and customer sales returns and accounts receivable attributable to these product lines foreign exchange gains and losses consist of translation gains and or losses of non us denominated current assets and current liabilities as well as certain other balance sheet items which result from the appreciation or depreciation of non us currencies against the us â we do not use financial instruments to manage the impact on our operations from changes in foreign exchange rates and because our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we therefore exclude foreign exchange gains and losses when presenting non gaap financial measures gain on disposal of long term investments relate to gains from our sale of fci our specialty rf ic product line â silicon motion technology corporation

an early market rally on wall street gave way to a broad slide for stocks and a surge in bond yields wednesday after the federal reserve signaled it plans to begin raising interest rates soon to fight a spike in inflation that the central bank says is probably getting worse the s p 500 fell 0 1 percent after having been up 2 2 percent earlier in the day the dow jones industrial average fell 0 4 percent after swinging more than 900 points from its high for the day the nasdaq ended little changed shedding most of a 3 4 percent gain bond yields rose including the yield on the 10 year treasury note which climbed to 1 87 percent from 1 78 percent late tuesday yields affect rates on mortgages and other consumer loans in a statement issued after its latest policy meeting the fed said it expects it will soon be appropriate to raise rates such a move is expected to happen as soon as march as half the fed s policymakers have expressed a willingness to raise rates by then the fed also said it would phase out its monthly bond purchases which have been intended to lower longer term rates in march the major stock indexes initially rose after the 2 p m eastern release of the fed statement but shed most of their gains as fed chairman jerome powell took repeated questions about how and when the central bank will start letting its balance sheet shrink after buying trillions of dollars of bonds through the pandemic the selling accelerated as powell acknowledged that the high inflation slamming the economy isn t getting better which could force the fed to get even more aggressive about raising interest rates and removing the support it put in pace for markets advertisement since the december meeting i d say the inflation situation is about the same but probably slightly worse he said it hasn t gotten better it s probably gotten just a bit worse and that s been the pattern powell also said that there s room to raise interest rates without hurting the labor market and wouldn t rule out the possibility that it could raise short term interest rates at any one of its meetings this year or raise by a larger than usual amount at any one those comments sent a signal to wall street that the fed may be more hawkish when it comes to tackling inflation said willie delwiche investment strategist at all star charts in the market s mind that s more rate hikes and while he was clear to say that the economy is strong enough to handle those rate hikes from a strictly stock market perspective higher rates weigh on expensive stocks delwiche said the s p slipped 6 52 points to 4 349 93 the dow fell 129 64 points to 34 168 09 the nasdaq rose 2 82 points to 13 542 12 the indexes are all on pace for weekly losses the market had been solidly higher prior to the release of the fed statement following several days of volatile swings as investors try to gauge whether the fed will succeed in its new effort to fight inflation the central bank had been widely expected to continue drawing back its stimulus measures ahead of raising interest rates in the coming months advertisement pressure from inflation on businesses and consumers is what is driving the fed to raise interest rates this year there was some concern on wall street that powell could suggest that the central bank will raise interest rates this year more than the four times that most economists currently expect for nearly two years investors had poured money into stocks confident that the federal reserve would help keep share prices upright with that support going away markets have been hit with a bout of volatility the s p 500 is down 9 5 percent so far this year markets rose following the fed s last policy meeting in mid december it wasn t until three weeks later in early january that stocks turned jittery that s when minutes released from that meeting suggested fed policymakers may be more zealous about fighting inflation through higher interest rates than many had been expecting investors knew that higher rates were on the way but the minutes showed that the fed was likely to raise rates faster than in prior efforts to get rates back to normal perhaps more impactfully the fed also said it was likely to be quicker than in the past to reduce its huge holdings of bonds it had bought up through the pandemic to keep longer term interest rates low that would have a similar effect as additional rate increases all but two of the sectors in the s p 500 turned lower with communication health care and industrial stocks weighing down the index the most strong earnings reports and financial forecasts underpinned gains for some stocks microsoft rose 2 8 percent after reporting standout results for its latest quarter on solid demand for its cloud computing services and work software chipmaker texas instruments rose 2 5 percent after giving investors a solid earnings report and financial forecast investors are also gauging the threat from covid 19 and the omicron wave s impact on economic growth the international monetary fund cited the omicron variant as the reason it downgraded its forecast for global economic growth this year wall street is also carefully watching the potential conflict between russia and ukraine which could push energy prices higher and force nations to focus on a war just as they are trying to focus on keeping the virus

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video after months of covid policies and growing inflation the central bank will begin phasing out its monthly bond purchases intended to lower long term rates washington the federal reserve signaled wednesday that it plans to begin raising its benchmark interest rate as soon as march a key step in reversing its pandemic era low rate policies that have fueled hiring and growth but also escalated inflation with high inflation squeezing consumers and businesses and unemployment falling steadily the fed also said it would phase out its monthly bond purchases which have been intended to lower longer term rates in march the central bank s actions are sure to make a wide range of borrowing from mortgages and credit cards to auto loans and corporate credit costlier over time those higher borrowing costs in turn could slow consumer spending and hiring the gravest risk is that the fed s abandonment of low rates could trigger another recession in a statement issued after its latest policy meeting the fed it expects it will soon be appropriate to raise rates though the statement didn t specifically mention march half the fed s policymakers have expressed a willingness to raise rates by then including some members who have long favored low rates to support hiring by raising rates the fed will be betting that it can slow inflation without weakening the economy too much speaking at a news conference chair jerome powell expressed his view as he has before that controlling inflation is itself vital to a strong job market the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains powell said is to promote a long expansion and that will require price stability i think there s quite a bit of room he added to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market this is by so many measures an historically tight labor market the fed on wednesday also set out principles it will follow once it decides to reduce its nearly 9 trillion in bond holdings a sum that has more than doubled since the pandemic struck nearly two years ago some analysts expect the fed to begin doing so as soon as july a move that would contribute to tighter credit the central bank s latest policy statement follows dizzying gyrations in the stock market as investors have been gripped by fear and uncertainty over just how fast and far the fed will go to reverse its low rate policies which have nurtured the economy and the markets for years the broad s p 500 index fell nearly 10 this month before rebounding slightly wednesday stock prices which had been solidly higher before powell spoke tumbled during his news conference the market swoon coincided with powell acknowledgement that the fed s balance sheet is substantially larger than it needs to be and that the economy no longer requires such highly supportive action that suggested that the fed might act sooner and faster than expected to shrink its balance sheet which would contribute to tighter credit conditions the fed s bond purchases which have swollen the central bank s balance sheet had been intended to reduce longer term interest rates to spur borrowing and spending many investors also saw the bond buying as helping fuel stock market gains by pouring cash into the financial system asked about the stock market s wild volatility powell stressed that the fed s ultimate focus is on the real economy but he added we feel like the communications we have with market participants and the general public are working monetary policy works significantly through expectations high inflation has become a serious political threat to president joe biden and congressional democrats with republicans pointing to rising prices as one of their principal lines of attack as they look toward the november elections yet biden said last week that it was appropriate for powell to adjust the fed s policies and congressional republicans have endorsed powell s plans to raise rates providing the fed with rare bipartisan support for tightening credit earlier this month minutes of the fed s december meeting revealed that the central bank was considering reducing its bond holdings by not replacing bonds that mature a more aggressive step than merely ending its purchases the impact of the reducing the fed s bond stockpile isn t well known but the last time that the fed raised rates and reduced its balance sheet simultaneously was in 2018 the s p 500 stock index fell 20 in three months by not replacing some of its bond holdings the fed in effect reduces demand for treasuries this raises their yields and makes borrowing more expensive some analysts have said they aren t sure how big the impact on interest rates will be or how much the fed will rely on reducing its balance sheet to affect interest rates all of which means the powell fed faces a delicate and even risky balancing act if the stock market is engulfed by more chaotic declines economists say the fed might decide to delay some of its credit tightening plans modest drops in share prices though won t likely affect the fed s thinking some economists have expressed concern that the fed is already moving too late to combat high inflation others say they worry that the fed may act too aggressively they argue that numerous rate hikes could unnecessarily slow hiring in this view high prices mostly reflect snarled supply chains that the fed s rate hikes are powerless to cure this week s fed meeting comes against the backdrop of not only high inflation consumer prices have surged 7 in the past year the fastest pace in nearly four decades but also an economy gripped by another wave of covid 19 infections powell has acknowledged that he failed to foresee the persistence of high inflation having long expressed the belief that it would prove temporary the inflation spike has broadened to areas beyond those that were affected by supply shortages to apartment rents for example which suggests it could endure even after goods and parts flow more freely

two analysts publish lukewarm new research notes on the stock what happened beyond meat bynd 2 26 the bellwether alternative protein stock lost a little weight on the stock market wednesday following a pair of new analyst notes that were not particularly positive investors traded the company s shares down by 1 7 on the day so what the first note was a reiteration with piper sandler prognosticator michael lavery leaving unchanged his neutral recommendation and 64 price target on beyond meat stock in his latest note on the company lavery waxed enthusiastic about the prospects of the mcplant the beyond meat developed sandwich being tested as a menu item by mcdonald s pointing out that the mcplant will be rolled out in a new phase to around 600 mcdonald s restaurants in california and texas next month he wrote that this suggests a full u s launch to nearly 14 000 restaurants is likely coming later than the end of 1q which is certainly cause for celebration yet the analyst continued saying we remain bearish on key fundamentals for despite the fact that the mcplant is likely to be a near term catalyst for the company meanwhile mizuho s john baumgartner initiated coverage on the stock on the same day like lavery he thinks it s a neutral and he s slapped an uninspiring 59 price target on it we believe long term expectations are too high on the company s prospects baumgartner wrote he also pointed out retail money flow has waned street expectations are resetting lower and short interest is 35 of the float now what beyond meat certainly has its acolytes and believers and no matter how gloomy the research they should help provide a floor to the stock but the two analysts are right to be somewhat cool on its prospects despite looming successes like the mcplant after all the company s pathway to sustained profitability is far from clear and meanwhile competition continues to intensify in the alternative protein segment of the food industry
the federal reserve said wednesday that it will soon be time to start raising interest rates a key step in reversing pandemic era policies that have fueled hiring and growth but also high inflation the fed is expected to lift its benchmark short term rate from zero as soon as march when it also plans to phase out monthly bond purchases that have been intended to anchor longer term rates chair jerome powell said at a news conference that these actions will help prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched and that the central bank can manage the process in a way that prolongs economic growth and keeps unemployment low i think there is quite a bit of room to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market powell said the fed s rate hikes will make it more expensive over time to borrow for a home car or business the fed s intent is to temper economic growth and cool off inflation which is at a 40 year high and eating into americans wage gains and household budgets without raising unemployment the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains powell said is to promote a long expansion and that will require price stability the central bank s latest policy statement follows dizzying gyrations in the stock market as investors have been gripped by fear and uncertainty over just how fast and far the fed will go to reverse its low rate policies which have nurtured the economy and the markets for years the broad s p 500 index fell nearly 10 this month before rebounding slightly wednesday asked about the stock market s wild volatility powell stressed that the fed s ultimate focus is on the real economy but he added we feel like the communications we have with market participants and the general public are working monetary policy works significantly through expectations high inflation has become a serious political threat to president joe biden and congressional democrats with republicans pointing to rising prices as one of their principal lines of attack as they look toward the november elections biden said last week that it was appropriate for powell to adjust the fed s policies and congressional republicans have endorsed powell s plans to raise rates providing the fed with rare bipartisan support for tightening credit the risk is for a faster pace of fed tightening given the stickiness of inflation said kathy bostjancic an economist at oxford economics a consulting firm chair powell s hawkish tone reflected the upside risks to inflation in the statement it issued wednesday after its latest policy meeting the fed said it expects it will soon be appropriate to raise rates though the statement didn t specifically mention march half the fed s policymakers have expressed a willingness to raise rates by then including some members who have long favored low rates to support hiring the fed also set out principles it will follow once it decides to reduce its nearly 9 trillion in bond holdings a sum that has more than doubled since the pandemic struck nearly two years ago some analysts expect the fed to begin doing so as soon as july a move that would contribute to tighter credit the central bank faces a delicate and even risky balancing act if the stock market is engulfed by more chaotic declines economists say the fed might decide to delay some of its credit tightening plans modest drops in share prices though won t likely affect the fed s thinking some economists have expressed concern that the fed is already moving too late to combat high inflation others say they worry that the fed may act too aggressively they argue that numerous rate hikes could unnecessarily slow hiring in this view high prices mostly reflect snarled supply chains that the fed s rate hikes are powerless to cure this week s fed meeting comes against the backdrop of not only high inflation consumer prices have surged 7 in the past year but also an economy gripped by another wave of covid 19 infections powell has acknowledged that he failed to foresee the persistence of high inflation having long expressed the belief that it would prove temporary the inflation spike has broadened to areas beyond those that were affected by supply shortages to apartment rents for example which suggests it could endure even after goods and parts flow more freely
the international monetary fund has advised nigeria and other developing economies with large foreign currency borrowings and external financing need to prepare for turbulence in financial markets the washington based lender also said countries such as nigeria should consider extending their debt maturities as a means to contain foreign exchange fluctuations in a blogpost titled a disrupted global recovery discussing its world economic outlook update report the imf said as the monetary policy stance tightens more broadly this year economies will need to adapt to a global environment of higher interest rates emerging markets and developing economies with large foreign currency borrowing and external financing needs should prepare for possible turbulence in financial markets by extending debt maturities as feasible and containing currency mismatches exchange rate flexibility can help with the needed macroeconomic adjustment in some cases foreign exchange intervention and temporary capital flow management measures may be needed to provide a monetary policy with the space to focus on domestic conditions with interest rates rising low income countries of which 60 per cent are already in or at high risk of debt distress will find it increasingly difficult to service their debts the g20 common framework needs to be revamped to deliver more quickly on debt restructuring and g20 creditors and private creditors should suspend debt service while the restructurings are being negotiated according to the imf as the policy space diminishes in many economies fiscal deficits are expected to shrink in most countries it added that fiscal priority should be given to the health sector and medium term fiscal frameworks should ensure that public debt remains sustainable it said national policies should be tailored to country specific circumstances and both fiscal and monetary policies must work in sync to achieve economic goals the washington based lender in its world economic report notes that less accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies are set to pose challenges for central banks and governments in nigeria and other emerging markets it said less accommodative monetary policy in advanced economies will pose challenges for central banks and governments in emerging markets and developing economies higher returns elsewhere will incentivize capital to flow overseas putting downward pressure on emerging markets and developing economy currencies and rising inflation without commensurate tightening this will increase the burden on foreign currency borrowers both public and private but the tighter policy also brings costs at home as domestic borrowers will find credit harder to come by overall tighter policies will likely be appropriate in many emerging markets and developing economies to stave off the threat of persistently higher inflation the imf said while emerging markets were more resilient with higher reserves financial vulnerabilities would remain especially in countries that have higher public and private debt it added that debt service burdens could rise significantly in the year as interest rates rise it said public finances will come under strain in the coming months and years as global public debt has reached record levels to cover pandemic related spending at a time when tax receipts plummeted higher interest rates will also make borrowing more expensive especially for countries borrowing in foreign currencies and at short maturities copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content on this website may not be reproduced published broadcast rewritten or redistributed in whole or in part without prior express written permission from punch contact

updated january 26 2022 at 6 49 pm et faced with mounting pressure from rapidly rising consumer prices the federal reserve is preparing to raise interest rates sooner and perhaps more aggressively than had been expected just a few months ago at the conclusion of a two day meeting wednesday fed chairman jerome powell signaled that he and his colleagues are likely to begin raising rates in march the central bank is trying to prevent stubbornly high inflation from becoming a permanent feature of the economy prices in december were up 7 from a year earlier the sharpest jump in nearly four decades inflation has persisted longer than we thought and of course we re prepared to use our tools to ensure that higher inflation does not become entrenched powell told reporters policymakers previously said they would wait to raise rates until the economy had reached maximum employment powell suggested that threshold has been met even though about 3 6 million fewer people are working now than were before the pandemic there is a pool of people out there who could come back into the labor force powell acknowledged but it s not happening very quickly and it may continue to not happen very quickly as long as the pandemic is on in the meantime the fed chairman has argued the central bank cannot afford to leave inflation unchecked to get the kind of very strong labor market we want with high participation it s going to take a long expansion powell told lawmakers this month and to get a long expansion we re going to need price stability frederic j brown afp via getty images afp via getty images a store in hollywood calif displays a sign showing a raised price for one of its offers consumer prices are rising at their fastest annual pace in nearly 40 years why inflation is on the rise prices during the pandemic have been far from stable consumers have spent freely thanks in part to generous government relief payments but with workers and supplies often scarce many businesses have struggled to keep pace with that demand the resulting price hikes have proved to be much more persistent than the fed initially expected much like the pandemic itself the price of new cars for example has jumped 12 in the past year as automakers have struggled with a shortage of semiconductors that s had a spillover effect in the used car market where prices have soared 37 the commerce department warned this week that it doesn t expect the semiconductor shortage to ease in the near future gasoline and groceries have also gotten more expensive price checkers point to elevated inflation in more than 2 out of every 3 categories the government tracks powell acknowledged that s particularly hard on people with limited incomes living paycheck to paycheck they re spending most or all of what they re earning on food rent gasoline powell said basic necessities so inflation right away right away forces people like that to make very difficult decisions raising interest rates would not solve the supply chain woes but is intended to tamp down consumer demand delphine touitou afp via getty images afp via getty images shelves at a supermarket in bethesda md look empty on jan 13 supply chain woes the spike in the omicron variant of the coronavirus and bad weather have been key factors behind the empty shelves seen at many supermarkets across the united states the fed is also pursuing other actions to fight inflation in addition to raising interest rates the fed is expected to gradually begin shrinking its portfolio of government debt and mortgage backed securities later this year doing so is another way to fight inflation by pushing up long term borrowing costs across the economy mortgage rates have already risen to their highest level since the start of the pandemic in anticipation of the central bank s moves investors concern about rising prices and the fed s response have contributed to extreme volatility in the stock market this week the fed expects inflation will cool this year provided the public health outlook improves easing shortages of both workers and supplies but powell acknowledged that similar hopes have been dashed in the past i don t think two years ago we thought we d still be having record levels of cases powell told lawmakers at the height of the omicron wave getting past the pandemic is the single most important thing we can do fed policymakers predicted in december that inflation would fall to around 2 6 by the end of this year less than half its current rate the fed s preferred yardstick for inflation is the commerce department s index of personal consumption expenditures which was 5 7 in november the central bank says it s prepared to adjust interest rates more or less aggressively if actual inflation turns out to be higher or lower than forecast we re going to have to be just very attentive to what s happening in the economy and willing to adapt pretty nimbly our policy as we go through the year powell said earlier this month copyright 2023 npr to see more visit

7 million and 37 0 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively significant variances from the prior year are as follows a 25 8 million increase in net interest income an 18 9 million decrease in the provision for credit losses on loans a 3 0 million increase in non interest income and a 646 000 increase in non interest expense net interest income for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 25 8 million or 19 9 to 155 6 million from 129 8 million for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to a 211 3 million or 4 3 increase in average interest earning assets as well as a 40 basis point increase in net interest margin to 3 01 from 2 61 the increase in average interest earning assets was due to increases in average loans outstanding of 239 5 million and average other securities of 19 7 million largely attributable to assets acquired in the vsb bancorp inc victory acquisition on july 1 2020 the increases were partially offset by decreases in average mortgage backed securities of 39 8 million average federal home loan bank of new york fhlbny stock of 4 6 million and average interest earning deposits in financial institutions of 3 5 million the increase in net interest margin was primarily due to the decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities outpacing the decrease in yields on interest earning assets yields on interest earning assets decreased five basis points to 3 33 for the year ended december 31 2021 from 3 38 for the year ended december 31 2020 the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by 54 basis points to 0 44 for the year ended december 31 2021 from 0 98 for the year ended december 31 2020 driven by lower costs of deposits lower market interest rates continue to negatively impact interest earning asset yields but these declines have been largely mitigated by lower costs of funds net interest income for the year ended december 31 2021 also benefited from an increase in the accelerated recognition of fees related to the forgiveness of ppp loans higher loan prepayment income and an increase in accretable income related to the payoffs of pcd loans in the first quarter of 2021 fees recognized from ppp loans totaled 5 6 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 1 9 million for the year ended december 31 2020 loan prepayment income was 5 1 million for the december

million for the year ended december 31 2020 the provision for credit losses on loans decreased by 18 9 million to a benefit of 6 2 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to a provision of 12 7 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease in the provision for credit losses was primarily the result of an improvement in the economic forecast and asset quality the improvement in asset quality is primarily attributable to an improvement in risk ratings as loans previously modified for covid 19 relief returned to consistent payment status the higher provision for loan losses in 2020 was primarily due to increases in qualitative factors used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses related to unemployment loan risk rating changes and increased risks related to loans on forbearance resulting from economic uncertainty attributable to the covid 19 pandemic under the incurred loss methodology net charge offs were 2 8 million for the year ended december 31 2021 primarily related to pcd loans as compared to net charge offs of 3 8 million for the year ended december 31 2020 on january 1 2021 the company adopted asu 2016 13 financial instruments credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments cecl cecl requires the measurement of all expected credit losses over the life of financial instruments held

adjustment that reduced stockholders equity by 3 1 million net of tax at adoption the company increased its allowance for credit losses by 11 1 million comprised of 10 4 million and 737 000 respectively for loans and unfunded commitments including 6 8 million related to pcd loans for pcd loans the allowance for credit losses recorded is recognized through a gross up that increases the amortized cost basis of loans with a corresponding increase to the allowance for credit losses and therefore results in no impact to shareholders equity non interest income increased 3 0 million to 14 5 million for the year ended december 31 2021 from 11 5 million for the year ended december 31 2020 due primarily to an increase of 1 4 million in fees and service charges for customer services as the prior year reflected fees waived and fewer transactions related to lower consumer spending in the early part of the pandemic an increase of 1 2 million in gains on sales of available for sale debt securities net a 736 000 increase in gains on sales of loans and a 329 000 increase in income on bank owned life insurance income related to an increase in benefit claims the increase in gains on

for gains of 665 000 in the second quarter of 2020 the company periodically considers the sale of loans to manage its overall risk profile including consideration of interest rate risk concentration risk and capital deployment opportunities partially offsetting the increases was a 781 000 decrease in other income primarily due to a decrease in fees on loan swap transactions for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 due to a lower volume of such transactions in 2021 non interest expense increased 646 000 or 0 8 to 79 2 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 78 5 million for the year ended december 31 2020 employee compensation and benefits expense increased by 2 2 million primarily due to increases in salary and medical benefit expenses associated with the addition of former victory employees combined with annual merit increases and an increase in the employee stock option plan expense partially offset by a decrease in change in control and severance compensation paid to former victory employees in the prior year fdic insurance premiums increased by 480 000 due to an increase in the insurance assessment rate and the receipt of a small bank assessment credit in the prior year that was not available in 2021 other expense increased by 518 000 primarily due to an increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments as well as an increase in other operating expenses partially offsetting the increases was a 1 2 million decrease in occupancy expense primarily due to a 2 2 million charge in the prior year associated with branch consolidations which was partially offset by higher maintenance costs related to additional branches from the victory acquisition renovation of existing branches and higher snow removal costs in the current year additionally there was a 1 3 million decrease in data processing costs as the prior year included a contract termination penalty of 1 3 million on the completion of victory s core system conversion and a 545 000 decrease in professional fees due to a reduction in merger related costs the company recorded income tax expense of 26 5 million for the year ended december 31

operating results for the three months ended december 31 2021 and 2020 net income was 16 1 million and 13 1 million for the quarters ended december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively

increase in non interest income a 497 000 decrease in non interest expense and a 1 4 million increase in income tax expense net interest income for the quarter ended december 31 2021 increased 1 3 million or 3 6 primarily due to a 13 basis point increase in net interest margin to 2 96 from 2 83 for the quarter ended december 31 2020 partially offset by a 70 9 million or 1 4 decrease in average interest earning assets the decrease in average interest earning assets was primarily due to decreases in the average balance of mortgage backed securities of 242 8 million the average balance of fhlbny stock of 7 1 million and the average balance of interest earning deposits in financial institutions of 9 7 million partially offset by increases in the average balance of loans outstanding of

the decrease in yields on interest earning assets yields on interest earning assets decreased six basis points to 3 23 for the quarter ended december 31 2021 from 3 29 for the quarter ended december 31 2020 the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased 23 basis points to 0 37 for the quarter ended december 31 2021 from 0 60 for the quarter ended december 31 2020 driven by lower costs of

for the quarter ended december 31 2021 from a provision of 2 5 million for the quarter ended december 31 2020 the decrease in the provision for credit losses for the current quarter as compared to the comparable prior year quarter was primarily the result of an improvement in the economic forecast and asset quality the improvement in asset quality is primarily attributable to an improvement in risk ratings as loans previously modified for covid 19 relief returned to consistent payment status the higher provision for loan losses in 2020 was primarily due to increases in qualitative factors used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses related to unemployment loan risk rating changes and increased risks related to loans on forbearance resulting from economic uncertainty attributable to the covid 19 pandemic under the incurred loss methodology net recoveries were 73 000 for the quarter ended december 31 2021 compared to net charge offs of 3 6 million for the quarter

quarter ended september 30 2021 whereas the net interest margin declined by three basis points to 2 96 from 2 99 for the quarter ended september 30 2021 the decrease in net interest margin was

of interest bearing liabilities decreased by three basis points to 0 37 for the quarter ended december 31 2021 from 0 40 for the quarter ended september 30 2021 net interest income for the quarter

or 62 6 to 4 3 million for the quarter ended december 31 2021 from 2 6 million for the quarter ended september 30 2021 the increase was primarily due to an increase of 674 000 in income on bank owned

federal reserve chair jerome powell said the central bank was ready to raise interest rates in march and didn t rule out moving at every meeting to tackle the highest inflation in a generation the committee is of a mind to raise the fed funds rate at the march meeting if conditions are there to do so powell told a virtual press conference on wednesday while noting that officials have not made any decisions about the path of policy because it needs to be nimble he was speaking after the federal open market committee concluded its two day meeting with a statement that declared it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate citing inflation well above its 2 target and a strong job market in a separate statement the fed said it expects the process of balance sheet reduction will commence after it has begun raising rates powell said no decision was taken at this meeting on the pace of the runoff or when it would start jerome powell aaron p bernstein bloomberg the hawkish pivot against a backdrop of turmoil in stocks comes amid consumer inflation readings that have repeatedly surprised and hit 7 the most since the 1980s and a tight labor market that s pushed unemployment down faster than anticipated to almost its prepandemic level the yield on 10 year treasury notes rose sharply as powell spoke while stocks fell and the dollar pushed higher a rate hike would be the central bank s first since 2018 with many analysts forecasting a quarter point increase in march to be followed by three more this year and additional moves beyond critics say the fed has been too slow to act and is now behind the curve in tackling inflation though key market gauges don t back that view even some fed officials have publicly discussed if they should raise rates more this year than forecast we will need to be nimble so that we can respond to the full range of plausible outcomes powell said we will remain attentive to risks including the risk that high inflation is more persistent than expected and are prepared to respond as appropriate the vote was unanimous philadelphia fed president patrick harker voted as the alternate for the boston fed which is currently without a president while three vacancies at the board of governors reduced the number of voters at this meeting to nine officials held the target range for their benchmark policy rate unchanged at zero to 0 25 as expected they also said they will conclude asset purchases on schedule leaving them on track to end in early march the fed s balance sheet stands at nearly 8 9 trillion more than double its size before officials began massive asset purchases at the onset of the pandemic to calm market panic in a separate statement outlining the principles it would apply to reducing its balance sheet the fed said that over the longer run it intends to primarily hold treasury securities the fed currently also holds mortgage backed securities and the shift is aimed at minimizing its effect on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy it said despite criticism that it has dragged its feet the fed is moving much quicker than it once expected to prompted by the failure of inflation to fade as anticipated amid robust demand snarled supply chains and tightening labor markets as recently as september central bank officials were split on whether any rate hikes would be warranted in 2022 the meeting is the last of powell s current term as fed chair which ends in early february he s been nominated to another four years at the helm by president biden and is expected to be confirmed by the senate with bipartisan support in his second term powell 68 will need to persuade investors and the american public that the fomc can successfully get inflation back down to the fed s 2 goal while also nurturing job gains as the labor market heals from the pandemic

after months of covid policies and growing inflation the central bank will begin phasing out its monthly bond purchases intended to lower long term rates example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington the federal reserve signaled wednesday that it plans to begin raising its benchmark interest rate as soon as march a key step in reversing its pandemic era low rate policies that have fueled hiring and growth but also escalated inflation with high inflation squeezing consumers and businesses and unemployment falling steadily the fed also said it would phase out its monthly bond purchases which have been intended to lower longer term rates in march the central bank s actions are sure to make a wide range of borrowing from mortgages and credit cards to auto loans and corporate credit costlier over time those higher borrowing costs in turn could slow consumer spending and hiring the gravest risk is that the fed s abandonment of low rates could trigger another recession in a statement issued after its latest policy meeting the fed it expects it will soon be appropriate to raise rates though the statement didn t specifically mention march half the fed s policymakers have expressed a willingness to raise rates by then including some members who have long favored low rates to support hiring by raising rates the fed will be betting that it can slow inflation without weakening the economy too much speaking at a news conference chair jerome powell expressed his view as he has before that controlling inflation is itself vital to a strong job market the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains powell said is to promote a long expansion and that will require price stability i think there s quite a bit of room he added to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market this is by so many measures an historically tight labor market the fed on wednesday also set out principles it will follow once it decides to reduce its nearly 9 trillion in bond holdings a sum that has more than doubled since the pandemic struck nearly two years ago some analysts expect the fed to begin doing so as soon as july a move that would contribute to tighter credit the central bank s latest policy statement follows dizzying gyrations in the stock market as investors have been gripped by fear and uncertainty over just how fast and far the fed will go to reverse its low rate policies which have nurtured the economy and the markets for years the broad s p 500 index fell nearly 10 this month before rebounding slightly wednesday stock prices which had been solidly higher before powell spoke tumbled during his news conference the market swoon coincided with powell acknowledgement that the fed s balance sheet is substantially larger than it needs to be and that the economy no longer requires such highly supportive action that suggested that the fed might act sooner and faster than expected to shrink its balance sheet which would contribute to tighter credit conditions the fed s bond purchases which have swollen the central bank s balance sheet had been intended to reduce longer term interest rates to spur borrowing and spending many investors also saw the bond buying as helping fuel stock market gains by pouring cash into the financial system asked about the stock market s wild volatility powell stressed that the fed s ultimate focus is on the real economy but he added we feel like the communications we have with market participants and the general public are working monetary policy works significantly through expectations high inflation has become a serious political threat to president joe biden and congressional democrats with republicans pointing to rising prices as one of their principal lines of attack as they look toward the november elections yet biden said last week that it was appropriate for powell to adjust the fed s policies and congressional republicans have endorsed powell s plans to raise rates providing the fed with rare bipartisan support for tightening credit earlier this month minutes of the fed s december meeting revealed that the central bank was considering reducing its bond holdings by not replacing bonds that mature a more aggressive step than merely ending its purchases the impact of the reducing the fed s bond stockpile isn t well known but the last time that the fed raised rates and reduced its balance sheet simultaneously was in 2018 the s p 500 stock index fell 20 in three months by not replacing some of its bond holdings the fed in effect reduces demand for treasuries this raises their yields and makes borrowing more expensive some analysts have said they aren t sure how big the impact on interest rates will be or how much the fed will rely on reducing its balance sheet to affect interest rates all of which means the powell fed faces a delicate and even risky balancing act if the stock market is engulfed by more chaotic declines economists say the fed might decide to delay some of its credit tightening plans modest drops in share prices though won t likely affect the fed s thinking some economists have expressed concern that the fed is already moving too late to combat high inflation others say they worry that the fed may act too aggressively they argue that numerous rate hikes could unnecessarily slow hiring in this view high prices mostly reflect snarled supply chains that the fed s rate hikes are powerless to cure this week s fed meeting comes against the backdrop of not only high inflation consumer prices have surged 7 in the past year the fastest pace in nearly four decades but also an economy gripped by another wave of covid 19 infections powell has acknowledged that he failed to foresee the persistence of high inflation having long expressed the belief that it would prove temporary the inflation spike has broadened to areas beyond those that were affected by supply shortages to apartment rents for example which suggests it could endure even after goods and parts flow more freely

the standard poor s 500 index fell 0 1 after having been up 2 2 earlier in the day wednesday an early market rally on wall street gave way to a broad slide for stocks and a surge in bond yields wednesday after the federal reserve signaled it plans to begin raising interest rates soon to fight a surge in inflation that the central bank says is probably getting worse the standard poor s 500 index fell 0 1 after having been up 2 2 earlier in the day the dow jones industrial average fell 0 4 after swinging more than 900 points from its high for the day the nasdaq composite ended little changed shedding most of a 3 4 gain bond yields rose including the yield on the 10 year treasury note which climbed to 1 87 from 1 78 late tuesday yields affect rates on mortgages and other consumer loans advertisement in a statement issued after its latest policy meeting the fed said it expects it will soon be appropriate to raise rates such a move is expected to happen as soon as march as half the fed s policymakers have expressed a willingness to raise rates by then the fed also said it would phase out its monthly bond purchases which have been intended to lower longer term rates in march the major stock indexes initially rose after the 2 p m eastern time release of the fed statement but shed most of their gains as fed chair jerome h powell took repeated questions about how and when the central bank will start letting its balance sheet shrink after buying trillions of dollars of bonds through the pandemic the selling accelerated as powell acknowledged that the high inflation slamming the economy isn t getting better which could force the fed to get even more aggressive about raising interest rates and removing the support it put in place for markets since the december meeting i d say the inflation situation is about the same but probably slightly worse he said it hasn t gotten better it s probably gotten just a bit worse and that s been the pattern powell also said that there s room to raise interest rates without hurting the labor market and wouldn t rule out the possibility that the central bank could raise short term interest rates at any one of its meetings this year or raise rates by a larger than usual amount those comments sent a signal to wall street that the fed may be more hawkish when it comes to tackling inflation said willie delwiche investment strategist at all star charts advertisement in the market s mind that s more rate hikes and while he was clear to say that the economy is strong enough to handle those rate hikes from a strictly market perspective higher rates weigh on expensive stocks delwiche said the s p slipped 6 52 points to 4 349 93 the dow fell 129 64 points to 34 168 09 the nasdaq rose 2 82 points to 13 542 12 the indexes are all on pace for weekly losses the market had been solidly higher before the release of the fed statement which followed several days of volatile swings as investors try to gauge whether the fed will succeed in its new effort to fight inflation the central bank had been widely expected to continue drawing back its stimulus measures before raising interest rates in the coming months inflation pressure on businesses and consumers is what s driving the fed to raise interest rates this year there was some concern on wall street that powell could suggest that the central bank will raise interest rates this year more than the four times that most economists currently expect for nearly two years investors had poured money into stocks confident that the federal reserve would help keep share prices upright with that support going away markets have been hit with volatility the s p 500 is down 9 5 this year markets rose after the fed s last policy meeting in mid december it wasn t until three weeks later in early january that stocks turned jittery that s when minutes released from that meeting suggested fed policymakers may be more zealous about fighting inflation through higher interest rates than many had been expecting advertisement investors knew that higher rates were on the way but the minutes showed that the fed was likely to raise rates faster than in prior efforts to get rates back to normal perhaps more effectively the fed also said it was likely to be quicker than in the past to reduce the huge holdings of bonds it had bought up through the pandemic to keep longer term interest rates low that would have an effect similar to additional rate increases all but two of the sectors in the s p 500 turned lower with communication healthcare and industrial stocks weighing down the index the most strong earnings reports and financial forecasts underpinned gains for some stocks microsoft rose 2 8 after reporting standout results for its latest quarter on solid demand for its cloud computing services and work software chipmaker texas instruments rose 2 5 after giving investors a solid earnings report and financial forecast investors are also gauging the threat from covid 19 and the omicron variant s effect on economic growth the international monetary fund cited the omicron variant as the reason it downgraded its forecast for global economic growth this year wall street is also carefully watching the potential conflict between russia and ukraine which could push energy prices higher and force nations to focus on a war just as

washington the u s central bank signaled wednesday that it planned to start raising its benchmark interest rate as soon as march and curb its direct financial support for the pandemic hit american economy the federal reserve has kept its key interest rate near 0 since the coronavirus swept into the united states in march 2020 which helped fuel faster than expected economic growth and curtailed unemployment in december however consumer prices rose 7 year over year the biggest such surge in four decades fed policymakers after a two day meeting in washington did not say how big an interest rate increase might be but financial analysts have presumed it might be a quarter of a percentage point with perhaps three more such increases to follow throughout 2022 the fed s increased interest rate would almost assuredly course through the u s economy the world s largest over time it would force consumers to pay higher borrowing costs for such big ticket purchases as houses and cars while businesses would pay more to finance machinery and goods for their operations the fed had already been slowing a bond buying program it was using to boost the economy it opted to leave that program in place but to end it in march as planned the policymakers signaled that they could begin to trim their balance sheet of government backed debt soon after they begin to raise interest rates another action that would curtail its direct support for the economy the fed s goal in raising its benchmark rate is to curb consumer demand and correspondingly curtail inflation which has squeezed the household budgets of millions of american families especially because of higher food prices and higher gasoline costs at service station pumps file signage for a job fair is seen on 5th avenue in manhattan new york city sept 3 2021 the fed s policies during the nearly two year pandemic in the u s helped push the unemployment rate down to 3 9 in december not far above the five decade low of 3 5 recorded before the coronavirus swept into the country at its peak in april 2020 the jobless rate was 14 7 but the prospect of higher interest rates in 2022 even though predicted for months has frightened investors throughout january with one broad u s stock index the s p 500 plunging about 8 from a record high at the beginning of the month in the hour after the fed s announcement the three major u s stock indexes all fell marginally
request withdrawn greenlight helena has withdrawn its request to move to stuttgart thousands of arkansans are hitting the web to learn about the state s medical marijuana offerings according to executives at three leading cannabis companies with more than 78 000 medical marijuana cardholders and more than 447 million in sales since 2019 arkansas has demonstrated a strong interest in medical marijuana the state s dispensaries have turned to web services such as weedmaps leafly and jane to advertise their products initiate online orders and inform the state s growing customer base about cannabis in general advertisement juanjo feijoo chief operating officer at weedmaps said his company s website sees more than 100 000 total visits from arkansas each month when you think about the number of cannabis consumers in arkansas i think it shows pretty high degree of penetration in the market feijoo said advertisement new medical marijuana consumers find the website s learn functionality very helpful feijoo said by learning more about dispensaries and products weedmaps typically sees a significant increase in web traffic when a state starts a new medical marijuana program and new consumers want to learn more about the marketplace and the products available feijoo said founded in 2008 in irvine california weedmaps went public in 2021 and is traded on the nasdaq stock exchange the company offers a variety of services including the posting of dispensary product menus and other cannabis information on its website like leafly weedmaps also has a strain library where users can learn about cannabis strains offers online ordering and helps to integrate menus into dispensaries websites weedmaps lists 31 arkansas cannabis businesses on its website including 20 of arkansas s 38 dispensaries advertisement weedmaps website typically displays prices thc percentages of cannabis products reviews crowdsourced tasting notes and common effects weedmaps also offers comprehensive services for dispensaries called business in a box this service allows dispensaries to use a single vendor rather than using as many as 12 vendors for services like point of sale technology and customer contacts feijoo said advertisement next year weedmaps plans to launch a social media platform with the help of rapper and cannabis entrepreneur berner while more than a third of americans get their information about cannabis primarily from social media feijoo said a lot of social media platforms have a very restrictive approach to cannabis we want to create a safe space where consumers can really learn and discover cannabis and potentially discuss and ask questions feijoo said advertisement weedmaps is not alone in the cannabis web services marketplace leafly based in seattle provides web services to 25 arkansas cannabis related businesses including 19 dispensaries a representative for leafly said the company could not disclose its arkansas data but said the website has more than 125 million visitors every year founded in 2010 leafly started as a strain database where consumers could learn about cannabis strains and understand their effects according to ross moulton leafly s vice president of strategy the company eventually added dispensaries and clinics to allow them to showcase their products services hours and locations in 2018 leafly introduced online ordering advertisement in 12 years leafly has grown to list dispensaries in 41 states and seven canadian provinces with around 4 600 total retailers on the site today moulton said leafly offers many similar services to weedmaps including menu listings online ordering and listing of product details like thc content the site also has a cannabis 101 section with blog posts about cannabis and industry terms the releaf center in bentonville was the first arkansas dispensary to receive an online order through leafly in 2019 kyle campbell manager of the releaf center said the dispensary was initially on both weedmaps and leafly but his customers gravitated more to leafly where most of the dispensary s online orders were being placed last year as much as 90 of the dispensary s orders were coming through online orders he said campbell said leafly has been helpful for educating both his customers and his employees so they can help educate patients advertisement a lot of these people have never used in any form campbell said it s something that can be very intimidating and something they don t know anything about so we push a lot for education on our employees so they can help educate the patients and leafly is a very strong platform for doing that jane technologies inc also known simply as jane is another web based cannabis service used by 26 arkansas dispensaries and visited by more than 10 000 unique visitors from arkansas every month according to a jane representative founded by military veteran socrates rosenfeld in 2017 jane provides similar services to those offered by weedmaps and leafly used by more than 2 500 dispensaries in 37 u s states and canada jane offers menus reviews descriptions and more for dispensaries jane s reviews are especially reliable rosenfeld said because reviewers are required to have purchased the product they are reviewing jane which can be found at iheartjane com allows users to sort the effect they are hoping to achieve from a cannabis product rosenfeld said using these filters can be helpful for people new to cannabis because it can help them more easily identify products that will allow them to achieve the effects they are seeking according to rosenfeld harvest cannabis of conway which was the first arkansas dispensary to use jane uses all three of the web based platforms robbin rahman executive director at harvest cannabis said it s important for his business to use all three because each one offers something a little different rahman called weedmaps a leader in the industry for helping customers discover dispensaries and products but while weedmaps processes online orders the platform does not communicate with the dispensary s seed to sale inventory tracking system requiring the dispensary to make manual adjustments jane on the other hand does a good job of working with the inventory system he said and does not require an employee to change the inventory data manually leafly with its informative blog posts and definitions of cannabis terms is a very good resource for educating people about cannabis rahman said the site is so helpful at explaining cannabis and its terms that rahman has even drawn from it when making a presentation to the state s marijuana regulators he said
historians of the irish agricultural co operative movement know of two truths firstly its founder horace plunkett honed his commerce skills while ranching in the big horn mountains of wyoming in the 1890s he embraced the co operative business model for ireland not as a socialist nirvana but to provide economic power against gombeen men and private retailers who were content to keep irish farmers impoverished the second truth is that the co operative business model is distinct from a company be it private or on a stock exchange that distinction pivots on the amount of leverage or indebtedness that any co op should incur to understand the strategies of both glanbia and kerry co ops currently you must examine them through the lens of these two truths unlike private companies where equity finance is always a key lever to potentially address excessive debt co ops do not have the option of a similar solution therefore they must always veer towards a more conservative amount of leverage when weighing up investment decisions to understand the strategies of both glanbia and kerry co ops currently you must examine them through the lens of these two truths each of them has created vehicles that have tapped the stock exchange over the past 30 years to create value by establishing successful global businesses the co op plc model they deployed is unique internationally and has facilitated significant wealth creation for member shareholders while retaining material farmer control in kerry the co op holds a share certificate in kerry plc valued at over 2bn at glanbia its farmer owned co op has recently voted to secure 100 control over the largest dairy processing business in ireland while continuing as the single biggest shareholder in glanbia plc in kerry the co op holds a share certificate in kerry plc valued at over 2bn and it too has expressed an ambition to take back control of the irish dairy processing assets that sit inside kerry plc both of these developments mark a full circle in the ownership of large swathes of irish agribusiness in the 1980s it was kerry co op led by a management team under denis brosnan that devised a stock market listed business model which could access equity finance to grow internationally both glanbia plc and kerry plc emerged from those brave decisions to create stock market companies with market values of 3 4bn and 20bn respectively deal last week glanbia co op struck a deal to secure funding that allows it take full control of the glanbia ireland business this long term funding ensures the co op will own 100 of glanbia ireland without the worries of volatile credit and equity markets it also respects the need to ensure a co op avoids where possible excessive indebtedness as part of that transaction glanbia plc as part of its share buyback programme chose to acquire some of the shares on offer by glanbia co op this mechanic helps bolster the value of each remaining share in the plc by reducing the absolute number of shares in issue that should boost the value for all shareholders in the plc including the co op over the medium to long term at kerry a similar pathway is plausible the co op there holds a highly valuable shareholding in kerry plc worth over 2bn the new glanbia strategy will develop over the coming months and years and may ultimately be part funded by the valuable equity holding that remains in glanbia plc if the latter as expected grows in value at kerry a similar pathway is plausible the co op there holds a highly valuable shareholding in kerry plc worth over 2bn inside the plc resides a profitable and well invested irish dairy processing business which could potentially be owned by the co op kerry plc is focused on building a global taste and nutrition business so the domestic dairy and agri assets could potentially be sold to the co op if terms were to be agreed constructive goodwill to achieve such an outcome constructive goodwill between co op and plc is a necessity when large businesses are being transacted there is a temptation to deploy advisers on either side at an early stage that though can trigger a process that gets tetchy and adversarial very quickly it is only when a level of mutual respect has been attained that a transaction can be progressed professionally with the support of advisers as ireland celebrates its 100th year as an independent state the role of the co operative movement needs to be cherished and celebrated by combining their economic power irish farmers have built an industry that has provided strong long term employment off farm and wealth creation on it you can define irish republicanism in many ways the imagination to establish stock market listed companies to advance that cause while retaining the scope to regain control over core processing assets is the hallmark too of a healthy co operative spirit you can define irish republicanism in many ways mine has always been to encourage and support successful business and employment opportunities created by indigenous enterprise that can advance the state and staunch the long term stain of emigration the private sector has had and will continue to have a key role in that journey having a thriving commercial co operative sector in the agri food industry not afraid to take bold decisions is central to that future horace plunkett would see the sense in that joe gill is director of corporate broking with goodbody stockbrokers which acted last week as lead adviser to glanbia co op on its funding structure
police estimate there could be up to 2 000 demonstrators but the number is shifting quickly ottawa police say they have been in touch with leaders of a trucker convoy over weekend protest plans in the capital and are getting ready for several scenarios including violence chief peter sloly told the police services board wednesday that he is working with the rcmp and intelligence bodies to prepare for the protests against a covid 19 vaccine mandate for cross border truckers sloly said the convoy organizers have been co operative in telling police about their plans for the protest which he predicts could last several days but the situation is evolving rapidly deputy chief steve bell said police are tracing parallel groups that are preparing to join the truckers as well as counter protesters and are monitoring social media ottawa police estimate there could be up to 2 000 demonstrators but this number is shifting quickly and warn residents against travelling downtown during the event sloly said while police support the right to peaceful protest officers will be prepared to move protesters out of the demonstration zone should the situation become violent or threatening some supporters of the convoy including some conservative mps have taken to social media to warn the vaccine mandate for truckers will leave store shelves empty some have gone so far as to predict canadians will starve transport minister omar alghabra has assured canadians there s no reason to fear food shortages will result from a small minority of truck drivers refusing to comply with the vaccine mandate in an interview alghabra said the large grocery store chains and other retailers have assured him they have plenty of goods to provide their customers despite some labour shortages and supply chain bottlenecks caused by the covid 19 pandemic moreover he said there s been no measurable impact on the number of trucks crossing the border since the vaccine mandate went into effect on jan 15 last week he said almost 100 000 trucks crossed the border about the same as usual for this time of year i don t want to minimize the fact that we have to remain vigilant and work together to address these issues of supply chain disruptions alghabra told the canadian press adding he plans to hold a summit on the issue with retailers on monday but this notion that we re going to starve is really unfortunate and does disservice to canadians to canadian society and to the debate that we need to be having others with more extreme far right views have latched onto the protest one online video includes a man expressing hope the rally will turn into the canadian equivalent of the jan 6 2021 riot at the u s capitol by supporters of former president donald trump donald trump jr took to social media tuesday to endorse the canadian truck convoy s fight against tyranny and to urge americans to follow suit a group called canada unity is organizing the movement which its members refer to as the freedom convoy a memorandum of understanding posted on the canada unity website says its coalition is opposed to restrictions and mandates related to covid 19 rules it deems are unconstitutional discriminatory and segregating the memorandum s goal it says is to form a committee with the senate and governor general that would override all levels of canadian government to stop the use of vaccine passports waive fines linked to covid 19 and reinstate employees who were fired for breaking covid 19 rules if the senate and governor general refuse to join such a committee the group says they should resign their lawful positions of authority immediately carissima mathen a professor of law at the university of ottawa said seeking to override all levels of government policy would not work because the body who initially put the policy in place must be the one to reverse it alternatively that policy could be undone by parliament passing a law mathen who specializes in the constitution added the governor general has very little involvement with the legal system in canada alghabra said he is concerned about the small number of far right vocal opposition that is polluting much of our political debate it s something that we all need to be aware of we all need to call out he said but at the same time let s not lose sight of this that the vast majority of canadians are vaccinated the vast majority of truckers are vaccinated truckers as you and i are speaking today are delivering goods for canadians the canadian trucking alliance has estimated that about 15 per cent of truckers as many as 16 000 are not fully vaccinated against covid 19 it has strongly denounced any protests on public roadways highways and bridges and has urged all truckers to get inoculated alghabra said representatives of large grocery chains and other retailers have assured him the truckers vaccine mandate has had no measurable impact on their ability to stock their shelves they are offended and hurt by this perception that people are trying to create that they are not able to deliver for their customers alghabra took particular aim at conservative mps some of whom have offered full throated support for the truck convoy some conservatives have posted pictures of empty grocery store shelves at least one of which turned out to be a stock photo of a british store it s irresponsible for anybody to spread fear for political gains alghabra said a day after refusing to say whether he supported the truck convoy heading to ottawa conservative leader erin o toole appeared in a facebook live event tuesday evening to say he understands why many truckers especially independent ones are upset you can understand why there s some frustration and why people are protesting o toole said on wednesday the canadian federation of independent business also urged the federal government to reverse its vaccination policy for truckers the organization represents 95 000 small and medium sized businesses including about 500 in the trucking sector earlier the canadian chamber of commerce had urged the government to give truckers more time to get vaccinated while the canadian manufacturing coalition has also called for the vaccine mandate to be scrapped entirely but alghabra said it would accomplish nothing to postpone or scrap the requirement that truckers entering canada be fully immunized since the united states has imposed the same requirement on truckers entering that country it won t really make a difference the u s has a mandate he said the best way to end supply chain disruptions is to end the pandemic and the best way to do that is to get vaccinated which is what the vaccine mandate is all about he argued marie woolf and joan bryden the canadian press related gofundme withholding 4 5 million from trucker convoy until plan presented

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video after months of covid policies and growing inflation the central bank will begin phasing out its monthly bond purchases intended to lower long term rates washington the federal reserve signaled wednesday that it plans to begin raising its benchmark interest rate as soon as march a key step in reversing its pandemic era low rate policies that have fueled hiring and growth but also escalated inflation with high inflation squeezing consumers and businesses and unemployment falling steadily the fed also said it would phase out its monthly bond purchases which have been intended to lower longer term rates in march the central bank s actions are sure to make a wide range of borrowing from mortgages and credit cards to auto loans and corporate credit costlier over time those higher borrowing costs in turn could slow consumer spending and hiring the gravest risk is that the fed s abandonment of low rates could trigger another recession in a statement issued after its latest policy meeting the fed it expects it will soon be appropriate to raise rates though the statement didn t specifically mention march half the fed s policymakers have expressed a willingness to raise rates by then including some members who have long favored low rates to support hiring by raising rates the fed will be betting that it can slow inflation without weakening the economy too much speaking at a news conference chair jerome powell expressed his view as he has before that controlling inflation is itself vital to a strong job market the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains powell said is to promote a long expansion and that will require price stability i think there s quite a bit of room he added to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market this is by so many measures an historically tight labor market the fed on wednesday also set out principles it will follow once it decides to reduce its nearly 9 trillion in bond holdings a sum that has more than doubled since the pandemic struck nearly two years ago some analysts expect the fed to begin doing so as soon as july a move that would contribute to tighter credit the central bank s latest policy statement follows dizzying gyrations in the stock market as investors have been gripped by fear and uncertainty over just how fast and far the fed will go to reverse its low rate policies which have nurtured the economy and the markets for years the broad s p 500 index fell nearly 10 this month before rebounding slightly wednesday stock prices which had been solidly higher before powell spoke tumbled during his news conference the market swoon coincided with powell acknowledgement that the fed s balance sheet is substantially larger than it needs to be and that the economy no longer requires such highly supportive action that suggested that the fed might act sooner and faster than expected to shrink its balance sheet which would contribute to tighter credit conditions the fed s bond purchases which have swollen the central bank s balance sheet had been intended to reduce longer term interest rates to spur borrowing and spending many investors also saw the bond buying as helping fuel stock market gains by pouring cash into the financial system asked about the stock market s wild volatility powell stressed that the fed s ultimate focus is on the real economy but he added we feel like the communications we have with market participants and the general public are working monetary policy works significantly through expectations high inflation has become a serious political threat to president joe biden and congressional democrats with republicans pointing to rising prices as one of their principal lines of attack as they look toward the november elections yet biden said last week that it was appropriate for powell to adjust the fed s policies and congressional republicans have endorsed powell s plans to raise rates providing the fed with rare bipartisan support for tightening credit earlier this month minutes of the fed s december meeting revealed that the central bank was considering reducing its bond holdings by not replacing bonds that mature a more aggressive step than merely ending its purchases the impact of the reducing the fed s bond stockpile isn t well known but the last time that the fed raised rates and reduced its balance sheet simultaneously was in 2018 the s p 500 stock index fell 20 in three months by not replacing some of its bond holdings the fed in effect reduces demand for treasuries this raises their yields and makes borrowing more expensive some analysts have said they aren t sure how big the impact on interest rates will be or how much the fed will rely on reducing its balance sheet to affect interest rates all of which means the powell fed faces a delicate and even risky balancing act if the stock market is engulfed by more chaotic declines economists say the fed might decide to delay some of its credit tightening plans modest drops in share prices though won t likely affect the fed s thinking some economists have expressed concern that the fed is already moving too late to combat high inflation others say they worry that the fed may act too aggressively they argue that numerous rate hikes could
