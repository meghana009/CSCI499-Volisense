most entrepreneurs spend a lifetime trying to convince the world that one of their ideas will work just a fraction manage to turn their vision into a business worth hundreds of millions of pounds and even fewer hit the jackpot twice against that backdrop alex chesterman is a quite extraordinary businessman he s just scored a hat trick of major successes his online car dealer cazoo is set to list on the us stock market with a valuation of around 7billion 5billion that follows the sale of dvd by post firm lovefilm to amazon for 200million in 2011 and the float of zoopla the online property agent which was subsequently bought in 2018 for 2billion by us private equity firm silver lake fortune alex chesterman s stake in online car dealer cazoo has made him a billionaire the float later this year is expected to value his stake in cazoo at around 1 5billion pushing him well into the billionaires club and it ll make the firm which was only launched in late 2019 his biggest success to date it s rapidly become the quickest company in the uk to achieve so called unicorn status a company valued at more than 1billion now chesterman reveals that cazoo is aiming to do almost a billion dollars of revenue this year he adds i m told that is the fastest that any company not just a uk company but any company globally has ever reached that landmark it will be welcome news for the group of investors who got behind cazoo in its early days the list includes investment group octopus fidelity blackrock and dmgt the parent company of the mail on sunday so what s chesterman s secret his modus operandi is as a tech disruptor in other words he finds ways to harness the power of technology and the internet to turn an entire market on its head he s not interested in merely grabbing a small slice of large sectors if i had a skillset it s being able to start with a blank sheet of paper and figuring out how i want to solve a problem whether it s through transparency convenience or efficiency he says chesterman openly describes himself as a copycat not in the sense of stealing other firms unique selling points but in identifying successful ventures overseas and translating their model to appeal to the uk consumer for example his blueprint for cazoo was carvana a 46billion american internet car retailer launched in 2012 his foresight was to spot the same growing appetite among britons to buy cars online without haggling on the forecourt in the case of lovefilm zoopla and cazoo it was seeing a model in the us that was really solving a problem and improving a market and then bringing that to the uk he says but as any entrepreneur will testify turning the germ of an idea into a major uk company isn t quite as simple as chesterman has made it look these are long journeys he concedes none of these are overnight successes so you have to be prepared to put in the effort a key piece of the puzzle he says has been building a loyal team of people and a supportive investor base around him several backers including dmgt have invested in his businesses multiple times chesterman however reveals cazoo is likely to be his final venture the 51 year old spent lockdown in london where he dyed his distinctive beard celadon the greenish colour in cazoo s branding for charity other than his facial hair he is notably different from the image of a hipster tech entrepreneur on the west coast of america he s suited no jeans t shirt or black polo neck for him older and more plain speaking than the evangelical cohort based in california however he reckons britain s tech start up investors are starting to become more like their gung ho counterparts in the states one of the historic differences was that every idea got funded in silicon valley that wasn t the case here but now a lot more businesses are getting off the ground and getting that opportunity the result of better access to capital is that more companies are staying private for longer he says chesterman believes the uk and us are still miles apart when it comes to investing in larger tech firms though it explains why he snubbed london for a us listing of cazoo which lost 19million last year i took my last business public in the uk so i m a fan of the uk market chesterman says but that was six years into the journey and it was profitable and it was very well received that s the type of businesses that uk investors typically like those that have got a longer track record are profitable paying dividends and so on the right type of investor for our business at this stage are us investors who know the kind of model we have very well his argument appears to be validated in cazoo s 7billion valuation which compares to the 250million price tag on traditional uk listed car dealers lookers and pendragon chesterman admits he could have given up work after the lovefilm deal thanks to the money he made his three main ventures have made chesterman a wealthy man he gained 20million when lovefilm was sold 200million from the zoopla deal and he s already sold shares in cazoo worth 100million he describes the money as a nice by product of the hard work and effort aside from holidays with his boys the main passion he invests in is bets on other early stage companies i describe it as sort of backing myself 20 years ago i m trying to find those guys or gals he says it s really about finding the right people and then giving them enough oxygen and capital to be able to build a great business among his higher profile investments have been travel specialist secretescapes snack box firm graze and online grocer farmdrop recently he has backed mental health app mindlabs payments firm trustshare and fenton an online jewellery business chesterman was named an obe for services to digital entrepreneurship in 2016 but his arrival in the car industry has ruffled feathers one industry ceo told me he was livid when he read bold statements in cazoo s prospectus claiming market leadership in a string of areas he also questioned the lack of auto experience among cazoo s directors including the boss himself chesterman hits back going in as a disruptor gets people s backs up because what you re saying is we think there s a better way and i have always found that when you re looking to do something different and transformational the less knowledge the better the less baggage you bring the more you re looking at every problem from a completely fresh angle as if to underscore the point when i ask him what he drives he replies a range rover it s black and i don t know the model the car salesman who readily admits he knows nothing about cars now there s something new he backs deliveroo in share chaos cazoo founder alex chesterman has defended deliveroo after its shares crashed on its stock market debut it s a great business and will be fine chesterman said you re always subject to market forces and those type of short swings chesterman said when he was running his previous business zoopla it never bothered me if our share price moved because of something we d done he added what bothered me was when you had wild swings that were nothing to do with anything going on inside our building a plane hijacking somewhere in the world these sorts of events for deliveroo it was an event that will fade over time deliveroo listed at 3 90 in march and shares in the food delivery company are now 2 60
actor and former blue peter presenter peter duncan has no pension to rely on in retirement but he doesn t feel financially insecure because he is using equity release to access the wealth he has accumulated in his 2 5million south london home duncan 67 who presented the bbc children s show in the 1980s says he has never struggled to make ends meet he is currently working on a new interactive online pantomime cinderella which is coming out at christmas visit pantoonline co uk for more details star peter duncan with fellow blue peter presenter simon groom left in 1982 and the actor today what did your parents teach you about money not to spend what you haven t got and to be frugal my father was a theatrical entrepreneur he put on shows with my mother who was a singer and his income depended on what came through the box office when i was born they were broke and were putting on shows that lost money but by the time i was ten they were more successful we moved into a bigger house and became more comfortable financially but i grew up with an awareness that sometimes my parents would make a profit on a show and sometimes they wouldn t that taught me too to be frugal friends thought i led a fun and glamorous life as a child but i knew that acting didn t always add up and that i didn t get to go on expensive holidays and have shiny new bikes like other boys did have you ever struggled to make ends meet no i left school at 15 and started working as an actor and i ve been in work ever since either in theatre or tv i m a grafter like my parents and something either always turned up or i d go off and find some work did you suffer financially during the pandemic no because the minute all the work for actors stopped i decided to make a film in my back garden at the time the pandemic kicked off i was touring in a musical i came back home and had an idea to make a pantomime film in my garden which is quite big i got lots of friends together and a crew and we made this singalong online film where you interact with what you see on screen it ended up going into the cinemas and had a national release and made the front page of newspapers in america i didn t know whether it would work out or not but it did and i didn t lose my shirt now we re doing another one for christmas because of that have you ever been paid silly money yes when i made a commercial for diamond company de beers in 1975 when i was 21 i was told to give a diamond ring to a model and ask her to marry me in various places it took seven days to film and i got paid about 20 000 which would be the equivalent of earning around 170 000 today i bought my first flat in london with the money i made was blue peter good for your finances working at the bbc actually reduced my income initially i only got paid a few hundred pounds per episode there was a sense that you were lucky to do it that you re going to be famous and all that malarkey but it meant i had a steady job for four years the first continuous job i d ever had and it led to more lucrative offers it was a great job too who wouldn t want to be a blue peter presenter travel the world and influence people s lives what was the best year of your financial life it was around 2000 that was the start of the most productive decade of my life i decided to make a documentary in 1999 about travelling the world with my four kids seeing the world through their eyes rather than spending 12 months trying to persuade broadcast channels that my idea was good i borrowed some money went off and filmed it i showed the raw footage which was fantastic to the bbc and it agreed to pay all post production costs then they commissioned me to make two further series that raised my profile and i became chief scout for the scout association as a result that led to corporate work and endorsements the best money decision you have made getting on the property ladder in chelsea south west london in 1975 i bought a one bedroom flat for 7 000 a couple of years later i sold it and bought a bigger flat in the same block for 20 000 then i bought a house in nearby fulham for 40 000 when i was 26 we moved to our current home a five bedroom house in south london 35 years ago when i was in my early 30s it cost 360 000 we had it valued before the pandemic and it was worth about 2 5million it s been a bedrock of financial security for us do you save into a pension no i don t i have a little pension which i saved into when i was young which now pays a meagre income but i didn t really believe in pensions so i stopped paying into it there were a lot of financial scandals at the time and i didn t trust the pension companies i never got one at the bbc because i was a freelancer so i just have my state pension i don t feel insecure about my retirement because we own such a big house we ve gone into equity release so we can access the wealth we ve accumulated in our home do you invest directly in the stock market no i don t want to invest in something i don t have a handle on and i don t like the idea of people making money out of my money i d much rather invest in a business or social enterprise where i agree with the principle of what they are doing what is the one luxury you treat yourself to clinique moisturiser partly because as an actor i sometimes have to put on make up i spend 30 on a little pot and it lasts a while if you were chancellor what would you do i would stop levying inheritance tax on gifts made within families i think you should have the ability to transfer your wealth to relatives without being punished it s not right for the government to take a slice of that money especially a government that seems to be giving money to all of its friends do you donate money to charity yes although i don t donate that much i give my time i m still vice president of the scout association and i m associated with five or six other charities i m also running a marathon in october to raise money for the clothing collective a local charity that gives vouchers to homeless people so they can go to charity shops and choose some new clothes to wear what is your number one financial priority to keep being creative and pursuing the projects i want to do and to keep receiving recompense for doing them

almost two and a half decades the affordable compact has gone from curiosity to sales powerhouse article content while honda first came to canada in 1969 it was not until 1973 when the honda civic arrived and made its presence fully known this is after all the car credited with saving honda as a car company in the sixties it was famous for its motorcycles but less so for its cars of the day the then new civic took conventional wisdom and like the mini before it shattered it in its first year in canada the civic got off to an inauspicious start selling just 747 units however since then it has gone on to become the best selling passenger car in canada a ranking it has enjoyed for 23 straight years we apologize but this video has failed to load tap here to see other videos from our team try

not supported on this browser version you may use a different browser or device to view this in full screen ok while it s impractical to do a complete review of every one of the 11 generations there have been a few milestones along the way the second generation civic arrived in 1980 to broaden its appeal honda offered a four door sedan and of course three or five door hatchbacks the world also got the civic wagon its tall upright stance made it versatile but it was also one seriously ungainly looking piece to its credit however it did get four wheel drive recommended from editorial next gen honda civic si type r both to be available with a manual transmission first drive 2022 honda civic the third gen arrived in 1984 with a sleeker style and the two seat civic crx the fourth gen was better looking and introduced the crx si with a 1 6l engine that made 105 horsepower the handling also took a big step forward with the introduction of a new double wishbone front suspension this made the civic one of the most agile small cars on the road at the time advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content in 1992 the fifth generation civic continued to grow stylistically and the range now included an oddity in the form of the del sol it was essentially a civic coupe with a removable roof panel as the replacement for the much loved cr x it did not fare so well in 2001 the seventh gen civic landed it was equally controversial as the double wishbone suspension was replaced by macpherson struts the uproar focused on the fact the former was supposed to be better than the latter in terms of outright handling history has shown the design works the 2017 civic type r using essentially the same suspension lapped the famed nürburgring in 7 43 8 a time comparable to a 2010 nissan gt r which i remind you boasted 485 horsepower and all wheel drive advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content another memorable civic moment came in 2002 when honda brought the civic sir to canada imported from the company s swindon plant in the uk it shared its platform 160 hp 2 0l i vtec engine and manual transmission with the acura rsx it was also the first civic to feature electrically assisted steering on the subject of acura the civic went upscale in 1996 when the canadian only acura el arrived at the time this civic based model offered an affordable way into honda s upscale portfolio shortly after the new millennium dawned honda introduced the first civic hybrid it picked up much of its technology from canada s first gas electric hybrid the 1999 insight and offered a posted average economy of 5 8 litres per 100 kilometres advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content honda is not beyond making a gaffe the civic introduced in 2012 was instantly reworked in 2013 because of the poor response to the refresh it was then reinvented again for 2016 it was a complete makeover that touched everything key was the fact it eliminated the two tier dash so many disliked and introduced turbocharged power to the civic for the first time part of civic s appeal is the fact it s been produced in canada since 1988 honda canada manufacturing hcm is based in alliston ontario just over 100 kilometres from toronto thirty three years later honda is still building the civic in canada the longest run for any car at any honda plant worldwide in all more than nine million honda cars and light trucks have been produced in canada with over five million of them being the civic the latest running down the line is the all new 2022 civic reviewed elsewhere advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content twenty years after the doors opened in 1986 hcm s four millionth vehicle rolled off the line not surprisingly it was a civic as was the five millionth car off the line in 2009 in 1998 hcm added a second plant which doubled the production capacity to 390 000 units per year a decade later an engine assembly line was added this nugget underscored honda s reputation as an engineering company it remains the world s largest producer of engines over the years the honda s engine innovations have included compound vortex controlled combustion cvcc and variable valve timing lift electronic control vtec in the beginning one of the civic s key attributes was the cvcc engine when introduced in 1975 the 1 5l four cylinder produced 53 horsepower more importantly it reduced emissions and improved fuel economy with the oil crisis and stricter emission regulations coming into effect the civic s ability to meet these new rules without needing emission controls made it an instant hit as did the fact it could burn both leaded and unleaded gasoline advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content meanwhile the detroit based manufacturers were struggling to get emissions under control while chrysler and ford licenced the cvcc technology gm dismissed it as some little toy motorcycle engine this irked soichiro honda so much he shipped a chevrolet impala with a 5 7l v8 to the company s headquarters after some tinkering and installing reworked cylinder heads based on the cvcc design the big v8 was cleaner than the stock engine and it did not need emission controls the catalytic converter was rapidly becoming the go to technology to clean up emissions in the mid seventies of course the honda ized impala also got better gas mileage too the thrust behind vtec is to deliver better performance at high rpm while reducing fuel consumption at low engine speeds and it does this using different cam profiles later intelligence was added i vtec it incorporated cam phasing which brought even better performance and lower emissions of late honda has shifted to turbocharging to deliver better power and greater efficiency the civic type r is the epitome of the new breed 306 hp and 295 lb ft of torque between 2 500 and 4 500 rpm pretty much says it all advertisement 8 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the other intangible is the ability to make the civic whatever the owner wants particularly when it comes to performance this aspect runs from a re flashed chip and cold air intake adding around 30 horsepower to the insane the middle ground is found in the hot rodded civics found on floor at the sema show in las vegas the wide array has included everything from the likes of realtime racing s civic concept racer shown in 2005 to a honda prepared unit in 2011 the civic si hfp honda factory performance which arrived in 2012 as a limited edition model included a body kit lowered suspension and hfp wheels wearing pilot super sport tires for those with a fertile imagination the work extends to insanity a civic with a blue printed 2 2l turbo four that runs 60 pounds of boost pressure is a prime example it produces 1 500 hp gets to 96 km h in 1 1 seconds and has a quarter mile time of 7 45 seconds with a terminal speed of 186 79 miles per hour that works

she kept at their home near plymouth in devon day 1 saturday total waste 1 13kg 600ml my first thought sitting down to write a diary of our food waste is how rarely i notice what actually goes in our bins getting everything cleared into the right containers for recycling food and general waste can feel like enough of a challenge with three bundles of energy for children clare axworthy 42 kept track of her family s typical food waste for two weeks in a daily diary i don t think we re particularly wasteful though like most families we try to make as much as possible from what we buy and we shop frugally also my husband jon and i work from home so we often mop up leftovers for lunch on the other hand i do have a tendency to cook big portions and the kids are all growing so i m fascinated to see how we get on at the end of day one it s already obvious that we have a problem at breakfast time the children often don t finish toast or cereal they ve prepared while i can be guilty of putting too much on their plates today two slices of french toast go in the bin last night we had chicken with potato skins and corn on the cob whenever i cook that dish it never gets reheated the next day so that s in the bin too the kids were all at home today and were snacking through the morning so they ate less for lunch i don t want to be one of those mums who s so insistent on them cleaning their plates that they put on weight i suppose that means accepting the risk that more goes in the bin of course less snacking is the obvious answer but as every parent knows that s easier said than done day 2 sunday total waste 2 44kg 600ml oh dear today s waste was mountainous keeping track of every crumb is making me feel guilty and we re only two days in i do find it hard to cook small portions for sunday lunch i d hate every plate to be empty because i d feel like i hadn t cooked enough but the children don t like reheated roast potatoes so they were binned one small victory today though was leftover pork shoulder shredded and frozen for pulled pork sandwiches at some point i wanted to make soup with the leftover cabbage carrots and broccoli stems but ran out of time day 3 monday total waste 1 15kg 380ml school lunches are a bone of contention in our house the children take fruit every day but it sits in their lunchboxes getting bashed and bruised and is inedible by the time they arrive home today an apple and an orange went straight into the bin eddie ate his banana at home but annie wanted a fresh apple throwing away a few lettuce leaves here or some crinkled up blueberries there might seem like nothing to worry about stock image when i ve threatened them with school dinners they tell me not to bother with the fruit but i know the lunch ladies monitor their lunchboxes it s a conundrum for jon and me maybe we need to bite the bullet and leave the fruit in the bowl for when they get home and here s everything they binned 16½ slices of bread ½ hot cross bun 730ml orange juice 11 rashers of bacon 195g 6 potato skins 5 drumsticks 400g 6 corn on the cob 880ml milk 1½ pain au chocolat 1 fruit corner 1 5kg potatoes 5 stuffing balls 250g 180g cabbage

greek salad 150g steak advertisement day 4 tuesday total waste 1 59kg 330ml buried at the back of our american style fridge i find the leftovers of a chicken curry takeaway from last thursday night that s five days ago and i don t want any of us getting food poisoning i meant to eat it but daren t now so with a heavy heart i had to put the whole lot in the bin half a chicken sandwich and half a ham sandwich came back in the school lunch boxes today i often look up recipes that use leftovers and today i saw one for banana fritters perfect for the four brown bananas now sitting on our kitchen counter but i didn t have time will i make them tomorrow probably not if i m honest it makes me cross with myself but there always seems to be something more pressing than cooking new dishes with odds and ends day 5 wednesday total waste 0 62kg much much better today other than throwing out some old lasagne that s been in the fridge too long the biggest offender in our food waste bin was bacon sammy had a bacon sandwich and i cooked extra to put in a chicken club sandwich for me but never got round to making it it s more and more obvious that time is my biggest enemy i often have the right intentions when it comes to food but ferrying three children to school and back and making packed lunches not to mention working full time eats away at the minutes and hours if i d thought about it sooner enough for example i could have frozen the lasagne a few days ago it s too late now day 6 thursday total waste 1 22kg 150ml more fruit left in lunchboxes more breakfast in the bin this morning an egg half a bowl of cheerios and one and a half glasses of milk all went to waste which feels galling now i m paying such close attention to our waste maybe i need to stand over the kids to make sure they don t heap too much on their plates being stricter on portion sizes works in theory but every mum knows it s hard in practice when you re rushing to get them out to school i took a bite of one of the lunchbox apple that arrived home but it was mushy and bruised later jon discovered some beans in the fridge that were more than a week old he said he d eat them but i refused point blank despite his iron constitution the beans had congealed and looked like an upset stomach waiting to happen he grudgingly agreed day 7 friday total waste 0 69kg now this is more like it a really low waste day for us the kids just devoured my pasta with home made tomato sauce so hardly any went in the bin the only sore point is the garlic bread it s the same story as usual we fill up on pasta and forget the garlic bread after everyone s had a slice i hate throwing it away and stopped making it for a while but then everyone requested it again it s not the healthiest of foods so next time i ll make less but today i decided i d rather it went to waste than on our waists day 8 saturday total waste 0 43kg banana pancakes for breakfast are a saturday treat but in my haste today i made too many and four went in the bin ideally i d have made smoothies with the leftover strawberries which we had on the side but would have meant getting my whizzer out and more washing up with a busy day ahead that put me off the scraps from lunch and dinner aren t worth saving to make another meal although annie was grumpy with me when she came looking for the remainder of her pasty only to find i d binned it i ve made a mental note to wrap hers and put it in the fridge next time day 9 sunday total waste 1 43kg sunday is fridge clear out day in our house which doesn t bode well for the food waste bin limp and squishy lettuce onion and tomatoes all had to go they were buried deep at the back of the vegetable drawer and i cringed as i scraped it all into the bin knowing how much it was adding to my total for the fortnight we re wasting far more than i expected and we re only halfway through the most obvious lesson from today is making more effort to remember what s lurking at the back of the fridge also moving older veg to the front of the drawer regularly would help me use it up day 10 monday total waste 1 75kg despite starting the day with a clean and tidy fridge i somehow threw away more than i did yesterday melon brie and half a tin of tomato soup it s alarming how it all mounts up we re buying too much at the supermarket that much is clear but i can t help thinking the trick is keeping track of it all each day something else seems to go off unexpectedly this time it was coffee cake baked by my mother in law it was delicious while fresh and we managed to get through most of it but the last bit has gone dry i hope she ll forgive us when she reads this day 11 tuesday total waste 1 1kg 50ml i deliberately left a whole cabbage alone when i cleared the fridge on sunday vowing to do something with it two days later and it was still sitting there looking sorry for itself so i ve ended up throwing it annie s birthday was last week and while a good portion of her cake was devoured eddie left the lid off the box and the remainder has gone stale after dinner there is a smidgen of shepherd s pie left over which doesn t seem worth saving or freezing it s not even enough for a meal for annie i like us to eat the same thing round the table as a family as often as we can and saving the shepherd s pie would have meant one of us being the odd one out day 12 wednesday total waste 1 43kg i usually eat porridge every morning but i bought yogurt for a change thinking i d have it with berries melon and honey for a healthy breakfast but no i haven t had a spoonful when i opened it it was mouldy so i had no choice but to throw it out i ll stick to porridge from now on at least the oats can sit in the cupboard for months nearly 20kg of food and more than two litres of milk juice and wine were thrown away in just two weeks stock image banana melon blueberries and grapes all went in the bin today too i want us all to eat more fruit but the amount we waste is ridiculous we left four chicken goujons at dinnertime but they went into the bin before i could even think of saving them for a snack tomorrow day 13 thursday total waste 1 45kg 130ml ok now the amount of fruit going to waste is really getting embarrassing my bin looks like a fruit salad four more oranges today and i was annoyed at the cherries they re my favourite and are quite expensive i bought them as a treat but because i didn t put them in the fruit drawer in the fridge they were tucked away behind the wine shelf i forgot about them we invested in our american style fridge hence the wine shelf thinking that stocking up with big weekly shops would save time and help us eat healthily now i wonder if it s part of the problem it stores so much that i can never see right to the back day 14 friday total waste 1 07kg today didn t seem too wasteful until the evening four corn on the cobs went uneaten along with two half bags of crisps we re always doing this we pour out crisps as nibbles around 6pm on a friday when the children return from their various clubs but inevitably they re left in a bowl and by 11pm when i go to bed they re starting to go stale so i chuck them i really must clip them in a bag when we sit down to dinner a bag of kale went in the bin too i bought it for last sunday s roast but it was too much with all the other vegetables it was more grey than green today so it had to go day 15 saturday total waste 1 45kg 200ml it s my last day keeping a diary and i m dreading the final tally for the fortnight i bought cheesecakes last weekend as a treat but they were still there today and past their use by date i d been eyeing them up but i try to eat healthily during the week and save treats for the weekends what a shame today s saddest loss was the wine i would never normally pour wine away but i spilled some salad dressing in the bottle spoiling the lot so down the sink it went clare s verdict we are staggered and ashamed i m staggered and ashamed about how much we re wasting as a family of five nearly 20kg of food and more than two litres of milk juice and wine in just two weeks and i thought we were pretty low on waste our children are chronically bad at opening things like a big bag of crisps eating some and then letting the rest go stale or pouring themselves a whole glass of milk and drinking only half but it s also clear that despite my best intentions i m routinely buying and cooking too much then throwing away dribs and drabs when i don t think there s enough to save maybe if i could pop to the shops on a daily basis i d waste less because i d be buying food as i needed it but that takes time we simply don t have
austin texas amidst an ongoing severe drought texas and california officials have asked residents to conserve energy this week in a bid to avoid outages as homes and businesses due to increased use of air conditioners during the ongoing heatwave throughout the u s southwest the public s help is essential when extreme weather or other factors beyond our control put undue stress on the electric grid said elliot mainzer chief executive of the california iso which operates the electric grid in most of california as quoted by reuters this year both texas and california put in place rotating or controlled power outages to prevent the widespread collapse of their power systems the electric reliability council of texas the state s grid operator said a new state record for electricity usage was set this week and is expected to be broken by even greater demand within days meanwhile the california iso said its flex alert or call for conservation is critical because when temperatures hit triple digits across a wide geographic area no state has enough energy to meet all the heightened demand officials at the iso said the most difficult time of day is in the evening when demand remains high and solar energy diminishes this year said officials solar power has provided 22 percent of the grid s electric power
fairfield on the days when it is larry hillman s turn to make doughnuts he arrives at hillman s bakery at 4 30 in the morning in the quiet before the bakery opens hillman the baker and owner starts the plethora of baked goods the storefront provides first up are the doughnuts then come the breads and other yeasted treats like cinnamon rolls next are the cookies and after that it depends on what is most in demand and needs to be replenished anything from pies to cakes to brownies to eclairs as he works the rest of the world comes alive the store opening up the commuters stopping in for coffee and a treat and the day carries on located at 16 western ave in fairfield hillman s bakery was opened over 60 years ago the bakery is open tuesday through friday from 6 a m until 6 p m and saturdays from 6 a m until 5 p m founded by lawrence hillman the bakery is a family endeavor and a fairfield institution and the store is now run by lawrence s son larry i ve enjoyed it mostly there are times that it s hard hillman said there are a lot of hats to wear in a small business originally from waterville lawrence hillman learned to bake from his mother and enjoyed it when he was young during world war ii he was in the navy and had a baking position advertisement after the war he used the gi bill to fund his education at the american baking institute in chicago but was drawn back to maine he lived in portland for a while before returning to central maine it s hard to say exactly when hillman s bakery officially opened larry hillman said his father started the business out of his home baking and delivering orders when he wasn t working until he was able to open up the physical store the bakery building was originally a garage for the house hillman said his father converted it into the bakery and expanded it over time larry hillman grew up in the house attached to the bakery and right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of it all his father started the bakery around the same time he was born and while to some it may seem like the equivalent of growing up in a candy store for hillman it s hard to compare it to anything else that s all i knew i didn t really know any different hillman said like many small businesses the pandemic has been a difficult time for the bakery the business closed for a little over six weeks last year hillman said advertisement and even once the bakery itself was open again with most people staying home the business s usual stream of people stopping by on their way to and from work was greatly diminished when we reopened it was ok hillman said things were slower we certainly lost a lot of the bigger items that nobody s had parties or big weddings slowly but surely customers are returning on an average thursday afternoon this month there is a steady stream of people coming and going picking up orders and asking about seasonal pies hillman said that small orders are on the rise but they re still not getting those large orders dozens of doughnuts for the office or spreads for parties like they used to but hopefully with warm weather and lifting restrictions that too will change over the summer months the other struggle with the pandemic has been hiring in the past hillman said he d share a job posting around and have it filled in two weeks now he s been looking for bakers for weeks and can t find anybody hillman took over as owner of the bakery after his father died suddenly from a heart attack 28 years ago hillman had been working at the bakery at the time and was already doing some management work but there was still much he didn t know advertisement it was so sudden too that there were a lot of things i hadn t done or i didn t know how he did it or stuff like that that i had to work out hillman said related fairfield baker retires after 54 years while the transition was rough hillman carried on determined to continue the family business when it comes to the bakery s next chapter it s up in the air hillman said that as he gets older he can t help but think about retiring and his own children are adults with their own nonbaking related careers he s always sort of hoped that he would hire a baker who would invest in the business i think well maybe this time i ll find somebody that shows a really good interest and they ll stick with it and learn for two or three years and then they want to take over but it hasn t happened yet hillman said as it stands he hasn t really looked into anything concrete about retiring and is keeping his sights set on riding out the end of the pandemic advertisement hillman first started working in the bakery when he was around 13 far from the excitement of the baking he was tasked with cleaning floors and wiping counters but over time he worked his way up to get to actually make the baked goods in high school hillman would often get up and work before heading off to school making the early morning doughnuts for commuters fairly often he d bring a dozen or so doughnuts with him to school and during lunch him and his friends from the key club would sell them to other students as a fundraiser while he grew up around baking taking over the family business wasn t always on hillman s radar after high school he went to the university of maine to study electrical engineering but this was in the early days of computers and hillman saw many of his friends in the field go into factory work but he didn t like the idea of doing the same thing all day every day so he came back to fairfield and was pulled back into the baking business it s different because you don t do the same thing where we have such a variety of stock we don t do the same thing all day hillman said we don t just make pies for eight hours straight looking back now taking over his father s business and returning to baking seems almost inevitable but it s hard to say for sure there are challenges to a small business but it s clear that hillman s bakery is a local favorite so hillman continues on as the customers come and go and there are more doughnuts to be made related headlines fairfield baker retires after 54 years send questions comments to the editors

jerusalem just hours after a vaccine sharing agreement was announced with israel on friday the palestinian authority announced that the deal was off because the doses donated by israel were too close to their expiration date and did not meet its standards israel had sent more than 1 million doses of coronavirus vaccines near their expiration date to the palestinian authority in the west bank in exchange for a similar quantity of fresh vaccine to be returned by the palestinians later in the year officials said friday the arrangement to cooperatively manage their vaccine stocks would have allowed the palestinian ministry of health to accelerate its vaccine campaign while keeping unneeded doses in israel from going to waste israel which has already reached a significant majority of its residents with vaccines will get its stocks replenished in time for booster shots later in the year experts said however palestinian health minister mai alkaila told reporters friday that they had expected the doses to have expiration dates for july or august after they received them alkaila said they saw that the doses would in fact expire in june that s not enough time to use them so we rejected them alkaila said according to reuters the vaccine deal announced by the office of new israeli prime minister naftali bennett had followed criticism from palestinian activists and human rights groups that say israel has not done enough to help fight the pandemic in palestinian populations it largely controls israel donated several thousand doses of vaccine for palestinian health workers early in the year and the israeli army inoculated more than 100 000 palestinian workers who have permits to work in israel but then prime minister benjamin netanyahu declined to make vaccines available on a wider scale contending that the palestinian authority was responsible for public health under terms of the oslo accords members of the new government touted their announcement friday as a means to aid palestinians while keeping the virus at bay across borders the statement issued jointly by the prime minister and the health and defense ministries said the transfer of up to 1 4 million doses would be paid back from a pfizer order scheduled to be delivered to the palestinians in september or october we will continue to find effective ways to cooperate for the benefit of people in the region new israeli foreign minister yair lapid said in a tweet the israeli military unit responsible for coordination with the palestinian authority said it delivered 100 000 doses of vaccine on friday before the deal was scrapped it was not immediately clear if some of the shared vaccine would have been passed on to the gaza strip where vaccine levels are lower last month s 11 day war threatened to create a new surge of infections after thousands of gazans were forced to shelter in crowded schools and community centers during israel s bombardment of the enclave israel has seen a dramatic drop in its need for vaccine inventories as its fastest in the world vaccine program has delivered shots to a significant majority of its population and the country has largely returned to pre pandemic life the virus continues to spread in the west bank although the number of positive cases has declined as more people are vaccinated officials have mostly depended on doses donated by third countries or the covax program aimed at inoculating the world s poorest populations you are beginning to see people have more weddings and parties said salwa najjab a west bank physician who has served on one of the palestinian authority s coronavirus advisory panels the situation is getting better a boost in supply would extend the reach of the vaccine campaign in time to help communities weather an expected jump in outside visitors from europe other arab countries and the united states as global travel restrictions are lifted najjab said it will make a difference if they get it out to the villages she said

the latest baylor religion survey conducted in the volatile months of early 2021 finds the lines between political and religious identity blurring even more as americans increasingly self identify in groups that general finding cropped up in several ways in the multi faceted survey from respondents who consider themselves biblical literalists being more likely to believe political conspiracy theories to survey respondents viewing conservative christians as the group most threatening to american societal unity the extensive 86 question survey is the sixth in a series conducted since 2005 and as such has provided researchers with data on long range trends on americans and religion as well as more immediate topics of interest the last one was conducted in 2017 polling company gallup inc conducted the mail and web survey for baylor university s institute for studies of religion contacting 1 248 people randomly sampled in a wide range of demographic groups between jan 27 and march 21 survey director and baylor sociology professor paul froese said the survey s timing proved serendipitous arriving in the immediate aftermath of the jan 6 capitol insurrection and the height of covid 19 deaths in the united states of the people polled 54 5 were female and 45 5 male 49 3 were married and 33 had at least a college degree nearly a third 29 8 reported never attending church while 41 7 attend at least once a month politically those considering themselves leaning conservative to extremely conservative represented 32 4 of the people surveyed 38 2 consider themselves moderate and 29 2 lean liberal to extremely liberal the latest survey the sixth in the series addressed questions of the emotional impact of covid 19 with democrats expressing the most emotional trauma belief in conspiracy theories with biblical literalists scoring highest christian nationalism threats to social unity with conservative christians considered highest followed by democrats republicans and immigrants prayer with more trump supporters praying for their candidate to win than biden supporters masculinity and perceptions of god and the pandemic response among others the first release of survey findings addresses belief in conspiracy theories and subsequent releases will address other topics in the survey there s so much stuff in here froese said we have a team of faculty and students working on this the survey asked participants if they believe the 2020 presidential election was rigged a covid 19 vaccine is untrustworthy top democrats were involved in an elite child sex trafficking ring a small percentage of respondents said they believe those statements with 23 7 saying the election was rigged 13 1 saying a covid 19 vaccine is untrustworthy and 15 3 saying democrats head a child sex trafficking ring but the percentage of belief among participants expressing stronger religious views was markedly higher of those identifying as biblical literalists 47 2 believe the election was rigged 19 5 do not trust a covid 19 vaccine and 34 5 think democrats head a child sex trafficking ring those who consider themselves very religious very spiritual who attended church at least weekly or who feel they had become more religious over the last 10 years also were more likely to believe those conspiracy theories than the national average froese said he finds it interesting that biblical literalists are less likely to believe a covid 19 vaccine untrustworthy than the other two political conspiracy theories because that group in the past had tended to have an anti scientific worldview the baylor survey is structured to tease out respondents beliefs beyond labels and stock phrases he said in addition to a question about how respondents view the bible ranging from belief it is a book of legends to belief it is literally true there are questions on frequency of church attendance personal prayer religious change spirituality and religiosity answers to those questions give researchers a better sense of how deeply some beliefs are held and importantly acted upon biblical literalists often don t read the bible froese said the survey s 2021 findings show a growing overlap in americans political and religious views increasingly hyperpartisanship is taking on a religiouslike fervor froese said the relationship between politics and religion is getting closer it s harder for us to distinguish between the two that may be a consequence of how people get their information belief is a network phenomenon you tend to defer to the people around you he said that s your go to for belief to your information bubble in the modern age that now continues to the internet the mechanisms of social media also serve to reinforce beliefs anyone who goes to youtube to see a video on a particular subject or theme likely will find youtube recommending other similar videos viewing those additional videos will find that opinion or belief reinforced often without the viewer realizing it you have created your own information bubble he said there s a similar correlation of partisanship and faith you look to who s in your network and what they are telling you sometimes an internet virus takes over that bubble there is also some concern that survey participants are answering as they feel someone in their identity group would or should answer rather than as themselves as individuals many of the survey questions and national polls in general have what froese calls identity words like liberal and conservative that shape respondents replies knowing that trump supporters and biblical literalists are more likely not to participate in a national poll survey designers and gallup made extra efforts to make sure those groups are represented in the completed surveys in the aftermath of the 2020 national elections where turnout and results sometimes differed markedly from pollsters predictions some analysts speculated that respondents distrustful of polls might have deliberately lied to skew results it is a trend unsettling researchers and others who rely on polls and surveys for data it s a huge problem in this area of research today froese

president joe biden signed into law on june 17 2021 a new federal holiday juneteenth national independence day it commemorates the day of june 19 1865 when union soldiers many who were black informed enslaved black people in galveston texas that they had been freed two years previously by president abraham lincoln in his historic emancipation proclamation juneteenth signals the official end of the brutal and inhumane institution of slavery in the united states of america though we know that it has continued in others forms through the jim crow era up to and including contemporary times within the current political and educational climate with every increasing numbers of states passing laws banning honest and age appropriate discussions of our nation s past we may have created the paradox by establishing a new federal law that educators may be prevented from teaching hopefully on our brand new federal holiday rather than seeking brand discounts on refrigerators cars mattresses and barbeque grills in our consumerist capitalist economic system we will instead reflect on our continuing legacy of slavery and racism in our country and the capitalist system that spawned it i had the privilege and honor of attending a virtual conference sponsored by the reparations legacy project a group of committed largely white activists working to compensate african heritage people in the u s for the wages and property stolen from them since white slavers first landed with their human african cargo in 1619 on the virginia shores the reparations legacy project rejects the mere giving of charity or the giving of money from rich philanthropists but rather calls for a true and honest accounting of the ways in which the capitalist system inherently requires divisions and exploitation of working people to function capitalism stands as a system based on the creation of capital that supports the exponential accumulation of wealth by the capital class generated by the labor of working classes those without substantial capital are forced within this system to run throughout their lives on a hamster wheel trying to get ahead but most never reach a successful conclusion from the moment of our birth people in the united states are fed the owning class hegemonic line that in this exceptional nation everyone can succeed if they possess the qualities of hard work ambition and personal responsibility this theory of meritocracy however is a myth a lie a fraud as is the theory and practice of trickle down economic in which the owning class trickles down some of its gigantic wealth and compassion to the laborers in their companies in reality only the scraps trickle down success in financial terms has more to do with family inheritance social and cultural capital and of course exhibiting essential social identities in terms of socioeconomic class background and race while economic disparities plague all nations across the planet nowhere are these disparities more extreme than in the united states for example according to the u s securities and exchange commission mcdonald s is among the companies in the u s that pays it workers the least ceo stephen easterbrook was paid 15 9 million in 2018 which equals 2 124 times the median employee salary of 7 473 ceo easterbrook earns in one hour the equivalent of what a median employee earns in a full year mid and upper management employees earn somewhat more but how can a family of four for example thrive on a yearly income of 65 000 to 100 000 per year in any of the major high cost of living centers in the u s white people who comprise only 11 of the world s population own 80 of the world s resources and wealth whereas 80 of the world s population attempts to subsist on the equivalent of 2 50 10 00 per day members of the african people s solidarity committee and the keynote speakers members of the african people s socialist party in particular their chair omali yeshitela presented an historical account of the transformation of what were several distinct and waring tribes into what we know today as europe built literally on the resources and slave labor of african peoples beginning in 1415 with the portugues invasion and enslavement of africans on the african continent looking over the historical emergence of the concept of race critical race theorists remind us that this concept arose concurrently with the advent of european exploration as a justification and rationale for conquest and domination of the globe beginning in the fifteenth century of the common era and reaching its apex in the early twentieth century geneticists tell us that there is often more variability within a given so called race than between races and that there are no essential genetic markers linked specifically to race they assert therefore that race is discursively constructed an historical scientific biological myth an idea and that any socially conceived physical racial markers are fictional and are not concordant with what is beyond or below the surface of the body colonialism stands as the very foundation of capitalism in which the accumulation of capital is gained from the commodification of africa and from black bodies it is more than symbolic that in 1711 slavers sold african bodies in slave markets on wall street in new york city named in 1644 after king george iii of england gave the lands to his brother the duke of york the murder and destruction of black people and property in towns like tulsa rosewood st petersburg st louis and others resulted from white resentment toward black people s accumulation of wealth the 1921 white assault of black people in tulsa oklahoma resulted in the death and injury of hundreds and the looting of approximately 22 5 million dollars of wealth which today would be many times that amount this stolen heritage of black wealth has been repeated in an endless cycle the freedmen s bank with accounts of black people across the country reached 64 million largely due to fraud and mismanagement of senior leaders and the board of directors the bank failed taking with it the deposits of black people in 1874 for example white businessman and politician henry d cooks who sat on the bank s board approved unsecured loans to his own quarry operation following a stock market crash in 1873 the quarry went bankrupt and soon thereafter so did the bank the reparations legacy project conference organizers estimated that 14 trillion is owed to black people in the united states in stolen wealth reparations amounts to restoration of stolen resources politicians must stop singing and start pass legislation at this year s kennedy center honors ceremonies which celebrates the work and inspiration of some of this nation s top artists in many fields joan baez was among the recipients for merging her unique singing and writing style with social justice causes as a surprise those gathered sung together one of joan s signature songs that she has performed hundreds of times at concerts and at peaceful protest rallies though she did not write we shall overcome she performs it as a way of unifying people through their differences and to highlight that everyone has a stake in creating a better world among the audience at the kennedy center was senator joe manchin d wv who lent his voice in the sing along but more important that raising one s voice in song is stepping into one s boots to travel the long and difficult path toward real and lasting change politicians must stop singing long enough to pass legislation that fully guarantees people s rights to vote and to reverse politically inspired gerrymandering stop singing long enough to pass legislation that fully rebuilds our ageing and crumbling infrastructure which disproportionately impacts people of color stop singing long enough to pass legislation that provides real solutions to the crisis of gun violence which also disproportionately impacts people of color stop singing long enough to pass legislation that gets at the roots of the racist underbelly in policing stop singing long enough to pass legislation to clean up our environment and reverse human imposed climate change before it is too late to save our planet stop singing long enough to eliminate the jim crow era senate filibuster which in its current form makes it virtually impossible to pass legislation in curing the ills that plague us and we white people must stop singing long enough to fully come to consciousness how we unconsciously and consciously collude in the oppression of people of color and we must become aware and acknowledge our unearned privilege socially granted on account of our white packaging politicians and others of all political parties and philosophies must make real the african people s socialist party call to uhuru the swahili term for freedom let us make juneteenth more than the commemoration of an event in

op ed views and opinions expressed are solely those of the author the meme stock revolution msr is upon us and it s expanding look when we hit one of them the other day we made 40 and 50 on the trade clne recently pubm pubmatic and clov clover health have been added to the memesters list of stocks then one of my guys calls me and says that clf cleveland cliffs a small iron ore company in michigan is a meme now i had to stop and look at this whole thing again are you kidding this little company iron ore i love the msr in fact carnivore trading is about the democratization of wall street and putting the power of making real money in the market back into the hands of the people and out of the hands of the wall street houses so we have been an advocate of the msr from the beginning it s also in my dna to love the underdog my dad was that way and so am i carnivore trading was vocal about what the dtcc and robin hood and the government did to screw the guys in gme and amc early on when they refused to let them buy certain stocks that was an outright illegal in my opinion attempt to crush the msr movement in favor of the big players it was masked as we have to do something to bring some stability to the system and these gme traders are a bad disruptive force whenever the powers that be use that kind of bs to mask the truth you can bet there s some big money at stake and they re scared the reddit army had taken hold and was running the stock gme up in the face of the hedge fund criminal shorts and i was loving every second of it but then when there were billions lost at the hedge funds and if it kept going there were going to be a number of hedge funds going literally out of business within days the guys that all own the dtcc the depository trust clearing corporation all got together and said all this trading is coming from robin hood let s just require them to post more capital in order to continue to clear their stock trades through dtcc and they ll have to do something to stop it dtc is owned by the top investment banks robin hood isn t a part of the inner circle at the dtcc and who does business with all the big investment banks the very hedge funds that were getting their faces ripped off in the gme and amc short squeezes now you know the landscape what happened is well known now robin hood was forced by dtcc to come up with 1 billion in like a day which they did robin hood also restricted the buying of gme and bb and amc and the few at the time meme stocks that were out there causing the problem at the big hedge funds in order to not have to come up with even more money every day while this went on this caused the stocks to collapse and the hedge funds were in essence bailed out by this move which was forced by the dtcc which is in essence all the investment banks and brokerages that make their money from trading with the hedge funds but we have to understand a fundamental fact here wall street asked for this wall street you wanted more trading income so more trading was good and you lowered commissions to generate more trading you tightened the bid ask spread decades ago by eliminating fixed spreads on stocks and that caused even more trading to happen then you literally eliminated commission trades then you created fractional share ownership allowing everyone on the planet with 50 to buy stock more trading is good right you make more money you re happy right carnivore trading estimates 50 million new traders have entered the markets in the last few years because of three things the ease of opening an account online or through your phone app commission free trades and fractional share ownership add some stimulus gasoline to that fire and you have a meme stock revolution you locked up 10 million people in their homes gave some money to them and then left them with no job and nothing to do but trade stocks and chat online about stocks and with social media they talked to each other some of the smart ones you locked up found a strategy and they found some things that were very wrong on the street and fundamentally this private cloaked in secrecy cabal called the dtcc then they decided to blow it wide open and they did the dtcc has looked the other way on naked short selling for decades they ve been sued for it repeatedly congress has made big but only temporary noise about holding hearings about it but nothing happens everyone drops the whole discussion it doesn t matter how outrageous the practice is how rigged it is how wrong it is everyone just looks the other way because of we suspect the money and the power the money from the street just pays off the politicians to stfu and let things alone and that s because the hedge funds have a good scam going with the naked short selling and they re paying the street a lot of money in trading revenue if you follow the money in this one it s so clear to see who the criminals are and what they ve done but of course nobody is going to do anything to them well the reddit army at wall street bets the heart of the msr figured out that the way to expose this scam and also probably make some money would be to find those stocks that they liked that had huge short interest like too much to be right and start a movement online to buy the stock and drive it up and they did the hedge fund short sellers didn t think much of them at first but then it caught fire and gme went from 20 to 400 and fast that s when the shtf fast forward to today we got through that period the hedgies took some major hits in the billions but they survived robin hood took a huge amount of flak for being perceived to be a part of the cabal and restrict the trading in gme and others and the waters have calmed a bit until this last couple weeks what we are experiencing now is msr 2 0 the movement is not only alive it is morphing and fundamentally changing things in the capital markets the meme stocks are running back up huge which we think is really cool and amazing what is happening is that the number and types of stocks that are being called meme stocks are expanding when an iron ore company is now a meme then this is growing and more importantly the reddit army and all the participants in the msr are fundamentally changing and impacting wall street without them amc would be dead instead just last week amc raised 500 million in capital in an at the market atm deal some of my old wall street buddies did the deal the demand was off the hook so think about that a company that was basically bankrupt is now sitting on so much cash it can actually make things happen do acquisitions maybe even morph into something really cool and giant and great gamestop gme might be alive but it wouldn t be in the shape it s in now with a new awesome leader and big capital coming their way the msr has allowed that to happen while at the same time shining a light on the crooks at the dtcc and the hedgies that have exploited their insider status with the dtcc for decades and made money on abusive naked shorting the story of the meme stock revolution is just getting started it should be a movie we wouldn t be surprised if purring kitty and company haven t already signed off on a movie deal it should be one for sure stay tuned for meme stock revolution 2 0 to really get going this could be fun dutch masters is the

a virtually unregulated investment firm today exercises more political and financial influence than the federal reserve and most governments on this planet the firm blackrock inc the world s largest asset manager invests a staggering 9 trillion in client funds worldwide a sum more than double the annual gdp of the federal republic of germany this colossus sits atop the pyramid of world corporate ownership including in china most recently since 1988 the company has put itself in a position to de facto control the federal reserve most wall street mega banks including goldman sachs the davos world economic forum great reset the biden administration and if left unchecked the economic future of our world blackrock is the epitome of what mussolini called corporatism where an unelected corporate elite dictates top down to the population how the world s largest shadow bank exercises this enormous power over the world ought to concern us blackrock since larry fink founded it in 1988 has managed to assemble unique financial software and assets that no other entity has blackrock s aladdin risk management system a software tool that can track and analyze trading monitors more than 18 trillion in assets for 200 financial firms including the federal reserve and european central banks he who monitors also knows we can imagine blackrock has been called a financial swiss army knife institutional investor money manager private equity firm and global government partner rolled into one yet mainstream media treats the company as just another wall street financial firm there is a seamless interface that ties the un agenda 2030 with the davos world economic forum great reset and the nascent economic policies of the biden administration that interface is blackrock team biden and blackrock by now it should be clear to anyone who bothers to look that the person who claims to be us president 78 year old joe biden is not making any decisions he even has difficulty reading a teleprompter or answering prepared questions from friendly media without confusing syria and libya or even whether he is president he is being micromanaged by a group of handlers to maintain a scripted image of a president while policy is made behind the scenes by others it eerily reminds of the 1979 peter sellers film character chauncey gardiner in being there what is less public are the key policy persons running economic policy for biden inc they are simply said blackrock much as goldman sachs ran economic policy under obama and also trump today blackrock is filling that key role the deal apparently was sealed in january 2019 when joe biden then candidate and long shot chance to defeat trump went to meet with larry fink in new york who reportedly told working class joe that i m here to help now as president in one of his first appointees biden named brian deese to be the director of the national economic council the president s main adviser for economic policy one of the early presidential executive orders dealt with economics and climate policy that s not surprising as deese came from fink s blackrock where he was global head of sustainable investing before joining blackrock deese held senior economic posts under obama including replacing john podesta as senior adviser to the president where he worked alongside valerie jarrett under obama deese played a key role in negotiating the global warming paris accords in the key policy post as deputy treasury secretary under secretary janet yellen we find nigerian born adewale wally adeyemo adeyemo also comes from blackrock where from 2017 to 2019 he was a senior adviser and chief of staff to blackrock ceo larry fink after leaving the obama administration his personal ties to obama are strong as obama named him the first president of the obama foundation in 2019 and a third senior blackrock person running economic policy in the administration now is also unusual in several respects michael pyle is the senior economic adviser to vice president kamala harris he came to washington from the position as the global chief investment strategist at blackrock where he oversaw the strategy for investing some 9 trillion of funds before joining blackrock at the highest level he had also been in the obama administration as a senior adviser to the undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs and in 2015 became an adviser to the hillary clinton presidential bid the fact that three of the most influential economic appointees of the biden administration come from blackrock and before that all from the obama administration is noteworthy there is a definite pattern and suggests that the role of blackrock in washington is far larger than we are being told what is blackrock never before has a financial company with so much influence over world markets been so hidden from public scrutiny that s no accident as it is technically not a bank making bank loans or taking deposits it evades the regulation oversight from the federal reserve even though it does what most mega banks like hsbc or jp morganchase do buy sell securities for profit when there was a congressional push to include asset managers such as blackrock and vanguard funds under the post 2008 dodd frank law as systemically important financial institutions or sifis a huge lobbying push from blackrock ended the threat blackrock is essentially a law onto itself and indeed it is systemically important as no other with possible exception of vanguard which is said to also be a major shareholder in blackrock blackrock founder and ceo larry fink is clearly interested in buying influence globally he made former german cdu mp friederich merz head of blackrock germany when it looked as if he might succeed chancellor merkel and former british chancellor of exchequer george osborne as political consultant fink named former hillary clinton chief of staff cheryl mills to the blackrock board when it seemed certain hillary would soon be in the white house he has named former central bankers to his board and gone on to secure lucrative contracts with their former institutions stanley fisher former head of the bank of israel and also later vice chairman of the federal reserve is now senior adviser at blackrock philipp hildebrand former swiss national bank president is vice chairman at blackrock where he oversees the blackrock investment institute jean boivin the former deputy governor of the bank of canada is the global head of research at blackrock s investment institute blackrock and the fed it was this ex central bank team at blackrock that developed an emergency bailout plan for fed chairman powell in march 2019 as financial markets appeared on the brink of another 2008 lehman crisis meltdown as thank you the fed chairman jerome powell named blackrock in a no bid role to manage all of the fed s corporate bond purchase programs including bonds where blackrock itself invests conflict of interest a group of some 30 ngos wrote to fed chairman powell by giving blackrock full control of this debt buyout program the fed makes blackrock even more systemically important to the financial system yet blackrock is not subject to the regulatory scrutiny of even smaller systemically important financial institutions in a detailed report in 2019 a washington non profit research group campaign for accountability noted that blackrock the world s largest asset manager implemented a strategy of lobbying campaign contributions and revolving door hires to fight off government regulation and establish itself as one of the most powerful financial companies in the world the new york fed hired blackrock in march 2019 to manage its commercial mortgage backed securities program and its 750 billion primary and secondary purchases of corporate bonds and etfs in no bid contracts us financial journalists pam and russ martens in critiquing that murky 2019 fed bailout of wall street remarked for the first time in history the fed has hired blackrock to go direct and buy up 750 billion in both primary and secondary corporate bonds and bond etfs exchange traded funds a product of which blackrock is one of the largest purveyors in the world they went on adding further outrage the blackrock run program will get 75 billion of the 454 billion in taxpayers money to eat the losses on its corporate bond purchases which will include its own etfs which the fed is allowing it to buy fed head jerome powell and larry fink know each other well apparently even after powell gave blackrock the hugely lucrative no bid go direct deal powell continued to have the same blackrock manage an estimated 25 million of powell s private securities investments public records show that in this time powell held direct confidential phone calls with blackrock ceo fink according to required financial disclosure blackrock managed to double the value of powell s investments from the year before no conflict of interest or a very blackrock in mexico blackrock s murky history in mexico shows that conflicts of interest and influence building with leading government agencies is not restricted to just the usa pri presidential candidate peña nieto went to wall street during his campaign in november 2011 there he met larry fink what followed the nieto victory in 2012 was a tight relationship between fink and nieto that was riddled with conflict of interest cronyism and corruption most likely to be certain blackrock was on the winning side in the corrupt new nieto regime fink named 52 year old marcos antonio slim domit billionaire son of mexico s wealthiest and arguably most corrupt man carlos slim to blackrock s board marcos antonio along with his brother carlos slim domit run the father s huge business empire today carlos slim domit the eldest son was co chair of the world economic forum latin america in 2015 and currently serves as chairman of the board of america movil where blackrock is a major investor small cozy world the father carlos slim at the time named by forbes as world s richest person built an empire based around his sweetheart acquisition of telemex later america movil then president carlos salinas de gortari in effect gifted the telecom empire to slim in 1989 salinas later fled mexico on charges of stealing more than 10 billion from state coffers as with much in mexico since the 1980s drug money apparently played a huge role with the elder carlos slim father of blackrock director marcos slim in 2015 wikileaks released company internal emails from the private intelligence corporation stratfor stratfor writes in an april 2011 email the time blackrock is establishing its mexico plans that a us dea special agent william f dionne confirmed carlos slim s ties to the mexican drug cartels stratfor asks dionne billy is the mx mexican billionaire carlos slim linked to the narcos dionne replies regarding your question the mx telecommunication billionaire is in a country where 44 of the population lives in poverty you don t become the world s richest man in just two decades selling girl scout cookies fink and mexican ppp with marcos slim on his blackrock board and new president enrique peña nieto larry fink s mexican partner in nieto peña s 590 billion publicprivatepartnership ppp alliance blackrock was ready to reap the harvest to fine tune his new mexican operations fink named former mexican undersecretary of finance gerardo rodriguez regordosa to direct blackrock emerging market strategy in 2013 then in 2016 peña nieto appointed isaac volin then head of blackrock mexico to be no 2 at pemex where he presided over corruption scandals and the largest loss in pemex history 38 billion peña nieto had opened the huge oil state monopoly pemex to private investors for the first time since nationalization in the 1930s the first to benefit was fink s blackrock within seven months blackrock had secured 1 billion in pemex energy projects many as the only bidder during the tenure of peña nieto one of the most controversial and least popular presidents blackrock prospered by the cozy ties it soon was engaged in highly profitable and corrupt infrastructure projects under peña nieto including not only oil and gas pipelines and wells but also including toll roads hospitals gas pipelines and even prisons notably blackrock s mexican friend peña nieto was also friends not only with carlos slim but with the head of the notorious sinaloa cartel el chapo guzman in court testimony in 2019 in new york alex cifuentes a colombian drug lord who has described himself as el chapo s right hand man testified that just after his election in 2012 peña nieto had requested 250 million from the sinaloa cartel before settling on 100 million we can only guess what for larry fink and wef great reset in 2019 larry fink joined the board of the davos world economic forum the swiss based organization that for some 40 years has advanced economic globalization fink who is close to the wef s technocrat head klaus schwab of great reset notoriety now stands positioned to use the huge weight of blackrock to create what is potentially if it doesn t collapse before the world s largest ponzi scam esg corporate investing fink with 9 trillion to leverage is pushing the greatest shift of capital in history into a scam known as esg investing the un sustainable economy agenda is being realized quietly by the very same global banks which have created the financial crises in 2008 this time they are preparing the klaus schwab wef great reset by steering hundreds of billions and soon trillions in investment to their hand picked woke companies and away from the not woke such as oil and gas companies or coal blackrock since 2018 has been in the forefront to create a new investment infrastructure that picks winners or losers for investment according to how serious that company is about esg environment social values and

by jack heart orage for vt before 1933 when hitler assumed power not a single god among ig farben s council of gods supported the national socialist party in fact four of the twelve men making up the council that called themselves gods were jews 60 all of them knew full well it was feder s intention to eviscerate them once he and hitler controlled germany like the rest of germany s industrialists ig farben had their own man 1926 winner of the nobel peace prize gustav stresemann who came replete with his own party the german people s party stresemann was married to the aristocratic jewish beauty and famed socialite käte kleefeld stresemann would serve as germanys chancellor for 102 days in 1923 when the economy crashed and france occupied the ruhr he would broker peace with france for which he won the nobel prize and carry on as foreign minister and one of the most powerful men in germany till 1929 when he expired suddenly at fifty one of a stroke his german people s party dvp represented the interests of the great german industrialists their politics were right wing liberal and their platform stressed christian family values secular education lower tariffs opposition to welfare spending and agrarian subsidies and a hostility toward anything that even vaguely hinted at socialism they had no use for the weimar coalition and only nominally even accepted that there was a german republic like gottfried feder hugenberg was an adherent of autarky an economic system first postulated by early nineteenth century german american economist georg friedrich list much like americas ex president donald trump list advocated imposing tariffs on imported goods while supporting free trade of domestic goods list stated the cost of a tariff should be seen as an investment in a nation s future productivity to list laissez faire was lunacy and adam smith anathema list called smith s economics the exchange value system and said they were really just another mercantile system ill suited to the emerging industrial age of the nineteenth century list put the good of the nation which he defines as a given culture before individuals segments of the populace or even the entire population itself when it came to them engaging in acts beneficial to them but damaging to the nation s future writing in the 1840 s in pennsylvania he prophetically uses slavery as an example of something wildly benefiting whole sections of the country but certain to end catastrophically for his newly adopted nation national socialism as articulated by feder summed up the basis of nazi employment creation measures as the switch from the liberalistic capitalist economy to a national economy striving toward rational vernünftige autarky 61 but this kind of closed economic space no matter how rational with import restrictions and bi lateralization of trade was anathema to the globalist agenda of rat der götter or the council of gods carl duisberg was the chairman of both the reich association of german industry and of the advisory board of ig farben he is pictured in the featured image of this article in the famous 1926 portrait of the twelve gods with the white suit seated on the right at the forefront he had come to farben as the director of bayer and was a student of the rockefellers whose standard oil so greatly impressed him on a trip to america that he began enthusiastically lobbying for merger of germanys chemical company s immediately upon his return to germany it was the villainous duisberg that forced the use of chemical weapons during ww i 62 in 1916 when bayer managed to synthesize nitrates for the production of gunpowder for the german war effort there weren t enough people to work to implement bayer s scientific breakthrough duisberg had a very simple solution they would make belgium bayer s slave colony there were sixty thousand belgians loaded up on transport trains to be shipped as goods to bayer but german ethics prevailed and the policy was halted to duisberg s dismay undaunted that same year our hero had wilhelm groener one of the most powerful men in germany removed from his position groener had been appointed by general ludendorff to reduce inflation groener had pointed out the obvious germanys chemical companies which were profiting wildly could easily absorb the increased costs duisberg who would be gracious enough to die in 1935 always made it abundantly clear that he was opposed to any attempts at disrupting germany s participation on the world market although he advocated a customs union of central and southeast european states he warned that to focus too much on the latter region would damage germany s overall trading position to duisberg it made little economic sense to endanger 96 6 per cent of our exports just to ensure 3 4 per cent 63 there is evidence that ig farben made secret contributions to the national socialist party in 1931 and 1932 64 by 1933 the support of ig farben would end up being the largest single contribution to national socialism s successful election campaign 65 when national socialism as it was represented to them by feder finally did assume absolute power in accordance with the electoral vote of the german people and with the passage of the enabling act in 1933 if duisberg the anti feder wasn t in germany s driver s seat he was riding shotgun right next to hitler feder along with the wishes of the german people were under their wheels under feder s national socialism ww ii never would have happened at the end of his book feder anticipates international finance will oppose the legal institution of national socialism in germany with all the means standing at its disposal characterize such a procedure as an unprecedented crime against cultured mankind it will through its own devoted press with all possible lies and distortions raise the so called civilized world against such an unprecedented breach of undertaken obligations it will speak of the complete collapse of europe and it will attempt to incite france as the especially suited bearer of european civilization to an open war against germany 66 but feder expresses his doubts whether in general a military power would take on such an enterprise in the service of the financial power is therefore still very questionable 67 feder expects no military conflicts and never would have been suckered into invading poland like hitler because he knew that was just the type of move the bankers needed a national socialist germany to make to get a military power involved his plans involve no military buildup and only passive resistance like germany used when france occupied the ruhr in 1923 he clearly states that the notion that france will invade germany because she is bankrupt is a joke no state has ever invaded another state on such a premise besides german debts will be paid in cash feder writes now our measures do not at all foresee the annulment of these internal german state debts but only the cancellation of interest and the transformation of the bonds into bank assets the cash payment can on the other hand be immediately offered to the foreign creditors how is it possible that in such a case that is when mr x illinois or chicago receives the information from his banker that the german government is paying back the war bonds in cash and that this amount has been credited to his account he would be very angry and set his government in motion against germany 68 feder summarizes in this battle it is only a matter of maintaining iron nerves and not allowing oneself to be frightened by the howl of the press coolies who are maintained by high finance the jew will conduct this battle with the most tenacious doggedness for it is a matter of his honour as the old rothschild said my money is my honour and one who takes my money takes away my honour from me 69 feder should have considered those words more carefully but then again feder was a mathematician a man of numbers no doubt hitler knew war was coming which is why he figured he could trade in feder and all his enemies for schacht and make them friends war would enable corporations like ig farben and standard oil to merge and swallow up not only each other but nations war is what baron de rothschild max warburg paul warburg bernard baruch and various other as of yet unmentioned jews needed to carve out a piece of prime real estate from the middle east and call it their promised land most of all the free masons wanted war they would need three to usher in the new aeon this would be the second august von knieriem was ig farben s lawyer colloquialisms aside knieriem was duisberg s trained viper he specialized in antitrust law and supervised the six company merger that would become ig farben he prospected for six years as a deputy board member till 1932 when they made him a full member and he became a god he would remain on the board presumably till being arrested by the allies in thirty seven he pretty much took over all ig farben s clandestine enterprises when he became chairman of its legal affairs committee it was knieriem who negotiated with the wehrmacht to establish production of what they needed to prosecute their war with the world which of course meant slave labor seemingly just for kicks so he could sit in on the tests knieriem sat on the board for anorgana a subsidiary of ig farben charged with the production of tabun tabun was one of the three next generation nerve gases the germans developed but never used sarin and soman being the others 70 two months before obergruppenfuehrer scheid met with leading german industrialists at the hotel maison rouge knieriem began developing the story to be told to the victorious allies about ig farben and standard oil in their dealings with each other both corporations had been committing treason against their respective countries for years and it was already being talked about in america in fact just from what was known of their prewar dealings with ig farben by 1944 standard oil was already being accused of treason one of the directors r t haslam had little enthusiasm for being hung he published an article in the petroleum times at the end of 1943 titled secrets turned into mighty war weapons haslam had spun it for the american primitives still without the benefit of a walt disney movie about globalism how standard oil had won the war for them the bumbling germans had without getting anything in return for them just showered standard oil with their secrets which of course standard oil used against them in the war effort in an ig farben memorandum boldly marked secret at the top and dated june 6 1944 knieriem addresses his fellow gods on the board of directors about what they will say considering what haslam has already said in the damage control memorandum knieriem hisses the cooperation between ig farben and standard initiated in 1927 and extended in 1929 was laid down in extensive agreements resulting from negotiations over a number of years 71 he makes it clear that it is the directorship of ig farben s position that the americans were ahead of us in their knowledge of the quality requirements that are called for by the different uses of motor fuels information vital in germany s ability to wage war knieriem points out that haslam s article seems oblivious to the fact that ig farben could and was producing fuel for germanys war machine on an industrial scale from coal therefore the hydrogenation process by which germany extracted hundred plus octane fuel from coal had nothing to do with standard oil s new found expertise in extracting what knieriem calls aromatics to produce hundred plus octane gasoline knieriem insists that they will insist specialized information was not turned over to the americans the americans learned nothing from us 72 but of course knieriem was lying he is a lawyer and that is what lawyers do the corporations had been merged at least since 1929 when for a block of standard oil stock worth thirty five million in 1920 s dollars i g farben transferred rights to the hydrogenation process outside of germany to a jointly owned standard oil i g farben company knieriem boasts that the americans learned nothing of ig farben s buna process by which germany produced synthetic rubber from coal in fact at the behest of knieriem frank howard the vice president of standard oil did everything he could to hinder american development of synthetic rubber strangely enough in the memo knieriem doesn t seem worried at all about germany s impending defeat only that ig farben s relation with standard oil not be blamed for it he needn t have worried about america s wrath he and the rest of ig farben s board were going to kangaroo court rockefeller style the subsequent nuremberg trials as opposed to the international nuremberg trials concluded in 1946 were held from forty six to forty nine before an american military tribunal as opposed to the nuremberg trials international military tribunal the farcical trial for ig farben was held in the summer of forty seven as part of the subsequent nuremberg trials their leading role in building and maintaining germany s war machine and penchant for using slave labor after the war began to do it were ignored in modern germany duisberg is a respected name in academics and philanthropy much like the rockefellers in america at nuremberg the americans whitewashed ig farben s institution in poland during the war of duisberg s innovative plans for the belgians twenty five years earlier in june of 1942 with the admission of six hundred inmates ig farben opened the doors to its very own concentration camp on its factory grounds in monowitz poland right next to a place called auschwitz the camp auschwitz iii or buna monowitz reached its maximum occupancy of over eleven hundred prisoners in july 1944 auschwitz iii ig farben blunawerke monowitz bundesarchiv _bild_146 2007 0057 none of it mattered it never did five months after the verdict the judge would file a dissenting opinion but nothing changed the tribunal ruled farben s policy of using slave labor necessary under the circumstances of the war although they were unavoidably held accountable for auschwitz iii no one even got ten years let alone hung for it of the twenty four defendants arraigned thirteen were found guilty on one or the other counts of the indictment and received light prison terms from one and one half to eight years including time already served which allowed at least two of them to walk out the front door after being sentenced everyone was pardoned by 1951 knieriem along with nine other defendants was acquitted outright of all charges josiah dubois the lead prosecutor a smug american from camden new jersey got a rude awakening as to how globalism really worked his head was still reeling from the trial and his legal smackdown when he wrote a book titled the devils chemists at the trial knieriem had underplayed the fact that he had more legal credentials than anyone there including the judge and referred to himself as mr instead of doctor as his academic achievements dictated just a poor old country boy in route to conquering the world august von knieriem when dubois asked him did you have anything to do with this marriage as i might call it between standard oil and farben knieriem answered yes i had a very important part in the negotiations i was in america for weeks at a time 73 when dubois asked him why farben never gave standard the buna process knieriem blames american patent laws dubois is incredulous remarking in the book that farben also received standards secret military formula for making tetraethyl lead the indispensable component for making aviation gasoline 74 for the luftwaffe dubois alleges that knieriem personally finagled a five hundred ton loan of tetraethyl from another firm called the american ethyl company and twenty million 1930 s dollars in fuel mostly aviation gasoline from standard for just that purpose among knieriem s many duties he also handled the legal aspects of the thirty six shadow factories subsidized by the wehrmacht but owned and operated by farben 75 shadow factories were by then already ig farben s favorite trick protecting farben and its illustrious founders like duisberg and nobel laurette carl bosch s name was a priority for rat der götter regardless of who won the war although it is inconsequential because hitler refused to use such weapons dubois also accuses knieriem of manufacturing mustard gas for the wehrmacht in shadow factories he personally owned through farben at the trial knieriem just shrugged it off insisting he didn t know what dichlordiethylsulphide the euphemism for mustard gas used on the written documentation produced by dubois even was he theatrically stuttered as he tried to pronounce it dubois tenor toward knieriem in the book can only be described as awe struck knieriem is sherlock holmes moriarty as dubois goes on to say the western hemisphere thought that krupp von bohlen was the rearmer of hitler it might be fortunate thought the attorneys that ivy lee had failed to make farben a household name 76 the initial thirty five million dollar deal to transfer the rights to the hydrogenation process outside germany did not expressly allocate rights to petrochemicals a second agreement was made in 1930 called the joint american study company or jasco in this agreement farben retained rights to its discoveries in germany otherwise each company had a 5 8 interest in discoveries i g farben contributed all the initial patents to jasco during the last days of september 1939 knieriem met with howard at the hague in holland where they plotted how they would prevent america from seizing ig farben s patents dubois writes within twenty four hours all the jasco patents were transferred to standard oil farben agreed to also put in standards custody the experience for making goods with no wartime use perhaps howards previous blocking of crucial industrial developments in the united states was unwitting now he deliberately accepted in friendly trust the power to prevent the united states from seizing the farben patents standard oil even agreed to hold farben s profits till after the war this agreement was in a secret memorandum signed by howard and left with farben according to which farben could revoke the whole deal at any time 77 frank howard another lawyer after the trial knieriem would become chairman of the supervisory board of i g farben industrie ag i l in frankfurt am main he would quietly rebuild basf now the largest producer of chemicals in the world live to see both kennedys assassinated and die in the early seventies in 1951 what remained of ig farben in the west was split into its six constituent companies then again into three basf bayer and hoechst these companies continued to operate as an informal cartel and played a major role in the miraculous economic recovery of west germany following several later mergers the main successor companies are agfa basf bayer and sanofi in france

elizabeth rever came to the ozarks a few months ago with the hope that she could better herself as she puts it rever has multiple health problems and relies on a walker with daily exercise she is determined to ditch the walker eventually and be able to use a cane almost every morning 63 year old rever catches the bus across from safe to sleep an overnight shelter for homeless women and heads to the ymca to swim and use water therapy to move and exercise then she usually heads to the library station where she can search the internet and make calls to landlords and property management companies as she tries to find a more permanent home rever who gets more than 1 300 a month in social security disability benefits since april has been working diligently with safe to sleep s guest advocate jessica luraas to find an affordable rental but it seems there s nothing currently available in rever s price range that she can access with her walker i ve called every apartment on this list rever said flipping through the pages long list of landlords that luraas gave her it s depressing because i can t find anything everything that would be suitable for me is full and has a long waiting list rever said adding that her credit score isn t great due to recent medical bills she has no evictions no felonies no nothing luraas said of rever she has a good rental history and we are still struggling in rever s case the fact that she needs something either on the ground floor or with an elevator plus access to sidewalks and public transportation makes finding something in her price range nearly impossible more aging on the streets local agencies report rise in elderly homeless people affordable housing has just become less and less available but luraas who s been with safe to sleep for five years said it s become increasingly difficult to get any of the ladies at safe to sleep into safe and affordable housing in springfield these days women can stay at safe to sleep for three months if the woman is actively working with safe to sleep case management on getting into housing she can stay longer right now if somebody is needing income based housing it s at least a year luraas said with oacac and section 8 that can be sometimes even two years market value rents have definitely increased and i feel like landlords have gotten more strict affordable housing has just become less and less available especially the income based housing it s just expected to be six months to a year on a waitlist and it didn t used to be that bad kelli komodi homeless services coordinator for burrell behavioral health said she s run into similar problems with clients who have housing vouchers from the u s department of mental health landlords have so many people trying to get into their properties they aren t interested in bothering with a person with a dmh voucher even though that would be a guaranteed source of rent payments we have been able to house only one person with a dmh voucher in the last year komodi said in an email and in fact they have stopped referring to us because we told them we simply can t find landlords who will accept the vouchers komodi said they have only one client right now with a dmh voucher and they ve been looking for a rental for that person for about three months we have mutual clients with the kitchen who have been looking for several months she said some searches have gone on for so long that the cases have been closed even for individuals who have their own source of income housing that is livable and economically viable is almost nonexistent komodi said in the email if you add barriers of any kind it is pretty much not an option with a reputable landlord michelle garand is vice president of affordable housing and homeless prevention with community partnership of the ozarks garand had not heard yet that the department of mental health had stopped giving housing vouchers to people in springfield but said she knows other organizations are having similar problems more wave of evictions coming amid pandemic how one springfield woman is trying to stay in her home we have funding that is coming in from the federal government to support households and get them rapidly rehoused for example through either vash hud veterans affairs supportive housing or hud funded programs garand said and we just can t find the housing for people we can t find anything that is either fair market rent rates or that they will accept our folks or have any vacancies period it s intensely frustrating because the ripple effects of that are enormous she said we have this huge bottleneck right now where we have money to be able to help folks get into something that is sustainable which would free up shelter space on down the road which would get more people off the streets not only are these nonprofit organizations struggling to find homes for their clients garand said but they are being scrutinized by the federal government checking to see if those dollars are being spent and accounted for correctly if they give us money they expect us to use the money garand said it makes the challenge even more complex affordable housing is pretty tough right now garand said there is just not enough affordable housing available to even place individuals if they have funding we have an aging housing stock we have a lot of older homes that need an influx of funds to make them safe and decent but when we do that that sometimes prices it out that affordability goes away past evictions and felonies are a huge barrier that a lot of people have when trying to find a landlord who will rent to them that is a big deal because right now it s that supply and demand garand said if you have an open unit and you have 40 people trying to get in then you are going to take the person with the least amount of barriers these people might have to pay more than double deposits garand said if they are lucky enough to find a landlord who will consider renting to them it s definitely a property owner s market right now garand said affordable housing is not just a springfield problem according to the most recent report from the national low income housing coalition people who earn minimum wage and work full time can t afford a two bedroom rental in any state in the u s without spending more than 30 percent of their income the coalition s annual out of reach report found that in missouri a full time worker 40 hours a week 52 weeks a year must earn 16 07 an hour in order to afford the fair market rent for a two bedroom rental home without paying more than 30 percent of their income the minimum wage in missouri is 10 30 an hour that means a missourian earning minimum wage would have to work 1 7 full time jobs or 68 hours per week in order to afford a two bedroom rental that person would have to work 1 3 full time jobs or 54 hours per week in order to afford a one bedroom rental the report broke down the numbers by counties as well in greene christian and webster counties the report found that a full time worker needs to earn 14 35 an hour in order to afford a two bedroom rental at the fair market rate of 746 a month a full time worker earning minimum wage would need to work 1 5 jobs to afford that two bedroom home or 1 1 jobs to afford a one bedroom home a few years ago community partnership of the ozarks asked the national low income housing coalition to take a deeper dive into springfield s rental inventory using data from 2011 to 2015 the coalition found that there were about 10 140 extremely low income renter households in springfield meaning those who earn less than or equal to 30 percent of hud area median family income with enough units of affordable and available housing for 20 percent of them for very low income renter households those earning less than or equal to 50 percent of hud area median family income the deficit was smaller with enough affordable and available units for about 66 percent of those households garand said those numbers were shocking to see but also validated what we knew to be true there is a severe lack of affordable housing for folks that are living on fixed income or those who are unemployed and don t have access to income in any way she said asked if she feels the numbers have only worsened in recent years garand said absolutely yes especially under covid garand said springfield s housing stock has only gotten older as well she said garand noted that a large number of springfield low income rental properties were involved in the chris gatley and 417 rentals bankruptcy debacle a few years ago hundreds of gatley s properties went into foreclosure and were purchased by people who then had to invest money to get the units up to par again that caused the rent on many of those units to go up and out of the range of the people who were originally living there more it just fed itself how chris gatley s properties became springfield s public menace that is one reason i feel like that deficit is probably a little higher because we had such a huge volume of rentals that went into another bracket garand said and honestly it was absolutely not the fault of the property owners that bought those properties because they had to invest a lot of money to get those places habitable you have to do the work rever was living in oregon last year when she fell very ill she s not sure if she had covid 19 or not but said she was in the hospital for three months at one point the doctors were preparing to intubate her when i woke

lewiston a neighborhood that people want to live in the choice neighborhoods redevelopment while the housing portion of the plan won t likely get going until 2023 here s what it s slated to bring to the downtown tree streets neighborhood replacement site 1 a 66 unit mixed income housing development with ground floor commercial space along pine street across from kennedy park replacement site 2 a 64 unit mixed income development between pine bartlett walnut and pierce streets with a broader mix of housing styles including duplexes the project will also include four renovated units replacement site 3 once the first two replacement sites are complete the plan calls for relocating residents of the maple knoll housing complex on maple street and demolishing the building another redevelopment of between 13 15 townhouse style homes is planned for ash street that s what some residents of the tree streets neighborhood envision when they hear the word transformation it s a term that s become ubiquitous with lewiston s multi year choice neighborhoods initiative months of community planning and an application process that became a 30 million reality in late may the redevelopment grant from the u s department of housing and urban development is slated to bring 100 million worth of investment into the city creating 185 new housing units in an area where the rate of childhood lead poisoning is higher than anywhere else in maine but while three ambitious housing projects are at the center of the plan those involved know transforming maine s poorest neighborhood will take more than new housing that s why other sections of the plan and a portion of funding focus on health education and neighborhood beautification efforts the people who have been closely involved since the process began in 2017 have high hopes they have seen a passionate neighborhood galvanized by the planning effort and now on the cusp of actual change advertisement but what does transforming the neighborhood mean for the people who live there and will it have an impact on the entire city i do believe it will be transformational as long as we adhere to the spirit of the plan where new rental housing is only one piece of the solution said amy smith founder of healthy homeworks and a member of the healthy neighborhoods planning council which organized the planning effort she said the other two pieces of the plan investing in neighborhood amenities and in the residents themselves are the real keys to success growing our tree streets by sunjournal on scribd the sun journal spoke with people who led the neighborhood planning effort as well as officials from another u s city that started undertaking a similar project in 2018 about how and when choice neighborhoods can deliver on the changes that are promised transformative advertisement when talking to those involved it s clear there are differing views on what transformation will mean for lewiston s inner city neighborhood the plan completed and adopted by the city council in 2019 lays out nine goals ranging from removing lead and growing a diverse inventory of housing options to a focus on health and wellness bolstering educational outcomes and career skills and providing more recreational opportunities for youth mayor mark cayer said he recognizes it can be easy for the effort to sound like a marketing campaign but he said the fact that the plan means so many different things to different people speaks to how comprehensive it is he said by itself the focus on removing lead paint from homes will have a transformative impact on the entire city with instances of childhood lead poisoning decreasing educational outcomes will rise he said ashley medina who served on the healthy neighborhoods planning council said her brother suffered from childhood lead poisoning so she s seen the horrible health effects caused by lead and the stress it brings to families that are often already living in poverty medina also had her home destroyed by fire in 2013 part of a string of fires involving downtown apartment buildings at that time advertisement it really excites me to know that people will have homes that are safe to live in and lead free she said our homes should be our safe space if you aren t happy or comfortable in your home it can make it very hard to thrive even when completed the new housing will be just a start to the plan s goal of either removing or remediating lead from some 1 500 units built prior to 1950 medina said outside of housing she believes the added resources in the plan for job training child care transportation access to healthier food and other projects will directly impact people in the community who are struggling and living in poverty more than half of the residents in the neighborhood are considered to be in poverty my hope is that people living in this community will feel heard and seen she said i hope it will help people feel more empowered that their community cares for craig saddlemire who has been involved in community building efforts in the neighborhood for more than 15 years the choice neighborhoods effort has already been transformational advertisement he said the planning process was the most inclusive transparent and resident centered planning effort this neighborhood has likely ever experienced but on top of that he said the new housing will change how people view the neighborhood the new block of housing between pine and walnut streets will give us a chance to promote more enjoyable walking space green space and family homes he said the plans also place parking and waste disposal between buildings away from the street when people visit that section of the neighborhood it s going to offer a real vision of change and also a place where local families will want to raise their children he said misty parker lewiston s economic development manager who has led the effort from city hall said transformation will be seeing a neighborhood people want to live in both for the people who live there now and for those looking to find a home in lewiston transformation will be seen when our childhood lead poisoning incidents are decreasing because property owners have the ability to invest in their buildings and when parents feel their neighborhood is a place where their children can thrive taking shape advertisement while the first phase of redevelopment a 66 unit housing complex with ground floor commercial space on pine street isn t slated to start until 2023 there are small signs the plan is already moving forward the first step for city officials and the city s partner the lewiston housing authority is to sign the grant agreement according to parker officials from hud will conduct a site visit in july where city staff will get more direction on how we need to refine our proposal and develop work plans each section of the plan will now require more detailed work plans with defined metrics and timelines to be established and submitted to hud within the first year for example the people section of the plan focused on the residents of the target housing sites has five specific metrics they include increasing regular wage income of nonelderly nondisabled households increasing the number of children under the age of 6 ready for kindergarten increasing children performing at or above expected state average grade levels and more as we dive into developing each plan with hud and our partners we ll be working to define our metrics and set targets so that we can report out the progress we are making in each area and to the goals of the transformation plan she said parker and others said that while the most visible development is still far off work on the other goals is already happening advertisement she said there are plans to expand promise early education center now on bates street to 1 college st within the first year including the addition of an outdoor play space last week smith who is also a lewiston landlord hosted an open house on howard street for a new program she created called renter 2 owner meant to create durable starter homes in the neighborhood with roughly 96 of residents in the neighborhood renting creating more pathways to home ownership is another goal of the choice neighborhoods plan also getting a facelift last week was a public play area at the corner of pine and bartlett streets where a new fence was installed smith said it fit the plan s goals of making the neighborhood a safer cleaner place and one that has more options for youth the pop up park is located where much of the new housing will eventually be situated as part of phase 2 of new construction but smith said by activating this large green space now instead of letting it sit idle until construction begins healthy neighborhoods is creating positive change immediately contributing to the excitement momentum and validity of the plan saddlemire said by this winter the city will have a new sledding hill behind longley elementary school that will provide outdoor winter recreation when many kids feel stuck indoors and are really looking for convenient ways to play outside advertisement that s just one example of visible changes that are going to give others more confidence to invest in the neighborhood in other ways he said i think it will give people a lot of hope medina said the plan s focus on youth will make a huge difference and give them as well as others a new perspective on the area a lot of youth decide to leave this community because they feel there is nothing here she said lewiston has the most youth in the state of maine and they are literally the future if they feel like they don t matter why would they want to stay smith added that while the neighborhood awaits the official grant process to gain steam the plan and its goals are there for residents to get to work on now everyone can understand the goals and get creative about strategies and tactics to achieve those goals aligned with the choice grant but outside of its specifics and timeline she said newport news virginia advertisement when hud announced the grant award last month lewiston became the first city of its size to receive the 30 million implementation grant since the program was launched in 2009 the smallest city to receive an implementation grant was newport news virginia in 2018 the city has a population of about 180 000 in newport news the marshall ridley neighborhood plan shares many of the same goals as lewiston its housing stock was in desperate need of updating in the three years since the award the neighborhood known as southeast has seen two new health clinics one a mobile clinic and the other in a former apartment unit there are education and workforce development initiatives including new headstart programs and a career center a new boardwalk on pinkett s beach the first interracial beach in the region after segregation ended was part of early choice neighborhood efforts there are new community gardens streetscape improvements neighborhood banners and murals but all of that has come before any new housing was built advertisement according to eoghan miller assistant to the city manager in newport news a groundbreaking for phase 1 of housing development in the city was held just last week from there he said it will be on schedule for a fall 2022 completion like lewiston the plan involves several phases it calls for developing single family homes and mixed use buildings in its first phase along with renovations to public apartment units some renovations to public housing have already occurred in lewiston officials have said the long timeline before construction can begin here is tied to financing while 70 of the funding is earmarked for the three redevelopment sites the projects will still require financing that job will fall on the lewiston housing authority and its development partner avesta housing when asked about the financing process in newport news miller said the city had some success seeking a number of funding sources but the bulk stemmed from virginia housing tax credits and city funds officials in lewiston have said they plan to use the 30 million grant to leverage a variety of funding sources for housing construction parker said that when lewiston received an initial planning grant in 2018 to pursue the larger choice neighborhoods grant the city reached out to several cities that had been through the process to learn from them she said staff has met with its hud team coordinators to learn about the complexity of beginning the implementation program advertisement investment one of the key hopes of city officials is that the federal grant can attract more private investment in the neighborhood if developers or investors see the momentum building in the neighborhood they might be more likely to pursue redevelopment projects renovations construction or new businesses obviously we re going to get some new housing but i truly believe that it will generate investment there from the private sector cayer said the mayor also believes the added investment in the downtown area will benefit the entire city if that area becomes stable it provides better opportunity he said if you have a struggling neighborhood in the core of the downtown area that dramatically impacts the entire city that alone is what makes this transformational parker said one of the central ideas of the program is that the investments made through choice neighborhoods will create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in the neighborhood that will create healthier safer housing with neighborhood amenities and assets important to families advertisement saddlemire also believes the neighborhood will see more private investment but he believes it could have drawbacks he said he has some concern over the long term impacts of real estate speculation which is often a way that people from outside the community profit from the social investment we ve all put in many of us as volunteers when someone buys up an old building and then raises the rent because the community has been making improvements around that building i think that s wrong he said the concern is tied to the idea of gentrification which describes the process of a poor urban area that through revitalization can lead to current inhabitants being priced out saddlemire through raise op housing cooperative is currently expanding its reach of community controlled housing the nonprofit has plans to double its footprint in the downtown by building two nine unit apartment buildings on separate vacant lots when that project was announced lincoln jeffers director of economic and community development for the city said the project was in keeping with the choice neighborhood plan and in keeping with the plan s goal of developing owner occupied in fill housing in the tree streets neighborhood we want every person who lives here today to stay and enjoy these improvements we are making together saddlemire said more projects like ours and the efforts of lewiston housing and community concepts will ensure the neighborhood remains a place where everyone who wants to live here can find a home that s what the choice grant is all about

kathmandu june 19 at a time when the several south asian nations including nepal have been hardly hit by the second wave of coronavirus pandemic government s lack of preparedness has been exposed as hospitals faced acute shortage of oxygen and other medical supplies putting lives of hundreds of covid patients at risk even though the government has imposed a nationwide lockdown to curb the current situation altering the modality now and then the rate of infections and deaths has remained not decreased significantly in this regard mausam shah nepali of the himalayan times talked with us based nepali cancer research scientist dr digbijay raja mahat who was one of the members of covid 19 researchers team while developing the crispr kit technology to detect the coronavirus in the usa and dr sargam raja mahat who has been closely following all aspects of covid 19 vaccine development to know and understand about the deadly virus and the pandemic as a whole excerpt what do you make of the ongoing second wave of covid 19 being more contagious and spreading at a rapid rate in comparison to the first wave in nepal although we do not have adequate sequencing data all the available evidences indicate that the ongoing second wave is driven by new variants limited sequencing of sars cov 2 genome from samples collected in nepal clearly indicates the prevalence of new variants in our communities the cases and mortality in our southern neighbor where sars cov 2 genome has been sequenced relatively widely has been driven by new variants that are more contagious inevitably those variants have made their way to nepal some key alterations in the genome of new variants primarily in the spike protein make them more efficient in binding engaging and entering the human cells increased efficiency in invasion into human cells enable them to proliferate more rapidly thus altering the incubation time and clinical manifestation of the disease not only that reports indicate that the variant may also have better ability to evade the antibodies generated by natural infection and vaccination these features make variants appear more deadly however increased deaths do not necessarily mean the variant is more lethal a widely transmittable variant will infect more people and eventually result in higher deaths for example if non mutated sars cov 2 causes two deaths out of 100 infections then a more contagious variant can result in four deaths by infecting 200 people but the mortality rate in both cases is 2 so far we do not have a concrete evidence of increased lethality in the new variants circulating in our region there was a hypothesis of sorts being floated earlier that nepali immunity factor was the reason behind low infection rate and corresponding deaths but there is no evidence to support that assumption given the current situation what are your thoughts on this particular premise when the virus was rampaging through other parts of the world in 2020 we were left unscathed this apparent discrepancy fueled the speculation of pre existing immunity in our population attributed to previous exposures to related pathogens which is also the central premise behind the hygiene hypothesis we also believed that this theory of previous exposures might have conferred cross protection to our population which led to less severe cases and deaths it was a feel good narrative which many of us wanted to believe however it has been disproven now we were lucky to evade the first wave that engulfed much of the world currently we are one of the most affected nations and our regions is among the hardest hit the beauty of science lies in its ability to strip the false sense of security serenity or superiority it is humbling to know that we are just as vulnerable as others to covid 19 despite our perceived advantage which many experts believed was conferred by our unique terrain herbs and fond recollection of bravery the only solution to the current pandemic is the vaccine dr sargam raja mahat what is your take on the nepal government halting the vaccination drive amid the pandemic how could the authorities have systematised the inoculation process during the lockdown to ensure safer administration of the vaccines as opposed to the consequantial mismanagement it is a no brainer that the authorities could have continued the vaccination instead of halting it in the middle of pandemic in fact the best tool we have in the fight against covid 19 are the vaccines depriving the vulnerable population of vaccine is akin to asking them to go to a war without their best weapon we have seen images of orderly vaccination in countries of similar socio economic status could the pause be driven by the dwindling stockpile of the sinopharm vaccines that were administered during the onset of second wave government authorities and medical personnel in the grounds would know better people are really curious about the efficacy of various kinds of vaccines that are available worldwide during the second wave we have noted that many people that were infected earlier are getting re infected and even the people that were fully vaccinated are showing severe symptoms what could the reason be is its because the vaccines are getting ineffective against the new variant no vaccines were advertised as being 100 efficacious we were certain of breakthrough cases and we are seeing them however the overwhelming evidence indicates that these breakthrough cases are much less severe vaccinated people who get reinfected can largely avoid hospital stays the important thing to understand here is this is exactly how vaccines are supposed to work the immunity conferred by vaccines is much more effective at protecting from severe disease and death than preventing viral entry and infection with heightened scrutiny on the pandemic and vaccines we are excessively cognizant of incidences that defy our expectations such as breakthrough cases nevertheless it is true that some vaccines are less efficacious at preventing mild to moderate infection caused by new variants but almost all of them have over 95 efficacy at preventing severe disease and death it will serve us well to remember that the protection conferred by covid 19 vaccines is better than vaccines against several other diseases such as annual flu vaccines covid 19 vaccines are remarkably efficient in protecting from sars cov 2 variants too when people talk about immune protection they mostly think of antibodies but our immune system is much more than just antibodies we also have unsung heroesin this battle t cells and vaccines elicit t cell response very well recent studies have shown that while some variants may evade antibodies generated by infection or vaccination they still have negligible impact on t cell recognition there is a lot of confusion regarding the use of plasma therapy for treatment of infected people with severe symptoms while hospitals are using this method many experts have shared that this is not really very useful while many countries have halted its use for covid treatment your take based on overwhelming available evidence convalescent plasma therapy is ineffective against hospitalised people with severe symptoms the main goal of using plasma therapy is to provide antibodies that can neutralise the virus and halt further replication by the time patients get hospitalised with severe symptoms virus has replicated enough therefore providing antibodies via convalescent plasma serves little to no purpose by that time the enemy is not the virus but patient s own immune system having said that plasma therapy could potentially work if high titer plasmais is used within 3 4days of symptom onset because the sooner you can neutralize the virus less severe the symptoms will be and the recovery could be expedited timing is key when it comes to convalescent plasma therapy this has also been proven by the monoclonal antibody cocktail treatments used in the usa informed citizens and media have to play their constructive role rather than fueling unfounded conspiracy theories to deter vaccination is there any scientific reason behind why usa wants to offload its 60 million stock of astrazaneca vaccine us does not need astrazeneca vaccines fda has approved three highly effective vaccines moderna pfizer and johnson johnson almost half of the us population has already received one dose there are reports indicating the availability of more vaccines in the us than the number of people who want them the supply pledged by the three companies exceed the demand rendering astrazeneca s 60 million vaccine surplus dr anthony fauci also recently opined that us may not be needing astrazeneca s vaccines there should be no confusion or qualms regarding the efficacy or safety of astrazeneca vaccines and therefore we don t see any reason to second guess usa s decision of donating them not only astrazeneca president biden recently announced that us will be donating further 20 million doses of other fda approved vaccines it is an obvious and smart decision to donate them to needier nations because it is abundantly clear that no one is safe until everyone is safe are the astrazeneca jabs that the us has committed to provide to south asian countries as effective as the other vaccines first of all i would consider us lucky if we receive significant amount of vaccines from the us there are many nations around the world lining up for these surplus vaccines there is nothing wrong with those vaccines it has the same formula as the covishield that nepal has used high vaccination rate is the only way out of this pandemic informed citizens and media have to play their constructive role rather than fueling unfounded conspiracy theories to deter vaccination the best vaccine is the one that gets into our arms where do you actually see the problem is in nepal government in securing vaccines and effectively implementing the program as you have been continuously putting in efforts to help the government procure vaccines from the us what are the hurdles that the authorities here may have had to face the major hurdle in procuring vaccines by nepal government is the availability of vaccines in the world market we have tried our best to help ministry of health population and nepal government s diplomatic missions in their pursuit of vaccines we connected with mohp with moderna s senior vp patrick bergstedt who is responsible for vaccine allocation patrick had a zoom call with the then mohp spokesperson dr jageshwor gautam and chief of the national immunization program dr jhalak gautam we also connected mohp with j j s senior executives sarthan ranade and jyotsna ghosal who look after south asia region and vice president of global vaccines jonathan collard both companies eventually declined nepal government s request of direct purchase and instead asked nepal to go through covax our status as a lmic nation subjugated voice in the world stage and the lack of dispensable resources many nations invested and paid for the vaccine development without certainty of return of their investment prevented us from timely procurement of vaccines companies manufacturing vaccines have non uniform pricing structure for example moderna decides price based on country s gdp they would have to sell the same vaccines to nepal at a lower price compared to for example canada which disincentivises companies to sell to countries like nepal do you think the virus will come back again in the form of third wave and how contagious it would be it is impossible to rule out another wave for two reasons first the majority of the world remains unvaccinated and as we have learned in the past month a new wave can emerge in one part of the world and swiftly spread to others second the sustained level of infection is a perfect breeding ground for new variants as we have learned some of these variants are more contagious and more resistant to vaccines it is difficult to rule out the possibility of new variants that could be even more resistant to vaccines in our opinion another wave is possible if we fail to expedite equitable vaccination programs covering rich and poor nations equally when majority of the population is left unvaccinated virus continues to replicate and with each replication probability of new variants emerging increases just by chance some variants can be more transmissible or even worse more adept at evading antibodies generated by natural infection or vaccination therefore we should make every effort possible to procure vaccines as soon as possible and roll out a fool proof plan to tackle vaccine hesitancy vaccines do not save lives vaccination does even a 100 efficacious vaccine will have no effect if it does not get in the arms of people what does nepal need to do in the coming days to deal with the pandemic the playbook to fight the pandemic is open to the world some nations have succeeded and some have failed we are not experts on public health so we will defer to the recommendations of public health experts of nepal in this matter is the lockdown only way out to deal with the virus lockdown is not a popular solution however it is the only effective control measure during this unprecedented surge while there are mortality reducing therapies like dexamethasone and tocilizumab they do not prevent transmission nor have any effects on viral replication they simply calm the cytokine storm that our immune system generates in the later part of the disease vaccines are the ultimate solution to get out of this pandemic and there are studies to show that they can start working as early as 12 days after the first dose unfortunately we may not be getting enough vaccines to make meaningful impact for a few months at least until then social distancing is the best way to slow transmission and unfortunately lockdown is the ultimate resort to minimize transmission lockdown is not the permanent solution to the virus however adhering to the government safety standards would help to keep the infection rate low by the time vaccines are delivered dr digbijay mahat some people have been saying that the vaccines have failed to shield people from getting infected your comments we have to understand the definition of end point to measure vaccine s success and failures vaccines were never designed to completely prevent infection so it is unfair to label vaccines as failure due to few cases of breakthrough infections however data from vaccine trials show that they are highly efficacious at preventing severe illness hospitalisation and death while we are observing and acknowledging breakthrough cases in the vaccinated population some of which could result in severe symptoms the chances remain very very low we do not have clear data in case of nepal but usa s cdc routinely publishes these data as of may 10 there were 1359 breakthrough cases that led to hospitalizations or deaths out of 115 million fully vaccinated people that is a 0 001 breakthrough rate amongst fully vaccinated population if you consider that some of those deaths and hospitalizations 384 were unrelated to covid 19 the probability drops down to 0 0008 that is a miniscule number compared to how many people have been protected a recent report from india indicated that the covishield s effectiveness against breakthrough infection in health care workers was 97 and the hospitalization rate was only 0 06 reports from italy further reinforce the effectiveness of vaccines vaccines have been a resounding success in your opinion how long would it take for science and technology to come up will full proof solutions to entirely overcome the pandemic we don t want to speculate the length of this pandemic or the probability of a new wave however although we are in the midst of the deadliest phase of the pandemic in our country there are good signs around the corner the vaccines are working the production capacity of vaccine manufacturing companies have increased and more vaccines will be available in the world market the covax program hopefully together with world s rich nations will deliver vaccines to countries in need even the citizens of rich nations who are privileged to be vaccinated first will realize the need for the entire world to be vaccinated for them to be safe and their advocacy for poor nations will amplify scientists are already working on pan coronavirus vaccines that holds the promise to mitigate potential pandemic at its root similar preemptive work is ongoingin the discovery of pan coronavirus monocolonal antibodies which could be used to treat future corona virus caused diseases the issue of vaccine equity was overshadowed by the crisis but let s hope it will gain momentum and the equitable vaccination becomes a reality once the dust settles we will have time and motivation to ensure mechanisms to prevent such pandemic in future both the origin and the management read also of trials errors and eventual success

n288b covid 19 relief fund how govt mdas scammed us by sme owners with the federal government claiming to have disbursed n288billion covid 19 relief fund to alleviate the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic on vulnerable nigerians taiwo alimi fact checks the claims against available data and facts smes shortchanged during disbursement as politicians hijack palliatives more than 100 million nigerians sink into poverty nbs world bank folashade adejobi owns a small and medium sized enterprise sme running a catering service in lagos state her business however suffered badly during the lockdown triggered by the covid 19 pandemic all the companies she serviced shut down except one the only one that weathered the covid 19 contraction subsequently downsized this affected her business negatively her income got depleted by half and she began to feed on her little savings in the bank in a short while all her reserves were gone cash strapped adejobi needed help and in late 2020 her sister introduced her to the federal government of nigeria fgn s covid 19 supporting small business msme survival fund supervised by the federal ministry of industry trade and investment and she applied for the fund she got a form filled it and submitted after waiting for more than three months she received a text message from a government agency in april 2021 that her application had been granted and she would be paid n30 000 monthly as sme support for three months her happiness knew no bounds i felt happy because the support is coming at the right time things are too expensive in the market and it is eating into my profit she said the 45 year old s optimism however dwindled when the money finally arrived my sister called me prior to disbursement that a condition is attached to payment i would have to refund n15 000 00 half of the payment she said she could not comprehend it at first but her sister insisted on the settlement for government officials in late april n30 000 was transferred to my first bank plc account and my sister called that she had been reliably informed of the payment that same day she demanded the settlement from the agreed sum paid into her account unfazed adejobi refused to pay up for three days she however succumbed on the fourth day following incessant harassment by phone calls thinking that was the end of the drama within three days of the first installment she woke up to see another alert of n30 000 and almost immediately her sister called her again to request the usual payback at first she lied about receiving the money but her sister persisted until she succumbed and sent the settlement what is glaring to me is that the government officials are working hand in hand with my sister and banker they knew the moment i got the money and they won t allow me rest until i returned half of it another question agitated her mind i was supposed to get the money within three months that is n30 000 monthly but to my surprise the full n90 000 for the three installments was paid within 10 days she reckoned that the system is either fraudulent or is being manipulated by fraudulent officials and their collaborators a culture of settlement adejobi s story is hardly different from that of taju ibrahim an artisan living in ogun state businessman lanre osifeso from akure in ondo state and housewife felicia wogu who resides in magboro ogun state ibrahim received the first installment of the covid 19 survival fund of n30 000 in march this year through the help of a friend who introduced him to the scheme he said i received the money on march 8 2021 and my friend called me to payback n15 000 00 into his account two days later i had spent the money before he asked for payment so i could not pay up the bricklayer said he received no payment afterwards even though he was told that he would receive n90 000 in three installments osifeso has been paid twice and he paid n20 000 from the money for settlement he said i m expecting the final payment as i speak with you my cousin introduced me to it and i ve been paying back through him there is no way to trace the money back to the ministry officials in wogu s case the payment was facilitated by her husband whose friend introduced to the scam so far she has received n30 000 and paid back n15 000 she said there are many people and government officials involved in this scam and that is why it is going on unabated wogu said she would continue to play along in order to receive the outstanding payments further investigation by the nation revealed that the covid 19 survival fund disbursements are fraught by fraud often perpetrated by corrupt government officials and their collaborators shady claims on september 24 2020 during a press conference in abuja to update nigerians on the progress of the national msme survival fund and the guaranteed off take stimulus schemes programme of the fg the minister of state for industry trade and investment mariam yalwaji katagum said the payroll support scheme targets 500 000 individual beneficiaries the scheme will support msme payroll obligations by paying between n50 000 max and n30 000 min to between three minimum and 10 maximum staff for three months on april 22 2021 clem agba the minister of state ministry of budget and national planning while giving a comprehensive breakdown of the covid 19 expenditure said from the n500 billion stimulus in the revised 2020 budget a provision of n126 billion was made for building a resilient health system in nigeria to prevent the loss of life however vahyala kwaga a senior policy analyst with the ngo budgit countered the claim he said unfortunately there are several portals by which information is been disseminated and to a very large extent this creates an overlap of information and creates further difficulties in verification so you have the open treasury portal corpus portal and the bureau of public procurement as well the important thing is triangulating these data to make sure that they all tally but because a lot of it is in non machine readable format it makes analysis very difficult some of the information is missing and the links dead so you can t in good faith say these figures are verifiable because there is no way for you to confirm them he also punctured agba s declaration that each state received n1billion except for lagos and kano states that received higher amounts kwaga argued that while it is a reasonable assessment it would have been nice if there was a provision of only one viable portal in which covid 19 spending expenditure donations can be tracked also several states have not published their information again some states have provided links but they links are dead out of 36 states i would say seven have provided some form of pointers towards information and some of them are not even accessible to analyst and journalists he said in response to agba s claim that the president directed the disbursement of covid 19 cash transfer to additional one million households as part of the social intervention programmes to protect the vulnerable kwaga said the idea is to trace how much has been given out and who has received them it is worrisome that the fg claimed to have spent a lot but they are unable to show us just who have received this relief materials there is a break in the transparency line and it makes tracking extremely difficult on fg s claim that it had spent n60 billion on road construction and rehabilitation under the moving people and goods programme across the country kwaga noted it is not clear here if the n60 billion are fresh allocations or are they moving the funds from the existing budgetary allocation for road constructions you could call this an extra budgetary allocation but it still need to follow the prescribed pattern of transparency accountability and openness i would say the fg really needs to do better in terms of implementation measurement and providing ample trusted third party verification for these things yes they have said there is a lot of money available nigerians do not really know how much of these monies have been disbursed and genuinely whether or not there is a change in the economy as a result of this injection on june 12 2021 president muhammadu buhari during his nationwide address to mark nigeria democracy day said during the pandemic we disbursed n5 000 to one million nigerians using a rapid response register and advanced n20 000 to 750 000 beneficiaries of the conditional cash transfer progamme and provided 1 37 million nigerians with palliatives from cacovid at the same time the federal government released 109 000 metric tonnes of food reserve stocks and 70 000 metric tonnes of grains to the poor and vulnerable in all 36 states of the federation president buhari concluded thus in the last two years we lifted 10 5 million people out of poverty farmers small scale traders artisans market women and the like reality vs fgn going by available data the federal government s claims conflict with the realities on ground verifiable figures obtained from the national bureau of statistics nbs punctured government s sustainability claims government s claims that hundreds of thousands of new jobs have been created through its covid 19 relief fund and from billions of naira pumped into the economy to galvanise it are hardly felt by the people fgn declaration that it has sustained 700 000 jobs in 140 000 msmes and 1 500 self employed individuals through grants and recruited 1 000 persons per local government of the 36 states and the fct resulting in 774 000 persons being employed fell short when it was compared to current unemployment figures as summarised by the nbs the unemployment figure released by nbs in fourth quarter of 2020 also contradicts fg s claim on new employment during the reference period the computed national unemployment rate rose from 27 1 in q2 2020 to 33 3 in q4 2020 while the underemployment rate decreased from 28 6 to 22 8 a combination of both the unemployment and underemployment rate for the reference period gave a figure of 56 1 this means that 33 3 of the labour force in nigeria or 23 187 389 persons either did nothing or worked for less than 20 hours a week making them unemployed by our definition in nigeria this is an additional 1 422 772 persons from the number in that category in q2 2020 using the international definition of unemployment the rate was computed to be 17 5 while the fg is claiming creation of new jobs the reality is that more nigerians have lost their jobs the situation is worse in rural areas where government claimed to have spent over n12billion on employment generation and facilities for rural dwellers nbs estimates reveal that the unemployment rate among rural dwellers was 34 5 up from 28 2 in q2 2020 while urban dwellers reported a rate of 31 3 up from 26 4 in the case of underemployment among rural dwellers it declined to 26 9 from 31 5 while the rate among urban dwellers decreased to 16 2 from 23 2 in q2 2020 among the young people 15 34 years the story is devastating for the period under review q4 2020 the unemployment rate among young people 15 34years was 42 5 up from 34 9 while the rate of underemployment for the same age group declined to 21 0 from 28 2 in q2 2020 these rates were the highest when compared to other age groupings the summary is that many young nigerians lost lucrative jobs and resorted to less paying jobs to make ends meet sola ogunwale a chartered accountant who was caught in the web of unemployment after his company went under in 2020 painted a pathetic image he said what the nbs figures are saying is that more educated young nigerians now ride okada commercial motorcycles keke marwa commercial tricycle and do other menial jobs the story is the same across state boundaries as nbs estimates reveal a project a bleak picture across the nooks and crannies of the country in the case of unemployment by state imo state recorded the highest rate of unemployment with 56 64 this was followed by adamawa state with 54 89 and cross rivers state with 53 65 the states with the lowest rates were osun benue and zamfara states with 11 65 11 98 and 12 99 respectively in the case of underemployment benue state recorded the highest rate with 43 52 followed by zamfara and jigawa states with 41 73 and 41 29 respectively lagos state recorded the lowest underemployment rate with 4 5 in q4 2020 a total number of 12 160 178 did not do any work in the last seven days preceding the survey stated the nbs palliatives hijacked by politicians investigation carried out in five states most hit by the pandemic namely lagos kano rivers ogun and niger states showed that a great number of vulnerable people including women children the elderly and physically challenged did not get palliatives provided by the government rather politicians community leaders and their cohorts got it budgit independent findings reads in part during the homegrown school feeding tracking in lagos we visited different distribution centres in ikeja surulere yaba ketu and mushin according to our findings the exercise was a lot more transparent in lagos security operatives were deployed to provide safety for the distribution agents and also help in handling the process we also observed that the packages arrived at the centres on time and most of the beneficiaries got their take home rations without any significant scuffle at the maryland school complex in lagos state the tracking team confirmed that officials followed the due process to a considerable extent as beneficiaries used the qr coded vouchers to access their take home rations citizens were allowed to pick up their rations once they presented the coupon the take home rations were valued at n4 200 according to current market price and made up of 5 kg bag of rice 5 kg bag of beans 500 ml vegetable oil 750 ml palm oil 500 mg salt 15 pcs of eggs 140gm tomato paste lukman olanrewaju a social worker in agaye 1 cda ojo local government area reported that a measly five sachets of noodles and bowl of beans were shared to each landlord association in a community to cushion the stay at home effects in most monitored local government areas including agege mushin ikorodu sururlere and epe we discovered that palliatives were hijacked and diverted by politicians and shared among party members some residents who are not members of the party lamented the hijack and their exclusion from the whole distribution process ward chairman is in charge of the distribution of the food in the agege area in lagos state one cup of rice one cup of beans and one sachet of tomato paste were given to a street with more than 30 houses olanrewaju added oga yemi in iseyin street onipanu lagos state said the politicians in our area hijacked the sharing of the palliatives which was channeled through the party s leadership across the wards in the local government area corroborating him another lagos resident funke in surulere stated we received two cups of rice and three sachets of noodles and salt my family consists of four members so the palliative was not enough to cater to our needs in rivers state a resident of the rumualogu community revealed that the only relief packages several people in the community got during the lockdown came from generous individuals who wanted to assist the less privileged and amina from dogowa lga kano state shared similar catalogue of complain our community only received three bags of rice one bag of beans and groundnut oil for over three hundred residents each household was given four cups of rice beans and one sachet of groundnut oil not every household benefited from the palliative items impact on nigerians the result is that the target beneficiaries are not feeling the impact of the n288 billion covid 19 intervention fund even as more people slip below the poverty line according to world bank s bankrolled national longitudinal phone survey nlps being implemented by nbs monthly more nigerians will sink below the poverty index due to the economic impact of covid 19 the number of poor people would be set to rise from 82 9 million in 2019 to 90 0 million by 2022 due to natural population growth yet with the economic effects of the covid 19 crisis the national poverty rate is instead forecast to jump to from 40 1 in 2019 to 45 2 in 2022 implying that 100 9 million nigerians will be living poverty by 2022 stated the report this contradicts president buhari s claim that in the last two years we lifted 10 5 million people out of poverty farmers small scale traders artisans market women and the like households income remain precarious sinking lower than last year and leaving more families financially insecure inflation skyrockets the situation is complicated by the soaring inflation index the nbs recorded the cpi consumer price index which measures inflation increasing by 18 17 yoy in march 2021 0 82 higher than february 2021 nbs selected food price watch data for april 2021 reflected that the average price of one dozen of medium sized eggs increased annually by 11 26 and monthly by 1 13 to n530 in april 2021 from n524 47 in march 2021 the average price of 1kg of imported rice increased annually by 14 57 and decreased monthly by 0 67 to n540 58 in april 2021 from n544 21 in march 2021 while the average price of 1kg of tomato increased annually by 0 09 and monthly by 3 67 to n277 26 in april 2021 from n267 45 in march 2021 similarly the average price of 1kg of yam tuber increased annually by 9 87 and monthly by 3 26 to n252 80 in april 2021 from n244 82 in march 2021 transport fare has also increased through the inflation the nbs transport fare watch report for april 2021 covering road journeys and water way passenger transport showed a rapid fare increase on every mode of transportation an average fare paid by commuters for bus journey within the city increased by 2 34 monthly and by 72 59 yearly to n386 10 in april 2021 from n377 27 in march 2021 states with the highest bus journey fare within the city were zamfara n620 35 bauchi n600 35 and nasarawa n500 23 while states with lowest bus journey fare rate within the city were oyo n200 07 abia n215 04 and borno n263 45 for bus journey intercity it increased by 1 48 monthly and by 37 50 annually to n2 446 86 in april 2021 from n2 411 29 in march 2021 states with the highest bus journey fare intercity were abuja fct n4 594 21 lagos n3 500 20 and sokoto n3 340 30 while states with lowest bus journey fare within city were bayelsa n1 764 55 bauchi n1 782 12 and enugu n1 800 40 the average fare paid by commuters for journey by motorcycle per drop increased by 1 79 month on month and by 86 41 year on year to n276 30 in april 2021 from n271 44 in march 2021 states with the highest journey fare by motorcycle per drop were yobe n455 02 lagos n435 21 and taraba n430 55 while states with lowest journey fare by motorcycle per drop were adamawa n95 10 katsina n155 04 and niger n160 20 govt must do more the economic effect of covid 19 pandemic is biting harder leading to loss of livelihood and abysmal increase in food transportation and housing and in general standard of living ogunwale could not agree more nigerians are overwhelmed with eking out a living in uncertain time condition of living is hard for them and so the fg must do more than dropping figures to implementing as an accountant what i can deduce is that we have implementation problem and all that covid 19 funds are largely going into pockets of some ministries officials political leaders and contractors and citizens working for them
the impending withdrawal of foreign forces from afghanistan has fomented fears regarding the future of thousands of afghan translators interpreters and other local allies that have worked extremely closely with the americans since 2001 and stand a risk of retaliation from the taliban the taliban recently stated that those who worked with the americans will not be harmed unless they engage in any such activities in the future that amount to treason against islam and the country but they have killed at least 300 interpreters or their family members since 2014 and their insurgents reportedly killed an interpreter as recently as in january 2021 many former interpreters still receive death threats the urgency to protect women and vulnerable minorities in afghanistan has been acknowledged by the us and other nato countries but narratives on afghanistan have largely ignored these local allies while there are procedures such as the special immigrant visa program for afghans that was instated in 2009 to facilitate the relocation of afghan allies to the us the program has years long backlogs with more than 17 000 applications still under review moreover there lie various administrative loopholes such as chronic staff shortage lack of funding to securely settle former translators and their families mistakes by the department of state decimation of refugee intake infrastructure by the trump administration and also the previously imposed muslim ban amongst others that have impeded the programme the us government track record suggests that it will take more than four years to process the backlogged applications assuming sufficient staff are present at the us embassy in kabul to handle the cases president biden has already been facing tremendous flak for not delivering on his refugee cap promises and instead extending trump era policies therefore prioritising these afghan allies lives could potentially salvage biden s flailing commitment to human rights failure to do so could have an impact on america s reputation which could be a detriment to american troops that are stationed across the globe its security interests in post us afghanistan and also hamper future partnerships jeopardising america s security objectives the urgency to protect women and vulnerable minorities in afghanistan has been acknowledged by the us and other nato countries but narratives on afghanistan have largely ignored these local allies even though the us military s use of local interpreters and other contractors has a long history this practice peaked during the post 9 11 wars in afghanistan and iraq at the height of the us troop surge in afghanistan there was one local contractor for every member of the us military the americans heavily relied on these thousands of afghans who did a variety of tasks such as interpretation elections monitoring construction work provision of private security and sometimes even performing skilled tasks in legal services information technology and human resources american military commanders have admitted that the us could not have accomplished its missions in either iraq or afghanistan without the help of these indigenous allies acknowledging the need to protect these allies that were instrumental in afghanistan the biden administration called for a review of the iraqi and afghan siv programs including a report to the president with recommendations to address any concerns identified however there lie herculean administrative and procedural flaws that threaten to nullify this review firstly the visa involves an elaborate 14 step application process that the applicants have to navigate the applicants also must produce proof of employment and a letter of recommendation from a former us military supervisor who may have left afghanistan years ago which seems reasonable but has resulted in the deaths of many applicants according to the applicants themselves additionally endless security checks and a lack of trained personnel to process the visas lengthens the waiting period while the congress mandates that the application process be completed within nine months the current processing period takes approximately 966 days on average this has led to severe backlogs margaret stock an immigration lawyer said that if the us department of state actually devoted resources efficiently to the processing each case would ideally take only a couple of months sometimes even after the applications are finally processed government errors have wrongly led to visa denials these mistakes include a bad translator at the visa interview misunderstanding something important confusion on the state department s part and also revenge cases when an interpreter s enemy plants malicious information to get the visa denied additionally many applicants go through this strenuous process only to find themselves ineligible due to some trivial reasons such as falling days short of the two years required service for eligibility failing a polygraph test or being categorised security ineligible for undisclosed reasons lastly despite the administration s favourable rhetoric the us government does not provide adequate funding to securely resettle these allies and their families multiple shortcomings on administrative and procedural fronts that have led to severe backlogs coupled with the shortly arriving withdrawal date and the taliban s prospects of regaining power necessitate instant action from the biden administration to secure afghan lives multiple shortcomings on administrative and procedural fronts that have led to severe backlogs coupled with the shortly arriving withdrawal date and the taliban s prospects of regaining power necessitate instant action from the biden administration to secure afghan lives but since this would be impractical given the enormous number of applications left to be scrutinised the alternative would be to identify and mass airlift those whose lives are in danger while their applications are under review historically the us has successfully done this on multiple occasions in 1975 about 130 000 vietnamese refugees were flown to guam after the vietnam war the u s military even evacuated 6 600 iraqi kurds to guam in 1996 97 after saddam hussein launched attacks into iraq s kurdish region apart from guam there are other safe locations such as military bases in qatar or the uae where us officials could vet them and assesses possibilities of resettlement reportedly the military has said that if orders come from the white house then this mass airlift could be accomplished jason crow a former u s army ranger told the atlantic however a directive from the white house has proven to be elusive so far and the biden administration does not seem to be prioritising this option which has triggered apprehensions on its commitment to human rights despite the us forces withdrawal from its longest war in afghanistan the american military has a global footprint that still continues to be the largest in the world speculatively america has close to 800 military bases across the world in honduras australia japan iraq qatar germany amongst others covering all continents us troop numbers vary periodically depending on policies and the classified nature of military data but washington reportedly maintains roughly 200 000 troops in more than 150 countries failing to honour its commitments to its afghan allies could send a very wrong message regarding america s untrustworthiness to local allies in all these countries that the us has a military presence in this is even more relevant because the biden administration recently released an interim national security strategy which emphasised the importance of local partners along with international partners whenever america needs to employ force in the future therefore america needs to maintain its credibility in the current afghan scenario otherwise it might find it increasingly tougher to find local allies willing to support its security objectives in any ensuing conflicts america needs to maintain its credibility in the current afghan scenario otherwise it might find it increasingly tougher to find local allies willing to support its security objectives in any ensuing conflicts even in afghanistan america still might need allies considering that the country might become a safe haven for terrorists again the cia is grappling with the possibility of using a former base in pakistan that was used until 2011 or regaining access to bases in former soviet republics to gather intelligence and conduct counterterrorism operations in afghanistan after withdrawal nevertheless the chances of fruition are bleak douglas london former head of the cia for counterterrorism options in pakistan and afghanistan said that the agency was likely to rely on a stay behind network of informants that would collect intelligence for counterterrorism efforts while nothing has been explicitly said about the usage of local allies it is plausible that america might want to use them owing to their significant contributions to security efforts throughout the afghan war consequently a failure to protect former allies might even entail security implications in post us afghanistan with the possibility of these allies refusing to help the americans joe biden promised a foreign policy centered around human rights but his decision to withdraw from afghanistan increase refugee cap only after incessant criticism refusal to sanction the saudi crown prince over khashoggi s killing and to proceed with a trump era arms deal with the uae amongst other issues has brewed discontentment and criticism amongs human rights groups americans have earned a bad reputation for abandoning their local allies that goes back to american independence in 1776 most prominently during the vietnam war americans abandoned the hmongs of vietnam and laos and the indigenous people of central vietnam called montagnards and recently the kurdish troops ypg in syria in 2019 under trump by departing from this usual american approach joe biden has an opportunity to re affirm his devotion to human rights in front of a skeptical international community furthermore since america still continues to be embroiled in conflicts maintains a military presence and is open to the idea of using force in the future if required which might warrant local allies it must establish its dependability by fulfilling obligations to afghan allies the views expressed above belong to

please try again later china tries to throw cold water on base metals the ev av megatrend continues gathering momentum and the oil trade is printing money there s lots happening in the news this week beyond yesterday s federal reserve meeting so today let s bounce around to several stories affecting your portfolio china spooks base metals investors as we ve been tracking here in the digest copper and other base industrial metals have been on a tear for months until recently advertisement advertisement investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tips below you can see copper climbing more than 85 over the last year before giving back some gains beginning in may the metal is down 8 from its recent high about one month ago also note the knife edge drop over recent days what s happening there from the wall street journal china said it would begin to sell major industrial metals from state stockpiles an effort to squelch factory gate price increases that have hit a 13 year high and are stoking fears of global inflation as the world s biggest buyer of a range of industrial commodities china is using its market heft to try to quell the sharp rise in global metal prices over the past 12 months including a 67 surge in copper a bellwether for macroeconomic health advertisement advertisement regular digest readers know that we re highly bullish on copper and other base metals in reaching this conclusion we ve relied on analysis from our macro specialist eric fry that s pointing toward a multi year supercycle in key commodities does this news out of china change any of that no china might be able to temporarily take pressure off of soaring commodities prices but to borrow from the fed that would be transitory a bit like trying to block the spray from a firehose with your hand story continues as the world transitions to green energy over the coming years the demand for copper and base metals is going to be massive one country s reserves even a country as large as china can t stop that from the verge bold added something does not come from nothing that fact can be easily forgotten when it comes to seemingly abstract concepts like energy as the climate change crisis worsens more politicians are starting to underscore the importance of transitioning to clean energy more clean energy means more solar panels wind turbines electric vehicles and large scale batteries but it also means more demand for the materials that make those technologies possible advertisement advertisement in some cases like silicon for solar panels higher demand is unlikely to be an issue but our supply chains for other materials like neodymium for wind turbines lithium and cobalt for batteries and copper for basically everything may need to shift and from axios bold added the world s transition to renewable energy and electric vehicles will require unprecedented amounts of copper from potentially new mining operations the global need for copper could increase by an estimated 350 by 2050 with current reserves depleting sometime between 2035 and 2045 as wind and solar energy generate an increasing percentage of electricity and more people adopt electric vehicles advertisement advertisement now to adjust expectations copper s price is under pressure below we add a 50 day simple moving average to its one year chart as you can see it has just fallen below this support line if it doesn t bounce back quickly we should expect further price weakness in the coming days but if that happens we would view it as an opportunity to add this green commodity to your portfolio as a long term investment bottom line stay long copper by the way if you missed it click here to read our recent digest featuring eric s thoughts on vanadium and how you might play it he believes it s the next base metal to offer investors huge returns advertisement advertisement continuing with the transition to green energy the electric vehicle ev autonomous vehicle av megatrend continues gaining strength copper and base metals play a huge role in the batteries of electric and autonomous vehicles interestingly yesterday we learned that gm will increase spending on electric and autonomous vehicles to 35 billion through 2025 that s a 30 increase from plans announced toward the end of just last year from cnbc the additional money will be used to expand its rollout of evs and accelerate production of its battery and fuel cell technologies including two new u s battery plants in addition to two under construction by 2025 advertisement advertisement keep in mind yesterday s news comes less than one month after ford announced it is increasing its electric vehicle spending to more than 30 billion by 2025 and speaking of spending we ve also learned that alphabet s self driving affiliate waymo just raised another 2 5 billion this money will be put toward its continued efforts to develop autonomous driving technology for passenger cars and freight hauling from the wall street journal the company on wednesday said it wants to use waymo driver technology to move people and goods its autonomous ride hailing service waymo one has had thousands of trips in metro phoenix where some customers are shuttled around in minivans without a person behind the wheel waymo said waymo is conducting tests of its autonomous vehicle technology with riders in san francisco advertisement advertisement for its waymo via delivery unit the company said it has joined with j b hunt transport services inc to move freight across the country its clients on a local level include united parcel service inc and autonation inc here too eric has positioned his investment report subscribers to benefit from this ev av megatrend his ev related pick back in february is up 60 as i write but signs suggest there are much bigger gains to come green is the future but right now black is making lots of money we re talking about the oil trade below you can see the price of west texas crude soaring over the last 12 months topping 72 in our february 19th digest we noted that long term our world is moving away from oil toward renewable energy advertisement advertisement we highlighted a series of facts and statistics supporting this conclusion one of which was the biden administration s plans to make the u s a 100 clean energy economy with net zero emissions by 2050 but as we wrote in that digest there s a lot of time between now and 2050 for a profitable oil trade we put three potential short to medium term plays on your radar the first was the energy select sector spdr fund etf xle that holds oil heavyweights including exxon chevron conocophillips schlumberger occidental and valero to name a few the second was diamondback energy fang which is a texas based energy exploration company advertisement advertisement and the third was exxon xom the massive multinational oil and gas company it s been four months since that suggestion so where do things stand as i write over a period in which the s p has climbed just 8 and the nasdaq just 1 xle fang and xom have climbed respectively 25 40 and 26 oil is piggybacking on the economic reopening as life has been getting back to normal leading to higher demand meanwhile supply has been constrained as production has been slower to get back online after 2020 shutdowns the result is a classic supply demand imbalance that s helped drive prices we believe this trade has more legs as the supply demand imbalance works itself out plus if we continue seeing higher inflation numbers that ll be an additional tailwind but see this trade for what it is it s a short to medium term momentum trade we still believe electric will be the big winner of the decade not oil so as it s been said rent this trade don t buy it that said this rental is treating us quite well so let s stay with it for now we ll keep you updated on copper evs and oil here in the digest have a good evening jeff remsburg the post the oil trade is crushing appeared first on investorplace

here s what you need to remember the qbz 95 or type 95 automatic rifle is the standard issue assault rifle of china designed to replace the chinese copy of the ak 47 the qbz 95 is unlike any other chinese rifle the rifle is issued to all arms of the people s liberation army as well as the people s armed police modern warfare has seen breathtaking advances in the last hundred years as mortal competition between nations spawns successively deadlier weapons aircraft missiles tanks submarines and other inventions many of which did not exist in practical terms in 1914 have quickly earned key positions in the militaries of the world yet there is still one invention that although conceived more than five hundred years ago still has a vital place on today s battlefield the infantry weapon and supporting arms no matter how high tech the armed forces of the world have become warfare since the end of the second world war has consistently involved some form of infantry combat in his seminal work on the korean war this kind of war historian t r fehrenbach wrote you may fly over a land forever you may bomb it atomize it pulverize it and wipe it clean of life but if you desire to defend it protect it and keep it for civilization you must do this on the ground the way the roman legions did by putting your young men in the mud with that in mind here are five of the most deadly guns of modern war ak 47 the undisputed king of the modern battlefield is the avtomat kalashnikova model 47 or ak 47 extremely reliable the ak 47 is plentiful on third world battlefields from american rap music to zimbabwe the ak 47 has achieved icon status and is one of the most recognizable symbols of any kind in the world the ak series of rifles is currently carried by fighters of the islamic state taliban fighters in afghanistan various factions in libya and both sides in the ukraine conflict the ak 47 as the story goes was the brainchild of the late mikhail t kalashnikov a red army draftee kalashnikov showed a talent for small arms design while convalescing from battlefield injuries and had assembled a prototype assault rifle by 1947 there is some circumstantial evidence however that the ak 47 was at least partially designed by the german designer hugo schmeisser who had created the similar stg44 in 1942 the ak 47 was the world s first standard issue assault rifle the rifle used a new 7 62 millimeter cartridge that generated less recoil and was lighter than rounds used in traditional infantry rifles in return the 7 62x39 round offered more controllability when fired in full automatic and allowed the infantryman to carry more rounds into battle the ak 47 has endured because it is a weapon for the lowest common denominator it requires little training to learn how to shoot and as a result large armies or militias can be raised by simply handing out ak 47s it is dead simple to use and requires little maintenance disassembly is quick and the weapon can run virtually without lubrication all of these are important considerations when your soldiers or militiamen are often illiterate untrained draftees an estimated one hundred million ak 47s of all varieties have been manufactured by countries including the soviet union china north korea egypt yugoslavia and most of the former warsaw pact as the independent pointed out that could be one ak for every seventy people on earth even finland and israel neither soviet allies nor client states built variants the most recent version issued to the russian army is the ak 74m chambered in the lighter 5 45 millimeter the m16 family of weapons the modern m16 rifle got its start in 1956 when inventor eugene stoner tested its predecessor the ar 15 at the infantry school at fort benning the rifle would not enter u s service for another four years and then with the u s air force the u s army would jump on the m16 bandwagon in 1965 with the u s marines following in 1966 the original ar 15 was a reliable innovative rifle but a last minute change of gunpowder and misconceptions about the rifle s need to be cleaned contributed to a poor reliability rate in vietnam exacerbating the problem was the m16 s direct impingement self loading system in which gasses and carbon residue created when gunpowder is burned are cycled back into the weapon s internal mechanism the most recent version the m16a4 weighs 8 79 pounds loaded with a 30 round magazine the rifle is effective to 550 meters with a sustained rate of fire of 12 15 rounds per minute the 5 56 millimeter ss109 m855 bullet which emphasized armor piercing capability over lethality on nato battlefields is being phased out in favor of the m855a1 round the original m16 led to the improved m16a1 by 1967 and the m16a2 by 1986 the m16a3 was a short run rifle built for navy seals while the m16a4 has become standard issue in the u s marine corps the m4a1 carbine currently the standard issue infantry weapon for the u s army is identical except for a shorter barrel collapsible stock and the ability to be fired fully automatic the m16 has evolved into a reliable rifle modular and highly adaptable variants have fulfilled roles from carbine to infantry rifle squad automatic weapon and designated marksman rifle the civilian version again dubbed ar 15 has enjoyed explosive growth in the last ten years with the sunset of the federal assault weapons ban the author owns two m240 machine gun the m240 machine gun is the current medium machine gun for the u s army and u s marine corps the m240 is in service with another sixty eight countries and has served long enough that at least one adopter rhodesia is no longer in existence the m240 is the american version of the fn mag designed in the 1950s by the belgian arms maker fabrique nationale fn utilizing features from both axis and allied infantry weapons the mag as it was known became wildly popular and standard issue with many nato countries in the years since introduction the mag has served from south africa to the falklands to afghanistan and iraq the m240 can be used to engage point targets such as individual enemy troops and light vehicles or provide suppressive fire the m240 s heavier 7 62 millimeter bullet gives it a maximum effective range of up to 1 800 meters the m240 weighs 27 pounds and with spare barrel tripod and other accessories and spare parts can weigh in at up to 47 pounds the m240 can fire 100 rounds per minute sustained fire meaning the weapon will not overheat it can fire up to 650 rounds per minute but overheating is imminent obviously too many countries use the m240 to run down its use in every case but the state of issue in the u s military is typical of use worldwide in the u s army m240 machine guns are found on armored vehicles and issued at a rate of two per infantry platoon in the u s marine corps six guns are issued to an infantry company allowing the company commander flexibility in their deployment pk machine gun the pk pulemyot kalashnikova or kalashnikov s machine gun light machine gun was the soviet union s solution to high firepower at the squad level like the ak 47 the pk has seen extensive use around the world where one finds an ak a pk is never far behind the pk was also invented by mikhail kalashnikov although it resembles the m240 it is in the same class as the u s marine corps m 27 infantry automatic rifle or the nato minimi m 249 squad automatic weapon the pk fills an important role as a squad automatic weapon saw although most infantrymen throughout the world carry weapons capable of fully automatic or burst fire trained soldiers rarely fire full auto full auto fire from lightweight assault rifles is generally inaccurate and rapidly consumes ammunition instead a single gun like the pk is designated as the squad automatic weapon the pk is equipped with a heavier barrel and frame to absorb heat and recoil from sustained fire accuracy particularly mounted on a tripod is reported to be excellent out to 800 meters the pk uses the same sights as the ak 47 to ease training the pk uses a heavier hitting round than the ak 47 the 7 64x54r round originally used in the moisin nagant infantry rifle and degtyaryov machine gun in world war ii the pk has some anti aircraft capability while the gun is mounted to a bipod or tripod although realistically that is limited to low flying helicopters and perhaps drones qbz 95 assault rifle the qbz 95 or type 95 automatic rifle is the standard issue assault rifle of china designed to replace the chinese copy of the ak 47 the qbz 95 is unlike any other chinese rifle the rifle is issued to all arms of the people s liberation army as well as the people s armed police the qbz 95 is a bullpup design with the magazine inserted behind the trigger like other bullpup rifles this shortens the overall length of the rifle the result is a rifle with a barrel 3 5 longer than the m4 carbine but shorter in overall length the rifle features a built in carrying handle although the use of such a handle creates issues when attaching scopes and other optics
george packer s incisive deftly argued book about the moral and political quandary of the united states begins and ends with his declaration i am an american the statement is self evident but also self congratulatory americans regard their citizenship as a spiritual credential a gesture of faith in the country that has always claimed to be the last best hope of beleaguered mankind packer s native land however no longer deserves to be quite so certain of its exceptional virtue or its automatic pre eminence early in the pandemic it had to accept charitable handouts from russia and taiwan and packer sadly accepts a new reduced reality by calling america a beggar nation and even a failed state after this he twists his title from a boast into an abject plea no one is going to save us we are our last best hope the need for salvation became urgent before the election last november when packer having moved his family from brooklyn to a covid free rural retreat noticed a sign beside the road on a neighbouring farm his car headlights flashed across a red rectangle branded with five white capital letters even here packer realised with a shudder he was not safe he doesn t need to say what the letters spelled out they were as succinctly satanic as the number 666 the mark of the beast in the book of revelation which made nancy reagan alter the street address of a house where she and the retiring president were due to live in los angeles superstitiously refusing to name trump when he reads the campaign sign packer eventually recognises his reptilian genius a talent for sniffing out and then stoking up the grudges of voters in the terra incognita that lies between america s shining seas a self accusing shock follows as the election draws near packer sees shop owners fortifying their premises millions of people were arming up says this impeccably liberal urban man he then adds i wondered if i should do the same of course he decides not to but the damage is done his panicked reaction testifies to the collapse of the trust in others that sustains democracy the problem packer acknowledges is not who trump was but who we are the first verb in that sentence is happily in the past tense but the second remains in the troubled present the populace empowered the vicious populist in the first place and may yet allow him to revive his lawless larcenous nepotistic sideshow packer who as well as contributing to the new yorker and the atlantic has edited collections of george orwell s essays goes on to attempt something close to the ideological fables in animal farm or nineteen eighty four he dramatises a cold civil war between four incompatible versions of the us the free america of libertarian reagan the smart america of clinton era technocrats the real america of trump the bottom feeding demagogue and the just america of metoo and blm each has its own narrative abhors the others as existential enemies and regards compromise as betrayal the us has had many crises a nation founded on a messianic idea can redeem itself by reaffirming first principles i don t much want to live in the republic of any of them packer concludes he smirks about customers at walgreen drugstores and members of rotary clubs in the heartland snidely notes sarah palin s post political career as an autographed merchandise saleswoman and even derides the sagging bellies of the marauders who invaded the capitol on 6 january as if their obesity was the worst thing about them but all these alien groups have to be included in democracy s gathering of we the people packer s sniffy attitude is a symptom of the problem he defines an epistemic rupture he says has made americans profoundly unreal to one another lacking a shared reality they have burrowed into partisan encampments or sealed themselves in digital ghettoes echo chambers of angry prejudice the relevance of this depressing analysis extends across the ocean disaffected american activists in red and blue states fantasise about secession here a fraying union is much more likely to fall apart packer believes that his country s dualistic political parties have in effect changed places with the democrats now the home of affluent professionals while the republicans sound like populist insurgents hasn t the same switchover happened with labour and the tories packer calls trump an all american flimflam man boris johnson is our homegrown equivalent the embodiment of all that is bogus smug and sloppily amateurish in this country though at least trump transmitted a sulphurous dark energy whereas johnson mainly gives vent to verbal flatulence trump packer says in passing levelled everyone down together that exposes boris s blather about levelling up as an empty opportunistic play on words commenting on an american meritocracy whose sole merit is its luck on the stock market packer predicts as with any hereditary ruling class political power will fall into the hands of increasingly inferior people to prove his point locally i nominate slick sunak shifty hancock patel the bully and williamson the schoolroom dunce packer is still able to cheer himself up at the end by reiterating i am an american and there s no escape after our own disastrous epistemic episode what can we say we re no longer europeans and only foreigners call us brits which they generally do while rolling their eyes in exasperation belonging by birth to none of the uk s four tribes i sometimes feel like a stateless refugee holed up in the republic of my house although america suffered through what packer calls a near death experience with trump it has had many such crises and has recovered from them all a nation founded on a messianic idea can always redeem itself by reaffirming first principles as joe biden seems determined to do the uk lacks an originating myth or mission and thus has no sense of purpose no means of renewal and nothing to look forward to but pitiful decline despite imperial puffery we may never have been the best but we used to be better than this now we seem doomed to be last and there s no hope anywhere

india s surging inflation is adding to the country s economic woes presenting challenges for businesses and policymakers alike as analysts warn of risks that could prevent prices of essential goods easing in the near future wholesale price inflation jumped 12 94 per cent in may a near 30 year high driven by soaring fuel prices while retail inflation hit a six month peak of 6 3 per cent as food and fuel costs rose exceeding the central bank s higher band and analysts estimates according to official data released this month the risk of inflation turning persistent exists anubhuti sahay head of economics research for south asia at standard chartered says especially because the rise in may s consumer price inflation was driven by a broad based surge and if commodity prices stay elevated a major factor driving the spike in inflation is elevated oil prices which have been hitting multi year highs recently india is heavily dependent on oil imports and this has a knock on effect on the cost of other goods including an increase in transportation costs fresh lockdown curbs imposed during a deadly second wave of covid 19 have also affected supply chains putting upward pressure on prices inflation pressure may remain high ahead with upcoming prints looking to be above the may print madhavi arora lead economist at mumbai based emkay global financial services says the surge in inflation is posing a challenge for policymakers with the reserve bank of india rbi instead focusing efforts on supporting economic growth the country s economy has been battered by the second wave of the coronavirus which has derailed what looked to be a promising start to a recovery after last year s pandemic induced recession last week the us federal reserve moved up its timeline for interest rate hikes as inflation in the world s largest economy rises the us central bank may now raise rates as soon as 2023 after saying in march that it saw no increases until at least 2024 india s economy contracted 7 3 per cent in the april 2020 to march 2021 financial year according to data meanwhile the world bank this month cut its growth forecast for the current financial year to 8 3 per cent from its earlier projection of 10 1 per cent the pandemic s second wave prompted authorities to introduce fresh lockdown curbs with fears of a third wave in the autumn india s recovery is being hampered by the largest outbreak of any country since the beginning of the pandemic the washington based lender said faltering economic growth leaves the rbi with little leeway to raise interest rates to bring inflation under control because it would raise the cost of borrowing but the dilemma for policymakers is that soaring inflation can hamper a pick up in the economy particularly as consumer price inflation has breached the rbi s upper threshold of 6 per cent high inflation amid low growth impacts disposable incomes and thus aggregate demand ms sahay says it has the potential to delay the recovery process many businesses are struggling amid the pandemic s impact and steep inflation is making profitability more challenging if inflation remains elevated over the coming months the situation will worsen for many business owners analysts say some have absorbed the price rise some have passed it on to customers and some are waiting and watching naved patel founder and director of mirepoix hospitalities which has a restaurant in mumbai says we have been affected by the rise in the most basic products vegetables cooking oil and pulses restaurants are in a miserable situation the spending capacity of the customer will be low mr patel adds rising inflation also means he has to increase his employees wages which is eating into his profits mr patel may have no choice but to pass the higher costs on to customers if inflation persists which he says is preferable to reducing portion sizes some have absorbed the price rise some have passed it on to customers and some are waiting and watching it comes as the hospitality industry has long been feeling the heat from the fallout of the pandemic exacerbated by the latest massive wave of infections in the last few months customers have fallen and our profit margin was already nullified mr patel says few of the big brands in our industry might survive this inflation but smaller brands might plunge there are however some factors on the horizon that could help to ease inflationary pressures daily coronavirus infections are currently on a downward trend compared with the peak of the second wave in may that has prompted state governments to start easing covid 19 curbs and allowing more business activity to resume with declining infections restrictions and localised lockdowns across states could ease gradually and mitigate disruptions to supply chains reducing cost pressures according to the rbi s minutes of its june monetary policy meeting released on friday expectations for normal rains this year during the monsoon season which is already under way also bodes well for easing of food prices because good rainfall leads to bountiful crops the rbi adds in its june meeting minutes but the central bank warns that the rising trajectory of international commodity prices especially of crude together with logistics costs pose upside risks to the inflation outlook it also notes that uncertainties remain because of the possibility that india could be hit by a third wave of infections this year a crucial question is the extent to which the price jump will reverse as lockdowns reverse sonal varma chief economist for india at investment bank nomura says our judgement is that prices are downward rigid in india and as such only part of the price rise will reverse when lockdowns are fully relaxed in coming months however the government may need to intervene as the central bank s hands remain tied some analysts say we don t see any immediate response from rbi on the inflation front given the priority accorded to the revival of the growth impulses suman chowdhury chief analytical officer at acuité ratings and research says given the stress that the second wave of covid has created on the livelihoods of a large section of the indian population some action can be expected on price control of these food products and retail fuel if the same continues to remain high for an extended period the government may need to take suitable measures to control inflation of food products such as edible oils and pulses as well as retail fuels to mitigate any longer term structural risks to inflation he says one option could be for the government to consider a reduction of the import duty on cooking oil mr chowdhury adds there is also scope for the central and state governments to lower high taxes on petrol and diesel to help ease fuel prices analysts say however a cut on taxes on retail fuel products can only help up to a point especially in a backdrop when commodity prices are rising ms sahay says a bigger relief however can emerge if global commodity prices relentless rise sees some kind of a correction if there is no let up in rising commodity prices including fuel metal and edible oil this could push the rbi to turn less accommodative sooner even before the growth recovery catches the desired level of momentum ms sahay says high inflation also has the potential to negatively impact the bond market and the value of the rupee she adds for now however as india s economy sputters amid the pandemic growth concerns remain the immediate worry overshadowing the country s significant inflation challenges we think at this particular juncture policymakers are likely to remain squarely focused on economic growth ms sahay says

diana s last upsetting hours in the hotel s imperial suite she was neither pregnant nor engaged to dodi and i have no doubt that if diana had returned safely to london the relationship would have

conventional foundations advertisement di mania she would have decided was self destructive the horror of the paparazzi s chase in paris would have finally turned her against co operating with the

brazil hit the grim mark of half a million covid 19 deaths saturday a toll second only to the us that shows few signs of easing yet residents are spurning vaccines that they believe are substandard in favour of hard to find shots from pfizer inc in sao paulo people demand the us company s shots at public clinics and often walk out if none are available some health care centres have put up signs saying no pfizer shots to save time many vaccination centres are empty and the few that have pfizer have massive lines maressa tavares a 29 year old teacher could have gotten her shot two weeks ago in rio de janeiro but at the request of her father she s holding out for pfizer for me it didn t make a lot of difference which one to take but my father has very strong beliefs she said such reluctance is hobbling a vaccination campaign already plagued by shortages and delays failure to control the disease would harm not only brazilians who are dying at the rate of about 2 000 a day but also threaten a global resurgence of the pandemic if the nation of 213 million becomes a breeding ground for new strains china s sinovac and england s astrazeneca plc account for about 96 of shots available in the country compared with just 4 for pfizer according to government data 500 000 lives lost by the pandemic that affects our brazil and the whole world health minister marcelo queiroga said in a tweet i work tirelessly to vaccinate all brazilians in the shortest time possible and change this scenario that has plagued us for over a year while doctors say residents should get any shot available sinovac s coronavac has a lower efficacy rate than other vaccines and president jair bolsonaro bashed its origin and initially refused to buy it astra saw its usage suffer worldwide thanks to rare blood clots side effects and a still pending approval in the us at first people were afraid to get coronavac because it s chinese and now it s astra because of the reactions said luiz carlos de souza e silva a nurse who helps immunize people at a public clinic in rio people are really misinformed the government took too long to come up with a vaccination plan that creates a lot of fear hesitancy hesitancy isn t uniquely brazilian amesh adalja who studies pandemics at the johns hopkins center for health security in baltimore said it has existed ever since the smallpox vaccine was created in 1796 more than two centuries later us officials have promised everything from french fries to lottery prizes to persuade people in europe astra usage stalled after the blood clot reports and uruguay even donated doses with approaching expiration dates because people didn t want them but nowhere are vaccines needed more than brazil the country has given out more than 86 million shots but that covers less than 30 of the population with a first dose and just 12 with two according to data compiled by bloomberg adalja said misinformation on social media combined with denial from the highest levels of the government have hindered brazil s campaign if the virus continues to spread unchecked adalja said new variants may emerge many have already appeared including the highly contagious gamma which was first documented in brazil in november and has since spread to 64 countries vaccines appear effective against these variants but countries with low vaccination rates could plunge deeper into crisis high rates in brazil contagion remains high and could worsen as winter arrives in the southern hemisphere some cities and states are reinstating lockdowns but after some 15 months of slap dash quarantines such measures have become less effective the virus is circulating like crazy a lot of people are infected few are vaccinated and mostly just with first doses said atila iamarino a biologist educated at the university of sao paulo and yale who specializes in virology opting to wait for this or that vaccine is extremely dangerous the government began an organised campaign to push vaccination and masks only in may more than a year after the virus arrived bolsonaro has minimized the crisis throughout in the past week alone he was the star of a motorcycle rally in his honor in sao paulo criticized lockdowns and ordered the health ministry to study making masks optional unlike the us which earlier bet on several vaccines brazil opted to buy only astra which has an efficacy rate of about 63 against symptomatic disease after delays governors and mayors sought contracts of their own as options ran out the government finally struck an agreement for coronavac a shot with an efficacy rate of about 51 that bolsonaro has publicly disavowed several times after being criticised during a congressional probe for not buying 95 effective pfizer vaccines the president has begun to highlight arrivals of new batches though he still questions the science behind them he said thursday that getting sick is a more effective way of protection and has yet to get a shot himself expert view experts say that even less effective shots are well worth taking but bolsonaro s mistrust is reflected among his supporters edilson pessanha father of maressa tavares delayed his immunisation about three months until he could get the us vaccine he said he feared coronavac people prefer excellence the 62 year old farmer said i research and want what s best for me what s best for our country which is what s happening bolsonaro is doing what s best for us natalia pasternak a microbiologist who s become a vocal critic of the government s handling of the pandemic and testified before congress calls such people vaccine sommeliers it s the government s job to tell people they shouldn t be cherry picking they re all effective and the good one is any you take pasternak said in an interview still the pace has picked up recently after a sharp drop in may the average number of daily doses given has climbed to about 984 000 in june according to data compiled by bloomberg the progress has made markets more optimistic for the outlook for latin america s largest economy sending stocks soaring more doses are expected to arrive in the second half of the year but for now experts see brazil stuck as the virus rages the country added 82 288 infections and 2 301 deaths in the last 24 hours with more than 17 8 million confirmed cases it ranks third in infections trailing the us and india it s second in deaths reaching 500 000 less than two months after crossing the 400 000 mark fiocruz an institution that monitors the disease called the situation critical in a thursday report it said the average age of deaths has dropped below 60 for the first time months after similar moves in cases and hospitalisations now more than half of deaths occur in those between 20 and 59 years

housing authority for more than two decades including as chairman until 2019 attempts over the past nine years to raze and replace the three deteriorating buildings have all failed however because of local opposition to the housing authority s plan to lift the age restriction for the complex instead of housing 39 older residents the new complex would accommodate 126 people of all ages including

convince the courts to stop the project and have been ordered twice to allow it to be built while a group of republicans on the town council wrote the town s zoning board in 2017 urging them to vote it down saying they had concerns about whether this expanded and new use is consistent with the neighborhood and character of this small part of branford this chorus of opposition against affordable housing that isn t age restricted raises a larger question for branford and other affluent connecticut towns is this discrimination amp amp lt span data mce type bookmark style display inline block width 0px overflow hidden line height 0 class mce_selres_start amp amp gt amp amp lt span amp amp gt although the federal fair housing act prohibits people with children from being discriminated against there is an exemption that does allow housing to be built exclusively for the elderly but for many civil rights attorneys and housing advocates local support for elderly housing or one bedroom apartments has become a strategy employed by affluent suburban towns to avoid erecting affordable housing options for families this tactic is on the radar of the u s department of housing and urban development last fall the federal agency charged arlington texas with violating the fair housing act after the city adopted a policy that only allows the construction of elderly affordable housing the number of successful complaints against communities discriminating against families has been limited however when people think about discrimination they re much more likely to be looking at the categories that have gotten more attention and has been more apparent in our social discourse discrimination based on race and ethnicity said erin boggs executive director of the open communities alliance a team of civil rights attorneys who focus on fair housing i ve done lots of trainings on fair housing law and people are often surprised that there s even protection for families with children winning local approval for elderly housing is also often demonstrably easier than getting through projects without an age restriction the reality is that the elderly have many more options to find housing than do people with children there s a lot more built for older people and in a way it s discriminatory because of who lives longer in this country said denes the former longtime chairman of the branford housing authority in connecticut reserving affordable housing for the elderly does have the potential to disproportionately benefit white people since 84 of those over age 65 are white compared to 67 statewide only 8 of branford s population is black and hispanic compared to 27 statewide just one of the 37 residents who lived at the controversial elderly complex in branford in 2020 was black the remaining residents were white the affordable housing built over the years in branford with the help of state and federal funding is half as likely to be reserved for families than other projects across the state these taxpayer funded affordable housing projects which are paid for with government grants or tax credits account for the overwhelming majority of the affordable housing units in the state of the 233 affordable housing projects built with taxpayer money in branford 25 are reserved for families compared to 54 statewide likewise 57 are reserved for the elderly in branford compared to 42 statewide branford also has 16 of its units set aside for the disabled compared to 3 statewide while the state department of housing collects this data the agency warns that there may be some overlap in reporting if a unit is both age and disability restricted an analysis by the ct mirror of affordable housing built with the government s assistance shows that 16 higher income towns have reserved 100 such housing for the elderly another 39 have reserved at least 80 and 25 towns have no government assisted housing in their communities those 16 towns are ashford chester columbia deep river east granby east hampton haddam madison morris pomfret sprague south windsor voluntown wilton woodbridge and woodstock translation almost half of the towns in the state

housing stock only 9 of taxpayer funded affordable housing units are located in them and 10 of all types of affordable housing this lopsided approach towards elderly housing didn t happen by coincidence local preference for elderly housing is showing up in zoning regulations which ultimately determine what type of housing developers are allowed to build and what types of people can live in those communities only 13 of districts zoned for housing in connecticut allow four or more unit developments to be built and one out of every four of those districts require such housing be reserved exclusively for the elderly according to research completed by sara bronin a professor at the university of connecticut school of law the number of districts specifically devoted to elderly

housing for low income seniors while blocking development of affordable housing for low income families in an effort to reverse this trend the connecticut housing finance authority under the previous administration of gov dannel p malloy made the primary source of funding to build affordable housing essentially out of reach for developments that would be reserved for the elderly each year the state finance authority awards tax credits worth roughly 120 million accompanied by 30 million in other state aid to build affordable housing to determine which of the many projects seeking aid to fund the state devised a grading system that aligns with its development priorities that grading system was overhauled in 2016 putting 9 of the points out of reach if the applicant s project would only house the elderly or if more than 50 of the units are single bedroom or efficiency units there were housing authorities in the state that wanted to build senior age restricted housing and they would come in to meet with us and i d say well sure you could apply but you won t be able to compete and they were disappointed said evonne m klein who served as housing commissioner and chairman of the chfa board for most of malloy s tenure more of our developments need to look like our neighborhoods with all ages all sizes of families so that was our way to address the fair housing issue you know a property doesn t have to be age restricted to have seniors living in it ron burton coleman an 84 year old resident who has lived at parkside for 15 years opens the free food he received on the

s managing director of multifamily development this fall the state announced it would fund 20 4 million of the 26 2 million project in branford prioritizing family housing when awarding construction dollars for affordable housing has annoyed some branford officials who want to keep it reserved for the elderly my concern is this is the loss of housing to the most vulnerable population greater than what was going to be added jamie cosgrove the republican first selectman of branford for the last eight years told the ct mirror during an interview last month i recognize that there s a need for affordable housing across the spectrum but again i continue to ask this question i think it needs to be addressed cosgrove and other town officials have fought in court for years to keep the branford housing authority s proposed project from moving forward as the town s chief elected official cosgrove also gets to determine who serves on the housing authority s board pending approval of the other selectmen civil rights attorneys have become concerned in recent months as calls grew for cosgrove to replace tacie lowe the chairman of the housing authority who supports redeveloping the property and opening it up to families just as he had done with the prior chairman with signs placed on the town green and throughout branford calling for the removal of lowe cosgrove and the selectmen replaced lowe on may 5 with someone who has regularly spoken against the project a sign placed outside the public housing complex calling for the removal of the chairman of the housing authority credit jacqueline rabe thomas ctmirror org on the eve of that vote the leader of connecticut fair housing center wrote the first selectman and threatened to file a fair housing lawsuit against the town if it continues to block the project if the town takes further actions motivated by misguided community opposition based on racist tropes and animus against families with children that animus will be attributed to the town wrote erin kemple the executive director of the connecticut fair housing center the multi year history of this redevelopment effort is rife with opposition based not on what is being built but on who will live there facing more litigation cosgrove said he is leaving the decision to the housing authority the new chairman robert imperato said he is inclined to let the parkside project progress i don t see any reason why it would not move forward said imperato it s been approved and we need to follow federal law here and so the projects will move forward and get built out and hopefully provide new housing for folks who need it construction could begin as early as this fall after nearly nine years however housing advocates worry that what happened in branford could have a chilling effect on other developers considering trying to build there or provide other towns with a strategy for deterring the development of affordable housing for families nobody in their right mind would have gone through what we have just been through said dara kovel the chief executive officer of beacon communities the developer and property manager of parkside in branford if i knew then what i know now about how much money we ve spent and how difficult it would have been both financially process wise emotionally for the residents and the board i don t think we would have done it and so that s a bad sign because the state has to find a way to make sure that people are willing to get through the hard process

alzheimer s disease patients who take aduhelm will need a lot of diagnostic scans too imaging leader radnet stands to benefit as the largest owner and operator of diagnostic imaging centers in the u s radnet rdnt 0 92 is a one stop shop for medical imaging providing x rays ultrasounds ct scans and mris the radiology company valued at 1 8 billion will likely get a boost to its growth as a result of the recent fda approval of alzheimer s disease treatment aducanumab developed by biogen biib 2 41 and eisai esaly 3 02 the arrival of aducanumab to be marketed as aduhelm will spark an immediate surge in the need for advanced imaging because those who are prescribed the drug will need a number of scans one in particular is the amyloid pet scan which detects the buildup of certain plaques in the brain that are believed to play a role in the development of alzheimer s disease advocating for insurance coverage of amyloid pet scans is a central pillar of biogen s rollout of aduhelm medicare and medicaid don t currently cover this particular type of imaging but at a cost of 4 000 to 5 000 per test and with an estimated 1 million to 2 million alzheimer s disease patients in the u s there s a potential multibillion dollar addressable market in this indication alone next let s talk mris the fda recommends all aduhelm recipients get an mri before their initial monthly treatments and additional ones after months six and 11 any time an abnormality is seen on those scans follow up mris are recommended the fda recommends the treatment be paused until those abnormalities stabilize which will mean still more mris for surveillance given that in aduhelm s various clinical trials abnormalities were seen 35 to 41 of the time on regularly scheduled mris it s not hard to see that there is potential for a lot of them to be ordered at a minimum cost of 1 600 for a brain mri and at least three of them to be ordered within the first year of treatment that s at least 4 8 billion worth of imaging business up for grabs and with approximately 70 000 new alzheimer s cases diagnosed each year that s a potential renewing revenue stream of over 330 million worth of mris annually that will need to be performed why radnet as the largest national owner and operator of imaging centers radnet is a consolidator in a highly fragmented 100 billion diagnostic imaging market it s the clear leader in the space despite operating in only a few states arizona california maryland delaware new jersey and new york there s no other fixed site imaging center company even half its size in terms of revenue or number of centers while patients could go to a local hospital radiology department for their outpatient imaging that option has several potential downsides for alzheimer s patients hospital based imaging is often more expensive and less focused on customer service and the buildings frequently feature maze like hallways and difficult parking situations perhaps most importantly not all hospitals have sub specialized radiologists evaluating their images with its network of 300 locations and over 750 radiologists radnet avoids many of these issues approximately 25 of its free standing imaging centers are operated as joint ventures with large local healthcare centers these agreements decrease local competition drive volume with additional referrals and bring management fees to radnet s coffers it can then expand its agreements to other services such as teleradiology in house staffing and specialized services one of these breastlink is a unique breast care center that unites the imaging center surgeon and oncologist into an organized team which leads to more efficient care and better communications these joint ventures are sticky and stable the average age of the contracts involved is more than 10 years a healthcare ai play the company is also continuing to make significant investments in artificial intelligence solutions and those are starting to pay off in april radnet received fda clearance for its ai mammography triage software saige q a screening tool that identifies suspicious issues in screening mammographies that may need prioritized attention allowing radiologists to optimize their workflow it seems to be working according to the company radiologists are more than 25 more productive using saige q the diagnostic imaging company believes that its next ai product which is awaiting fda approval should improve productivity even more with a price to earnings p e ratio of 156 radnet stock is certainly not cheap especially compared to other mature outpatient services companies like dialysis provider davita dva 1 51 and its p e of 19 however radnet has significant tailwinds with ai utilization and increases in the number of pet scans and mris performed likely to improve its margins the company also has a proven track record for investors its share price is up by more than 850 in the last 10 years more than doubling the gains of the s p 500 healthcare investors looking for stocks that will give them exposure to the alzheimer s disease treatment market beyond biogen and eisai should have radnet on their radar
bargains abound for long term investors arguably the most important lesson investors learn when putting their money to work in the stock market is that patience pays off last year the coronavirus pandemic sent the widely tracked s p 500 screaming lower by 34 in just 33 calendar days despite unprecedented volatility and uncertainty those who believed in their long term investment theses have been handsomely rewarded the s p 500 has bounced back 90 since hitting its bear market bottom in march 2020 the point is this anytime is a good time to put money to work in the stock market as long as you have a long term mindset best of all you don t need a boatload of cash to get started or to further your path to financial independence if you have 500 that s ready to be invested which won t be needed to pay bills or cover emergencies the following trio of no brainer stocks are begging to be bought right now barrick gold for much of the past decade wall street has shunned gold stocks that s because miners were a bit too overzealous with taking on debt in the early 2010s following a more than decade long run higher in physical gold prices but after years of cost cutting and favorable macroeconomic conditions the gold mining industry is overflowing with value stocks that s why barrick gold gold 0 61 is a no brainer stock you can buy right now from a macro perspective things are nearly perfect for gold the federal reserve has pledged to keep lending rates at or near historic lows and its bond buying program is designed to weigh down long term yields between a rising money supply low yields and the prospect of higher inflation in the future gold is checking all the boxes it needs to head well above 2 000 an ounce but there s more to like about barrick gold beyond just realizing a higher price for what it produces and sells in particular we ve watched the company s balance sheet bloom since the beginning of 2019 what was once a 3 6 billion net debt position is now a 500 million net cash position though higher realized selling prices have helped barrick s size and the high yield ore grade of its mines have helped push its all in sustaining costs aisc down to around 1 000 per gold ounce 1 018 oz in q1 2021 and 967 oz in full year 2020 this provides well over 800 an ounce in operating margin additionally barrick gold aims to improve on its aisc investments being made in underground automation at kibali luolo guonkoto and bulyanhulu as well as the 300 million third shaft project at turquoise ridge in nevada should improve output and lower production costs after more than a decade of following gold mining stocks i ve come to the conclusion that a multiple of 10 times operating cash flow is a fair valuation with barrick gold currently valued at less than eight times wall street s cash flow projection for 2021 ample upside is still likely ping identity during the coronavirus pandemic traditional workplaces were disrupted like never before though businesses were making the move online and into the cloud well before the coronavirus made its presence known the pandemic kicked this trend into high gear in other words as more data makes its way into the cloud the onus of protecting this information from hackers and robots is increasingly falling to third party providers that s why putting your 500 to work in ping identity ping is such a no brainer as its name likely gives away ping identity is focused on providing identity verification solutions for its enterprise clients ping s platform utilizes artificial intelligence to grow smarter at identifying and responding to threats over time and its more advanced services offer a hybrid approach of cloud native security as well as on premises protection cloud native applications are typically nimbler than on premises solutions at identifying and responding to problems while there s no sugarcoating that ping s 2020 was less than stellar a number of its clients opted for shorter term agreements due to pandemic uncertainty a deeper dive into its recurring revenue shows plenty of promise annual recurring revenue arr jumped 16 in the first quarter from the prior year period since ping is predominantly focused on growing the higher margin software as a service portion of its business as opposed to its term based license subscriptions we re liable to see arr growth remain in the mid to high teens with revenue growth eventually catching up although arr growth in the mid teens may not seem as impressive as what other cloud based companies are delivering i d remind folks not to overlook the 85 subscription gross margin ping identity is bringing in with such robust margins even a modest double digit growth rate can generate significant cash flow considering that most cybersecurity stocks are valued at 10 to 20 times forward year sales ping is a screaming bargain at a multiple of six times next year s forecasted revenue fastly a third no brainer stock to buy now with 500 is rapidly growing edge cloud company fastly fsly 0 79 fastly provides a number of services to clients but might be best known for its content delivery network specifically it s responsible for expediting the delivery of content to end users in a secure manner with businesses moving online at an extraordinary rate during the pandemic traffic demand surged for fastly that s great news considering fastly s operating model is usage based though fastly is likely to be remembered for its meteoric rise and fall over the past 15 months i believe the company s defining moment came during the third quarter of 2020 that s when the company announced that its top customer bytedance the parent company of tiktok was pulling most of its traffic off the network for context bytedance was engaged in a stateside dispute with the trump administration at the time instead of curling up in the fetal position fastly still managed to grow its sales by 42 in q3 and another 35 in the recently ended first quarter in other words fastly demonstrated the importance of its services to a wide array of fast growing businesses while fastly remains unprofitable as it boosts its headcount and takes on higher costs following the signal sciences acquisition other metrics remain promising total customer count grew by 123 in q1 to 2 027 adjusted gross margin remained robust at 60 1 and the dollar based net expansion rate dbner hit 139 this latter figure dbner tells us that existing clients spent 39 more in q1 2021 than they did in the prior year period with content being increasingly funneled online over time fastly is in the driver s seat of a sustainable high growth operating model
