magic richard jones says the best financial year of his life was 2016 when he won itv s britain s got talent competition what did your parents teach you about money i was taught to always spend less than you earn and save as much as possible my dad was a policeman and mum was a childminder when my brother and sister and i were growing up money wasn t tight we were comfortable because my parents worked really hard have you ever struggled to make ends meet luckily i haven t i did have a terrifying moment though when covid struck in 2020 i was just about to start the biggest uk tour i d ever done as a magician when everything got cancelled overnight all the dates on my tour disappeared and so did all my corporate bookings and weddings i was booked to appear at at the time i had a lot of savings so i didn t panic i bought my home outright for 295 000 when i won britain s got talent in 2016 so i didn t have a mortgage that was a big comfort to me during the pandemic and i felt lucky and grateful i was in that situation but as time went on i started to worry quite a lot i didn t like living off my savings so about six months in i started putting on virtual shows and my regular corporate clients started booking me to appear at their online conferences and events now i look back and think the online world saved me have you ever been paid silly money yes i m extremely fortunate that i do high profile events around the world on private yachts in the middle east for example the most i was ever paid was for a show in the ritz carlton in saudi arabia in 2019 i earned a substantial five figure sum for a performance i d rather not say how much but it worked out at roughly 1 000 a minute what was the best year of your financial life it was 2016 the year i won britain s got talent it was a mind blowing experience as well as winning 250 000 tax free i started getting bookings to do corporate shows it was obviously a really good year the most expensive thing you bought for fun in 2018 i purchased a very flashy lexus f sport car for just over 40 000 it wasn t something i really wanted it was a car i thought people would expect me to drive rather than a car i enjoyed driving so earlier this year i sold it and got a mercedes campervan which is much more fun what is your biggest money mistake not keeping an eye on the money i was spending the year after i won britain s got talent i was eating out pretty much every night i was also regularly going in and out of london for events in addison lee taxis i live in essex so each journey probably cost between 100 and 150 nowadays i usually get the train and i enjoy it i take a book and read the craziest thing you spent money on at that time new shirts after i won britain s got talent i lived in a hotel near london bridge for six weeks i was busy going to and from interviews events and tv appearances and i didn t have a washing machine so i would go to the closest shop which sold white shirts for more than 100 each every time i needed a fresh shirt i would buy one instead of washing the ones i already had i look back now and think what a waste of money the best money decision you have made investing 70 per cent of my savings in shares and investment funds in november 2020 as i had more time on my hands during the pandemic than usual i researched how the stock market works if it hadn t been for covid i probably never would have tried to understand the world of investing but i got really interested and read books about it i ve invested the majority of my money in the s p500 index the 500 largest companies listed on the stock market of the united states i ve also invested in companies such as apple and tesla i think i ve done fairly well overall i ve seen my savings increase by around 18 per cent although they ve taken a hit in recent months i see my holdings as long term investments and i ll probably leave my money invested for at least ten years career change richard jones when he was in the household cavalry do you save into a pension no that s not something i ve had time to look into but it s something i m planning to do soon do you own any property yes my home in essex it s a three bedroom house close to my mum and dad s i bought it with my winnings from britain s got talent and some money i had saved from my army career i had previously earned just under 30 000 a year as a lance corporal my home has probably gone up in value from 295 000 to between 400 000 and 430 000 being mortgage free takes a lot of financial pressure off me i feel lucky what is the one little luxury you treat yourself to coffee on a day when i m performing in a show i ll probably have five or six cups i m a big cappuccino lover each time i buy one it costs around 4 if you were chancellor what would you do first i would increase funding for the nhs i feel that people working for the nhs don t get paid enough money for the work they do do you donate money to charity yes i do but i mainly give my time i do hospital visits regularly on behalf of the charity spread a smile it uses entertainers such as myself to go into hospitals to get seriously ill children to smile i also work with rainbow trust which provides emotional and practical support to families who have a child with a life threatening or terminal illness i m also an ambassador for the royal british legion and a children s hospice charity called together for short lives plus i work closely with scotty s little soldiers a children s charity which supports the families of servicemen and women who lost their lives on duty for these charities i ll do magic for amazing kids when i go into hospitals i always leave feeling great sometimes i ll teach a kid a couple of tricks it s so rewarding the next time i visit when the nurses tell me how that child has loved doing the magic tricks i taught them what is your number one financial priority i probably save 70 per cent of everything i earn my plan is to keep doing that for at least the next 10 years one day i d like to retire and not have to worry too much about money

maurie backman the motley fool one of the reasons costco has such a loyal fan base is that it s known for offering a nice range of products at competitive prices but that doesn t mean shopping at costco will always result in the best deal here are a few specific items that you may want to purchase outside of costco before you do all of your shopping at costco crunch some numbers to see whether it pays to stock up on certain items outside of costco when they re on sale you may find that doing so lets you shave some money off of your grocery bills and run up less of a credit card tab as a result 1 condiments buying condiments in bulk can seem like a good idea especially during barbecue season but in many cases you re better off purchasing things like ketchup and mustard at your regular supermarket once they go on sale and for a couple of reasons first grocery stores tend to offer nice discounts on condiments before holiday weekends so you might snag a lower price point at the supermarket than at costco also condiments tend to sit out a lot it s common to leave them out baking in the sun during a barbecue or on the table during regular dinners all told that means condiments won t always have the longest shelf life once opened and so it could actually work to your benefit to not buy giant bottles of them at costco 10 best supermarket brands these are the chains our readers swear by 2 cereal costco tends to offer a nice selection of bulk cereal but cereal is one of those things that tends to go on sale frequently at the supermarket and when it does you ll often find that costco s price doesn t hold up plus costco tends to carry brand name cereals while many supermarkets carry their own store brand versions that taste just as good but the thing is those store brands will often cost a lot less per ounce than what you ll get at costco despite the bulk discount the daily money get our latest personal finance and consumer news in your inbox 3 pasta like cereal pasta is one of those items that tends to be deeply discounted at times at the regular supermarket and when that happens the cost per pound is often cheaper at your local grocery store what s more pasta is one of those items that consumers don t tend to be brand specific about your kids may prefer one brand of cereal over another for example but chances are they don t care what name comes on the box of the macaroni you buy for them as long as you smother it with melted cheese and that means when pasta does go on sale at the supermarket it should be easy enough for you to capitalize on those lower prices i go hungry what parents are sacrificing amid soaring inflation to feed their families don t spend more on food than you need to these days food prices are soaring due to inflation so it pays to do what you can to eke out some savings while costco definitely offers its share of bargains it s wrong to assume you ll always get the lowest price or best deal there alert highest cash back card we ve seen now has 0 intro apr until 2023 if you re using the wrong credit or debit card it could be costing you serious money our expert loves this top pick which features a 0 intro apr until 2023 an insane cash back rate of up to 5 and all somehow for no annual fee in fact this card is so good that our expert even uses it personally click here to read our full review for free and apply in just 2 minutes read our free review we re firm believers in the golden rule which is why editorial opinions are ours alone and have not been previously reviewed approved or endorsed by included advertisers the ascent does not cover all offers on the market editorial content from the ascent is separate from the motley fool editorial content and is created by a different analyst team maurie backman has no position in any of the stocks mentioned the motley fool has positions in and recommends costco wholesale the motley fool has a disclosure policy the motley fool is a usa today content partner offering financial news analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives its content is produced independently of usa today
one hundred days into russia s invasion of ukraine the war has brought the world a near daily drumbeat of gut wrenching scenes civilian corpses in the streets of bucha a blown up theater in mariupol the chaos at a kramatorsk train station in the wake of a russian missile strike those images tell just a part of the overall picture of europe s worst armed conflict in decades here s a look at some numbers and statistics that while in flux and at times uncertain shed further light on the death destruction displacement and economic havoc wrought by the war as it reaches this milestone with no end in sight the human toll nobody really knows how many combatants or civilians have died and claims of casualties by government officials who may sometimes be exaggerating or lowballing their figures for public relations reasons are all but impossible to verify government officials u n agencies and others who carry out the grim task of counting the dead don t always get access to places where people were killed and moscow has released scant information about casualties among its forces and allies and given no accounting of civilian deaths in areas under its control in some places such as the long besieged city of mariupol potentially the war s biggest killing field russian forces are accused of trying to cover up deaths and dumping bodies into mass graves clouding the overall toll with all those caveats at least tens of thousands of ukrainian civilians have died so far president volodymyr zelenskyy said thursday in comments to luxembourg s parliament in mariupol alone officials have reported over 21 000 civilian dead sievierodonetsk a city in the eastern region of luhansk that has become the focus of russia s offensive has seen roughly 1 500 casualties according to the mayor such estimates comprise both those killed by russian strikes or troops and those who succumbed to secondary effects such as hunger and sickness as food supplies and health services collapsed zelenskyy said this week that 60 to 100 ukrainian soldiers are dying in combat every day with about 500 more wounded russia s last publicly released figures for its own forces came march 25 when a general told state media that 1 351 soldiers had been killed and 3 825 wounded ukraine and western observers say the real number is much higher zelenskyy said thursday that more than 30 000 russian servicemen have died more than the soviet union lost in 10 years of the war in afghanistan in late april the british government estimated russian losses at 15 000 speaking on condition of anonymity wednesday to discuss intelligence matters a western official said russia is still taking casualties but in smaller numbers the official estimated that some 40 000 russian troops have been wounded in moscow backed separatist enclaves in eastern ukraine authorities have reported over 1 300 fighters lost and nearly 7 500 wounded in the donetsk region along with 477 dead civilians and nearly 2 400 wounded plus 29 civilians killed and 60 wounded in luhansk ukraine s ambassador in geneva yevheniia filipenko said for her the 100 day mark was more about the faces of children who lost parents or homes or the faces of fleeing mothers than about any particular count it s not about the numbers she said in an interview it s about the feelings and the sufferings of ukrainians the devastation relentless shelling bombing and airstrikes have reduced large swaths of many cities and towns to rubble ukraine s parliamentary commission on human rights says russia s military has destroyed almost 38 000 residential buildings rendering about 220 000 people homeless nearly 1 900 educational facilities from kindergartens to grade schools to universities have been damaged including 180 completely ruined other infrastructure losses include 300 car and 50 rail bridges 500 factories and about 500 damaged hospitals according to ukrainian officials the world health organization has tallied 296 attacks on hospitals ambulances and medical workers in ukraine this year fleeing home the u n refugee agency unhcr estimates that about 6 8 million people have been driven out of ukraine at some point during the conflict but since fighting subsided in the area near kyiv and elsewhere and russian forces redeployed to the east and south about 2 2 million have returned to the country it says the u n s international organization for migration estimates that as of may 23 there were more than 7 1 million internally displaced people that is those who fled their homes but remain in the country that s down from over 8 million in an earlier count land seized ukrainian officials say that before the february invasion russia controlled some 7 of ukrainian territory including crimea which russia annexed in 2014 and areas held by the separatists in donetsk and luhansk on thursday zelenskyy said russian forces now held 20 of the country while the front lines are constantly shifting that amounts to an additional 22 000 square miles under russian control a total area slightly larger than croatia or a little smaller than the u s state of west virginia the economic fallout in russia and ukraine the west has levied a host of retaliatory sanctions against moscow including on the crucial oil and gas sectors and europe is beginning to wean itself from its dependence on russian energy evgeny gontmakher academic director of european dialogue wrote in a paper this week that russia currently faces over 5 000 targeted sanctions more than any other country some 300 billion of russian gold and foreign exchange reserves in the west have been frozen he added and air traffic in the country dropped from 8 1 million to 5 2 million passengers between january and march additionally the kyiv school of economics has reported that more than 1 000 self sanctioning companies have curtailed their operations in russia the moex russia stock index has plunged by about a quarter since just before the invasion and is down nearly 40 percent from the start of the year and the russian central bank said last week that annualized inflation came in at 17 8 percent in april ukraine meanwhile has reported suffering a staggering economic blow 35 of gdp wiped out by the war our direct losses today exceed 600 billion andriy yermak the head of zelenskyy s office said recently ukraine a major agricultural producer says it has been unable to export some 22 million tons of grain it blames a backlog of shipments on russian blockades or capture of key ports zelenskyy accused russia this week of stealing at least a half million tons of grain during the invasion the world the fallout has rippled around the globe further driving up costs for basic goods on top of inflation that was already in full swing in many places before the invasion developing countries are being squeezed particularly hard by higher costs of food fuel and financing crude oil prices in london and new york have risen by 20 to 25 percent resulting in higher prices at the pump and for an array of petroleum based products wheat supplies have been disrupted in african nations which imported 44 of their wheat from russia and ukraine in the years immediately before the invasion the african development bank has reported a 45 increase in continental prices for the grain affecting everything from mauritanian couscous to the fried donuts sold in congo amin awad the u n crisis coordinator in ukraine said 1 4 billion people worldwide could be affected by shortages of grain and fertilizer from the country this war s toll on civilians is unacceptable this war has no winner he told reporters in geneva via video from kyiv on friday today we mark a tragic milestone and we know what is needed the most an end to this war

chalmers should be wary of conventional thinking about problems that are of unconventional origins just as the coronacession was unlike an ordinary recession because it was caused by government imposed restraints on the supply side rather than efforts to curb excessive demand so he shouldn t be using demand restraint to try to fix disruptions to supply inflation problems normally arise from an overheated economy leading to excessive wage growth the standard solution will involve cutting real wages to make labour less expensive but we ve had weak real wage growth for a decade the business lobby has become so consumed by short sighted self interest so used to getting its own way that we need a new government with the wisdom and strength to save business from its own folly those ideologically opposed to fiscal stimulus tell us our stimulus has given us a red hot inflation prone economy as proved by our super tight labour market they conveniently forget to mention that the pandemic caused us to ban all imported labour for two years but that this supply constraint has now been lifted if excessive wage growth didn t cause our high and rising prices what did fiscal stimulus has caused shortages of materials and workers in housing and construction but most of the price rises have come from external supply constraints caused by the pandemic and the war on ukraine nothing we could do can fix problems coming from the rest of the world but we shouldn t forget that these are once off price increases and those import prices will fall at some stage as pandemic disruptions are resolved and the war ends it s not that simple of course why not because our businesses don t seem to have hesitated in passing their increased import costs through to retail prices that s the start not of a wage price spiral but price wage spiral and business and employer groups solution to the spiral is simple allow only a token increase in wages and inflation will come down in no time loading this is the unspoken doctrine that s the bastard child of the economic rationalist era give business whatever it demands and everything in the economy will be wonderful the business lobby has become so consumed by short sighted self interest so used to getting its own way that we need a new government with the wisdom and strength to save business from its own folly we need a government capable of seeing what business can t that wages aren t just a cost to business and an impost on profits but also the chief source of income for the 10 million households who are the reason we have an economy and whose spending on the things our businesses produce is what generates their profits in the first place screwing the workers by tolerating ever falling real wages is a delusional way to increase profits in anything but the short term the bigger the fall in real wages and the government can t stop them falling the more labor risks joining the us and china in recession loading this is why in its worthy desire to keep big business in the tent the government was wrong to ask the fair work commission to increase award wages by 5 1 per cent only for low paid workers that is only about the bottom 12 per cent of workers rather than the bottom 25 per cent do you really think the 88 per cent of workers reliant on bargaining with bosses rather than a commission edict will get anything like a 5 per cent pay rise former reserve bank governor bernie fraser used to say that any fool could get inflation down all you had to do was crunch the economy is that what business would like it s certainly what the financial markets whose model of our economy is a footnote saying see america want as i m sure the reserve well understands we need to get inflation down without causing a recession and that means being patient about how long it takes we were below the target range for six years we can be above it for a few years without the sky falling and remember this if we did fall into recession the strategy of growing our way out of debt would explode not only would the economy be growing more slowly than the debt the budget s automatic stabilisers would reverse and the deficit would blow out greatly increasing the debt on the other hand chalmers should be sceptical of the argument that an additional reason we need to cut the budget deficit asap is to reduce the need for interest rates to rise so far getting inflation under control is not a big ask provided we re patient the reserve s stated strategy is to shift the stance of monetary policy only from emergency expansionary to neutral that is to take its foot off the accelerator not to jam on the brakes this means slowly lifting the official interest rate to about 2 5 per cent so the medium term real interest rate is zero in theory at least this should not cause the economy to contract nor great pain to most people with mortgages and it would be a good thing in itself to get rates up to a level remotely approaching normal

chalmers should be wary of conventional thinking about problems that are of unconventional origins just as the coronacession was unlike an ordinary recession because it was caused by government imposed restraints on the supply side rather than efforts to curb excessive demand so he shouldn t be using demand restraint to try to fix disruptions to supply inflation problems normally arise from an overheated economy leading to excessive wage growth the standard solution will involve cutting real wages to make labour less expensive but we ve had weak real wage growth for a decade the business lobby has become so consumed by short sighted self interest so used to getting its own way that we need a new government with the wisdom and strength to save business from its own folly those ideologically opposed to fiscal stimulus tell us our stimulus has given us a red hot inflation prone economy as proved by our super tight labour market they conveniently forget to mention that the pandemic caused us to ban all imported labour for two years but that this supply constraint has now been lifted if excessive wage growth didn t cause our high and rising prices what did fiscal stimulus has caused shortages of materials and workers in housing and construction but most of the price rises have come from external supply constraints caused by the pandemic and the war on ukraine nothing we could do can fix problems coming from the rest of the world but we shouldn t forget that these are once off price increases and those import prices will fall at some stage as pandemic disruptions are resolved and the war ends it s not that simple of course why not because our businesses don t seem to have hesitated in passing their increased import costs through to retail prices that s the start not of a wage price spiral but price wage spiral and business and employer groups solution to the spiral is simple allow only a token increase in wages and inflation will come down in no time loading this is the unspoken doctrine that s the bastard child of the economic rationalist era give business whatever it demands and everything in the economy will be wonderful the business lobby has become so consumed by short sighted self interest so used to getting its own way that we need a new government with the wisdom and strength to save business from its own folly we need a government capable of seeing what business can t that wages aren t just a cost to business and an impost on profits but also the chief source of income for the 10 million households who are the reason we have an economy and whose spending on the things our businesses produce is what generates their profits in the first place screwing the workers by tolerating ever falling real wages is a delusional way to increase profits in anything but the short term the bigger the fall in real wages and the government can t stop them falling the more labor risks joining the us and china in recession loading this is why in its worthy desire to keep big business in the tent the government was wrong to ask the fair work commission to increase award wages by 5 1 per cent only for low paid workers that is only about the bottom 12 per cent of workers rather than the bottom 25 per cent do you really think the 88 per cent of workers reliant on bargaining with bosses rather than a commission edict will get anything like a 5 per cent pay rise former reserve bank governor bernie fraser used to say that any fool could get inflation down all you had to do was crunch the economy is that what business would like it s certainly what the financial markets whose model of our economy is a footnote saying see america want as i m sure the reserve well understands we need to get inflation down without causing a recession and that means being patient about how long it takes we were below the target range for six years we can be above it for a few years without the sky falling and remember this if we did fall into recession the strategy of growing our way out of debt would explode not only would the economy be growing more slowly than the debt the budget s automatic stabilisers would reverse and the deficit would blow out greatly increasing the debt on the other hand chalmers should be sceptical of the argument that an additional reason we need to cut the budget deficit asap is to reduce the need for interest rates to rise so far getting inflation under control is not a big ask provided we re patient the reserve s stated strategy is to shift the stance of monetary policy only from emergency expansionary to neutral that is to take its foot off the accelerator not to jam on the brakes this means slowly lifting the official interest rate to about 2 5 per cent so the medium term real interest rate is zero in theory at least this should not cause the economy to contract nor great pain to most people with mortgages and it would be a good thing in itself to get rates up to a level remotely approaching normal

heavy losses 60 to 100 fatalities a day zelensky said recently the british defence ministry said on saturday that russia s recent use of airstrikes and artillery fire has been a factor in its limited success in ukraine s east a contrast with its largely ineffective air attacks earlier in the war the russian reliance on long range strikes has probably depleted the country s stock of precision

theater of war and the focus of russia s war machine despite its early and devastating setbacks russia has come to occupy one fifth of the country the intensity of the russian attack and frequency of russian reinforcements to sievierodonetsk led to predictions that the city would soon fall but serhiy haidai governor of luhansk province who recently had a dour prognosis for the city s survival told

the bbc like the new york times excels at disinformation with an authoritative touch these media engines do not shout who wants to use a vulgar ax when innuendo used as a stiletto can accomplish so much more not surprising then that their facts and arguments calibrated for a refined audience and slyly embedded in many layers of deception not liable to be spotted by the untrained eye are couched in what appears to be established truths and impeccable reasoning yet as this piece so efficiently illustrates almost every paragraph is tainted with a lie can you identify the lies we ll give you a hint the article uses one major stratagem to inject its poison reality inversion almost everything in it is upside down the people attacked are actually the truthtellers the lonely few pushing against the vileness of tyrannical plutocratic elites masquerading as zealous champions of peace freedom and democracy the people defended like the notorious white helmets long exposed as a creation of british intelligence to facilitate regime change ops are vectors for the lies upholding the western imperialist order for good measure the pain of the victims is also exaggerated and it doesn t help any that by design the discourse is also conducted in a contextual miasma in which some witnesses like dr schlosberg is seen loftily casting a curse on both warring houses progressives of this type who always end up carrying water for the empire are a regular fixture in western political debates it s also ironic but to be expected for these avatars of priggish journalistic integrity that while they are quick to mention in ominous tones that dr schlosberg in connection with the largely debunked bucha story has been using some russian state media they conveniently forget that the bbc itself is a huge media and propaganda instrument of the british state an aggressive participant in many of the topics and events discussed in this story so give it a try we d like to hear what you have to say

as russia has tightened its hold over information channels to the point of virtually criminalizing criticism of the special operation in ukraine russia s business dailies sometimes succeed in providing unwelcome information to the authorities perhaps the authorities do not fear the select readership of these dailies perhaps it assumes that the readership has access to sources of information in any case rbc media has provided an article proving that the sanctions imposed on russia are taking their toll on russia s defense industry it turns out that even the quintessentially russian kalashnikov has foreign components the absence of foreign components has caused extensive production delays reliance on obsolete equipment disruption of maintenance schedules and even layoffs the rbc report follows below f ollowing the launch of russia s military special operation in ukraine the us and the european countries imposed a series of new sanctions against the russian military industrial complex now defense industry complex plants are still assessing the risks but it is already apparent that due to the new restrictions a number of contracts will be postponed there are problems with the lack of marine diesel engines import substitution of helicopter and aircraft engines electronics replacement of imported components installed in tank s fire control systems as well as aircraft repairs yet defense industries claim that the state defense order will be fulfilled at the same level as in the previous year the industry doesn t have the task of achieving a 100 level of import substitution for all products as rostec and the ministry of industry and trade emphasize reliance is being shifted to parallel imports rbc has been taking with leading defense industry enterprises and experts to find out from them how extensive are the problems caused by the new sanctions and what are the plans for resolving them how did the authorities in charge of the military industrial complex react in early march deputy prime minister for the defense industry yury borisov stated that the full magnitude and depth of the current sanctions was difficult to forecast however borisov noted that in 2021 the state defense order was fulfilled by 98 and that every opportunity for maintaining such indicators in the future exists at rostec they explained to rbc that the corporation s revenues are comprised of three elements civilian goods state defense orders and exports according to the corporation the latter two accounted for about 55 of corporate revenues while civilian products accounted for over 45 naturally changes considering today s reality are inevitable the ratio will change how exactly it will happen we are now scrutinizing this issue approximately by the middle of the year the picture will become clear stated rostec now the companies belonging to the state corporation adjust their plans on a number of projects in consideration of the new inputs their deadlines have been objectively shifted to the right that is they were postponed to a later date said the rostec representative without specifying what these projects are among the measures being taken rostec cited the following development of new cooperation opportunities fundamental changes in the suppliers as well as intensification of import substitution programs in critical areas for instance regarding aviation these concerns propulsion systems both for aircraft and helicopters onboard systems and specialized software for production nevertheless the task of producing absolutely everything didn t and doesn t exist the state corporation emphasized this is unreasonable as there are alternative suppliers there is also a mechanism of parallel import they summed up at rostec the ministry of industry and trade also told rbc that no country in the world is able to completely abandon the use of foreign technologies and components statements about 100 import substitution are populist ones argued the ministry regarding the decisions to support of the industry the ministry recalled that during the covid 19 pandemic the department generated the necessary measures some of which were perceived as redundant at the time thus some measures brought to a state of readiness weren t implemented and now we are applying these drafts summarized the ministry without specifying what tools they were referring to what s going on in the aircraft industry a representative of the united aircraft corporation uac stated in an interview to rbc that after the new sanctions were imposed there is more work to be done in the civilian segment the short term maintenance of the serviceability of the existing fleet of sukhoi superjet 100 aircraft is an important area of work for russian manufacturers of planes systems and components the work is being performed with the airline companies and each operator has its own road map of joint actions according to uac for the past period spare parts depots have been established including a pool of replacement engines however there are of course sensitive positions regarding the superjet 100 repairs admitted the company in early april yury lapin general director of iraero airlines warned that due to the us and eu sanctions airlines operating domestically produced sukhoi superjet 100 aircraft are unable to provide repairs and maintenance to assure the technical fitness of russian french sam146 engines such a situation according to lapin may lead to a stoppage of on the fleet of superjets in the short term perspective engine service problems were also reported by managers of three other airlines that fly superjet planes one of them noted that his airline will have to stop passenger flights on these planes as early as the fall of 2022 provided the engine tech support won t improve there are the two largest programs in civil aviation manufacturing and exploitation of the short haul superjet 100 and of the medium haul ms 21 both programs presumed the utilization of a significant number of foreign produced components reminded oleg panteleev executive director at the aviaport industry agency we are talking in particular about american produced pratt whitney engines for the ms 21 and russian french sam146 engines for the superjet 100 planes he specified the americans stopped the supplies in turn the french side has also blocked the delivery of its component i e of the generator module and other components therefore it s not possible to maintain production at the planned speed elaborated the expert regarding combat aircraft even if somewhere isolated foreign produced components are being used they belong to the category where their usage is allowed because large warehouse inventories of them were created in advance and they can be bought in the countries that don t support sanctions noted panteleev at the end of march the newspaper kommersant reported that uac had failed to receive the majority of the ms 21 engines from the american pratt whitney company due to which the commissioning and supply plan for this aircraft had to be reduced rostec plans to start deliveries of the ms 21 equipped with a home produced pd 14 engine in 2024 but even these terms are considered way too optimistic in the industry stressed the newspaper deputy prime minister borisov stated in mid march that the russian authorities at the background of sanctions were considering the prospects of increasing the serial production of il 96 and tu 214 passenger planes which are currently produced in small batches for special customers the uac told rbc that they are already increasing the manufacturing of tu 214 planes these planes will make it possible to support the air transport industry through a difficult period stated the company as for the helicopter manufacturing programs it s necessary to replace imported engines for ansat ka 62 and ka 226 helicopters panteleev continues at the same time there are more concerns about future maintenance and repair of western produced machines involved in the production of aircrafts it s necessary to purchase them in order to increase the production volume concluded the expert according to the disclose investigative journalism portal between 2014 and 2018 the french thales group of companies equipped 60 twin seat su 30 multi purpose fighters with the latest tacan navigation systems what s more similar tacan systems were delivered to russia for upgrading mig 29 fighters as well as special high tech pilot helmets since 2014 russian air force jets have been equipped with sigma 95n navigation systems developed by the french safran company which allow autonomous navigation without satellite signals according to the disclose website the target detection systems were supposed to be installed on ka 52 helicopters what shipbuilders say commenting on rbc s question regarding the components which are in short supply due to new restrictions the united shipbuilding corporation usc stated that the volume of domestic production must be increased first for all for marine diesel engines for components of propulsion systems for anchor mooring equipment and ship systems water circulation waste water management etc russian shipbuilders today are going through enormous difficulties regarding the supply of engines for ships of all types from boats to large warships ilya kramnik researcher at the center for north american studies of imemo russian academy of sciences and navy expert confirmed to rbc for instance multipurpose corvettes of project 20380 equipped with guided missiles were initially fitted with engines made by the kolomna plant according to kramnik the practice of their usage demonstrated that the domestic diesels didn t meet expectations as the expert explained there were complaints about engines reliability power and upgrade potential it was decided to equip the improved corvettes of this type project 20385 with german engines however due to the new restrictions the deal was derailed thus the fleet continues to use domestically produced diesel engines while for some projects the purchase is made in china noted the expert there are relatively few companies in the world that are capable of producing powerful modern diesel ship engines and russian companies aren t among them although russia possess some competence in manufacturing diesel stressed kramnik regarding the propulsion systems and anchor mooring equipment traditionally the emphasis was put on imported components and it remains unclear how promptly domestic developments can be introduced summed up the expert the usc has developed and is implementing import substitution plans for these types of equipment as stipulated by the shipbuilding industry development strategy drawn up to 2035 it is planned to start serial production of cycloidal propellers for a series of river sea vessels in addition to domestic engines whose has been already mastered and which are supplied en masse to such vessels besides the russian enterprises which deal with engine production are upgrading them to the requirements of the register the corporation has been working in this direction for some time but now the magnitude of such work has grown considerably and at the usc they are sure that it aims to become a full fledged business segment capable of generating proceeds it will take about two years to work out tactical solutions from 2024 till early 2025 we expect to transform to be based entirely on russian produced piston machines and other systems that were traditionally bought from foreign countries explained the usc the situation demands first of all a tough stance of state customers with regard to meeting civil demand with russian produced ship equipment this will provide the main support for shipbuilders stressed the corporation how serious are the problems with electronics deputy prime minister borisov has repeatedly mentioned the collapse of microelectronics in russia and the need to restore this industry in mid may he stressed again that the country is facing the task of acquiring technological independence ruselectronics holding told rbc that in the face of restrictions the holding s companies continue to fulfill contracts under state defense orders and produce civilian goods in order to facilitate an uninterrupted work the holding s stocks of electronic components are being used while cooperation chains are being reviewed in terms of exports we record stable demand from foreign customers for a number of electronic components particularly sealed magnetically controlled contacts thus we expect export revenue in the first half of 2022 to remain at the level of 2021 ruselectronics summed up according to kramnik the company grossly underestimates the situation claiming that there are no problems there are big problems with microprocessor production in particular in military military defensive and space areas the equipment that we possess now allows for production of some things but one has to be aware that such goods are already quite obsolete explained the expert when the issue concerns their introduction in modern arms systems with ai capability for example of real time data transfer and support for tactical decision making it requires growing foundation capacities that are not always accessible via older solutions stressed kramnik especially when compact equipment is needed added the expert if there s some kind of ground facility a building it s generally not that important whether to equip such a building with 100 or 500 kilograms of equipment however when it comes to a guided missile the dimension and weight requirements increase dramatically the product has to be light and small which is difficult to achieve explained kramnik there are also issues with modern optical and thermal imaging equipment continued kramnik russian plants enjoy their own matrices but they usually cannot satisfy the demand and don t meet the required characteristics noted the expert even enclosures switches and cables are imported that is we should start not with electronics but with electrical engineering concluded the expert what issues is russia s only tank manufacturer facing the press service of uralvagonzavod uvz told rbc that the holding s enterprises are operating steadily and are even increasing their production volume the concern has been operating under sanctions since 2014 recalls the company s representative import substitution doesn t concern the holding s products of both military and civilian use stressed uralvagonzavod meanwhile at the end of march as kommersant reported referencing the plant s press service that a small part of the employees at the car assembly line were sent on short term leave with 2 3 pay the exact number of employees on leave wasn t specified however the press service stressed that there are pending orders until the end of the year and with regard to a number of products until the end of 2024 according to a statement of representative of the plant s trade union alexander ivanov made to ura ru agency in early april there are actually no issues with the quantity of orders however there are problems with their fulfillment ivanov claimed that uralvagonzavod is facing a shortage of components because of the transition to import substitution the plant is searching for russian suppliers we are developing schemes of raw materials purchase from friendly states that haven t joined the sanctions said ivanov in addition he claimed that the employees at the car assembly line are being laid off with 2 3 of their pay intact on a massive scale rather than on a case by case basis as the plant s press office told kommersant on the whole uralvagonzavod fulfills the state defense order but the components for the fire control systems including those deployed at the russian main battle tank t 90m were purchased via belarus from the french thales company recalled colonel victor murakhovsky the editor in chief of arsenal of fatherland according to murakhovsky this concerns not the fire control system as a whole but only its night time module it s not yet known how critical this issue is and whether there is a potential for production of domestic substitutes said the expert the european online eu observer magazine also reported that russian t 72s are equipped with thermal imaging sight made by the french thales company what is the position of the gunsmiths on april 7 a meeting of the board of directors of the union of russian armorers named after m t kalashnikov was held the meeting was chaired by alan lushnikov a shareholder of the kalashnikov concern the meeting was dedicated to the issues of import substitution simplification of export procedures for arms and cartridges work on elimination of excessive administrative obstacles regarding the arms circulation as well as to state support measures of the industry according to the holding s own statement vladimir zhikharev executive director at the union of russian armorers told rbc that the organization scrutinized the risks that may appear in connection with sanctions pressure on part of unfriendly states he also concluded that some enterprises that are part of kalashnikov holding are at risk of not receiving many components 70 of which and sometimes more than 80 were previously bought abroad also there is the short term issue of the repair and replacement of imported equipment many companies find themselves in a very difficult situation the air guns production as well as that of cartridges of many civilian arms experience shortage some companies of the holding have ceased production of certain types of civilian products said zhikharev in addition he stated that kalashnikov holding may experience a twofold decrease in the export of civilian small arms due to the recent tightening of the sanctions regime the kalashnikov press service didn t respond to rbc s inquiry the same is also true for rbc s inquiries to russian helicopters and united engine corporation rbc ru may 30 2022

pharmaceutical companies the company s revenues will come under significant pressure in the coming years when its best selling drug humira will lose patent protection in 2023 accordingly abbvie s future revenue and earnings depend in large part on its ability to develop new sources of revenue to offset humira s lost sales rinvoq an anti inflammatory drug manufactured by abbvie and used to treat rheumatoid arthritis ra and other diseases by inhibiting janus kinase jak enzymes was touted as one such drug rinvoq was initially approved in the united states to treat only moderate to severe ra however abbvie was actively pursuing additional treatment indications and in 2020 asked the u s food and drug administration fda to approve rinvoq for the treatment of several other diseases as is relevant here rinvoq is similar to other jak inhibitor drugs including xeljanz manufactured by pfizer inc when the fda approved xeljanz in 2012 for the treatment of ra it required an additional safety trial to evaluate xeljanz s risk of triggering certain serious side effects beginning in february 2019 the fda repeatedly warned the public that the safety trial indicated that xeljanz s use could lead to serious heart related issue cancer and other adverse events notwithstanding the similarities between rinvoq and xeljanz during the class period defendants assured investors that rinvoq was far safer than xeljanz and not subject to the same regulatory risks however investors began to learn the truth about rinvoq s significant risks on june 25 2021 when abbvie revealed that the fda was delaying its review of expanded treatment applications for rinvoq due to the safety concerns associated with xeljanz on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 1 76 per share or approximately 1 5 from a close of 114 74 per share on june 24 2021 to close at 112 98 per share on june 25 2021 then on september 1 2021 the fda announced that final results from the xeljanz safety trial established an increased risk of serious adverse events even with low doses of xeljanz as a result the fda determined that it would require new and updated warnings for xeljanz and rinvoq because rinvoq share similar mechanisms of action with xeljanz and may have similar risks as seen in the xeljanz safety trial the fda also indicated that it would further limit approved indications for rinvoq as a result of these safety concerns on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 8 51 per share or more than 7 from a close of 120 78 per share on august 31 2021 to close at 112 27 per share on september 1 2021 after the class period on december 3 2021 abbvie announced that the fda had updated rinvoq s label to require additional safety warnings and limit marketing of rinvoq to only its use after treatment with other drugs has failed on january 11 2022 defendants admitted that these changes to rinvoq s label would negatively impact sales forcing the company to reduce its long term guidance for rinvoq s sales in 2025 the complaint alleges that throughout the class period the defendants made materially false and or misleading statements about the company s business and operations specifically defendants misrepresented and or failed to disclose that 1 safety concerns about xeljanz extended to rinvoq and other jak inhibitors 2 as a result it was likely that the fda

the war has settled into what seems increasingly destined to be a slog the ukrainians and russians both said saturday that they were inflicting decisive losses against each other in the battle for sievierodonetsk the last major city in the luhansk region of eastern ukraine still under ukrainian control but the fighting was not limited to that town a senior ukrainian official said on saturday that the country s troops had reached a milestone in grinding down the russian invasion force in eastern ukraine andriy yermak chief of staff to president volodymyr zelensky posted on social networking site telegram that most of a large russian military unit had been destroyed in heavy fighting over the past weeks almost the entire 35th all russian army was destroyed he wrote yermak s claim was supported by commentary from a russian military blogger cited in a report by the influential institute for the study of war incompetent russian commanders had failed to prepare troops for combat in a forested area near the city of izyum the report said the claim of the routing of the russian unit could not be independently verified ukrainian soldiers interviewed over the past week have described fierce fighting in the forests around izyum a strategic city that russia is using as a base for attacks south toward the cities of kramatorsk and sloviansk ukrainian forces are also taking heavy losses 60 to 100 fatalities a day zelensky said recently the british defence ministry said on saturday that russia s recent use of airstrikes and artillery fire has been a factor in its limited success in ukraine s east a contrast with its largely ineffective air attacks earlier in the war the russian reliance on long range strikes has probably depleted the country s stock of precision guided missiles leading to more use of unguided munitions that can cause substantial civilian casualties the ministry said ukrainian soldiers atop an armoured fighting vehicle in an area near kramatorsk in the donbas region of ukraine on june 4 credit ivor prickett the new york times also on saturday an air launched cruise missile hit the odesa region on ukraine s black sea coast odesa city officials said on telegram the missile struck a mostly agricultural area with warehouses injuring two people according to the officials loading and russian and ukrainian officials traded blame for the burning of the main temple of the all saints hermitage a 16th century monastery in eastern ukraine that is considered one of the three most sacred sites in ukraine for orthodox believers the increasing terror from the sky came a day after ukraine on the 100th day of the war took stock of its successes in holding back and in key places repelling the invasion by russia which had sought to quickly conquer the capital kyiv and topple the government zelenskyy insisted victory will be ours and announced that 50 foreign embassies had resumed activities in the capital but on the 101st day ukraine faced anew the harsh realities on the ground and increasingly from overhead russia s airstrikes provided cover to their troops engaged in the bitter fighting in the contested city of sievierodonetsk and russian troops continued to target the last remaining bridge into sievierodonetsk to keep ukraine from moving reinforcements food and medicine into a city that has become the main theater of war and the focus of russia s war machine despite its early and devastating setbacks russia has come to occupy one fifth of the country the intensity of the russian attack and frequency of russian reinforcements to sievierodonetsk led to predictions that the city would soon fall but serhiy haidai governor of luhansk province who recently had a dour prognosis for the city s survival told ukraine s national television that ukrainian troops had retaken 20 per cent of the territory they had lost adding that it was not realistic the city would fall in the next two weeks a ukrainian demining specialist clearing anti tank mines in horenka north of kyiv ukraine credit ivor prickett the new york times as ukrainian forces try to take back territory in the east its state emergency services has removed 127 393 explosive devices with the efforts focused mostly on urban areas in the kyiv sumy and zhytomyr regions that were occupied by russia early in the war according to a report by the united nations development program russia s retreat from those areas has made them more accessible for clear up operations the report said adding that ukrainians had covered an area of more than 28 714 square kilometres but that it could take years to clear all of the mines in ukraine ukrainian forces have also launched a counteroffensive near the occupied city of kherson in the country s south loading but a punishing costly and tragic military stalemate is increasingly foreseen by experts ukraine has been outgunned but will soon receive long range m142 high mobility artillery rocket systems commonly known as himars from the united states the exchanges of evermore lethal firepower will likely add to the many millions of people who have already been displaced a death toll of at least 4 000 civilians and a ukrainian economy already in tatters with roughly us100 billion in losses kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov said on friday that russia would continue what it calls a special military operation in ukraine until all goals have been attained but one thing russia had already achieved was international isolation and a solidifying of the western alliance against it nato secretary general jens stoltenberg met on friday with prime minister sanna marin of finland in washington about the country s application to the military alliance he has advised allies to be prepared for the long haul and warned this past week that the conflict had become a war of attrition
on nov 11 2011 alec bradley began shipping the first in an ambitious series of cigars named fine rare which was notable for the fact that it incorporated 10 different tobaccos in the overall blend one wrapper two binders and seven fillers over the years each of the cigars in the series has featured different blends the one exception being the 2020 release which was made up of five previous fine rare cigars although the name of each has always been made up of a distinctive code system and the packaging has been relatively similar that packaging has also included a unique band that is printed with an enormous amount of information including the code of the cigar bc 13 4ev the date the cigars were originally rolled between aug 2 and aug 8 2020 the release date nov 18 2021 the weekly quantity of cigars that were produced 778 the names and signatures of the factory supervisor and two rollers the names and signatures of ralph montero vice president of alec bradley and alan rubin president and founder of alec bradley after giving an original release date of november 2021 the company announced that the newest addition to the fine rare series would ship approximately six months later than anticipated in april 2022 or rather the two newest additions because instead of a singular release the 2022 incarnation includes two different cigars packaged in the same box each 11 count box contains 10 of the main cigar name fine and rare bc 13 4ev as well as a single cigar named bc 13 4ev b that is packaged in its own coffin that single cigar is included to commemorate the 11th year of fine rare being released but its blend and dimensions have not yet been disclosed my review today concerns the bc 13 4ev a 7 x 50 churchill that is made with a honduran criollo 98 wrapper grown in the trojes region as well as dual binders sourced from honduras and nicaragua and seven different filler tobaccos grown in honduras and nicaragua as is the case with all of the previous releases in the fine and rare line it was rolled at the raíces cubanas factory located in honduras each 11 count box has an msrp of 260 or about 23 64 per cigar and there were a total of 2 500 boxes produced although those boxes were originally supposed to ship in november 2021 the release was pushed back to april 2022 due to supply chain issues before finally shipping a bit early in late march cigar

cigars number of cigars smoked for review 3 the large band is easily the first third i notice when i pick up the alec bradley fine and rare bc 13 4ev but the gorgeous and rustic looking dark chocolate brown wrapper is not far behind that wrapper is parchment dry to the touch but there are some issues with two of the three samples one has a soft spot on the back of cigar between the main band and the foot while the other is rock hard when squeezed with virtually no give whatsoever strong aromas of dry tea leaves and cloves emanate from the wrapper of all three cigars along with much more restrained notes of earth generic wood black pepper and light candy sweetness the foot is similar but more aggressive with cloves tea leaves dark chocolate sweet hay and espresso beans all noticeable after a straight cut the cold draw is full with the same dry tea leaf flavor dominant followed by black pepper baker s spices cloves sweet cedar gritty earth sourdough bread and leather a massive amount of both spice and pepper almost obliterates my palate during the first few puffs of the cigar but both recede quickly almost shockingly quickly leaving behind an intense combination of tea leaves and cloves as the top flavors both of which almost seem to be pulled directly from the aroma and cold draw secondary notes include creamy cedar bitter espresso beans leather tack hay toasted bread and slight soap and there is plenty of spice left on my tongue that does not seem to be going anywhere anytime soon in addition the retrohale features not only plenty of black pepper but also plenty of a toasted marshmallow sweetness that is as distinct as it is enjoyable flavor starts off with a bang at medium plus while both body and strength levels are just under medium in terms of construction the smoke production and burn lines give me no issues with all three cigars although the draw is another matter while two samples feature excellent draws the last one is a bit more tight than i would like everything seems to be clicking for the fine and rare bc 13 4ev as the second third begins the combination of cloves and dry tea leaves easily remain at the top of the profile while flavors of creamy cedar gritty earth leather cocoa nibs almonds and citrus peel follow close behind the retrohale sees some changes with less black pepper and more of the amazing toasted marshmallow sweetness both of which help to bump up the other all complexity of the profile flavor increases to full and the body remains just under medium while the strength has increased enough to hit the solid medium mark unfortunately there are some issues with construction as all three of the samples need a couple of corrections with my lighter but the smoke production and draw presents me with no problems the alec bradley seems like a broken record in the final third but the profile is so enjoyable that i don t really care as as been the case since virtually the first puff flavors of cloves and dry tea leaves easily lead the way with cedar roasted coffee beans hay leather flour and citrus peel all making themselves known at various points in addition the black pepper and marshmallow sweetness more of a raw marshmallow than toasted at this point continue to reign supreme on the retrohale until the end of the cigar flavor ends at full body ends at a solid medium and the strength increases enough in the final third to hit a point firmly between the medium and full marks construction wise the draw and smoke production remain excellent and only one sample needs any attention from my lighter before i put the nubs down with about an inch remaining on each final notes when it was released alec bradley indicated that it was urging tobacconists to sell the box as a single unit and not offer single cigars which is why there is no single cigar msrp being disclosed by the company while i do love the idea of including a single special cigar in a box like this release does it would annoy me as a consumer if i enjoyed that cigar more than the normal release and had to purchase multiple boxes priced at more than 250 just to get more of them contrast the above with a release like the joya de nicaragua dos cientos which included one cigar albeit the same as the rest of the cigars in the box specially wrapped in tissue paper i can appreciate how alec bradley wanted to protect the cigars in transit unfortunately at least in our case the company s efforts were somewhat in vain as the rails glued to the inside of the box used to suspend the cigars had been knocked loose at some point before we opened the box meaning that two of the cigars on the right side of our box were rolling around loose i honestly can t imagine there will be many people referring to this cigar as the fine and rare bc 13 4ev due to its convoluted nature most will most likely use the much easier to remember and pronounce fine and rare 2021 the alec bradley fine rare ten year anniversary set took tenth place in halfwheel s 2020 packaging awards construction was quite impressive on two of the samples including copious smoke production excellent draws after straight cuts and a burn that only needed correcting once my final sample featured a noticeably tighter draw and needed a couple more corrections with its burn and while there were some minor differences the flavor profile of that cigar did not suffer in any major way alec bradley advertises on halfwheel the cigars smoked for this review were purchased by halfwheel final smoking time for all three samples averaged a surprisingly quick one hour and 49 minutes if you are looking to purchase any of the alec bradley fine and rare bc 13 4ev cigars site sponsor corona cigar co has them in stock on its website here 91 overall score if there was one word that kept popping into my mind as i was smoking these cigars it is intense the profile does not lack in flavors and includes notes of cloves dried tea leaves and cedar that combine effortlessly with a massive amount of spice and black pepper mix the latter of which recede a bit as the cigar burns down but never come close to disappearing completely throw in some marvelous toasted marshmallow sweetness on the retrohale which is strong enough to be noticed over the black pepper that is also present which is saying something and you are left with not only a great cigar but also the best fine and rare blend i have smoked in a very long time

the u s government needs foreign soldiers and technology experts to defend the 285 million native born americans who are just too fat drugged out or uneducated to do the job say pro migration lobbyists the national security pitch is a growing part of the lobbying campaign by fortune 500 business groups to import more foreign technology workers for many ordinary professional jobs the groups claim that they need foreign workers to run a new generation of government funded chip making factories amid the rising threats from china their migration legislation is included in the house s america competes act which is now being merged with a senate bill that does not include migration immigration is becoming a national security issue remco zwetsloot from the d c based center for strategic and international studies told a june 1 meeting one of the central lessons of the cold war was that is an advantage rep tom malinowski d nj told washington post columnist josh rogin i just hope we choose the same strategy that won the cold war claimed malinoskwi who wants to accelerate migration by hong kong residents it s offensive for someone to say that americans cannot defend our own nation countered rosemary jenks government relations director at numbersusa we have always had plenty of hardworking patriotic men and women serve in our military she said adding we have prosecutions ongoing of chinese nationals who have stolen our technology why on earth would we put any foreigners in positions where they can do that it s the reason that people don t trust zoom we ve seen chinese cut into calls the underpinnings of are individuals and communities that are healthy accumulating wealth and are contributing to society that s the virtuous circle responded kevin lynn founder of u s tech workers he added the destructive cycle is when we stop investing in american citizens so we re seeing now the degradation of national security because americans are being displaced by foreigners that don t share their obligations to the country the national security theme is being pushed amid the growing gop opposition to the fortune 500 giveaway from such legislators as sen chuck grassley r ia and todd young r in the gop legislators are opposed to the migration giveaway in part because it would allow investors to import foreign workers for ordinary white collar jobs that would otherwise go to midwest professionals and their families section 80303 of the house bill would allow a wide range of foreign graduates to pick up the green cards and to work in a very wide variety of white collar jobs throughout the united states the gateway would open u s jobs for anyone with an ordinary one year master s degree says the house bill in a program of study involving science technology engineering or mathematics from a foreign institution if such degree is the equivalent to a degree issued by a qualified united states research institution the acceptable program of study includes agricultural sciences natural resources and conservation computer and information sciences and support services engineering biological and biomedical sciences mathematics and statistics military technologies physical sciences health professions and related programs or medical residency and fellowship programs or the summary group subsets of accounting and related services and taxation the huge inflow would allow executives at fortune 500 companies and smaller companies to fill career starting professional jobs with grateful lower wage foreign graduates just as farm companies now can easily hire illegal migrants at street corners for stoop labor in the fields many reports show the growing corporate favoritism for foreign tech workers and the continued layoffs of u s professionals the new york post reported on may 31 sixty six tech firms handed out a whopping 16 800 pink slips last month that s more than the 13 600 layoffs across 52 companies during the first four months of 2022 combined and the most employees to get the axe in a single month since may 2020 according to tech jobs tracking site layoffs fyi large tech firms including facebook parent meta and twitter have both frozen hiring altogether for some departments while other companies including microsoft snap uber salesforce instacart and coinbase have slowed hiring the new york post added many investor run tech companies are already dominated by indian born executives and managers google for example is run by an indian former visa worker and it has 8 000 south asians mostly indians working in the company according to a june washington post article about the sector s indian origin caste discrimination the replacement of free speaking american professionals with indentured foreign labor allows executives to discard important civic priorities such as security privacy and durability of high tech infrastructure in favor of lower costs and higher stock prices the resulting damage was exposed by losses at intel boeing and theranos the replacement has continued for so long that a 2021 report by the census bureau showed that a large share of trained technology trained american professionals is not working in tech jobs we have tech workers and software programmers who are delivering pizza which is crazy said jenks the easy access to migrant labor also minimizes the pressure on the government and corporations to train millions of younger americans a may 26 report in politico noted the u s spent just 0 03 percent of its gdp on worker training that s less than a third of what oecd nations spent on average or 0 10 percent meanwhile president joe biden s deputies are quietly expanding the unpopular federal pipeline of cheap and compliant visa workers gop and democratic legislators know about this stealthy replacement of the american professional class said jenks they re aware and they think it is fine they are not unhappy about it because is not being pushed in their faces what is being pushed in their faces is the demands of the employers and if the demands of the employers are met then there s generally money following and that s really all that matters to our political class some of the definitely are malevolent she added i think that there are far too many elites wealthy elites who have complete disdain for the rest of america actual disdain they think that americans are worthless so whatever happens to them they deserve it i don t think they actively plan it i just think they couldn t care less what happens to americans republicans and democrats choose to turn a blind eye because the tech lobbyists all the industries whether they re finance or health care have become reliant on a pipeline of cheap and exploitable foreign labor said lynn but the lobbyists and investors also know their migration demands are deeply unpopular i think it s very hard politically to imagine a standalone bill like this zwetsloot told a meeting on june 1 organized by the american action forum he added which is why i think people are trying to make it part of these bigger bills politically more palatable to who might privately say i actually support these provision i think they re very important but politically it is very hard for me to support something like this but it was part of a broader package i think i can the stealth tactic has long been used by investors who tell congress that they need only a few top tier specialists but then use the migration rules to import many ordinary foreign graduates for entry level jobs through the fortune 500 and their subcontractors for example ex google chief eric schmidt is pushing for the house legislation which would allow easy immigration by foreign holders of master s degrees but in a june 2020 op ed for barron s magazine he argued that the ability to attract and retain top tier talent from around the world is the backbone of a trifecta where the best talent comes to the u s to work at the best institutions on the most cutting edge intellectual property other migration advocates are trying to raise the stakes it s a debate between those who think our openness as a democratic society is an advantage in the struggle with autocracies or a disadvantage malinowski told the post the russian invasion of ukraine and rising cyberattacks have increased concerns over high tech threats to u s national security especially cybersecurity said a june 1 statement by the american action forum a business first advocacy d c group the migration provision in the competes act could provide with enough highly skilled workers to support current stem hiring rates for the next three years said the report which was written by the group s president douglas holtz eakin the lobbyists national security message is also being trumpeted by jeff bezos washington post newspaper the house bill would expand visas for applicants with advanced stem degrees from any country the senate version has none of these provisions washington post columnist josh rogin reported on june 2 republicans excessive fear of immigration should not waste a strategic opportunity for the united states to strengthen itself and weaken its rivals at the same time the military needs foreigners in battlefield foxholes said a may 25 op ed in the washington post by margaret stock an immigration lawyer and democrat according to the centers for disease control and prevention even if they wanted to join 71 percent of young cannot meet military requirements one in four is overweight others either fail to meet the education requirements necessary to serve in a high tech 21st century military or have mental health challenges or a drug abuse or criminal record she continued our lawmakers could boldly address the need for reforms across the u s immigration system from the asylum process to refugee vetting to legalizing agricultural workers and dreamers to make it easier for immigrants to get green cards the demographic challenges and declining number of eligible recruits is a national security threat from within our own borders at a time of global instability a domestic labor shortage and multiple crises facing the usual pool of younger military recruits our leaders must act now with the urgency that this demographic threat demands immigration has made the united states into a superpower tim kane an economist at the hoover institution told a february podcast he added why don t you allow electrical engineers with no criminal background that want to be american there should not be a cap on that in may president joe biden echoed that claim arguing that each generation of immigrants has made our nation stronger and reaffirmed that diversity is and always has been our greatest strength in reality the period of greatest u s relative power came during the 41 years when immigration was minimized between 1924 and 1965 in 1990 one year after the u s won the cold war d c doubled immigration rates to deliver roughly one migrant for every four births that rapid immigration has converted the bi racial united states into a multi ethnic society split by a proliferating variety of competing identity

legislative response advertisement article continues below this ad the letter was paid for by todd maclin a former senior executive at j p morgan chase who now runs the dallas based finance firm

he is still hearing from more conservative gun owners who are feeling a great sense of urgency and a great need to support as he does his best to address these issues maclin said the group is focusing on federal legislation which he believes is the best avenue to passing gun safety laws and ensuring they are applied uniformly across the country he declined to comment on the state response to the

the u s government needs foreign soldiers and technology experts to defend the 285 million native born americans who are just too fat drugged out or uneducated to do the job say pro migration lobbyists the national security pitch is a growing part of the lobbying campaign by fortune 500 business groups to import more foreign technology workers for many ordinary professional jobs the groups claim that they need foreign workers to run a new generation of government funded chip making factories amid the rising threats from china their migration legislation is included in the house s america competes act which is now being merged with a senate bill that does not include migration immigration is becoming a national security issue remco zwetsloot from the d c based center for strategic and international studies told a june 1 meeting one of the central lessons of the cold war was that is an advantage rep tom malinowski d nj told washington post columnist josh rogin i just hope we choose the same strategy that won the cold war claimed malinoskwi who wants to accelerate migration by hong kong residents it s offensive for someone to say that americans cannot defend our own nation countered rosemary jenks government relations director at numbersusa we have always had plenty of hardworking patriotic men and women serve in our military she said adding we have prosecutions ongoing of chinese nationals who have stolen our technology why on earth would we put any foreigners in positions where they can do that it s the reason that people don t trust zoom we ve seen chinese cut into calls the underpinnings of are individuals and communities that are healthy accumulating wealth and are contributing to society that s the virtuous circle responded kevin lynn founder of u s tech workers he added the destructive cycle is when we stop investing in american citizens so we re seeing now the degradation of national security because americans are being displaced by foreigners that don t share their obligations to the country the national security theme is being pushed amid the growing gop opposition to the fortune 500 giveaway from such legislators as sen chuck grassley r ia and todd young r in the gop legislators are opposed to the migration giveaway in part because it would allow investors to import foreign workers for ordinary white collar jobs that would otherwise go to midwest professionals and their families section 80303 of the house bill would allow a wide range of foreign graduates to pick up the green cards and to work in a very wide variety of white collar jobs throughout the united states the gateway would open u s jobs for anyone with an ordinary one year master s degree says the house bill in a program of study involving science technology engineering or mathematics from a foreign institution if such degree is the equivalent to a degree issued by a qualified united states research institution the acceptable program of study includes agricultural sciences natural resources and conservation computer and information sciences and support services engineering biological and biomedical sciences mathematics and statistics military technologies physical sciences health professions and related programs or medical residency and fellowship programs or the summary group subsets of accounting and related services and taxation the huge inflow would allow executives at fortune 500 companies and smaller companies to fill career starting professional jobs with grateful lower wage foreign graduates just as farm companies now can easily hire illegal migrants at street corners for stoop labor in the fields many reports show the growing corporate favoritism for foreign tech workers and the continued layoffs of u s professionals the new york post reported on may 31 sixty six tech firms handed out a whopping 16 800 pink slips last month that s more than the 13 600 layoffs across 52 companies during the first four months of 2022 combined and the most employees to get the axe in a single month since may 2020 according to tech jobs tracking site layoffs fyi large tech firms including facebook parent meta and twitter have both frozen hiring altogether for some departments while other companies including microsoft snap uber salesforce instacart and coinbase have slowed hiring the new york post added many investor run tech companies are already dominated by indian born executives and managers google for example is run by an indian former visa worker and it has 8 000 south asians mostly indians working in the company according to a june washington post article about the sector s indian origin caste discrimination the replacement of free speaking american professionals with indentured foreign labor allows executives to discard important civic priorities such as security privacy and durability of high tech infrastructure in favor of lower costs and higher stock prices the resulting damage was exposed by losses at intel boeing and theranos the replacement has continued for so long that a 2021 report by the census bureau showed that a large share of trained technology trained american professionals is not working in tech jobs we have tech workers and software programmers who are delivering pizza which is crazy said jenks the easy access to migrant labor also minimizes the pressure on the government and corporations to train millions of younger americans a may 26 report in politico noted the u s spent just 0 03 percent of its gdp on worker training that s less than a third of what oecd nations spent on average or 0 10 percent meanwhile president joe biden s deputies are quietly expanding the unpopular federal pipeline of cheap and compliant visa workers gop and democratic legislators know about this stealthy replacement of the american professional class said jenks they re aware and they think it is fine they are not unhappy about it because is not being pushed in their faces what is being pushed in their faces is the demands of the employers and if the demands of the employers are met then there s generally money following and that s really all that matters to our political class some of the definitely are malevolent she added i think that there are far too many elites wealthy elites who have complete disdain for the rest of america actual disdain they think that americans are worthless so whatever happens to them they deserve it i don t think they actively plan it i just think they couldn t care less what happens to americans republicans and democrats choose to turn a blind eye because the tech lobbyists all the industries whether they re finance or health care have become reliant on a pipeline of cheap and exploitable foreign labor said lynn but the lobbyists and investors also know their migration demands are deeply unpopular i think it s very hard politically to imagine a standalone bill like this zwetsloot told a meeting on june 1 organized by the american action forum he added which is why i think people are trying to make it part of these bigger bills politically more palatable to who might privately say i actually support these provision i think they re very important but politically it is very hard for me to support something like this but it was part of a broader package i think i can the stealth tactic has long been used by investors who tell congress that they need only a few top tier specialists but then use the migration rules to import many ordinary foreign graduates for entry level jobs through the fortune 500 and their subcontractors for example ex google chief eric schmidt is pushing for the house legislation which would allow easy immigration by foreign holders of master s degrees but in a june 2020 op ed for barron s magazine he argued that the ability to attract and retain top tier talent from around the world is the backbone of a trifecta where the best talent comes to the u s to work at the best institutions on the most cutting edge intellectual property other migration advocates are trying to raise the stakes it s a debate between those who think our openness as a democratic society is an advantage in the struggle with autocracies or a disadvantage malinowski told the post the russian invasion of ukraine and rising cyberattacks have increased concerns over high tech threats to u s national security especially cybersecurity said a june 1 statement by the american action forum a business first advocacy d c group the migration provision in the competes act could provide with enough highly skilled workers to support current stem hiring rates for the next three years said the report which was written by the group s president douglas holtz eakin the lobbyists national security message is also being trumpeted by jeff bezos washington post newspaper the house bill would expand visas for applicants with advanced stem degrees from any country the senate version has none of these provisions washington post columnist josh rogin reported on june 2 republicans excessive fear of immigration should not waste a strategic opportunity for the united states to strengthen itself and weaken its rivals at the same time the military needs foreigners in battlefield foxholes said a may 25 op ed in the washington post by margaret stock an immigration lawyer and democrat according to the centers for disease control and prevention even if they wanted to join 71 percent of young cannot meet military requirements one in four is overweight others either fail to meet the education requirements necessary to serve in a high tech 21st century military or have mental health challenges or a drug abuse or criminal record she continued our lawmakers could boldly address the need for reforms across the u s immigration system from the asylum process to refugee vetting to legalizing agricultural workers and dreamers to make it easier for immigrants to get green cards the demographic challenges and declining number of eligible recruits is a national security threat from within our own borders at a time of global instability a domestic labor shortage and multiple crises facing the usual pool of younger military recruits our leaders must act now with the urgency that this demographic threat demands immigration has made the united states into a superpower tim kane an economist at the hoover institution told a february podcast he added why don t you allow electrical engineers with no criminal background that want to be american there should not be a cap on that in may president joe biden echoed that claim arguing that each generation of immigrants has made our nation stronger and reaffirmed that diversity is and always has been our greatest strength in reality the period of greatest u s relative power came during the 41 years when immigration was minimized between 1924 and 1965 in 1990 one year after the u s won the cold war d c doubled immigration rates to deliver roughly one migrant for every four births that rapid immigration has converted the bi racial united states into a multi ethnic society split by a proliferating variety of competing identity groups we re trying to become the first multiracial multi ethnic superpower in the world rep rohit khanna d ca told the new york times on march 21 it will be an extraordinary achievement we will

after america s latest mass shooting it s amazing how fast the media found scapegoats to blame rather than assign responsibility to the gun in the troubled young man s hands common sense leads to the conclusion that if there was no gun in the man s hands it s likely that the attacker would have been apprehended before killing so many this latest mass shooting on may 24 by an 18 year old man killed 19 children and two teachers and injured 17 more in a uvalde texas elementary school before this massacre using one of the two ar 15 semi automatic rifles he legally purchased on his 18th birthday the gunman had aimed a non fatal but bloody shot at his grandmother s face in the school officials found 315 rounds of ammunition 142 of which were spent cartridges like the guns the ammunition was purchased legally nine days before this another mass shooting occurred this one in buffalo new york when another 18 year old man killed 10 people in a supermarket 11 black and two white people were shot by bullets fired from an ar 15 style rifle other recent mass shootings in which ar 15 style assault rifles were used include the following feb 14 2018 shooter at stoneman douglas high school in florida killed 17 people oct 1 2017 shooter at las vegas event killed 58 people nov 5 2017 shooter at sutherland springs texas church shooting killed 26 people june 12 2016 the pulse nightclub shooting in orlando florida left 49 dead dec 2 2015 the san bernardino california shooting killed 14 people dec 14 2012 the shooting at sandy hook elementary school in connecticut took 27 lives ar 15 style weapons are offshoots of the m 16 rifles used during the viet nam war like the m 16 the ar 15 is designed to kill people quickly and in large numbers the national rifle association estimates there are some eight million ar 15s and its variations in circulation and says they are so popular that the ar should stand for america s rifle the new york times reported the uvalde and buffalo instances of gun violence are not unusual there have been 213 mass shootings in the united states in the first 21 weeks of 2022 an average of 321 americans are shot every single day and every day there are roughly more than 50 000 gun sales recorded mass shootings were reduced for a decade after president bill clinton signed an assault weapons ban in 1994 after the ban was not renewed in 2004 the number of mass shootings increased the ban did not however prevent the columbine high school massacre in which two students killed twelve students and one teacher in april 1999 story continues we are left wondering what can be done to reduce the number of mass shootings other countries do not have the gun violence that pervades our american culture students shoppers and church goers in other countries do not live in fear being gunned down we need to demand our legislators pass a permanent assault weapons ban that will buy back ar 15 style weapons and bump stocks which can be added to semi automatics to make them behave more like automatic firearms from civilians and that will halt their production importation and sales for all but military and law enforcement uses in response to a mass shooting that killed 35 and wounded 28 people in 1996 australia greatly reduced the number of murders when it instituted a guns buy back program that removed more than 650 000 from use polls show a majority of americans have supported stricter gun laws for decades a politico morning consult poll conducted this week showed overwhelming support among americans for background checks a ban on assault style weapons and other gun restrictions we also need a supreme court decision that restores the meaning of the first half of the second amendment a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed the meaning of the first 13 words was lost after the 2008 supreme court s decision in the district of columbia v heller case by a 5 4 vote the supreme court ignoring the original intent of the amendment interpreted the second amendment to grant individuals the right to possess and use firearms independent of servicing in a well governed militia if our legislators fail to produce the changes that are needed vote for those who will be more responsive to all americans not just to those in their political party or to lobbyists judy parr is a resident of holland this article originally appeared on the holland sentinel my take why america must restore its assault weapons ban

britannica inc patrick o neill riley this article is republished from the conversation under a creative commons license read the original article which was published may 19 2022 the conditions that led to a shortage of baby formula were set in motion long before the february 2022 closure of the similac factory tipped the u s into a crisis retailers nationwide reported supplies of baby formula were out of stock at a rate of 43 during the week ended may 8 2022 compared with less than 5 in the first half of 2021 in some states such as texas and tennessee shortages were over 50 which has prompted parents to travel long distances and pay exorbitant sums of money to grab dwindling supplies of formula for their babies news that the food and drug administration and similac maker abbott have reached a deal to reopen the formula factory in sturgis michigan is welcome news for desperate parents but it will do little to alleviate the shortage anytime soon this is in no small part because of the very nature of america s baby formula industry i research and teach supply chain management with a special focus on the health care industry the closure of the similac factory may have lit the fuse for the nationwide shortage but a combination of government policy industry market concentration and supply chain issues supplied the powder what prompted the baby formula shortage on feb 17 abbott initiated a voluntary recall after four infants were hospitalized with infections from the bacteria cronobacter sakazakii two of them died after consuming baby formula manufactured in their sturgis facility the factory was also shut down the fda has identified no new cases but has not yet approved reopening the sturgis facility which is responsible for about half of abbott s u s supply abbott said it entered into a consent decree with the fda that paves the way to reopening the facility once certain conditions are met shortages of baby formula have led major u s retailers including target cvs walgreens and kroger to restrict the amount of formula a consumer may purchase these shortages are disproportionately hurting low income families and those who do not have the resources to travel long distances to find alternative sources of baby formula government created monopolies the root of the problem begins with a concentration of production two companies abbott and reckitt benckiser which makes enfamil dominate the industry with about 80 of the u s market nestlé which sells baby formula in the u s under its gerber brand controls another 10 part of the reason these companies are so entrenched in their position is that abbott reckitt and nestlé are the only makers approved by the u s government to provide baby formula through the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children known as wic which provides supplemental food to low income families wic which reimburses companies at 15 of the wholesale cost is responsible for 92 of supermarket sales of milk based powder formula in 12 to 16 ounce containers and 51 of all sales in other sizes the federal government provides wic grants to each state which then contracts with one of the three companies while wic is a critical program to feed the most vulnerable government support of this program has the unintended consequence of creating a de facto monopoly in each state the amount of wic funding to these three established companies makes it difficult for any startup to make significant inroads in the baby formula industry there is little chance they can capture the market share necessary to justify a significant investment since only a handful of manufacturing facilities are approved for production of baby formula in the u s startups don t have the volume required to produce in these facilities import restrictions another reason for the intense concentration is import controls about 98 of the formula consumed in the u s is produced domestically whether by a u s or international company while facilities abroad such as those in mexico chile ireland and the netherlands meet the fda s nutrition standards a failure to meet its labeling guidelines prevents them from exporting to the u s as a result some consumers order unapproved formula over the internet from europe and elsewhere which may then be confiscated at the border international manufactures also face high tariffs which can be as high as 17 5 depending on volume that s one reason canadian producers which are subsidized by their government have mostly steered clear of the u s market and the united states mexico canada agreement which came into force in 2020 included a provision that made it even harder for canada to ship baby formula south in an effort to protect domestic producers lean supply chains the pandemic related problems that have beleaguered global supply chains have also played a role like in other industries baby formula makers have long tried to make their supply chains as lean and efficient as possible that means they aimed to minimize the amount of time baby formula spent sitting unprofitably on warehouse shelves and send the goods from factory to retailer as quickly as possible the problem is that when there s a surge in demand or a drop in supply shortages can result the leaner the supply chain the larger the potential disruption the wic program also encourages a lean supply chain because it reimburses just 15 of the wholesale price the huge volume means the companies can still be profitable but the lower margins per sale encourage them to keep a very efficient supply chain in march 2020 formula sales surged as people stockpiled pretty much everything but that led sales to drop as parents worked through all that extra formula that prompted makers to reduce production and now in 2022 demand jumped again especially after reports spread of the similac recall and with demand soaring and supply down significantly because of the sturgis plant s closure shortages were inevitable shortage is far from over both the biden administration and companies have announced a variety of measures to end the shortage some companies such as reckitt say they have stepped up production and are running factories seven days a week to get more formula to stores the fda is expected to soon announce the loosening of import rules for baby formula and some states are allowing wic recipients to use their rebates to buy formula from companies other than the one on the contract abbott has already agreed to honor rebates for competitor products in states where they have wic contracts abbott and nestlé are also speeding up shipments from their fda approved facilities overseas the best way to end the shortage getting the sturgis plant online and its formula on retail shelves will take two months ultimately preventing this kind of situation from happening again will require changes to government policy and business practices i believe the government s de facto monopolies should be opened up to more competition and formula makers may just have to accept a little less profit from supply chain efficiencies as a cost of doing business and as a way to ensure families won t again be faced with the loss of a product so vital to their babies survival written by kevin ketels assistant professor teaching global supply chain

i ve never escaped watergate says john dean as once again he allows the years to melt away the old faces to crowd in and the secret tapes to whirr in his mind there s just no choice i m living in the bubble it s become a fact of life america has never escaped watergate either the biggest political scandal of the 20th century and the only one to cause a presidential resignation has become a byword for lost innocence and lost faith in institutions along with the vietnam war it marked the end of an era in which a president s words were met with automatic trust rather than default scepticism such is the notoriety that the gate suffix has been applied to dozens of controversies from sharpiegate donald trump showing a map altered using a black marker pen to deflategate allegations that tom brady s new england patriots used deflated footballs to partygate british prime minister boris johnson s social gatherings that flouted covid 19 restrictions today the luxury watergate hotel s phone number ends in 1972 the year of the burglary and callers are greeted by a message that begins there s no need to break in as well as recordings of president richard nixon this month s 50th anniversary of the break in is being marked by books exhibitions tv dramas and a four part cnn documentary series watergate blueprint for a scandal narrated by dean himself in it the man who helped bring nixon down draws a direct line from the watergate break in on 17 june 1972 to the insurrection at the us capitol on 6 january 2021 taking stock of a half century that has seen the media fragment the republican party embrace authoritarian tendencies and presidents become less accountable dean has never been more concerned about american democracy than he is now i was never worried about the country and the government during watergate but from the day trump was nominated i had a knot in my stomach and until he left i never got rid of it dean 83 tells the guardian via zoom from a washington hotel he just discovered late in his presidency the enormous powers he does have as president he wants them now he knows he can hurt his enemies and help his friends view image in fullscreen john dean on capitol hill on 10 june 2019 photograph jonathan ernst reuters he adds nixon who was very bright and understood how the government operated and what the levers of power really are was somebody who also could experience shame and accepted the rule of law when the supreme court ruled against him that was it i can t imagine in a similar situation trump complying with a court order from the supreme court saying turn over your tapes dean was working for the justice department when he was recruited to the nixon white house but he soon discovered that john ehrlichman would remain the president s top legal adviser as white house counsel i got the title i didn t get the job dean says wryly it was frankly too good a title at 31 years of age to pass up although i knew i would be doing the grunt work it also did not take dean long to discover that the nixon administration was doing things differently it kept an enemies list it had approved a september 1971 burglary of the office of the psychiatrist of daniel ellsberg the defence analyst who leaked the secret history of the vietnam war known as the pentagon papers dean himself had to intervene to squash an outlandish plan to firebomb the brookings institution a thinktank in washington where classified documents leaked by ellsberg were being stored i did not know that the president had authorised the brookings operation but i thought it was insane whoever had authorised it he says dean was out of the country on the day of the watergate break in but instantly guessed who was behind it five men had been arrested in the bungled operation to bug and steal documents from the democratic national committee headquarters at the watergate office complex a dirty tricks operation aimed at sinking would be challengers to nixon in that year s presidential election at first the incident seemed comically inept and inconsequential but when it emerged in court that the lead burglar james mccord had worked for the cia journalists such as bob woodward and carl bernstein of the washington post sprang into action gradually they and others would trace a complex web that connected operatives known as the plumbers to the committee to re elect the president creep to senior white house officials and finally to nixon himself but it was not until after the president won re election in november 1972 that dean felt himself sucked into the cover up arranging hush money for the watergate burglars he recalls colson brings a recording he s made of howard hunt who was one of the managers of the burglars and hunt wants to be paid and if he doesn t get paid people are going to start talking i knew enough of the criminal law to know this is either extortion or bribery now my reaction is kind of interesting i had just gotten married and i said holy cow we re in trouble so i decided then i ve got to make the cover up work and that s when i dove in with both feet it was foolish he adds it s only later when hunt starts extorting me personally for money that i said the same thing s going to happen to everybody it s going to follow us the rest of our lives there ll be no end to it and nixon has got to get out in front of it and we all have got to stand up and account for the mistakes we ve made dean went to see nixon in an effort to convince him that the cover up would destroy his presidency in later testimony to congress dean explained i began by telling the president that there was a cancer growing on the presidency and that if the cancer was not removed that the president himself would be killed by it dean has since been able to listen back to the conversation thanks to nixon s secret recording system at the white house the quality of the tapes in general is just awful but i m sitting right over one of the little microphones that had been bored into the desk so my voice is crystal clear i can actually hear myself sigh at times exasperated with the reaction i m getting what surprised me most is spent a lot of time conspicuously trying to impress me john dean i took him through every problem he had and to my amazement he had an answer for everything i thought was a problem i can hear my frustration with this man and i m waiting for his fist to come down on the desk finally at the end when it s clear he is going to do nothing i say well mr president people are going to go to jail for this he says like who to bring it home i say like me so he knows his white house counsel thinks he s on his way to jail i hope that will turn him but all it does is turn him against me because now i m radioactive what were dean s impressions of nixon the man he wasn t who i thought he was he clearly wanted to engage in criminal behaviour and he would blame everybody but himself what surprised me most is he spent a lot of time conspicuously trying to impress me on one occasion dean recounts nixon told him that he was reading a book about president john s f kennedy s ruthless streak i ve often thought he did that to impress upon me that all presidents are ruthless to a degree because i m the one who had blown up the the plan to firebomb the brookings institution he knew that and he was worried maybe i thought presidents shouldn t do things like that he was trying to do a little tutorial on me view image in fullscreen richard nixon he wasn t who i thought he was says dean photograph everett collection historical alamy wary that he would be turned into a scapegoat dean began cooperating with senate investigators at the end of april 1973 with the walls closing in nixon aides hr haldeman and ehrlichman resigned and dean himself was forced out he then publicly turned against nixon by testifying to the senate watergate committee becoming the first white house official to accuse the president of being directly involved in the cover up the blockbuster hearing in june was watched by millions on television but first dean got a haircut it was a barber i had never been to and it was last minute i had done an interview with walter cronkite and my hair was curling over my shoulders i said that is just not a good look i d better get that neck cleaned up or my mother will be all over me in the barbershop he just put a bowl on my head and cut it so it was much shorter than people were used to oh he s changing his image the same thing with the glasses i had actually scratched my cornea i had worn contacts during the cronkite interview and noticed i was just blinking madly i have never really worn contacts since i had that experience dean read from a mammoth prepared statement that took almost the entire first day if i had been told in advance i was going to have to read it all it would not have been 60 000 words it may have been 6 000 at max but it s much easier to write a long statement than it is a short one so i just let it flow it took eight hours to read it later that year dean pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice was disbarred and served four months he was in the witness protection programme so never went to prison meanwhile alexander butterfield nixon s deputy chief of staff had testified that there was a recording system in the white house the supreme court ordered the release of a smoking gun tape confirming dean s claim that nixon told aides to order the cia to shut down the fbi investigation into the burglary nixon lost the confidence of fellow republicans and facing impeachment resigned in august 1974 the president gave a final victory sign on the south lawn before a helicopter spirited him away dean who happened to have his molars removed that day cannot recall any particular emotion i didn t feel vindication or anything of that nature we d been at battle it s very lucky that the system worked as it was designed he continues it s very hard to look at watergate without looking through the lens of trump where it didn t work or hasn t yet it s not over if trump gets through with zero accountability then the system is deeply flawed and a lot of that is probably traceable to the ford pardon when president gerald ford granted nixon a full pardon in september 1974 bernstein exclaimed to woodward you re not gonna believe it the son of a bitch pardoned the son of a bitch woodward has more recently praised ford s act as one of courage dean s initial reaction was different at the time i thought it was right and it was understandable because i knew he couldn t govern with watergate hanging over him every day would be a new decision as to what he does and doesn t turn over from the nixon archive it would have consumed his presidency but so i understood it but in the long run it codified the memo that was prepared then re prepared during the clinton presidency that a sitting president can t be indicted well a post president can t be indicted when he s pardoned it s very hard to look at watergate without looking through the lens of trump where it didn t work or hasn t yet john dean dean went into business for a while and tried to leave watergate behind but a 1991 book that alleged he and his wife maureen masterminded the cover up prompted him to take legal action this led to years of research immersing himself in the tapes and making peace with the subject he has written several books including two about watergate and teaches a watergate related course for lawyers he has also been called upon by the media and congress to provide expert analysis during scandals in the clinton and trump administrations now a grandfather living in beverly hills california he quips my speciality i guess is presidents in deep trouble but if something like watergate happened in the 2020s he does not believe it would necessarily bring down a president again it would be very different today primarily because of fox news which would be mounting a fulsome defence of him we are far more polarised today than we were we were polarised during watergate but not to the degree we are today dean will be watching this week s january 6 hearings on capitol hill intently but reckons that republicans at least face less accountability than they once did trump is a poster boy for authoritarianism and the authoritarian followers just fell in line they just absolutely did what authoritarian followers do click their heels salute yes sir that leaves him fearing for the future of american democracy not so much trump but now the whole republican party has shifted into this authoritarian stance not all the republicans i know are that way but too many of them now think authoritarianism is just dandy because it works it s efficient well mussolini ran the trains on time didn t he but at some expense
early in joe biden s presidency felicia wong president of the liberal roosevelt institute told me that biden was badly misunderstood he s been in national politics for decades and so people look at him and default to a kind of old understanding of what democrats stand for this idea that democrats are tax and spend liberals wong thought he wanted more what biden is trying to push is much more about actually remaking our economy so that it does different things and it actually regularly produces different outcomes i think wong is right about what biden or at least the biden administration wanted but its execution has lagged its vision and the reason for this is uncomfortable for democrats you can t transform the economy without first transforming the government in april brian deese director of biden s national economic council gave an important speech on the need for a modern american industrial strategy this was a salvo in a debate most americans would probably be puzzled to know democrats are having industrial strategy is the idea that a country should chart a path to productive capacity beyond what the market would on its own support it is the belief that there should be some politics in our economics some vision of what we are trying to make beyond what financial markets reward trying to build clean energy infrastructure is a form of industrial strategy so is investing in domestic supply chains for vaccines and masks and microchips for decades the idea has been disreputable even among democrats you don t want government picking winners and losers as the adage goes the argument is this when governments bet on technologies or companies they typically bet wrong markets are more efficient more adaptable less corrupt and so governments should where possible get out of the market s way the government s proper role is after the market has done its work shifting money from those who have it to those who need it put simply markets create governments tax and politicians spend it s remarkable the assumptions that lurk beneath what s taken for common sense in washington consider the phrase winners and losers winners at what losers how markets manage such questions through profits and losses valuations and bankruptcies but societies have richer more complex goals to criticize markets for failing to achieve them is like berating a toaster because it never produces an oil painting that s not its job so i won t say markets failed we failed growth slowed inequality widened the climate crisis kept getting worse deindustrialization wrecked communities the pandemic proved america s supply chains fragile china became more authoritarian rather than more democratic and then vladimir putin s war revealed the folly of relying on countries we cannot trust for goods we desperately need no one considers this success deese in his speech to the economic club of new york declared the debate over the question should move from why should we pursue an industrial strategy to how do we pursue one successfully i am sympathetic to this vision in a series of columns over the last year i ve argued that we need a liberalism that builds scratch the failures of modern democratic governance particularly in blue states and you ll typically find that the market didn t provide what we needed and government either didn t step in or made the problem worse through neglect or over regulation we need to build more houses trains clean energy research centers disease surveillance and do it faster and cheaper at the national level much can be blamed on republican obstruction and the filibuster but that s not always true in new york or california or oregon it is too slow and too costly to build even where republicans are weak perhaps especially where they are weak this is where the liberal vision too often averts its gaze if anything the critiques made of public action a generation ago have more force today do we have a government capable of building the answer too often is no what we have is a government that is extremely good at making building difficult the first step is admitting you have a problem and deese did exactly that a modern american industrial strategy needs to demonstrate that america can build fast as we ve done before and fairly as we ve sometimes failed to do he said one answer the typical republican answer is that government can t do the job and shouldn t try but the data doesn t bear that out the transit costs project tracks the price tags on rail projects in different countries it s hard to get an apples to apples comparison here because different projects are well different and it matters whether they include say a tunnel which is expensive for obvious reasons even so the united states is notable for how much we spend and how little we get it costs about 538 million to build 1 kilometer of rail here germany builds 1 kilometer of rail for 287 million canada gets it done for 254 million japan clocks in at 170 million spain is the cheapest country in the database at 80 million all those countries build more tunnels than we do perhaps because they retain the confidence to regularly try the better you are at building infrastructure the more ambitious you can be when imagining infrastructure to build the problem isn t government it s our government nor is the problem unions another favored bugaboo of the right union density is higher in all those countries than it is in the united states so what has gone wrong here one answer worth wrestling with is offered by brink lindsey director of the open society project at the niskanen center in a 2021 paper titled state capacity what is it how we lost it and how to get it back lindsey s definition is admirably terse state capacity is the ability to design and execute policy effectively he told me when a government can t collect the taxes it s owed or build the sign up portal to its new health insurance plan or construct the high speed rail it s already spent billions of dollars on that s a failure of state capacity but a weak government is often an end not an accident lindsey s argument is that to fix state capacity in america we need to see that the hobbled state we have is a choice and there are reasons it was chosen government isn t intrinsically inefficient it has been made inefficient and not just by the right what is needed most is a change in ideas a reversal of those intellectual trends of the past 50 years or so that have brought us to the current pass on the right this means abandoning the knee jerk anti statism of recent decades embracing the legitimacy of a large complex welfare and regulatory state and recognizing the vital role played by the nation s public servants not just the police and military on the left it means reconsidering the decentralized legalistic model of governance that has guided progressive led state expansion since the 1960s reducing the veto power that activist groups exercise in the courts and shifting the focus of policy design from ensuring that power is subject to progressive checks to ensuring that power can actually be exercised effectively the biden administration can t do much about the right s hostility to government but it can confront the mistakes and divisions on the left a place to start is offered in another niskanen paper this one by nicholas bagley a law professor at the university of michigan in the procedure fetish bagley argues that liberal governance has developed a puzzling preference for legitimating government action through processes rather than outcomes he suggests provocatively that that s because american politics in general and the democratic party in particular is dominated by lawyers joe biden and kamala harris hold law degrees as did barack obama and john kerry and bill and hillary clinton before them and this filters down through the party lawyers not managers have assumed primary responsibility for shaping administrative law in the united states bagley writes and if all you ve got is a lawyer everything looks like a procedural problem this is a way that america differs from peer countries robert kagan a law professor at the university of california berkeley has called this adversarial legalism and shown that it s a distinctively american way of checking state power bagley builds on this argument inflexible procedural rules are a hallmark of the american state he writes the ubiquity of court challenges the artificial rigors of notice and comment rule making zealous environmental review pre enforcement review of agency rules picayune legal rules governing hiring and procurement nationwide court injunctions the list goes on and on the justification for these policies is that they make state action more legitimate by ensuring that dissenting voices are heard but they also over time render government ineffective and that cost is rarely weighed this gets to bagley s ultimate and in my view wisest point legitimacy is not solely not even primarily a product of the procedures that agencies follow he says legitimacy arises more generally from the perception that government is capable informed prompt responsive and fair that is what we ve lost in fact not just in perception i ve spent most of my adult life trawling think tank reports to better understand how to solve problems when i go looking for ideas on how to build state capacity on the left i don t find much there s nothing like the depth of research thought and energy that goes into imagining health and climate and education policy but those health climate and education plans depend crucially on a state capable of designing and executing policy effectively this is true at the federal level and is even truer and harder at the state and local level so this is what i have become certain of democrats spend too much time and energy imagining the policies that a capable government could execute and not nearly enough time imagining how to make a government capable of executing them it is not only markets that have failed

prestonrose farm and brewing co is now able to make more beer than ever before the paris based organic farm which also operates a brewery and restaurant recently added a three barrel system and began producing its first beer with it over the weekend the decision to expand beer production started over a year ago in march 2021 explained co owner liz preston and it came with a raft of challenges including supply chain snafus which seem to be hindering nearly every industry they told us it was in stock when we ordered it preston explained about the new system and it was in stock only in china the new system triples the small brewery s production and is an upgrade from the one barrel system preston began with about seven years ago room had to be made for the new gear since the old system used to share space with the kitchen now the new system has taken over the kitchen area while the operation brought in a food truck to make meals as well as snacks and finger food served to customers liz preston along with her husband mike who goes by preston began the organic vegetable farm in 2013 which now includes the brewery a taproom and a farm to table restaurant operation open at various times during the week they also recently added a 1 500 square foot four season enclosed porch to accommodate additional sheltered seating arkansas craft brewers produced 38 066 barrels of beer in 2020 down nearly 7 from 2019 s record production of 40 819 barrels according to information provided by the alcoholic beverage control division of the arkansas department of finance and administration beer production jumped 16 in 2019 when compared with the year before a barrel of beer contains 31 gallons the arkansas brewers guild has 41 member breweries plus seven guild member breweries in the planning stages there are at least seven non guild member breweries operating currently according to the organization bart watson chief economist for the brewers association a nonprofit trade group supporting small and craft brewing said the nation s breweries are recovering from the economic impacts of the covid 19 pandemic despite dealing with high prices brought by inflation and challenges of supply chain snarls he said in general smaller breweries are bouncing back the strongest but it s related to the fact they were the hardest hit by the pandemic we ve definitely seen some smaller breweries who found traction in the market for their distributed beer make investments to keep those sales going that said others have been more content going back to their previous model a lot of this variation can probably be explained by local market conditions which is why there isn t a clear national trend watson said in response to email questions tony guinn is the co owner of gravity brewworks in big flat in baxter county and the president of the arkansas brewers guild she said the state s breweries like those nationwide are suffering from higher costs across the board to produce beer and many are considering raising their prices to keep up guinn said while a few breweries like prestonrose are looking at increasing their capacity to make beer more are exploring options to package and distribute their product liz preston said customers are slowly finding their way back to prestonrose after the covid pandemic hammered breweries and restaurants across the state she said it s been a little more difficult to remind patrons they re back open and ready to serve them because of their rural location so she s been keeping her social media channels full of goings on and new offerings at the brewery to keep people s interest up liz preston said the memorial day weekend was busy and she s hopeful the momentum will continue to grow with the addition of the new brewery system plans are to offer more beers on tap locally and throughout the state she said once production begins in earnest she expects to be delivering kegs to restaurants and bars throughout the state the size of our old system limited us liz preston said now we can expand our footprint

just_super e via getty images investment thesis ii vi incorporated iivi has aggressively expanded its leadership position in its most relevant markets while maintaining a relatively healthy balance sheet and securing its market share in secular growth trends the company is anticipated to close the acquisition of coherent in the short term as it waits for the chinese antitrust regulator to give its consent ii vi has an outstanding growth potential in its end markets such as communication with the adoption of 5g and increasingly demanding technology in data centers in the automotive industry with the emergence of self driving cars and electric vehicles or in the consumer electronics market with augmented and virtual reality applications as well as 3d sensing the company is investing 1b over the next 10 years in the next generation semiconductor material that can significantly reduce power losses and enable higher power density voltages temperatures and frequencies while reducing heat dissipation and necessary size of the components a relatively high short interest has built up over the past years with bets against the companyâ s ability to achieve its targets instead the company has consistently delivered strong results and is successfully integrating the recent acquisitions the actual share price has a remarkable upside potential of 44 with a price target of 89 73 a quick look at ii vi ii vi is an american company that operates in the electronic components industry and develops manufactures and markets optoelectronic components engineered materials and devices worldwide its business is divided in two segments photonic solutions and compound semiconductors the photonic solutions segment offers optics lasers optoelectronic modules transceivers advanced components for telecom networks and data centers wavelength selective switches and crystal materials the compound semiconductors segment provides optical electro optical and infrared optical components and materials used in high power co2 lasers fiber lasers and direct diode lasers high precision optical assemblies semiconductor lasers and detectors for optical interconnects and sensing applications engineered materials for thermoelectric ceramics and silicon carbide sic applications as well as compound semiconductor epitaxial wafers for applications in optical and wireless communication it serves customers in the communication industrial aerospace and defense semiconductor capital equipment life sciences consumer electronics and automotive markets the company was founded in 1971 is headquartered in saxonburg pennsylvania and employs over 22 000 employees in over 18 countries its most important geographical region is north america followed by hong kong china germany and japan author the company saw its revenue growing in its most important geographic regions over the past 5 years recording a growth of 33 70 compound annual growth rate cagr with sales in the us growing at 61 82 cagr author on november 9 2018 ii vi announced the acquisition of finisar corporation in a deal valued at 3 2b finalizing the takeover by september 24 2019 and forming a global leader in the highly growing markets of 5g 3d sensing cloud computing electric and autonomous vehicles and advanced microelectronics manufacturing the deal allowed ii vi to aggressively expand its capacities in the 3d sensing market especially in the production of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers vcsels for use in 3d sensing applications like facial security scanning used in smartphones and other devices apple awarded ii vi with 410m in may 2021 after the company already received funding of 390m from appleâ s advanced manufacturing fund in 2017 an important aspect to consider in the change in sourcing for apple and its face id and time of flight tof light detection and ranging lidar technology on march 25 2021 the company announced the acquisition of coherent nasdaq nyse cohr a global leading provider of lasers laser based technologies and laser based system solutions in a deal valued at approximately 6 88b the deal has yet to be accepted by the chinese antitrust regulator who delayed the decision because of insufficient remedies on the market ii vi expects the combined company to have annual revenues of approximately 4 1b initially with a combined addressable market of approximately 25b projected 250m of run rate cost synergies achieved within the 36 months after the deal closing and that the deal will be accretive to non gaap earnings per share in the second year following close although the companyâ s balance sheet will significantly be impacted by the acquisition of coherent ii vi projects a rapid deleveraging in the two years after the closing from strong ebitda and cash flow generation of the combined company an insight into the industry it is quite difficult to compare ii vi to direct competitors or similar peers since the company operates in many fields and offers such a large spectrum of products the company reported an increasing gross margin accelerating from 26 86 cagr over the past 5 years to 34 76 cagr over the past 3 years and standing at 39 40 trailing twelve months ttm while its actual gross margin is below the average of the analyzed peers itâ s important to note that none of them had such significant growth over the past 3 5 years and some even saw their gross margin decelerating in terms of operating profitability ii vi reported a significant improvement of 28 41 cagr over the past 5 years growing to 40 49 cagr over the past 3 years and standing at 12 73 ttm although some of its peers reported a higher profitability in the last 12 months ii vi recorded the greatest acceleration of its operating margin over the last 3 years author in terms of capital allocation efficiency the company could not achieve the high performance of some of its peers with only ams osram otcpk amssy or otcpk aukuf reporting even lower metrics ii vi reported a return on invested capital roic of 8 16 in the past 12 months while the peersâ average stood at 14 77 i consider this metric to be a very important element when pondering an investment decision a company must be able to consistently create value to be a sustainable investment companies such as lumentum nasdaq lite or ipg photonics nasdaq ipgp which reported a significant negative net debt could increase their capital allocation by investing their cash positions coherent being more efficient in those terms once the two companies are fully integrated the capital allocation efficiency could potentially increase as a consequence of the mentioned cost synergies and a better capital management in my article ams osram is a victim of its success i give more details on this company which is still in the process of integrating the osram acquisition a step i personally criticized as the timing and the conditions at which that takeover was executed was quite inappropriate and led to a significant value destruction for amsâ shareholders investments in research and development r d are of primary importance for companies in the semiconductor and electronic components industry and ii vi is spending a relatively fair amount of 11 27 when compared to the average of its competitors slightly increasing its spending from about 10 39 on average in the past 6 years the company reported relatively high leverage of 3 36 a metric which will significantly increase with the takeover of coherent but as mentioned before the combined company will likely be able to reduce its debt exposure in the two following years with a target of 2 5 gross leverage considering the stock performance of the past 5 years ii vi performed better than most of the analyzed peers with only broadcom nasdaq avgo performing even better without surprise ams osram is the worst performer of the group while coherent underperformed the group for a considerable time author using seeking alpha ii vi underperformed significantly the first trust nasdaq semiconductor etf nasdaq ftxl in the last two years while showing some sporadic periods of relative strength when compared to the s p500 instead the company greatly outperformed the index author using seeking alpha all relevant end markets of the company are anticipated to expand at a sustained rate over the next few years and the company announced its intention to invest 1b over the next 10 years in the sic segment which is projected to grow at 50 cagr between 2020 and 2030 the investments are aimed to position the company as a vertically integrated sic power electronics technology leader offering high power and high frequency semiconductor modules and devices that operate well beyond the capabilities of either silicon or gallium arsenide devices the company already reported strong growth from revenue of sic products in q2 2022 with 11 growth both sequentially and on a year over year yoy basis confirming this trend in its q3 where the company reported 13 yoy growth in its industrial segment fueled by its sic solutions valuation to determine the actual fair value for ii viâ s stock price i rely on the following discounted cash flow dcf model which extends over a forecast period of 5 years with 3 different sets of assumptions ranging from a more conservative to a more optimistic scenario based on the metrics determining the weighted average cost of capital wacc and the terminal value as forecasted by the street consensus the company is anticipated to generate consistent solid 16 11 free cash flow fcf cagr over the coming 5 years while its revenue is forecasted to grow slower at 8 59 cagr considering the previously discussed growth in its most relevant end markets and pondering those estimations with the companyâ s average revenue share by end market gives an average growth rate of 11 45 cagr through 2026 that underscores the rather cautious forecast in this dcf modeling author using data from s p capital iq the valuation takes into account a tighter monetary policy which will undeniably be a reality in many economies worldwide in the coming years and lead to a higher weighted average cost of capital author i compute my opinion in terms of likelihood for the three different scenarios and i therefore consider the stock to be considerably undervalued with a weighted average price target with 44 upside potential at 89 73 risk discussion the pending acquisition of coherent is facing a delay mostly due to the chinese regulatorâ s reluctance to give its consent however the two companies are reportedly implementing specific market remedies which could possibly satisfy the chinese antitrust regulatorâ s requests and the deal could be approved in the coming weeks the transaction also bears risks in terms of integration of coherent and the successful achievement of ii vi expected targets ii vi sales are diversified in many industries and the company is targeting strong secular growth vectors with advanced r d and production capacity with the recent acquisitions and the companyâ s strategy to focus on vertical integration in the production of relevant technologies ii vi has created a robust moat and is characterized by a relatively low risk profile in its business as we will see in the next section this risk mitigation is also evidenced in the recent stock performance and serves as strong support for the downside risk market timing the stock reached its all time high ath at 100 44 on february 11 2021 after a long rally since the covid 19 pandemic low at 19 on march 12 2020 the stock successively had a period in which it underperformed the nasdaq composite by retracing until 54 35 and since then showing significant relative strength while many companies in the technology sector lost massively in value from a technical analysis point of view the stock is now in a side movement between 75 and 55 56 on the lower end a great setup for momentum and swing traders the market is waiting for further positive catalysts while the strong moat and the potential offered through the recent acquisitions give the stock a strong support reducing the risk of further losses author using tradingview ii vi can count on significant institutional support among its shareholders with 98 76 of the outstanding shares owned by institutions and a relatively high short interest of 19 88 and over 15 days to cover the street consensus given by 16 analysts prices the share on average at 83 88 with a buy rating with the lowest estimation at 65 and the highest at 121 the seeking alpha quant rating instead qualifies the stock consistently as a hold position in my opinion the stock has shown to be less affected by the recent market turmoil and has formed a quite strong bottom however the upside is limited by a very strong resistance level at 75 which is likely also close to the breakeven for many short sellers who are probably betting on the failure of the coherent acquisition or on a similar scenario as happened to ams osram in the past years when the company lost significant revenue from its main customer apple nasdaq aapl and as i explained in this article itâ s very likely that ii vi gained the supplier slot in appleâ s 3d sensing technology technically the stock is in my opinion in a comfortable setup for both long term investors as well as more short term traders which can set their stop loss in order to limit the downside risk to break out of its lateral channel the stock will need a major positive catalyst or a consistently positive trend in the general market the bottom line investing in a technology company can be associated with a higher risk profile and not all companies in this sector have a strong moat as ii vi has built over the past years the company has an undeniably large offering of high demand products and technologies with strong r d and production capacities and cost advantages given by its focus on a vertical integrated structure although the past few years were challenging in terms of consolidating important acquisitions ii vi has until now achieved its aggressive expansion strategy and is forming an outstanding market leader in crucial future oriented technologies and materials given the relatively low downside risk and the massive potential in both market opportunities and stock price gains i value the stock as a buy with 44 upside potential and a price target seen at 89 73
new research using ancient dna is rewriting the genetic history of two ancient peoples the hindus and the jews and it shows that their two religious civilizations are the result of multiple ancient ethnic migrations into the land of india in the case of the hindus and into diaspora jewish communities in the case of the jewish people first the hindus according to tony joseph author of early indians hindu nationalists believe the source of the indian civilization was a group of people who called themselves aryans a nomadic tribe of horse riding cattle rearing warriors and herders who composed hinduism s oldest religious texts the vedas aryans they argue originated within the land of india spreading themselves and their family of indo european languages across large parts of asia and europe west aryan types of eastern and northern europe in the image georgians ossette albanian woman of iceland russian woman of rjasan roumanian woman poles of radom public domain the out of india thesis many indian scholars question the out of india thesis arguing that indo european language speakers or aryans were just one of many streams of prehistoric migrants who came into india after the decline of the much earlier harappan or indus valley civilization which thrived in the current area of north western india and pakistan around the same time as the early egyptians and mesopotamians illustration said to depict an indo aryan person no known copyright hindu right wingers believe the harappan civilization was also an aryan or vedic civilization but none of their languages have been deciphered so no one knows what language they spoke now studies using ancient dna are rewriting world history and there have been many fascinating discoveries especially for hindu and jewish peoples the most recent study on this subject led by geneticist david reich of harvard university who had also studied the genetic evolution of the jewish people was published in march 2018 and co authored by 92 scholars from all over the world many of them leading names in disciplines as diverse as genetics history archaeology and anthropology the study showed that in the last 8 000 years there were two major migrations into and not out of india the first one originated from the zagros region in south western iran which has the world s first evidence for goat domestication and brought agriculturists most likely herders to india this would have been between 6 000 and 3 000 bc these zagrosian herders mixed with the earlier inhabitants of the subcontinent the first indians descendants of the out of africa ooa migrants who had reached india around 65 000 years ago and together they created the harappan civilization diorama of everyday life in indus valley civilization national science centre delhi india biswarup ganguly cc by 3 0 in the centuries after 2000 bc came the second set of immigrants the aryans from the eurasian steppe lands probably from kazakhstan who brought with them an early version of sanskrit mastery over horses and new cultural and religious practices all of which formed the basis of early hindu vedic culture a genetic indian pizza a thousand years earlier these aryan peoples from the eurasian steppe lands had moved into europe mixing with agriculturists there and spreading indo european languages into europe other genetic studies have brought to light more migrations into india such as that of the speakers of austro asiatic languages who came from south eastern asia thus india s population is made up of a number of different layers added at different times as tony joseph writes in his book early indians the indian population is like a pizza with the first indians forming its base though the base is thin in some places and thicker in others studies show that 50 to 65 of the genetic ancestry of almost all indians derives from the first indians mohenjo daro is an ancient indus valley civilization city built around 2500 bc suronin adobe stock on top of the base comes the sauce the harappans then come the various toppings and the cheese the austro asiatic tibeto burman and indo european language speakers or aryans all of whom found their way into the subcontinent later hindu nationalists will not admit that the aryans were not the first inhabitants of india and that the harappan civilization existed long before their arrival for it would mean acknowledging that aryans or their vedic culture were not the singular fountainhead of indian civilization the idea of the mixing of different population groups is even more unappealing to orthodox hindus and hindu nationalists as they put a premium on racial purity plus the migration theory puts aryans on the same footing as latter day muslim conquerors of india such as the mughals miniature painting by bitchitr from around 1630 now at the chester beatty library dublin it depicts three of the most important emperors of the mughal period akbar is in the center his son jahangir is to his right and his grandson shah jahan is to his left the painting was commissioned by shah jahan the builder of the taj mahal nathan hughes hamilton cc by 2 0 unity in diversity some hindu nationalists demand that the harappan civilization be renamed the saraswati river civilization since the saraswati is mentioned in the rig veda such a renaming would serve to emphasize the link between harappan civilization and the aryans however tony joseph says the real message that the new research carries is an exciting and hopeful one that indians have created a long lasting civilization from a variety of heredities and histories the genius of the indian civilization during its best periods has been inclusion not exclusion unity in diversity is indeed the central theme of india s genetic make up youth wearing assamese traditional costumes diganta talukdar cc by 4 0 this is one example of a physically diverse group of people in india a biological basis for jewishness now to the jewish people i would say that the same thing can also be said for the jewish people in the 2500 years since the babylonian exile after all are all present day jews really the biological descendants of the jews who inhabited the land of israel 3 000 years ago yes and no a new genetic analysis supports the historical record of middle eastern jews settling in north africa during classical antiquity actively proselytizing and marrying local populations and in the process forming distinct populations that later stayed largely intact for over 1500 years yemenite jew blowing shofar 1947 public domain the study was published online august 6 2012 in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences our new findings define north african jews and enhance the case for a biological basis for jewishness said study leader harry ostrer m d professor of pathology genetics and pediatrics at albert einstein college of medicine of yeshiva university however as anyone who has been to present day israel knows jews come in many shades and looks this is because even in the diaspora and even against the will of the ruling religious authorities jews have quietly welcomed converts into the jewish community even against the formal rules of medieval rabbis that is why most jews in different geographical locations tend to look similar to the local majority after several generations ashkenazi jews praying in the synagogue on yom kippur 1878 painting by maurycy gottlieb public domain the rabbinical rule that one should not refer to any jew s convert status is evidence of the desire of jewish leaders to keep proselytizing activities secret from the non jewish ruling religious authorities in a previous genetic analysis the researchers showed that modern day sephardic greek and turkish ashkenazi eastern european and mizrahi iranian iraqi and syrian jews that originated in europe and the middle east are more related to each other than to their contemporary non jewish neighbors with each group forming its own cluster within the larger jewish population further each of the four geographical groups genes demonstrated middle eastern ancestry plus varying degrees of inclusion of converts to judaism from the surrounding populations this is true even though two of the major jewish populations middle eastern and european jews were found to have diverged from each other approximately 2 500 years ago the current study which extended the analysis to north african jews the second largest jewish diaspora group found that they also were more related to each other than to their contemporary non jewish north african neighbors sephardi jew from algeria circa 1890 public domain inclusion not exclusion the current study also included members of jewish communities in ethiopia yemen and georgia in all the researchers analyzed the genetic make up of 509 jews from 15 populations along with genetic data on 114 individuals from seven north african non jewish populations north african jews exhibited a high degree of endogamy or marriage within their own religious group in accordance with jewish custom ethiopian and yemenite jewish populations also formed distinctive genetically linked clusters as did georgian jews so i would also say that the real message that the new genetic research carries is an exciting and hopeful one that jews have created a long lasting civilization from a variety of ethnic and racial heredities and national histories the genius of the jewish civilization during its best periods has been inclusion not exclusion unity in diversity is the central theme of the jewish people s genetic historical make up jewish festival in tetuan alfred dehodencq 1865 paris museum of jewish art and history public domain while the inhabitants of the indian sub continent like those of china have always outnumbered their conquerors and thus been able to absorb them the jewish diaspora has always been a small minority so opposition to outreach may have been a wise precaution then but it is very counter productive now when jews are a majority in israel orthodox unwillingness to increase the number of non orthodox jews

columns judy parr holland after america s latest mass shooting it s amazing how fast the media found scapegoats to blame rather than assign responsibility to the gun in the troubled young man s hands common sense leads to the conclusion that if there was no gun in the man s hands it s likely that the attacker would have been apprehended before killing so many this latest mass shooting on may 24 by an 18 year old man killed 19 children and two teachers and injured 17 more in a uvalde texas elementary school before this massacre using one of the two ar 15 semi automatic rifles he legally purchased on his 18th birthday the gunman had aimed a non fatal but bloody shot at his grandmother s face in the school officials found 315 rounds of ammunition 142 of which were spent cartridges like the guns the ammunition was purchased legally nine days before this another mass shooting occurred this one in buffalo new york when another 18 year old man killed 10 people in a supermarket 11 black and two white people were shot by bullets fired from an ar 15 style rifle other recent mass shootings in which ar 15 style assault rifles were used include the following feb 14 2018 shooter at stoneman douglas high school in florida killed 17 people oct 1 2017 shooter at las vegas event killed 58 people nov 5 2017 shooter at sutherland springs texas church shooting killed 26 people june 12 2016 the pulse nightclub shooting in orlando florida left 49 dead dec 2 2015 the san bernardino california shooting killed 14 people dec 14 2012 the shooting at sandy hook elementary school in connecticut took 27 lives ar 15 style weapons are offshoots of the m 16 rifles used during the viet nam war like the m 16 the ar 15 is designed to kill people quickly and in large numbers the national rifle association estimates there are some eight million ar 15s and its variations in circulation and says they are so popular that the ar should stand for america s rifle the new york times reported the uvalde and buffalo instances of gun violence are not unusual there have been 213 mass shootings in the united states in the first 21 weeks of 2022 an average of 321 americans are shot every single day and every day there are roughly more than 50 000 gun sales recorded mass shootings were reduced for a decade after president bill clinton signed an assault weapons ban in 1994 after the ban was not renewed in 2004 the number of mass shootings increased the ban did not however prevent the columbine high school massacre in which two students killed twelve students and one teacher in april 1999 we are left wondering what can be done to reduce the number of mass shootings other countries do not have the gun violence that pervades our american culture students shoppers and church goers in other countries do not live in fear being gunned down we need to demand our legislators pass a permanent assault weapons ban that will buy back ar 15 style weapons and bump stocks which can be added to semi automatics to make them behave more like automatic firearms from civilians and that will halt their production importation and sales for all but military and law enforcement uses in response to a mass shooting that killed 35 and wounded 28 people in 1996 australia greatly reduced the number of murders when it instituted a guns buy back program that removed more than 650 000 from use polls show a majority of americans have supported stricter gun laws for decades a politico morning consult poll conducted this week showed overwhelming support among americans for background checks a ban on assault style weapons and other gun restrictions we also need a supreme court decision that restores the meaning of the first half of the second amendment a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed the meaning of the first 13 words was lost after the 2008 supreme court s decision in the district of columbia v heller case by a 5 4 vote the supreme court ignoring the original intent of the amendment interpreted the second amendment to grant individuals the right to possess and use firearms independent of servicing in a well governed militia if our legislators fail to produce the changes that are needed vote for those who will be more responsive to all americans not just to those in their political party or to lobbyists judy parr is a resident of holland

tokyo ap japanese adventurer kenichi horie at 83 just became the oldest person in the world to complete a solo nonstop voyage across the pacific ocean and he says he is still in the middle of my youth and not done yet horie returned home as he crossed the kii strait off japan s western coast early saturday completing his trans pacific solo voyage in 69 days after leaving a yacht harbor in san francisco in late march on sunday after spending the night on his 19 foot 6 meter long suntory mermaid iii just off the coast horie was towed into his home port of shin nishinomiya where he was cheered by local residents and supporters and banners that read welcome back mr kenichi horie as he approached the harbor horie standing in his boat took off his white cap and waved he got off the yacht took off the cap again and bowed deeply on the pier before he was presented with bouquets of roses thank you for waiting said horie who appeared tanned and with his white hair longer than usual he carried a stock of medicine from san francisco he said but only used eye drops and band aids during his more than two months alone at sea that shows how healthy i am horie said i m still in the middle of my youth he said he burned all my body and soul on the journey but says he s ready for more i will keep up my work to be a late bloomer at a news conference at the yacht harbor later sunday he said becoming the oldest person to make the feat was a dream come true it was my great joy to have been able to make a challenge as a real goal and safely achieve it instead of just holding onto it as a dream i want to be a challenger as long as i live he said it 1962 he became the first person in the world to successfully complete a solo nonstop voyage across the pacific from japan to san francisco sixty years later he traveled the opposite route this time his preparation during the coronavirus pandemic was full of uncertainties involving vaccine requirements testing and other logistics it was like walking on thin ice he said soon after his departure from san francisco he was faced with a storm but the weather gradually improved and he reached hawaii in mid april ahead of schedule he had some struggles toward the end with a few days of pushback from a strong tide he wrote on his blog on friday that he had succeeded but was exhausted and he took a nap after feeling assured that his yacht was on the right track to the finish line horie has completed other long distance solo voyages including sailing around the world in 1974 his latest expedition was the first since his 2008 solo nonstop voyage on a wave powered boat from hawaii to the kii strait despite sailing on his own technology such as ship tracking and communications allowed him to stay in touch with his family and other people throughout the journey i imagine my next voyage would be even more fun he said
early in joe biden s presidency felicia wong president of the liberal roosevelt institute told me that biden was badly misunderstood he s been in national politics for decades and so people look at him and default to a kind of old understanding of what democrats stand for this idea that democrats are tax and spend liberals wong thought he wanted more what biden is trying to push is much more about actually remaking our economy so that it does different things and it actually regularly produces different outcomes i think wong is right about what biden or at least the biden administration wanted but its execution has lagged its vision and the reason for this is uncomfortable for democrats you can t transform the economy without first transforming the government in april brian deese director of biden s national economic council gave an important speech on the need for a modern american industrial strategy this was a salvo in a debate most americans would probably be puzzled to know democrats are having industrial strategy is the idea that a country should chart a path to productive capacity beyond what the market would on its own support it is the belief that there should be some politics in our economics some vision of what we are trying to make beyond what financial markets reward trying to build clean energy infrastructure is a form of industrial strategy so is investing in domestic supply chains for vaccines and masks and microchips for decades the idea has been disreputable even among democrats you don t want government picking winners and losers as the adage goes the argument is this when governments bet on technologies or companies they typically bet wrong markets are more efficient more adaptable less corrupt and so governments should where possible get out of the market s way the government s proper role is after the market has done its work shifting money from those who have it to those who need it put simply markets create governments tax and politicians spend it s remarkable the assumptions that lurk beneath what s taken for common sense in washington consider the phrase winners and losers winners at what losers how markets manage such questions through profits and losses valuations and bankruptcies but societies have richer more complex goals to criticize markets for failing to achieve them is like berating a toaster because it never produces an oil painting that s not its job so i won t say markets failed we failed growth slowed inequality widened the climate crisis kept getting worse deindustrialization wrecked communities the pandemic proved america s supply chains fragile china became more authoritarian rather than more democratic and then vladimir putin s war revealed the folly of relying on countries we cannot trust for goods we desperately need no one considers this success deese in his speech to the economic club of new york declared the debate over the question should move from why should we pursue an industrial strategy to how do we pursue one successfully i am sympathetic to this vision in a series of columns over the last year i ve argued that we need a liberalism that builds scratch the failures of modern democratic governance particularly in blue states and you ll typically find that the market didn t provide what we needed and government either didn t step in or made the problem worse through neglect or over regulation we need to build more houses trains clean energy research centers disease surveillance and do it faster and cheaper at the national level much can be blamed on republican obstruction and the filibuster but that s not always true in new york or california or oregon it is too slow and too costly to build even where republicans are weak perhaps especially where they are weak this is where the liberal vision too often averts its gaze if anything the critiques made of public action a generation ago have more force today do we have a government capable of building the answer too often is no what we have is a government that is extremely good at making building difficult the first step is admitting you have a problem and deese did exactly that a modern american industrial strategy needs to demonstrate that america can build fast as we ve done before and fairly as we ve sometimes failed to do he said one answer the typical republican answer is that government can t do the job and shouldn t try but the data doesn t bear that out the transit costs project tracks the price tags on rail projects in different countries it s hard to get an apples to apples comparison here because different projects are well different and it matters whether they include say a tunnel which is expensive for obvious reasons even so the united states is notable for how much we spend and how little we get it costs about 538 million to build 1 kilometer of rail here germany builds 1 kilometer of rail for 287 million canada gets it done for 254 million japan clocks in at 170 million spain is the cheapest country in the database at 80 million all those countries build more tunnels than we do perhaps because they retain the confidence to regularly try the better you are at building infrastructure the more ambitious you can be when imagining infrastructure to build the problem isn t government it s our government nor is the problem unions another favored bugaboo of the right union density is higher in all those countries than it is in the united states so what has gone wrong here one answer worth wrestling with is offered by brink lindsey director of the open society project at the niskanen center in a 2021 paper titled state capacity what is it how we lost it and how to get it back lindsey s definition is admirably terse state capacity is the ability to design and execute policy effectively he told me when a government can t collect the taxes it s owed or build the sign up portal to its new health insurance plan or construct the high speed rail it s already spent billions of dollars on that s a failure of state capacity but a weak government is often an end not an accident lindsey s argument is that to fix state capacity in america we need to see that the hobbled state we have is a choice and there are reasons it was chosen government isn t intrinsically inefficient it has been made inefficient and not just by the right what is needed most is a change in ideas a reversal of those intellectual trends of the past 50 years or so that have brought us to the current pass on the right this means abandoning the knee jerk anti statism of recent decades embracing the legitimacy of a large complex welfare and regulatory state and recognizing the vital role played by the nation s public servants not just the police and military on the left it means reconsidering the decentralized legalistic model of governance that has guided progressive led state expansion since the 1960s reducing the veto power that activist groups exercise in the courts and shifting the focus of policy design from ensuring that power is subject to progressive checks to ensuring that power can actually be exercised effectively the biden administration can t do much about the right s hostility to government but it can confront the mistakes and divisions on the left a place to start is offered in another niskanen paper this one by nicholas bagley a law professor at the university of michigan in the procedure fetish bagley argues that liberal governance has developed a puzzling preference for legitimating government action through processes rather than outcomes he suggests provocatively that that s because american politics in general and the democratic party in particular is dominated by lawyers joe biden and kamala harris hold law degrees as did barack obama and john kerry and bill and hillary clinton before them and this filters down through the party lawyers not managers have assumed primary responsibility for shaping administrative law in the united states bagley writes and if all you ve got is a lawyer everything looks like a procedural problem this is a way that america differs from peer countries robert kagan a law professor at the university of california berkeley has called this adversarial legalism and shown that it s a distinctively american way of checking state power bagley builds on this argument inflexible procedural rules are a hallmark of the american state he writes the ubiquity of court challenges the artificial rigors of notice and comment rule making zealous environmental review pre enforcement review of agency rules picayune legal rules governing hiring and procurement nationwide court injunctions the list goes on and on the justification for these policies is that they make state action more legitimate by ensuring that dissenting voices are heard but they also over time render government ineffective and that cost is rarely weighed this gets to bagley s ultimate and in my view wisest point legitimacy is not solely not even primarily a product of the procedures that agencies follow he says legitimacy arises more generally from the perception that government is capable informed prompt responsive and fair that is what we ve lost in fact not just in perception i ve spent most of my adult life trawling think tank reports to better understand how to solve problems when i go looking for ideas on how to build state capacity on the left i don t find much there s nothing like the depth of research thought and energy that goes into imagining health and climate and education policy but those health climate and education plans depend crucially on a state capable of designing and executing policy effectively this is true at the federal level and is even truer and harder at the state and local level so this is what i have become certain of democrats spend too much time and energy imagining the policies that a capable government could execute and not nearly enough time imagining how to make a government capable of executing them it is not only markets that have failed
this stock offers something that none of berkshire s other holdings can don t underestimate the power of berkshire hathaway s brk a 0 59 brk b 0 74 13f hr filing to the u s securities and exchange commission sec the sec requires the company to disclose all of the stocks that it owns on a quarterly basis in a real sense berkshire s 13f hr provides a peek into what warren buffett is thinking the filing shows which stocks the oracle of omaha especially likes considering that buffett ranks as one of the greatest investors of all time that could be really useful information for investors who aren t legends which stock in berkshire s portfolio excluding berkshire hathaway itself is the best pick for ordinary investors right now different people will likely have different answers however if i could buy only one buffett stock though this would be it honorable mentions before i get to my favorite buffett stock though allow me to first acknowledge several honorable mentions berkshire s portfolio includes quite a few really great stocks to own apple aapl 2 19 ranks as the biggest holding for berkshire it also happens to be the biggest position in my own portfolio primarily because i ve owned it for a long time and it s performed very well i continue to view apple as an excellent pick my take is that amazon com amzn 1 35 also stands out as a top stock to buy right now this technically wasn t a buffett pick since one of berkshire s two investment managers made the call to buy amazon a few years ago regardless amazon appears to be a bargain it s one of the stocks in my portfolio that i d seriously consider adding to my position buffett is betting big time on chevron cvx 0 86 these days although i don t personally own the stock i think that the oil and gas giant should continue to deliver solid returns thanks to highly favorable market dynamics i also own shares of two other berkshire holdings bank of america bac 0 45 and mastercard ma 1 20 my prediction is that both stocks will perform well over the long term why i especially like one buffett stock while i think highly of all of the aforementioned stocks there s another buffett stock that i especially like and it s a recent addition to berkshire s portfolio markel mkl 0 38 buying markel is arguably the next best thing to buying berkshire itself in fact markel is sometimes referred to as a baby berkshire there are a couple of key similarities between the two companies for one thing both are in the insurance business while berkshire has geico general re and a handful of other businesses that mainly focus on the standard insurance market markel offers specialty insurance and reinsurance it provides coverage to customers who usually can t obtain standard insurance but it s the second common denominator between markel and berkshire that puts the stock in my top spot both companies use the cash generated by their insurance businesses to work by investing in other publicly traded companies in a way buying shares of markel or berkshire is almost like investing in an exchange traded fund etf that owns lots of stocks diversification is very important to me as much as i like apple amazon and the other stocks mentioned earlier they don t offer the diversification that markel does actually buying shares of markel provides a way to also invest in apple amazon mastercard berkshire itself and lots of other great stocks because they re all in markel s portfolio not perfect markel isn t a perfect stock its performance lags well behind all of the previously mentioned stocks and the s p 500 over the past five years some investors might also shy away from markel s price shares currently trade at nearly 1 400 markel has never conducted a stock split to make its share price more affordable for retail investors however markel is faring quite well so far in 2022 it s trouncing the s p as well as all of the other stocks i ve mentioned except chevron markel is also valued attractively with a forward earnings multiple below 18 that s especially appealing considering the company s strong growth prospects if i could only buy one buffett stock the combination of the valuation and diversification that markel offers makes this stock close enough to perfect for me

as the country grapples with yet another shooting that left four dead in at a medical center in tulsa oklahoma eyes are on congress to see how representatives will respond to calls for changing the country s gun laws but in the more than two decades since the columbine high school shooting most gun reforms have taken place at the state level those state level measures can only go so far said monisha henley senior director for state affairs at gun control advocacy group everytown for gun safety when everytown ranks gun safety policies across the country the group also has to consider the laws of neighboring states the reason that illinois even with strong gun laws may not be the california or new york is because they re neighbors with a state like indiana which is not taking this seriously that are deregulating their laws henley said mass shootings there have already been a dozen mass shootings this year we re in a paralysis changing gun laws the calls for gun reform follow every school shooting here s what they ve led to a bad day for hope another school shooting more dead kids why gun control advocates see no end in sight here are five states that passed significant gun legislation after a deadly attack connecticut the shooting the deadliest school shooting the country s history left 26 dead including 20 children after a gunman opened fire at sandy hook elementary school in 2012 the response the connecticut general assembly established a gun violence and children s safety task force responsible for holding public hearings and delivering proposals for gun control and school safety evil visited this community today and it s too early to speak of recovery but each parent each sibling each member of the family has to understand that connecticut we re all in this together dannel malloy connecticut s governor at the time said we ll do whatever we can to overcome this event in the months following the shooting lawmakers drafted a 139 page bill which added more than 100 firearms to the state s list of banned assault weapons banned the sale or purchase of ammunition magazines with capacities of more than 10 rounds required background checks for all gun sales the sandy hook shooting renewed the national debate around gun control as a growing number of gun control advocacy groups lobbied the white house and congress to introduce gun control legislation what happened four months after the deadly shooting connecticut lawmakers passed its comprehensive gun control legislation with malloy signing it into law just hours after the it won approval from the general assembly daniel defense team from sandy hook gun suit seeking answers on uvalde ar 15 marketing california the shooting gunmen armed with assault rifles and handguns opened fire during an event at the inland regional center located in san bernardino california in 2015 leaving 14 dead and 22 injured the response in the wake of the san bernardino shooting california lawmakers looked to introduce a comprehensive package to revise the state s gun laws and revisit previously stalled proposals including a bill that would have closed the loophole allowing semiautomatic guns to have recessed bullet button one of the semiautomatic rifles recovered was fitted with a bullet button among the new proposals and previously stalled bills reconsidered after the shooting were outlawing the manufacturing and sale of all semiautomatic weapons with the capacity to be fitted with a detachable magazine requiring background checks for those buying ammunition banning firearms with the holding capacity of more than 10 rounds requiring homemade guns to be registered with the state what happened nearly seven months after the shooting in san bernardino gov jerry brown signed six new gun laws into law with the new pieces of legislation the state closed the loophole allowing bullet buttons on semiautomatic weapons a measure brown previously vetoed in 2013 during another gun law reform effort the state also passed measures to restrict firearms with the capacity of holding more than 10 rounds to require a background check when purchasing ammunition and to restrict straw purchasing which is when an individual purchases a weapon legally but gives or sells it to another individual brown also vetoed several other bills including one that would have made it a felony to steal a gun saying that a similar measure was slated to appear on the state ballot later that year age limit buy a semi automatic rifle uvalde has house pushing a minimum age increase from 18 florida the shooting seventeen people were killed at marjory stoneman douglas high school in 2018 after a gunman opened fire on the school with an ar 15 styled rifle the response a gun reform movement was launched in the aftermath of the school shooting in parkland which took place almost two years after a mass shooting at an orlando nightclub that killed 49 people the movement which also launched march for our lives was led by a group of marjory stoneman douglas students including david hogg emma gonzalez jaclyn corin cameron kasky and alex wind during the aftermath of the shooting florida lawmakers worked on bipartisan legislation with proposals including creating a program to arm some school officials requiring a three day waiting period for the majority of long gun purchases raising the minimum age to purchase those weapons to 21 banning the possession and sale of bump stocks what happened after weeks of debate florida lawmakers approved the bill in a bipartisan vote despite opposition from the national rifle association and then gov rick scott signed the legislation into law along with the increased age minimum and imposing a three day wait period the legislation also created a red flag law which allows authorities to confiscate or temporality bar the purchase of firearms from individuals who are deemed dangerous in the days following the texas school shooting sen chris murphy d conn voiced approval for florida s gun laws passed after parkland the florida law is a good law and it s a signal of what s possible said murphy who is a vocal advocate for gun control legislation it married together changes to florida s gun laws with some significant investments in mental health and school security despite florida s recent improvement to its gun laws progress as stalled since 2018 and its considered to be missing key gun laws according to everytown for gun safety arming teachers ohio gov dewine set to sign bill requiring only 24 hours of training for teachers to carry firearms colorado the shooting a 21 year old man opened fire in a boulder grocery store in march 2021 killing 10 people ten days before the shooting boulder had voted to ban assault weapons but the measure was blocked in court the court ruled that the city couldn t ban assault weapons due to a preemption law that prohibits cities from passing stricter gun laws than the state the response in the weeks following the shooting inside the king soopers grocery store state lawmakers proposed a series of bills in an attempt to curb gun violence among the proposed measures requiring individuals to safely store firearms and report any loss of stolen firearms tightening an already existing law that allows the removal of firearms from individuals charged with domestic violence establishing an office of gun violence prevention for the state banning individuals with violent misdemeanors including child abuse convictions and sexual assault from purchasing a firearm for five years what happened colorado lawmakers passed the series of bills and gov jared polis signed the legislation into law just weeks after the shooting the state also passed a bill overturning colorado s preemption law making the centennial state the first in the country to do so and allowing cities to set stricter gun regulations than the state despite the numerous gun laws passed in the aftermath of the 2021 shooting lawmakers didn t propose or attempt to pass a statewide assault weapons ban colorado state senate president steve fenberg a democrat from boulder told 9 news that while

these screaming bargains are ripe for the picking by opportunistic investors there s no doubt about it this has been a challenging year for the investing community since the curtain opened on 2022 the storied dow jones industrial average and benchmark s p 500 have dipped into correction territory a decline of more than 10 while the technology focused nasdaq composite has fallen into a bear market with a peak to trough decline of 31 since november although big drops in the stock market can be unnerving and tug on investors emotions they re also historically an excellent time to put your money to work corrections and bear markets tend to run their course relatively quickly and all notable declines throughout history have eventually been erased by a bull market rally during bear markets it s not uncommon for investors to place added emphasis on valuation time tested companies with reasonably low multiples relative to earnings sales and or book value tend to be popular buys that steadily outperform over the long run what follows are four ultra cheap time tested stocks that can with patience turn a 300 000 investment into 1 million by 2030 meta platforms the first incredibly cheap stock that can more than triple investors money by the turn of the decade is meta platforms meta 2 28 the company formerly known as facebook take note that meta will be changing its ticker symbol later this week to drum roll meta what makes meta such a special company is its social media engagement although public interest in social sites can ebb and flow meta s assets facebook facebook messenger instagram and whatsapp are consistently among the most downloaded social apps on the planet to build on this point meta s family of apps had 3 64 billion monthly active users during the first quarter this effectively means that more than half the world s adult population visits a meta owned asset at least once per month advertisers are well aware of this which is why meta has historically had no trouble charging a premium for ads on its platforms even though ceo mark zuckerberg has pivoted his company s long term focus to metaverse innovations there s no question that ads remain meta s cash cow though it s going to take time to get the support infrastructure in place for the metaverse the next iteration of the internet which allows users to interact with each other and their environment in 3d virtual worlds meta can be a winner investing tens of billions of dollars now could make meta one of the key on ramps to metaverse engagement at no point in meta s 10 years as

by the covid 19 pandemic and war in ukraine coupled with historically high inflation and inventory buildup are creating havoc for retailers american eagle s latest report clearly cited these inventory and supply chain struggles however this is a company with an experienced management team that s navigated its fair share of headwinds before in particular american eagle outfitters has shown time and again that it s a no nonsense company that can quickly move excess inventory ridding itself of unwanted merchandise has helped boost margins by encouraging more full priced purchases during long winded economic expansions as i ve previously pointed out american eagle outfitters brand also sits at the perfect price point it offers teens and young adults brand name apparel and accessories

years shares of american eagle outfitters can be scooped up for less than seven times wall street s forward year earnings forecast to boot investors are netting a nearly 6 dividend yield agnc investment corp ultra high yield dividend stock agnc investment corp agnc 1 93 is yet another inexpensive time tested company that can turn 300 000 into 1 million by 2030 agnc is a monthly dividend payer that s yielding 11 8 as of june 1 2022 and has sported a double digit yield in 12 of the past 13 years agnc investment is a mortgage real estate investment trust reit agnc borrows money at low short term lending rates then uses the capital it receives to purchase higher yielding long term assets such as mortgage backed securities mbss which is why it s known as a mortgage reit the goal for the company is to maximize its net interest margin which is the difference between the average yield on the assets it owns minus its average borrowing rate the beauty of the mortgage reit industry is that there aren t any surprises simply following the federal reserve s monetary policy and the treasury bond yield curve will give investors a good idea of how well or poorly the mortgage reit industry is performing at the moment companies like agnc are being challenged by flattened yield curves and rising short term lending rates however when things look their bleakest is often the ideal time to buy into mortgage reits like agnc for instance higher interest rates should also improve the yields on the mbss agnc is buying over time this would be expected to widen the company s net interest margin furthermore 66 9 billion of agnc s 68 6 billion investment portfolio at the end of march was comprised of agency assets agency securities are backed by the federal government in the unlikely event of default this added protection is what allows agnc to lean on leverage to boost its profit potential investors can buy shares of agnc right now for a 7 discount to its book value and roughly six times wall street s forecast earnings for the upcoming year walgreens boots alliance a fourth ultra cheap time tested stock that can turn 300 000 into 1 million by the end of the decade is pharmacy chain walgreens boots alliance wba 1 12 normally healthcare stocks are relatively immune to economic downturns since people get sick no matter how well or poorly the u s economy and stock market perform there should always be a steady demand for prescription medicine medical devices and healthcare services but with the initial stages of the pandemic leading to lockdowns foot traffic driven pharmacy chains like walgreens struggled the good news is that these short term struggles are providing investors with an opportunity to buy into a highly profitable business at a sizable discount long before the pandemic even began walgreens had initiated a multipoint plan aimed at boosting organic growth lifting its operating margin and increasing repeat visits to its stores one aspect of this transformation cost cutting is well ahead of schedule according to the company it managed to shave off more than 2 billion in annual operating expenses a full year ahead of schedule what s interesting though is that while walgreens tightened the proverbial spigot in certain operating segments it s been spending aggressively in others for instance it s built up its direct to consumer segment which should be particularly fruitful in the wake of the pandemic though most of the company s sales will continue to originate from its brick and mortar locations the convenience of online shopping and drive thru pickup can lead to sustained organic growth the company is also willingly spending capital on opening co located health clinics in cooperation with villagemd more than 100 of these clinics are already open with 1 000 full service clinics expected to be open in more than 30 u s markets by 2027 since these clinics are physician staffed they should have success at driving repeat visitors and boosting business at walgreens pharmacy shares of walgreens can be purchased for less than nine times wall street s forecast earnings for next year and shareholders can net a 4 4 annual yield for their patience

a decent dividend plus a bargain price adds up to an incredible opportunity for investors to consider if there s an upside to a down market it s that not every company whose shares get punished will end up in the dustbin of history as the market declines quite often great businesses with solid long term prospects get put on sale giving investors a chance to buy at great prices when those businesses also pay supported sustainable and often growing dividends then investors who buy the shares can get paid for their patience as they wait for a recovery to help figure out whether such opportunities are emerging in today s market three investors and fool com contributors named beaten down dividend stocks that look like they could be screaming buys this june they uncovered stanley black decker swk 0 71 home depot hd 1 44 and 3m mmm 0 01 read on to find out why they feel that way and decide for yourself whether any or all of them deserve a spot in your portfolio the right tool for your portfolio eric volkman stanley black decker stocks don t get much more beaten down than toolmaker stanley black decker the company s stock has cratered by almost 40 so far in 2022 and its price is teasing its one year low that s hardly fair stanley black decker is a top name in the tools and associated goods space and has been for years it owns some of the top tool brands you ll find in millions of american closets and garages outside of the two that comprise the company s name it also sells the craftsman and dewalt lines among numerous others like many of the best dividend stocks stanley black decker has historically managed to consistently if unspectacularly grow revenue and post a bottom line profit but this has been overshadowed lately by a notable increase in the costs of raw materials a key input for the company as a result it recently cut its net profit and free cash flow guidance for full year 2022 which sent investors scurrying for the exits never mind that in its first quarter the company trounced the average analyst earnings estimate for its first quarter or managed to increase revenue 20 year over year thanks in no small part to a clever and complementary acquisition of gardening equipment purveyor mtd stanley black decker is doing what it can to cope with the increase in raw material costs notably raising prices for its products but that crunch with raw materials won t last forever and even while it does the company will continue to operate in an environment where key business drivers like the frothy u s housing market should continue to improve the recent investor exodus has left stanley black decker rather cheap on its valuations it trades at a forward price to earnings ratio of less than 12 and a price to book value barely above 1 both rather low compared to other manufacturing stocks meanwhile although 2022 probably won t be a banner year for the company analysts are expecting a much sunnier 2023 collectively they are anticipating a nearly 17 per share increase in net earnings finally a weakened share price means a meatier dividend yield stanley black decker s currently stands at nearly 2 7 a very attractive figure when matched not only against stocks in its sector but also the hallowed grouping of dividend aristocrats that it s a part of home depot is an excellent business selling at a fair price after the sell off parkev tatevosian home depot one of my favorite beaten down dividend stocks to buy now is home depot the company has had a wild couple of years starting with a surge in revenue at the pandemic s onset followed by the slowing growth in recent quarters however investor pessimism surrounding home depot s prospects as economies reopen is providing a lower price to potential investors indeed home depot s stock is down 28 off its highs short term fluctuations aside home depot has done an excellent job growing revenue expanding profit margins and raising earnings per share over the longer run that s good news for dividend investors because ultimately dividends are paid out of earnings home depot s revenue went from 75 billion to 151 billion in the previous decade the operating profit margin expanded from 10 4 to 15 2 during that same time it all flowed to the bottom line it grew earnings per share at a compound annual rate of 20 over 10 years that undoubtedly helped home depot raise its dividend payment from 1 16 in 2013 to 6 60 in 2022 that means income investors in 2013 who held their stock are getting nearly six times the dividend they signed up for today s income investors can expect home depot to boost the dividend over the next decade as well the fall in home depot s stock has it trading at a fair valuation of a price to earnings ratio of 19 and a price to free cash flow ratio of 28 investors can never be faulted for paying a reasonable price for an excellent business home depot is an outstanding beaten down dividend stock to buy for those reasons an industrial titan whose legal troubles are keeping its shares down chuck saletta 3m industrial titan 3m s shares currently trade for substantially less than they did five years ago in part due to ongoing legal and environmental costs associated with its business such costs are unfortunately common to many companies especially ones with long histories of operations and broad scale product lines that people rely on for things like health and safety that softness in its shares offers investors a decent opportunity to buy a part of a world class company at a reasonable price 3m trades at around 15 times trailing earnings and closer to 13 times its anticipated forward earnings in addition its shares sport a 4 yield thanks to a dividend that has increased for 64 consecutive years yet which only consumes around 62 of its earnings perhaps even better analysts are expecting only modest earnings growth of around 6 6 annualized over the next five or so years a growth rate like that gives investors good reason to believe the company can keep up its trend of dividend increases over time it also means the market doesn t have incredibly high expectations built in which when combined with its reasonable current valuation could help moderate the risks of further declines giving further reason to believe in its future 3m has a strongly embedded culture of innovation this is how the same company that makes post it notes and scotch tape can also make products as varied as n95 face masks and car repair kits that culture of innovation means that while the future is never certain there s a good chance 3m will find a way to adapt and thrive in it get paid for your patience stanley black decker home depot and 3m are solid companies that look like they have the staying power to make it through this current down market and on to brighter days ahead the market s recent sell off has made them available at reasonable prices while their dividends offer investors cold hard cash for their patience as they wait for the potential of a better future if there s an upside to a down market it s that offers like this only tend to come around when those brighter days look like they re far far away nobody really knows how long it will take for the market to recover getting paid decent and potentially growing dividends while you wait for that day to come certainly makes it a much more palatable proposition so decide for yourself which of these companies may deserve a spot in your portfolio and get yourself in a better spot to ride out the rockiness
former political aspirant under the all progressives congress apc chief robinson ariyo is public analyst lawyer vociferous activist and a peace builder in the niger delta he speaks with ebenezer adurokiya on the seven years reign of the apc government among others what s your score sheet like for the apc in the last seven years we actually over expected based on our dissatisfaction with the goodluck jonathan administration and with the promises that the government made and our impression about president muhammadubuhari during his war against indiscipline wai administration in 1983 we felt that indiscipline was a major issue and bringing somebody with a pedigree in attending to that issue was the way to go and so everybody expected much from him all the promises made if you put the manifesto side by side item by item the realities on ground you ll discover that the government has failed in practically every area if you view the power generation issue which was one of the major issues they took president jonathan on the minister of works and power rajifashola had said any serious government should be able to fix the power issue in six months that was the extent of bragging they had before mounting the saddle as a matter of fact also president buhari himself did say that given his experience as former minister of petroleum sector at a time any jonathan s government claim to be subsidizing fuel was a fraud he had followed up on that statement that there ll be functional refineries he painted a picture that he was going to solve the problem of petroleum subsidy and make us more self sustaining but he failed on this too i ve spoken about power petroleum sector which are critical sectors the primary duty of any responsible government is the welfare and security of its people in this area again he s failed woefully this country has never been as insecure as it is now and global indices as regards the ease of doing business has plummeted the ease of doing business during jonathan s time was much higher than where we are today there have been a lot of small and medium scale businesses flying away to neighbouring countries to the extent that even nigeria at a time was going to neighbouring countries to refine crude oil and bring back to nigeria so power petroleum sector security and infrastructure the roads are terrible now it is almost impossible for nigerians to travel safely via all the means of transportation the trains are at the mercy of terrorists attacks is it about the religious unrest in the country the country is now almost at a boiling point there appears no respite in sight as to how to resolve this logjam we thought things would be far better by now but we were wrong in the area of education the other time buhari had described the government of jonathan as irresponsible over asuu strike buhari s government has entered into several agreements with asuu which it has never fulfilled and that s why we have a situation our schools have shut down and it has radically affected the quality of education in nigeria the area of the economy things have become worse today the rate of the naira to a dollar is n610 all the empirical indicators suggest an abysmal failure completely below expectation see how high profile economic criminals convicted by the efcc are being granted state pardons what message is buhari sending to the younger generation talk about those accountant generals accused of stealing billions of naira in a government priding itself as anti corruption crusader this is a tip of the iceberg when it comes to corruption in this government in the last one week we re talking about over n500 billion being stolen by just two persons the accountants general of rivers state and the federation do you know what that amount will do as regards asuu strike imagine the governor of the central bank of nigeria the man who sits on the financial policy of a country nursing presidential ambition and grandstanding while in power and claiming that a group of people bought him a presidential form of n100 million we ve become the laughing stock of the world i don t think any government can be worse than this it s just as if we don t have a leadership in the country it s a state of lawlessness we ve gone back to the state of nature how do you critique nigerians standard of living in the last seven years we can t be talking of standard of living without talking about the cost of living our incomes have not improved in any way since the last seven years the rate of inflation is unimaginable check out the rates of a pack of lipton sugar etc how much were they sold then and now electricity tariff transportation fuel pump rents foodstuff electronics everything has gone up that s why crime has increased and people are so desperate now people are resorting to different measures to survive including ritual killing if your income is down and the cost of living is up what happens next could be unimaginable are you saying this government has been more of a curse thank a blessing to nigerians absolutely yes particularly so because when you don t expect someone to perform you ll not be disappointed the expectations were high they came with the critical concept of the breath of fresh air they understood our state that we were suffocating but they sunk us deeper into that toxin that we were in every promise they made they had failed on it where are the refineries where s the life abundance today we re more unsecured than when they came in is subsidy still a scam like buhari described it then has he not consistently maintained paying it in the last seven years what are the ways out unfortunately we have an electoral system that has been hijacked by the oligarchy how do you mean by the oligarchy the ruling class at the federal and state levels those who are privileged are the ones favoured by the government those who have stolen money and are not favoured by the government are being chased by the government through the efcc i understand that the wanted accountant general of rivers state won the pdp governorship primaries in the state how can such happen in a country where people are hungry and someone who s alleged of stealing billions of naira being declared governorship candidate if you look at those emerging as governorship candidates in some states and compare them to the aspirants they contested with you ll understand the rationality behind these oligarchs what we re practising is government of the oligarchic few by the oligarchic few and for the oligarchic few if you look at all the primaries you ll see that there s a pattern a nigeria s president who purchases a form of n100 million for a four year job of less than legitimate n50 million salary is it not madness what is the way of the current mess of seven years there s really no way out of this quagmire because the people in charge of the transitional and electoral system are the ones benefitting from the system the way out is a radical change by way of a revolution that ll sweep away these people and sanitize the system people make laws and they re the actual beneficiaries of the same law we need the people to come out en masse for me there should be no election the people should come out and solve the first problem when you do a thing over and over again in a particular way and you expect a different result then you need your head examined the scaffold with which we produced buhari is still the same scaffold available to produce the next set of leaders the kind of revolution i m prescribing is the type that occurs in every civil society why can t we adopt direct primary in our political parties that ll eliminate all these incompetent candidates emerging in our states let the people choose who they want but they have created a system that eliminate quality candidates in favour of less quality ones what kind of revolution are you calling for within legal framework there s what we call civil disobedience that s one of the tools with which you challenge the policies of government for instance the plummeting dollar issue is enough for us to occupy the streets to reject some policy directions encouraging the harsh situation as of today the country is unsafe due to religious intolerance and ethnic intolerance and insecurity so the civil society is supposed to mobilise the populace against these trends to hold this country to ransom like they did during endsars debacle why can t we have direct primaries as opposed to indirect primaries the real election is the primaries which they ve hijacked for their cronies already the citizens have been disenfranchised look at what happened during pdp primaries in delta state look at the quality of aspirants that contested if it were to be a direct primary the person who emerged would not have emerged you should not miss these from nigerian tribune revealed details of south west apc leaders

gotta go formula mia cathey shouted at her husband as she rushed out the door one night at 9 p m cathey was off to buy two cans of the high calorie hypoallergenic formula her 4 month old baby needs to survive the previous two weeks she had been unable to find a single can of the formula anywhere in her hometown of blue springs missouri and she was down to her last can cathey was finally able to get a couple of days worth of food for her baby thanks to a post on a community facebook group about one store s stock such experiences are common in mid february abbott shut down the nation s largest formula production plant and recalled its similac products from shelves the company did so after the u s food and drug administration fda found dangerous bacteria in its sturgis michigan production facility as of may 21 out of stock rates for formula had risen to 70 nationwide according to datasembly a retail data provider in kansas city it s become a community effort to keep babies fed friends and family members have sent cans of formula to their friends with babies folks have posted on community boards what they see at the grocery store moms have donated excess breast milk and local agencies have worked to ship the product where it s needed it s just trying to survive as a community i think is the best way to put it said anne strope the administrative coordinator for missouri s women infants and children wic program getting formula in kansas city formula shortages have been an issue for some time as one of the many supply chain problems caused by the covid 19 pandemic strope said in the past couple of months the issue has grown and become an all hands on deck situation the recall caused parents who normally buy similac to reach for other brands creating a scarcity across all formula types like toilet paper in the early stages of the pandemic formula became a hoarded commodity by those with the means missouri wic has contracts with abbott the maker of similac so wic vouchers are primarily for similac formula if a wic participant can t find similac on the shelves strope explained they have to go to their closest wic agency and request a different type of formula they would also have to hope that the substitute product was still available it s a frustration and we get it and we re sorry strope said as a program we don t have the flexibility to make all the changes that we see that could help people we re doing what we can within our regulations to help as best as we can sometimes this means strope is calling retailers herself trying to track down a can of formula to help a participant people are mad at wic and i feel some of it is justified because we re supposed to be helping strope said the majority of us are moms or grandmas that work at wic and we would go make formula if we knew how or go work at a plant for a while and help out if we knew it would help in missouri wic has more than 82 000 participants even prior to this shortage the program would facilitate direct shipments of formula from distributors to wic agencies that couldn t get the product last year the program did about 10 of these a month now it s averaging 20 a day that number kind of speaks volumes as to the difficulty our participants are having to find formula strope said and we re not always able to find it either these shipments are especially important to rural areas of the state with fewer grocery stores and wic retailers than urban areas while the shortage definitely affects wic participants strope was adamant that the shortage affects everyone that fear is everywhere whether you re on wic or not strope said to bolster the nation s inventory oversea shipments of formula have landed on u s soil but it s unclear if those shipments will reach the kansas city area the new york times reported one shipment has enough formula to feed around 9 000 babies and 18 000 toddlers for a week if it was just missouri i would say it would be a huge help but when you look at it from a broader perspective that doesn t even cover one state what is needed strope said the sturgis formula plant has remained closed since the recall in mid february other similac plants have ramped up their production to help fill the gaps but strope said it s hard to see an end to the shortage until the sturgis plant is operational again abbott ceo robert ford said in an opinion piece the sturgis plant plans to reopen at full capacity the first week in june by the end of june we will be supplying more formula to americans than we were in january before the recall ford wrote however he also said in the same paragraph it would take 6 8 weeks from the start of production for formula to reach the shelves that s another couple of months when moms like cathey have to worry about where to find formula how to help an ongoing community effort is the best way to support mothers and babies during this time from the frontlines of the issue as both a mom and wic coordinator strope suggested the following ways to help don t stockpile formula if you have more than a month s supply leave the cans on the shelf for those who don t if you can breastfeed consider donating excess supply or sample cans of formula you might have and not need strope cautions that anyone accepting these donations should ask the mother about their diet and ensure the formula cans have not been exposed to extreme temperatures call your friends and family members who have formula drinking babies and ask them if you can help look for the precious powder strope said to make sure you ask which type of formula the baby prefers or can drink as many infants have dietary restrictions switch to baby food for babies old enough strope said most babies over 6 months old can eat baby food and don t need to rely on formula for all of their nutrients she noted to always consult a pediatrician before changing diets as every baby is different consider breastfeeding or re lactating women who are pregnant and due in the next month should especially consider breastfeeding their children strope said wic and most insurances offer lactation consultations though breastfeeding is not always an option for all mothers uzazi village provides free breastfeeding and lactation education clinics consult with a pediatrician if you are considering using alternative or homemade formula options we really want people to talk to their pediatricians before they do anything besides formula or breast milk because you don t want to take that chance with your baby strope said breastfeeding isn t always an option jessica hurd is one of the many moms donating extra breast milk to those who can use it she s been breastfeeding for almost five years now with just short breaks between each of her three kids her youngest is just 6 months old and still feeding but hurd said she over produces milk and ended up with a freezer full of breast milk as she heard about the formula shortage affecting families this past month she decided to reach out on a facebook group about donating her milk i m not going to use it so why not give it to someone that needs it hurd said within an hour of listing that she had breast milk to donate hurd had countless inquiries and was able to donate about 700 ounces of milk the moms she was able to donate to were grateful she said one gave her farm fresh eggs and others offered to replace her breast milk bags i m not doing it to get anything back hurd said i like to think that if i was in that same position they would donate to me while facebook groups have helped some people find food social media conversations around the shortages are filled with comments suggesting mothers just breastfeed and offering recipes for homemade formula but what works for one baby doesn t necessarily work for every baby alyson cathey s 4 month old baby was born with a heart condition and struggles to gain weight needed for early development so she needs a high density formula to make matters worse alyson is allergic to milk even cathey s breast milk gave the baby a rash and caused projectile vomiting formula is almost more like liquid gold to me than breast milk because i can t make more of this cathey said when it s not on the shelf how do i feed my baby alyson is healthy but because of her heart condition at birth she is still only in the 25th percentile for growth cathey s pediatrician told her to mix alyson s formula at a higher powder to water ratio to help the baby gain weight this means a can of formula which goes for about 35 only feeds alyson for a few days so i can t supplement with anything cathey said she is frequently left in situations saying i have one can left and that s two days worth of food for her i have to find something in these two days she tried to breastfeed but it wasn t what her baby needed i just have to remind myself that these people that are leaving these comments they just don t understand because they haven t had to walk in these shoes cathey said another local mother is experiencing a similar problem em moreno feeds her 3 month old baby a special formula that she now scrambles to find on kansas grocery shelves i thought it may be easier to find because it s only for premature babies but we have friends and family looking all over moreno said when he was born her baby was in the natal intensive care unit for more than a week he was jaundiced and his weight hovered at around four pounds until physicians gave him formula moreno explained he grew around two ounces a night and finally got to come home after 11 days she said the new mother said she never expected for this to happen she chose to formula feed her child because her mom and grandmother did the same she just wants her baby to be healthy maternal health care experts say the stigma that comes with making the choice to formula feed is underscored the day a child is born when a person gives birth nurses come in who may or may not be well versed in lactation care rather than educate and empower the parents the choice might be made for them one advocate says like clockwork maternity ward staff come in and rattle off the 10 step baby friendly hospital initiative launched by who and unicef no 6 states do not provide breastfed newborns any food or fluids other than breast milk unless medically indicated this raises concerns for parents like moreno lots of people think breast is best and it s easy to get breast milk but that is just not true for a lot of babies she said my baby needs a special amount of calories to grow flatland baby alyson has a milk allergy that means she must drink formula in order to stay healthy and fed now her child is a healthy five pound baby as she struggles to find the specified formula recommended by her pediatrician in recent weeks she and her family hit every walmart dillons sam s club and cvs within an hour radius and nothing finally a friend in south dakota located four cans the only four left in that store and shipped them to her another family friend sent her a few more so she ll have enough for maybe 70 days although her doctor provided a different formula she s worried it isn t the one her child needs i don t know what will happen after that moreno said what lactation educators say netta thompson chief operations officer and breastfeeding lactation educator at uzazi village said it all boils down to this ultimately my thing is feed your baby thompson said the shortages happening now remind her of the early part of the pandemic the stress of going to the store and what you need is not there and so then you have to really think about how am i going to take care of my family added stress also can impact how mothers are able to care for their children newborn or not with those considerations in mind uzazi village is doing what it can to provide community support the nonprofit organization is a leader in maternal care for parents of color a needed resource for those who distrust hospitals and medical clinics thompson said the organization has seen less formula donations as of late which poses a dilemma staff asked whether they should go to big box stores to purchase formula they ultimately decided not to because we d be taking it away from families who need it she said though uzazi village is a hub in the community for its free offerings such as family education diaper depots lactation consultations pantry and closet organizations like these rely on donations and funding to get by the lack of investment in maternal health care organizations and parental care in general has been magnified by the current shortage thompson says she added it really breaks my heart that families here in the u s have to be concerned with how they re going to feed their babies while thompson states that breastfeeding is the optimal way to feed infants this just isn t an option for every parent she feels the issue is multifaceted one being that the formula industry in the u s should be held to a higher standard in the 1950s formula was hailed as the premium choice but more recent research has shown otherwise depending on the brand we also need to kind of understand a little bit about infant anatomy when babies are born they have a virgin gut meaning that some whey molecules the whey that is in formula makes it a little bit harder for some of our babies to be able to process than mom s milk she said second understanding complexities of other factors is key she said a brief trigger warning for readers this explanation may be unsettling for some some women who have been sexually assaulted are unable to feed at the breast thompson explained then there are also women who require medication that are unsafe to pass on to the infant through feeding we haven t even talked about babies with down syndrome or a cleft palate she added the list goes on still parents are being shamed on social media and elsewhere thompson said another piece to understanding the puzzle is the historical implications of racism and discrimination in medical settings it has sown distrust many medical providers still believe that a lot of these families are on welfare and so they re not going to breastfeed anyways they re gonna go ahead and just give the baby formula she said so they don t put in as much effort when it comes to educating the mom about breastfeeding the history points to discriminatory practices that used enslaved black immigrant or poor women to feed wealthy mothers babies also called wet nurses this meant the needs of kids from lower income and marginalized backgrounds went unmet then when infant formula was popularized in the late 1920s the industry further cemented the widening racial disparities as it connects to food access health and maternal health care this shortage does point to a larger issue of just our maternity care here in the u s thompson said segregation racism in the medical field and economic drivers made it harder for lower wage workers who were largely hispanic or latinx and black to access fair parental leave this included a workplace that provided an avenue for breastfeeding such as nursing rooms time to pump and other lactation support according to a report by the association of women s health obstetric and neonatal nurses early initiation and support was lacking in communities of color this shortage further underscored the issue a pbs report found that the demographic of parents hit hardest by the shortages were largely parents of color thompson s hope is that hubs like uzazi village can work to close those gaps in kansas city and provide what parents need the community support has no doubt been vital to these mothers it does boil down to education it does boil down to having better maternity leave for moms and giving them a fighting chance she said giving them the opportunity to be able to do what they want to do but it doesn t change the fact that many of them still face another month or two filled with fear there s a lot of frustration as a parent that in the first world country that we live in this should not be a problem cathey said it s very frustrating
