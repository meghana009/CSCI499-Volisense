forget the old stereotype that the french are rude the french have a reputation for being difficult with foreigners a good amount of that reputation is likely thanks to the hollywood stereotype typically in the form of stock characters like a snooty ma√Ætre d femme fatale or mendacious lothario to be sure most visitors to france have at least one story of a run in or misunderstanding with the french sometimes these are honest cultural misunderstandings while in others it may just be bad luck humans are complex beings with complex emotions and we all have our frustrating moments that said some social graces are particularly helpful in france and her overseas departments other francophone countries may also have similar social norms these cues may not be as important in many larger well touristed cities in paris especially many tourism industry workers may not be french and are intimately familiar with american habits several years ago paris published a booklet for tourism workers on visitors cultural differences and expectations however these cues can be good habits for smooth travel among the french

as the covid 19 pandemic moves toward its endemic phase changes are occurring with state and local resources liz copan summit daily archive as the covid 19 pandemic moves toward a more endemic phase resources and services relating to the virus as well as vaccines and tests continue to shift in eagle county according to heath harmon eagle county s director of public health throughout the months of may and june the county experienced higher levels of transmission mirroring the rest of the state however over the past two weeks the number of new cases as well as positivity rates have started to level out and even slightly drop fortunately throughout the period of increased transmission in our communities hospitalizations have remained low harmon said this helps highlight protections within a highly vaccinated community as well as some immunity from previous infection largely the cases being seen across colorado are still dominated by various strains of omicron in the spring the dominant strain was ba 2 and now ba 4 and ba 5 account for approximately 50 of covid 19 cases nationwide harmon said each of these variants have demonstrated higher transmissibility compared to the original omicron strain of december and january which is why vaccines later this year will likely cover omicron in this newer formulation he added the good news is we have not seen evidence of increased severity during this recent period of higher transmission support local journalism donate a spokesperson for vail health noted that covid 19 is still present in the community on wednesday the spokesman said the hospital is experiencing one to three patients a week being admitted and that patients coming into urgent care and the clinics are generally experiencing mild covid 19 symptoms as we move toward the new endemic phase of covid 19 however tracking positive cases and transmission has certainly changed from even six months ago as public testing sites closed up shop and at home testing became more prevalent with a significant amount of at home testing available many of these cases are not reported to state or local public health agencies harmon said adding that for this reason the practice of comparing disease rates to historic or even geographic data no longer makes sense that doesn t mean that disease tracking is gone however surveillance efforts will continue to look at positivity rates disease rates and hospitalizations however the colorado department of public health and environment is using wastewater surveillance throughout colorado including eagle county harmon said this surveillance tool helps to identify changing trends in community virus levels earlier than just looking at case rates changes to testing in recent months largely following the december and january surge of omicron one of the main changes locally has been the availability of free public testing sites as covid 19 is shifting toward being endemic the testing resources continue to evolve to reflect changes in transmission and demand for testing the pandemic phase required more of a crisis response hence testing locations in parking lots throughout the county and availability five or more days each week harmon said with a disease that is more endemic state and local public health officials are working to shift more testing and vaccination resources back into traditional medical clinics in fact the colorado department of public health and environment recently has opted to close test sites in the region due to decreased demand as such starting july 1 the state department is consolidating eagle county test sites to one location under a new provider affinity eurofin at the eagle town park this location will be open three days a week for six hours a day offering free pcr testing and is acceptable for travel validation at local health care providers colorado mountain medical and vail health testing is still available however around six months ago when testing sites began to close the providers only started offering tests to those with symptoms as such walk in testing and travel testing are no longer available from these locations as harmon stated earlier this has led to an increased reliance on at home testing free at home tests are widely available for pickup throughout the county and online through the federal government in eagle county these pickup locations include the vail library vail fire eagle county government offices in avon eagle and el jebel as well as mail delivery via the u s postal service plus harmon added walgreens continues to provide testing and patient pay testing for travel is available in el jebel outside of the eagle county community center and even as many things change once a person tests positive for covid 19 guidelines remain the same we continue to ask anyone who tests positive for covid 19 to isolate per the cdc guidelines this remains an important prevention measure to reduce community spread harmon said to view the testing options which are changing on july 1 visit eaglecountycovid org vaccines the most recent change to covid 19 vaccines was the june 18 centers for disease control recommendation that all children between 6 months and 5 years old receive a covid 19 vaccine the centers for disease control and the federal drug administration authorized both pfizer a 3 dose series and moderna a 2 dose series for this age range several locations in the county are offering vaccines to this youngest age group including the eagle county public health and environment office locations in eagle and avon the state mobile vaccination bus and local pharmacies and healthcare providers according to a vail health spokesperson the health care provider is currently offering moderna for this age group with pfizer expected to be available soon as for everyone else being up to date on your covid 19 vaccinations is important to both protect you as well as our community harmon said the colorado department of public health and environment now has a vaccination calculator available to help determine how many doses are recommended for individuals this depends on pre existing conditions vaccine doses received and more this tool is available at covid19 colorado gov vaccine calculator for information on where to get vaccines in eagle county visit eaglecountycovid org even as eagle county pushes toward an endemic phase with covid 19 harmon added a reminder that testing and vaccine availability and administration is also impacted by other key challenges facing the community while the u s health care system is plagued with staffing shortages eagle county also has a severe affordable housing need that contributes to the challenges we have in filling positions for physical and behavioral health care providers as well as nearly all businesses in our mountain communities harmon said many actions are being taken by eagle county government and other local partners to increase the affordable housing stock but it won t alleviate some of the immediate service challenges within our communities

ryan p barrow a 39 year old helena man was cited for igniting a fire in a burn barrel without a permit setting off a three acre wildfire northwest of helena that burned for about three and a half hours the fire at three mile road northwest of mount helena started around 4 30 p m monday evening and lasted until about 8 p m two homes were evacuated and a third notification was given but they chose not to leave according to lewis and clark county sheriff leo dutton no structures were lost in the fire by the grace of god it came and burned right around one but it didn t start the home on fire dutton said about 40 people from the sheriff s office multiple volunteer fire departments the birdseye rural fire department and a helicopter from the montana department of natural resources and conservation responded to the blaze dutton said dutton said he was surprised to see a fire start this early in the season i thought we had a little bit more moisture in the ground than what we had but apparently not so that will cause me to confer with me my rural fire partners and evaluate whether we should close open burning or not he said philip higuera professor of fire ecology and paleoecology at the university of montana said he wouldn t put too much stock into what this fire means for the rest of the season i wouldn t use this one fire to extrapolate out we look at how dry fuels are at this point in the season and at this point our fuels are as wet or wetter than average so compared to previous years we are looking good for not having extensive wildfires with the very important caveat that this is when our weather patterns change all this can change if we have intense heat or if our precipitation turns off he said
developers pursue duplex project with affordable component for former williamstown grange site williamstown mass the owner of the former grange hall property on water street is looking to develop more than 20 sustainable energy efficient homes with a quarter of the owner occupied units set aside for residents earning up to 80 percent of the area median income last week alexander carlisle appeared before the board of the town s affordable housing trust to seek its support for the project in anticipation of an approval process that will involve the town waiving zoning regulations to allow the development carlisle and his wife purchased the 6 6 acre 584 water st property in 2005 with hopes of renovating the historic structure after it no longer served the local branch of the grange america s oldest advocacy group for agriculture the great recession in 2008 killed off initial interest that the couple had in such a project but the carlisles fallback position had been to subdivide the property into three single family residential lots but we realized building costs had become so high that there was simply no interest in it he told the board no one was asking to buy lots period even in the recent run up to the housing bubble there was no interest as well some of the fancier lots in town with great views they had to drop their lot prices which finally sold during this incredible time of housing pressure the carlisles pursued the idea of establishing a community supported agriculture farm on the property and communicated with williams college about locating faculty housing on the site before connecting with hicks stone and bill freeman who put together a plan to erect pre fabricated two family duplexes on helical piles on the site right now we have 22 units stone told the trustees it s conceivable we could get 26 the developers face two primary regulatory hurdles the first is a need for approval from the town s conservation commission which has jurisdiction over projects that occur near waterways like the green river which abuts the grange hall property the second is the town s zoning bylaw which would not allow that many residents on that size parcel that is where the affordable housing component comes in under chapter 40b of massachusetts general law local zoning can be waived to permit developments that include at least 25 percent affordable units six such income restricted units in the development currently under consideration in a community with less than 10 percent of its housing stock classified as affordable by the commonwealth basically income restricted housing chapter 40b development is allowed by law williamstown on the other hand is nearing the 10 percent threshold with recent developments that include 330 cole ave highland woods and 27 more planned units at the third phase of the cable mills development if the project stays at 22 units stone said he projects the market rate units to sell for about 750 000 the six units designated as affordable which would be indistinguishable from their neighbors in the complex would sell for 175 000 i ve taken the pittsfield area median income and calculated the monthly amounts for housing expenditure stone said at 70 percent it s 1 488 per month at 80 percent it s 1 700 per month at a sales price of 175 000 with an assumed down payment of 5 percent you end up with a monthly payment of about 1 684 a month which places it below the 80 percent threshold that number includes the homeowners association fees that would be associated with the planned duplexes the development includes a central green space for the residences in addition to the existing marsh land on the site my colleague bill freeman is very interested in pollinator pathways and natural landscaping stone said stone is a harvard trained architect with a firm in new york city who moved to williamstown as part of the covid diaspora he told the housing board in addition to an interest in preserving green space at the planned development he and freeman share a passion for sustainable architecture he said he shared that the duplexes under development would have maximum insulation and a fairly sophisticated heat recovery ventilator dehumidifier and heating and cooling unit made in canada by minotair he noted that energy efficiency will add to all of the units long term affordability our motto is planet people and profit with the emphasis on the planet and serving the people stone said i d love to see a combustion free net zero housing development with an affordable component in williamstown i hope this will be one step in a number of projects like this as for the existing grange hall carlisle said that over the years he has realized that any attempt to make the structure a fully functioning four season building would not be cost effective as someone who has been involved in historic preservation most of my career i know the process to take a building like that and turn it into a four season structure is so damaging to the original building structure that it s not advantageous to anyone to do that he said he said he is interested in finding alternate uses for the grange hall either on its current site or by disassembling and relocating the historic structure the cost of taking it down would be much less than the cost of conversion he said it s possible to repurpose it in a much more cost effective utilitarian manner carlisle said he was surprised when the developers expressed an interest in keeping the grange hall on the property and working around it but a decision one or another is still a ways off carlisle and his partners did not come to the affordable housing trust last wednesday with any specific requests and the trustees did not take any votes the developers did not give a timeline for when they would begin the formal process of seeking the wetlands and zoning approval they would need to break ground trustee daniel gura recommended that the group run the numbers to see whether an infusion of town funds either from the affordable housing trust or directly from the community preservation act allotments at next year s annual town meeting would help increase the number of affordable units in the project above the required 25 percent gura said they may find the number needed to move that needle is beyond the town s capacity to help but it is worth exploring the question gura also complimented the development team for pursuing a mixed income development the single most valuable and lasting way to create affordable housing is through mixed income he said the extracted value of those who are the low income recipients to be in a mixed neighborhood their outcomes vastly outweigh any other structure the data is staggering versus putting 50 low income people in one place is what we at habitat for humanity are doing nationwide i don t mind a 700 000 house next to a 175 000 house it sounds great to me stone told the board that based on conversations with some of the residents in the water street neighborhood there was support for the proposal but he acknowledged there could be some opposition when the time comes to go through the chapter 40b process i m told williamstown is not as nimby oriented as some other communities stone said is that your impression largely but not totally board chair tom sheldon replied

sacramento calif ap california lawmakers on wednesday were taking up a 308 billion state budget that will fund a democratic wish list of public spending on everything from expanded healthcare for immigrants and low income residents to giving taxpayers an inflation refund and helping more women access abortion care the centerpiece of the operating budget crafted by democratic gov gavin newsom and legislative leaders is 17 billion in new spending aimed at providing relief for the soaring inflation that has increased prices for most things notably gasoline about 23 million people will get cash payments of between 200 and 1 050 to help pay for gas which averaged more than 6 30 per gallon in california on tuesday how much people get will depend on how much they make only couples who make below 500 000 per year and single people who make below 250 000 per year will be eligible businesses will get 2 3 billion including a yearlong suspension of the state sales tax on diesel fuel that reduce costs by about 23 cents per gallon between 80 and 90 of diesel fuel customers in california are business owners according to the california department of finance the spending package represents the largest state budget i m not just talking about california but any state in the history of the u s said state sen nancy skinner a democrat from berkeley and chair of the senate budget and fiscal review committee meanwhile the state sales tax on gasoline the second highest in the nation at 51 1 cents per gallon will go up nearly another 3 cents on friday part of an annual recalculation to keep up with inflation republicans have tried in vain to convince democrats to suspend the sales tax for one year arguing it would benefit taxpayers faster than a rebate check the governor could have suspended the gas tax or stopped the gas tax increase that will happen on friday july 1 he did not said republican assemblymember vince fong vice chair of the assembly budget committee in the face of rising inflation californians will see more costs in their everyday lives despite all the governor s rhetoric newsom and democrats in the legislature say they don t want to suspend the state s tax on gasoline because they don t trust the big oil companies and refineries to pass on the savings to drivers they agreed to suspend the state tax on diesel fuel because that tax is calculated differently the budget also commits to making california the first state to provide free health care for all low income adults regardless of their immigration status california s medicaid program already covers people 50 and older and 26 and younger who are living in the country illegally the new spending plan will include everyone else at a cost of about 2 6 billion per year once fully implemented as the pandemic highlighted our individual health is tied to the health of our community and we all benefit when everyone has access to primary preventive and comprehensive care said jose torres policy and legislative advocate for health access california a consumer health care advocacy group now that the u s supreme court has overturned roe v wade california s budget also includes more than 200 million to support abortion clinics and other reproductive health care services the spending includes 40 million to cover abortions for women who can t afford them plus another 20 million for travel expense but only for travel within the state california s revenues have grown despite the pandemic largely because of a soaring stock market that has made the rich get richer in a state with a disproportionate number of millionaires and billionaires who pay higher tax rates than other states but the nonpartisan legislative analyst s office recently warned the economy is at a heightened risk of recession to prepare the budget proposal leaves the state with 37 2 billion in reserves

photo pilots protest outside the new york stock exchange credit air line pilots association airline pilot unions across the country are standing up for their rights in a wave of actions one thousand three hundred pilots with southwest airlines stood in the sun of dallas love field on june 22 as temperatures neared 100 degrees now hundreds of delta pilots are planning to picket in seven different airports alaska airlines pilots voted to authorize a strike last month and fedex pilots picketed on june 28 outside the fedex express air operations center at the center of these protests are outdated contracts dating back many years before covid and the inflation crisis as well as grueling schedules and chaotic work conditions the pilots demands are in line with other essential workers who were forced into unsafe working conditions during covid and now face economic instability from record inflation their bosses took money for relief and pocketed the profits during the pandemic pilots helped to keep the global economy afloat at great personal risk to themselves the companies they worked for took tens of billions in federal relief money but kept pilots and staff working on outdated contracts the federal government propped up these airlines to the tune of 54 billion in two years even as profits plummeted executives enjoyed immense luxury while passing austerity onto their workers southwest airlines increased compensation for all top level executives between 5 and 14 in 2020 with then ceo gary kelley raking in 9 2 million in compensation while the company lost 3 5 billion that year none of this wealth has been shared with the workers it was allegedly supposed to bail out during the worst of the pandemic many airlines offered buyout plans to pilots in order to cut back on staff rather than pay to retain workers airlines shrunk their workforce by 56 000 people by fall 2021 now that flights have increased again most airlines are severely short staffed leading to record numbers of flight cancellations tens of thousands of flights have been canceled in recent months alone the airline executives have even turned flight cancellations into a form of revenue in 2021 airlines refused to return 10 billion to customers for canceled flights despite federal aviation administration rules requiring these refunds airlines continue to offer flight schedules 11 months in advance despite knowing that they are understaffed now and not knowing what the future will hold airline workers and travelers alike are suffering because capitalism cannot plan for anything beyond the next fiscal quarter pilots are still working from an old contract with negotiations indefinitely suspended during covid it s been two and a half years since our contract became amendable and three and a half years since the delta pilots last had a pay raise meanwhile our quality of life has eroded due to management s unwillingness to schedule the airline properly said capt jason ambrosi chairman of the delta master executive council a unit of the air line pilots association southwest flight attendants are similarly working from a contract last updated in 2018 and the southwest airlines pilot association proposed a new contract which had been ignored 900 days before its last protest airlines are sacrificing everyone s well being and gambling with our lives swapa reports that pilots have dealt with hundreds of thousands of schedule changes while being asked to fly on their days off pilots are professionals and take their jobs seriously but this kind of extreme stress and overwork could have serious consequences meanwhile pilots are limited in the actions they can take airline labor agreements are governed by the railway labor act of 1926 the rla limits the authorization of strikes to major disputes concerning the terms of collective bargaining which it classifies differently than minor disputes over interpretation the act s structure is designed to limit disruptions to the flow of commerce airports are a historic battleground in the 40 year right wing offensive against labor rights beginning with ronald reagan s firing of 11 385 air traffic controllers in 1981 still alaska airlines made the decision to authorize a strike as an assertion of their rights and their willingness to fight rights are won through struggle pilots and all airline workers deserve good well paying jobs free from stress illness understaffing and workplace chaos these workers not the capitalists who pocketed billions of unearned wealth during the pandemic know how the airlines should be run

official website of cbd essence pros strong reputation 100 organic deal directly with the manufacturer family owned batches produced in small quantities cons out of stock a lot of times not ideal for newbies how we made this list when looking for the best cbd pills gel capsules ever since the government legalized hemp cbd products have been trending and many companies are making these products since they are available in abundance and every brand advertises its products as the best it is hard to find a trustworthy brand moreover not every brand opts for natural ingredients some add artificial ingredients to increase the potency leading to health hazards while choosing the best cbd capsules brands we set standards like value for money natural ingredients cbd made from us grown hemp and less than 0 3 thc while most brands filled the other criteria easily finding cbd capsules with only natural ingredients was hard what we looked for us grown hemp hemp from the usa is considered the best and the safest hemp with multiple terpenes that bring added health benefits usa regulatory authorities will not allow the use of imported hemp due to health issues we opted for brands that only use us hemp in their products also we checked their lab reports and ensured that the hemp is sourced from quality farms in the usa like colorado oregon or new york we removed any brand using imported hemp on our list regardless of how well the brand marketing was natural ingredients while artificial ingredients are cheap and bring quick and potent results they also cause adverse health issues since most people cannot distinguish between natural and synthetic ingredients they easily fall for the wrong product we only chose brands that use natural ingredients in their products natural ingredients not only bring long lasting results but also keep you safe we also checked if the products mention the proprietary blends in their product description we excluded any brand that did not disclose proper accuracy about its ingredients less than 0 3 thc thc is addictive so usa regulatory authorities only allow 0 3 of thc in any product a higher concentration of thc leads to overdose which leads to adverse side effects like anxiety hallucination and more we only chose products with less than 0 3 thc so you can get a little buzzed but will not lose your senses we checked each product√¢ s lab report to find those with the lowest thc concentration possible reasonable prices cbd products tend to get expensive as their potency increases since cbd capsules have high potency their price can reach the top so we chose brands that use some countermeasures to lower their customers prices factors to consider when buying cbd pills√¢ √¢ √¢ √¢ here are the essential factors you should consider while purchasing the best cbd capsules it would help if you looked at the product and the brand selling such a product so these factors target both brands and the products they sell certificate of analysis coa a coa is an indication that the company is providing safe products to its customers and the relevant authorities approve it you can always find the coa on the company√¢ s website if not you can contact customer support and they√¢ ll provide you with one if you cannot find the coa on the website and the company is not providing it consider it a red flag and choose another brand a coa contains three panels cannabinoid analysis heavy metals analysis and pesticides analysis these panels confirm the number of cannabinoids in the products how many heavy metals like cadmium lead arsenic and mercury are found in the product and what substances were used while growing and harvesting the hemp plant third party testing every company must test its cbd products before providing them to the customer these tests confirm the potency and the ingredients used in the final product test reports from the third party labs are unbiased and transparent if the company hides something from its customers these test resorts will present it to the public multiple potency finding a brand that offers multiple potencies on a single product is better so newbies and old users can enjoy them most companies do not follow this practice making it hard for people so they have to use alternate methods to control the dosage and potency customer reviews every brand will present itself as the best which is why reading the customer reviews will give a good idea of how legit the brand is if no reviews are available on the website you can check what people share about the brand on the trustpilot platform ratings are another quick way to see how satisfactory the product is never choose a cbd product that has less than 4 star ratings understand the product type cbd is available in full and broad spectrum variants full spectrum cbd is the most popular and it contains less than 0 3 thc providing a bit of a high feel to the users broad spectrum cbd has terpenes instead of thc to provide the same health benefits but you will not get high before choosing a product decide what kind of effects you want and the primary purpose of using cbd if you want relaxation and better sleep broad spectrum is an optimal choice but if you want to get buzzed enough to handle anxiety symptoms full spectrum would be better faqs on cbd oil capsules q1 how long does it take for cbd capsules to work it depends on your body and the capsule you use if you get soft gels they will not take more than 10 minutes to start working if you use a capsule with a hard shell it might take up to 40 minutes to dissolve and allow the cbd to enter your blood choose the type of capsule based on how quickly you want results as soft gels are perfect for everyday tasks and hard capsules are good for sleep q2 how many cbd capsules should i take the recommended dosage is one capsule when you feel like it but for the best results and savings it is better to use one capsule daily do not overdose to get fast and solid results as you will only get headaches and stomach pain always consult your doctor before using these products as cbd might not work for everyone q3 do cbd capsules make you feel high yes using the thc infused cbd capsules can make you high but you will not get the same feeling as alcohol since usa regulatory authorities will not allow the use of higher thc concentrations you will not get a solid high feeling from cbd q4 what are the side effects of using cbd capsules cbd has no adverse side effects and most of its side effects are associated with

labs and send them to third party labs these multiple tests ensure the final product s top quality making it safe for consumers they have strict rules not to allow artificial ingredients or additives near the final product you can find thc and thc free products on their website especially cbd oil capsules if you live in a state where thc is banned you can get a product with pure cbd and natural terpenes the price will remain the same even if you buy more capsules in one serving unless the company decides to keep the potency the same q7 do brands offer both thc infused and thc free capsules some brands offer thc infused cbd or pure cbd then we have some brands providing both of them and you can make a choice while purchasing you can opt for products with or without thc however the prices will not change it is an excellent option as it brings much convenience for the customer you would not have to go back and find the different cbd products if you chose the wrong one moreover you can

montville the town s planning and zoning commission approved its affordable housing plan in a 7 2 vote tuesday night the approval comes nearly a month late as connecticut municipalities had a june 1 deadline to approve such plans though there are no consequences for missing the deadline democrat chuck longton and republican anthony siragusa were the two commissioners who voted against the plan under title 8 of the connecticut general statutes municipalities are permitted to regulate land use through local zoning regulations which set the standards for what types of housing can be constructed per cgs 8 30j which was established in 2017 every municipality in the state must prepare and adopt or revise and adopt a plan to increase the available affordable housing within the municipality housing is considered to be affordable if an individual or family who earns 80 of a town s median income will spend no more than 30 of its income on housing in the norwich new london metro area 80 of the median income is 82 160 per year for a family of four so affordable housing would allow them to spend no more than 24 648 per year on housing including utilities taxes and associated costs currently 5 16 of the town s overall housing stock is deemed affordable qualified affordable housing created or maintained under government subsidies or programs is usually intended for occupancy by households earning no more than 80 of median income and typically has a 40 year deed restriction in order to keep the housing affordable according to the town s affordable housing plan the approved plan outlines six objectives the town s current strategies as well as additional strategies the town will implement increasing housing options for elderly residents by considering expanding support for the elderly disabled tax relief program and inventory town owned properties that could be suitable for development of housing supporting first time homeownership by considering a five year tax rebate program for first time homebuyers creating an information packet with information on homebuying and energy efficiency programs considering the use of grants or american rescue

performance measures including the number of new affordable housing units created and the percentage of renters and homeowners paying more than 30 of their income for housing as a way to see the plan through the commission has planned to create a standing affordable housing committee one person spoke during the public hearing in the council chambers at town hall before the commission voted nick gauthier a democratic member of waterford s representative town meeting commented on the depth of background information in the plan but he did not see a lot of plan moving forward he said he saw similar problems in waterford s plan it describes well where we are currently but i don t see a lot of how we re going to get to a sufficient amount of affordable housing stock overall gauthier said of the plan though montville s planning director liz burdick did not comment on gauthier s observation she made a point later in the meeting that progress is being made we already have two developments that are approved that will most likely have affordable housing because they are receiving federal funds burdick said in a recording of tuesday s meeting which along with all of the plan s documentation can be accessed on the town s website at bit ly mthousing22 the commission now has to wait for the plan to go through the state s office of policy and management before any real action can take place though the plan was approved by the commission and has promise burdick said it won t be easy to get private developers to commit to a 40 year deed restriction to prevent prices from fluctuating the state statute was put in place in response to the increased cost of housing across the state the percentage of renters who paid at least 30 of their income toward housing increased from 37 in 2000 to 46 in 2019 in southeastern connecticut one in four households earns less than 80 of the area median income and pays more than 30 of their income toward housing according to the town s affordable housing plan the covid 19 pandemic supply chain issues and the recent increase in gas prices have not helped either but burdick remains hopeful we re going through a little boom with housing she said the economy s picked up and people are actually building things k arnold theday com

oil shed its gains after a bullish crude inventory report was tempered by an unseasonal slowdown in gasoline demand west texas intermediate slipped under 110 a barrel after rising as high as 114 05 a barrel during the session a government report showed that us crude stocks fell as fuelmakers increased runs amid historically high refining margins meanwhile gasoline demand on a four week rolling average fell to the lowest seasonal level since 2014 with the exception of 2020 the slowdown in gasoline demand growth could be a sign that prices are starting to impact consumers said rebecca babin senior energy trader at cibc private wealth management however the outlook for oil is still strong she added demand is currently below seasonal averages but the key thing for crude is that it is still growing compounding concerns over supply tightness opec is expected to rubber stamp another modest supply later this week although the cartel has struggled to meet its targets this year the us has lobbied the production group to increase output and amos hochstein the state department s senior adviser for energy security said the us hopes opec will institute a further production increases oil is heading for the first monthly decline since november after being hit by fears of a global economic slowdown but prices still are about 50 higher this year while fears of a global economic slowdown have weighed on futures demand remains robust for now us retail gasoline prices remain near record highs causing pain for consumers a recovery from covid 19 and a shortage of refining capacity to make fuels continue to keep prices at record highs prices wti for august delivery dropped 1 98 to settle at 109 78 a barrel in new york brent for august settlement fell 1 72 to settle at 116 26 a barrel meanwhile libya s state oil company suspended shipments from two key eastern ports while iranian media said talks to revive a nuclear deal that could boost the country s supply ended wednesday with little effect output in ecuador also has been lower due to ongoing protests time spreads that help gauge market health are also flashing bullish signs as the vital north sea market that underpins much of the world s crude supply extended a recent surge dated to frontline swaps a measure of how tight north sea supplies are jumped to their highest level on record near 6 a barrel spreads were also supported by tightening supplies at the us s largest crude hub in cushing oklahoma where stockpiles fell to the lowest since 2014 the spread between the september and october contracts is near 3 a barrel as the market prices in the end of the spr release the us will assess the need for further releases of emergency reserve crude after october amos hochstein the state department s senior adviser for energy security said in a bloomberg television interview
the steep price tag san diego must pay to unwind all the damage caused by 2012 s proposition b pension cuts continues to grow nearly four years after the cuts were legally nullified by the state supreme court a new analysis nearly doubles the estimated cost from 81 million to 150 million and that doesn t include the impact of recent stock market losses because the new analysis uses data from before the downturn sharpened in april this story is for subscribers we offer subscribers exclusive access to our best journalism thank you for your support the new analysis also doesn t include the costs of creating retroactive pensions for hundreds of affected workers who have left their city jobs it only includes the costs to create retroactive pensions for employees still working for san diego advertisement proposition b was a ballot measure city voters approved in june 2012 it eliminated pensions for all new hires except police officers but courts ruled it was illegally placed on the ballot because city officials didn t negotiate the details with labor unions the new financial analysis comes just as the city heads into a crucial period for determining the final price tag for proposition b thursday is the deadline for thousands of workers affected by the cuts to decide whether they want retroactive pensions or to stick with the 401 k style accounts of those who have already chosen more than 90 percent want pensions those employees who want pensions will become part of the city s pension system july 9 and the balances of their 401 k style accounts will be determined and frozen sometime in late july probably july 24 or 25 those accounts will be frozen so they can be liquidated into cash and turned over to the city s pension system to cover part of the cost of retroactively creating pensions for those roughly 3 500 city workers that s why recent stock market losses could significantly balloon the city s costs to unwind proposition b beyond the 150 million estimate in the most recent analysis city officials plan to soften the costs of creating retroactive pensions for those workers with money from the 401 k accounts but those accounts have lost a lot of their value since the new analysis was completed based on april 15 data the standard poor s 500 a key financial index for pension funds has lost more than 15 percent of its value since mid april the stock market losses will create another problem they will increase the cost of court ordered penalties the city must pay to workers who lack pensions because of the proposition b cuts the courts ordered san diego to pay each employee a penalty of 7 percent of the difference between the value of the 401 k style plans and the value of a pension those amounts would have been much lower before the recent stock losses even before the stock losses the city s price tag had nearly doubled since january that was primarily a function of time because the january analysis was based on employee salary data and 401 k account balances from march 2021 since march 2021 employees affected by proposition b have gotten raises and accumulated more years of service toward a pension two things that make it more costly for the city to retroactively create pensions for them the april analysis created by the actuary who works for the city s pension system also sharply increases the estimate of how much the city must pay immediately tripling that amount from 14 9 million to 44 7 million according to the new analysis the city must pay 44 7 million upfront and add the remaining 105 2 million to the city s 2 95 billion pension debt some of the money must be paid immediately because that s required by the court rulings the board of the city s pension system the san diego city employees retirement system could decide to force the city to pay the entire bill upfront but city finance officials have expressed optimism the board will allow the bulk of the proposition b price tag to be smoothed like other significant new costs facing the pension system such as estimates that people will start living longer the pension system s next board meeting is scheduled for july 8 city officials have reached settlement agreements with multiple city labor unions this year over how to unwind proposition b including recent deals with firefighters lifeguards and deputy city attorneys firefighters and deputy city attorneys who don t have pensions because of proposition b must agree to give up their 401 k style accounts in exchange for a retroactive pension there are 444 city firefighters and 95 deputy city attorneys affected the city reached agreements in january with the municipal employees association which represents the city s white collar workers and local 127 of the american federation of state county and municipal employees which represents mostly blue collar workers employees in those unions can choose either a retroactive pension or to keep their 401 k style account workers represented by those two unions don t stay with the city for their whole careers as often as firefighters and deputy city attorneys do so for them pensions won t always be preferable to the 401 k style plans there are 2 100 mea workers affected and 846 local 127 workers affected the agreement reached by those unions also extends to 358 unrepresented workers but the unrepresented workers aren t entitled to the 7 percent penalty because they didn t participate in the litigation that eventually overturned proposition b lifeguards who are represented by california teamsters 911 are also not entitled to the 7 percent penalty because they also didn t participate in the litigation another additional cost the city is facing is possibly needing to create retroactive pensions for some of the 1 586 workers hired after proposition b who have since left their city jobs because they no longer work for the city many of them might not be interested in retroactive pensions but if they left for a job with a different government agency instead of a job in the private sector they could want a retroactive pension city officials are expected to begin contacting those workers and analyzing those potential costs in late august after they have completed calculations for employees affected by proposition b who still work for the city while the recent stock losses have cost the city millions in added costs to unwind proposition b the historically strong stock market since voters approved the pension cuts in 2012 has shrunk the city s costs by making the 401 k style accounts more valuable than officials expected 10 years ago proposition b language wasn t eliminated from the city charter until nearly three years after the state supreme court ruling the delay was because a state appeals court needed to determine the proper remedy for the supreme court s ruling that the proposition was illegally placed on the ballot because city officials failed to discuss it with labor leaders beforehand after the appeals court a superior court judge had to formally order the language removed from the charter under an archaic legal process called quo warranto that process concluded in february 2021

government reported that the economy shrank at a 1 6 annual pace in the first three months of the year its third and final estimate for gdp in the first three months of 2022 that figure was in line with previous estimates and economists expect growth to resume later this year investors have been closely watching economic data as they try to determine how deeply inflation is hurting consumers and businesses while also keeping an eye on the federal reserve s aggressive shift to raise interest rates the central bank is raising rates in an attempt to slow economic growth enough to temper inflation but wall street is wary that the fed could go too far and push the economy into a recession those concerns have been heightened by a series of reports showing a slowdown in retail sales and other indicators consumers were held up as being resilient in the face of rising prices earlier this year but that sentiment has faded said liz ann sonders chief investment strategist at charles schwab the latest gdp revision shows that consumer spending which accounts for about two thirds of economic output was substantially weaker than the government had calculated earlier growing at a 1 8 annual pace instead of the 3 1 it estimated in may not only is recession the base case but i think it already may have begun sonders said fed chair jerome powell speaking wednesday at a european central bank forum in sintra portugal repeated his hope that the fed can achieve a so called soft landing raising interest rates just enough to slow the economy and rein in surging consumer prices without causing a recession and sharply raising the unemployment rate but he said the path to achieving that goal has become more difficult and there s no guarantee the central bank can tame runaway inflation without hurting the job market lingering supply problems and a sharp jump in demand as the pandemic faded sparked a rise in inflation it has grown worse through the year as supply chain problems worsened following new lockdowns in china to help control covid 19 cases russia s invasion of ukraine in february sent energy prices higher and resulted in record high gasoline prices that

skwentna 200 snowmobile race the native youth olympics and the arctic encounter symposium the largest annual arctic policy event held in the united states president s message donlin gold s largest drill program in more than 10 years progressing ahead of schedule the prime focus of our activities this year is to undertake a 34 000 meter drill program with tight spaced grid drilling as well as in pit and ex pit exploration and to input the results from this drilling into the geologic modelling and interpretation work that is being used for updated resource models in addition to the engineering studies being undertaken this program will as a whole enable commencement of an updated feasibility study the donlin gold total 2022 expenditures are anticipated to be 60 million of which novagold s portion is 50 the budget also supports the advancement of environmental activities and finances community and external affairs efforts following the excellent results of 2021 we are encouraged by the significant drill program for 2022 with drilling also focused on upside prospects in the acma and lewis pits where drilling so far has been limited in the second quarter 2022 the team of 150 people at donlin gold are advancing drilling activities at a good pace with more than 70 of the planned drilling completed to date we expect the first set of assay results from the 2022 drill program to be issued this summer the health and safety of our workforce both at novagold and at donlin gold is a priority both novagold and donlin gold have implemented strict safety protocols and covid 19 mitigation measures are still in place at donlin gold to ensure the staff rotations in and out of the camp are conducted in both an efficient and safe manner the 2021 drill program results are being incorporated into updated geologic and resource models as well as mining schedules and life of mine business plans ahead of the update to the feasibility study which is expected to commence in 2022 subject to a formal decision by the donlin gold llc board onwards and upwards donlin gold is fortunate to enjoy time tested partnerships with calista and tkc owners of the mineral and surface rights respectively the project s location on private land specially designated for mining activities through the 1971 alaska native claims settlement act ancsa constitutes a key attribute that distinguishes it from most other mining assets in alaska our longstanding commitment to meaningful tribal consultation throughout project development and permitting has been demonstrated over decades of reliable and dependable engagement with the community page 2 and it shows donlin gold received its federal permits in 2018 and most of the key state permits are also in place this represents a tremendous achievement and the product of a substantial undertaking over many years to ensure a diligent thorough transparent and inclusive process for all involved including stakeholders from the y k region on

adec to be in place when the extension of the current permit expires in mid 2023 we anticipate that adec will issue a draft of the new permit for public comment in the second half of 2022 we are also working with the adnr the u s bureau of land management and our alaska native corporation partners on re locating certain public easements and rows in the mine and transportation facility areas for public safety purposes alternate routes will be constructed and available before any existing planned routes are closed some of which are not passable during much of the year we anticipate that the proposed re locations will be issued for public comment sometime in 2022 donlin gold working with its native corporation partners continues to support the state of alaska to advance other permits and certificates for the project the field work related to the issuance of the alaska dam safety certificates is expected to recommence during the second half of 2022 or the first half of 2023 native corporation participation and consistent community engagement novagold prides itself on having been a longstanding leader in esg we are committed to delivering long term value to all our stakeholders through responsible mining the protection of human life good stewardship of the environment and adding value to the local communities in which we operate donlin gold s native corporation partners calista and tkc provide valuable insight about their region way of life culture and ancsa mandate under which the donlin gold lands were selected and set aside for mining activities to promote the economic prosperity of their shareholders as private landowners calista and tkc are committed to developing a mining operation that is consistent with the elders vision of responsible development one that creates jobs and economic benefits for the communities while mitigating impacts to the environment and protecting local culture page 3 in the second quarter donlin gold participated in and sponsored multiple local events with calista and tkc providing a wide range of critical support and engagement activities throughout the y k region this encompassed a broad array of projects including the signing of a new shared value statement with stony river a village in the y k region for a total of nine shared value statements to date akiak sleetmute kalskag napaimute crooked creek napaskiak nikolai tuluksak and stony river in addition we undertook numerous educational environmental and social initiatives to help support villages such as working with tkc to charter flights with drinking water to red devil one of the local communities on the kuskokwim river following a flood in may as a result of the ice breakup that temporarily contaminated local water wells supporting the skwentna 200 snowmobile race and sponsoring the lower kuskokwim school district s annual college and career fair with 30 vendors and 89 students attending the virtual event additionally donlin gold sponsored statewide events including the native youth olympics and the arctic encounter symposium the largest annual arctic policy event in the united states donlin gold was also the principal sponsor of the 50th anniversary of the iditarod the 1 000 mile sled dog race often referred to as the last great race this event holds a special connection with the gold rush days in alaska and is a reconstruction of the freight route to nome through which much needed supplies as well as news from afar were once delivered in march 2022 49 mushers and their dogs participated in the race with numerous volunteers and veterinarians to support and care for the mushers and dogs along the various checkpoints a rare high quality gold asset in a jurisdiction that welcomes responsible development in our view donlin gold is a rare gold development asset the reason for such a unique status beyond providing investors with pure leverage to gold lies in the project s key attributes namely size no gold mine ever began production with 39 million ounces in measured and indicated resources inclusive of proven and probable mineral reserves scale expected to be a million ounce per year producer with a projected mine life of at least 27 years low cost anticipated to be one of the lowest cost producers due to the high grade large scale open pit grading 2 24 grams per tonne2 or twice the industry average for an open pit project3 growth excellent exploration potential beyond the planned 27 years of production with defined resources located on only three kilometers of an eight kilometer mineralized belt which itself represents less than 5 of the total land package and jurisdiction having the good fortune of being located in alaska one of the safest jurisdictions in the world on private land specifically designated for mining by our partners calista and tkc it is our belief that donlin gold is poised to become the greatest gold story in the development space we have protected these resources substantially de risked donlin gold over many years committed to responsible mining dedicated to building trust and transparency and continuing to work to find ways to improve and enhance the project as well as building a legacy ___________________________ 2 donlin gold data as per the 2021 technical report and s k 1300 report both as defined herein donlin gold possesses measured resources of

every year the growers will bring their frizzy headed fennel bulbs to the farmers market and then they ve got some explaining to do the customers wish to buy this attractive vegetable but they have no idea what to do with it maybe they ve brought one home before only to be stumped and are now twice shy so they ask what do you do with fennel the answers are well worn we are told to grill it braise it saut√© it with garlic and olive oil and other ways to cook the life out of it because few have the confidence to suggest we eat it raw ari levaux fennel and arugula salad in the center at the atlantic cafe in edgertown massachusetts the licorice like flavor can be intimidating you may not think that you want bite after bite that s why we drench it in sauce and try to cook it out but when we look forward to grilling season it isn t for the grilled fennel and any cooking technique will ruin some of its better qualities cooking is like a forced aging what s the hurry if you really want to try braising fennel start with the stumps you cut off the bottom when trimming the bulbs i look for ways to make the most of its stronger qualities and putting that aromatic juicy crispness to work salads for the most part a plate of mere slices sprinkled with salt and drizzled with extra virgin olive oil make a lovely snack fennel may rarely make it as a main course but as a side it can play an important part in a stellar meal whether in coleslaw or some other raw salad like form fennel really shines alongside seafood at the atlantic cafe in edgartown massachusetts last week i had a fennel and arugula salad served alongside octopus a few days later i served mint fennel coleslaw alongside an eight pound bluefish that my son reeled in i added shreds of mint to round out the fennel fragrance with more complexity and to make it taste less like a piece of black licorice cabbage based coleslaw might just be a thing of the past the city of marathon after which the race is named is itself named after fennel which translates to maratho in greek while marathon literally means place with mucho fennel unsplash this might just be a coincidence but it nonetheless teases the imagination that it might be connected to longevity it s high in nutrients and fiber and low in calories which is a good thing unless you re starving fennel also aids in digestion by reducing bowel inflammation and it is thought to suppress gas causing bacteria in the gut were none of this true it wouldn t change how i feel about this crunchy zesty plant or how it performs alongside fish now that i know what to do with fennel i no longer fear it instead it s the fennel that needs to be afraid of me to cut a fennel bulb first slice off the bottom where the roots were attached and the stalks right as they emerge green from the white bulb the stalks themselves aren t good for much except in the stock pot but the thin leaves often called fronds make a nice garnish and also work as a fresh herb i add the chopped fronds to my coleslaw for the lovely green capillaries in the coleslaw that double down on that fabulous fennel flavor slice it in half top to bottom and lay the flat sides down many people cut out the core in the middle but i don t understand why it tastes like the rest of the plant and might be more tender slice the halves thinly in the same top to bottom direction you can go with those slices or hold the sliced half bulb in place and cut the slices crosswise into dice sliced or diced on fish or your favorite dish fennel is your greek friend it doesn t speak english but now you know enough to communicate in fennelese fennel slaw fennel coleslaw is so simple that no recipe is even required you can simply add it to your favorite coleslaw recipe or substitute it for some or all of the cabbage my recipe below involves no cabbage but rather a bouquet of fragrant herbs to compliment the fennel aroma my choice is parsley and mint but you could also mess around with basil dill and chives all in generous quantities 1 fennel bulb trimmed and grated into large shreds 1 medium sized carrot shredded large onion sliced thinly 2 cloves garlic shredded small cup white balsamic vinegar cup mayo 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon pepper 1 cup chopped parsley 2 tablespoons minced mint up chopped fennel fronds combine all the ingredients taste and adjust as necessary serve with fish or anywhere coleslaw is served

u s department of justice doj deputy attorney general lisa monaco presented a new policy at a securities industry and financial markets association event that requires chief compliance officers cco to certify that compliance programs have been reasonably designed to prevent anti corruption violations 1 the policy is an outgrowth of a settlement involving us 1 billion in criminal and civil penalties imposed on mining giant glencore international ag glencore after it pleaded guilty to bribery and market manipulation charges 2 according to monaco this new policy is meant to ensure that ccos stay in the loop on potential company violations and have the necessary resources to prevent financial crime 3 while the expressed intention of this new policy is to empower ccos it has raised concerns about potential liability for ccos glencore settlement glencore is among the largest companies that dominate global trading of oil fuel metals minerals and food 4 in 2018 glencore was subject to a multi year investigation by the doj for violations of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and a commodity price manipulation scheme 5 according to admissions and court documents filed in the southern district of new york glencore acting through its employees and agents engaged in a scheme for over a decade to pay more than us 100 million to third party intermediaries in order to secure improper advantages to obtain and retain business with state owned and state controlled entities a significant portion of these payments were used to pay bribes to officials in nigeria cameroon ivory coast equatorial guinea brazil venezuela and the democratic republic of the congo 6 glencore resolved the government s investigations by entering into a plea agreement plea agreement 7according to the plea agreement glencore admitted to one count of conspiracy to violate the fcpa 8 shaun teichner the general counsel for the company told a federal judge in new york that glencore knowingly and willingly entered into a conspiracy to violate the foreign corrupt practices act by making payments to corrupt government officials 9 glencore expects to pay about us 1 billion to u s authorities after accounting for credits and offsets payable to other jurisdictions and agencies and about us 40 million to brazil 10 a related payment by glencore to the united kingdom will be finalized after a hearing next month 11 the plea agreement requires that glencore among other things 1 implement two independent compliance monitors one in the united states and one abroad to prevent the reoccurrence of crimes 2 retain a compliance monitor for three years and 3 have its chief executive officer ceo and cco submit a document certifying to the doj s fraud section that the company has met its compliance obligations the cco certification requirement or the certification 12 why the cco certification requirement has raised concerns the cco certification requirement has raised concerns in the compliance space over potential increases in cco liability 13 specifically compliance officials worry that this policy transfers corporate liability into potential individual liability for the cco the certification form asks the ceo and cco to certify that the compliance program has been reasonably designed to prevent future anti corruption violations 14 critics worry that these new certifications may discourage ccos from taking jobs at companies that are or may be parties to agreements with the doj 15 the doj stated that liability will depend on the facts and circumstances of the case but that the new policy is not aimed at going after ceos or ccos 16 assistant attorney general kenneth a polite jr stated if there is a knowing misrepresentation on the part of the ceo or cco then that could certainly result in some form of personal liability 17 depending on the circumstances the doj may consider it a breach of the corporation s obligations under the plea agreement if there is either a misrepresentation in one of these certifications or a failure to provide the same 18 polite added that the certification memorializes the company s commitment to take its compliance obligations seriously 19 critics question how realistic the cco certification requirement is for large multinational companies 20 they also question the due diligence required to actually ensure that compliance programs are reasonably designed especially for companies operating in over 50 countries would it be realistic to expect a cco or ceo to keep tabs on compliance across their company with that level of specificity 21 what the c suite and board should consider moving forward the questions to consider are 1 where will the expressed policy lead and 2 how do we best prepare for the certification the doj has specifically stated its intention to prosecute the individuals who commit and profit from corporate malfeasance 22 regardless of monaco s comments the certification appears to create potential for an extension of that policy the fact of the policy gives rise to a number of subsidiary questions is the certification which targets foreign corrupt practices a harbinger for other such certifications in areas such as health care fraud defense contractor fraud money laundering etc and is doj gearing toward providing its prosecutors with more tools for individual culpability at the highest corporate levels consistent with its expressed policy moving forward in house counsel should work with the ceo and cco to consider areas of corporate business practices that are specifically subject to compliance programs they should develop practices including auditing tracking training and reviewing to ensure the programs are reasonably designed to prevent future wrongdoing further they should be sure to document their corporate business practices obviously these programs become much more complex when operations include foreign jurisdictions and foreign laws with respect to matters such as privacy and employee rights although this process may not be new to protect corporations from criminal charges the newly announced policy will certainly focus the spotlight on ceos and ccos in the fcpa context and arguably beyond 1 al barbarino doj defends new cco certifications amid industry worry law360 may 26 2022 2 id 3 id 4 chris strohm chris dolmetsch jack farchy glencore pleads guilty to

after months of weekly meetings a group of st paul tenants landlords homeowners and housing experts delivered a handful of broad ideas for honing the rent control ordinance voters approved last year now the policy s fate lies in the hands of elected officials who will decide if and how to amend the law capping annual residential rent increases at 3 according to a 36 page report from the university of minnesota s center for urban and regional affairs cura which facilitated the task force s conversations 60 of members support a policy that would exempt new housing construction from the law for 15 years and allow landlords to bank rent increases below 3 for future years they also said they would like a law that prevents renters from being evicted without just cause a majority of group members also supported allowing landlords more flexibility to raise rents in between tenants though the report did not specify how that would work in february mayor melvin carter appointed members of the 39 person group which he tasked with suggesting tweaks to st paul s rent control ordinance that would balance the city s desire for equity and growth minnesota s capital city became the first in the midwest to implement rent control when voters passed an ordinance by ballot initiative in november a 1984 state law prohibits local governments from enacting rent regulations unless approved in a general election st paul s ordinance is considered among the most stringent policies of its kind because it does not allow landlords to raise rents once a tenant moves out does not exempt new construction and is not tied to inflation upon passage the law immediately drew warnings from developers and property owners who said rent control will exacerbate st paul s existing housing shortage calls for changes to the ordinance drew backlash from supporters who have said amendments defy the will of the electorate community divisions were captured in the group s at times heated conversations the task force met virtually and for the first eight weeks learned about different rent control policies in other parts of the country they also gathered public feedback in a survey and online hearing i doubt that the process created political consensus that will bring anyone together who disagreed about rent control bill lindeke a member of the task force wrote on the twin city sidewalks blog members expressed some confusion about the process in which they voted on policy recommendations some of which were handled as package deals while other aspects were considered individually i feel disappointed that we probably did not provide the city council or the mayor s office with information to help make a good decision around this said rich holst who owns rental properties in st paul and served on the task force tram hoang who led the campaign to implement rent control said she has some concerns about the task force s recommendations including the proposed exemption for new housing which she says could incentivize property owners to tear down older buildings which are generally more affordable am i happy about every piece of the recommendations i don t think anyone is that s what compromise looks like said hoang who called cura s report an excellent foundation for policymakers carter on wednesday said he had not yet read the full report but he plans to work with the council on next steps what we said from the beginning is we want to be really open and really hear from the diverse group of stakeholders who came and sat around the table the mayor said policy changes would likely not take effect until more than a year after the ballot measure s passage to mitigate the risk of legal challenges though the ordinance is already being tested in court earlier this month a pair of property owners filed a federal lawsuit alleging the law violates their constitutional due process and property rights sanneh foundation founder tony sanneh who co chaired the task force called the process challenging but he pointed to the unanimous approval of a 12 point set of rent stabilization objectives which ranged from providing stability to tenants to encouraging the maintenance of st paul s rental housing stock as a success we all have a goal of what we want the city to look like and we want everyone to thrive from tenants to landlords sanneh said the question is is it too utopian to actually do
fixes looks at solutions to social problems and why they work my wife told me to sell the boats says brad pettinger a longtime trawl fisherman in the pacific northwest but i said honey who s gonna buy them at that time we just didn t have anything the anything was fish to catch fifteen years ago america s vast 50 million pacific groundfish fishery which stretches some 1 200 miles from southern california to the canadian border collapsed several critical species from the spiky orange canary rockfish to the large lingcod had dropped to below one quarter of their natural un fished levels sharp restrictions were brought in and the fishery was officially declared an economic disaster many fishermen found themselves stranded and facing bankruptcy it was a perfect example of too many trawlers chasing too few fish says pettinger who is now director of the oregon trawl commission it was a dark time it s a situation that has been repeated around the world as overfishing habitat destruction and climate change cause fish to disappear from the oceans at alarming rates according to the united nations food and agriculture organization 90 percent of fish stocks are being exploited at or beyond their maximum sustainable levels overfishing is often seen as a classic case of what economists call the tragedy of the commons clearly fishing communities have a collective interest in making sure marine life sticks around but it s in each boat s individual interests to grab as much as possible as soon as possible once a fishery has broken down fixing it is fraught with difficulties photo hostility and distrust among the fishing industry environmentalists and regulators means progress is often glacial rules to limit how much is caught can be hard to implement and often backfire for example when quotas force fishermen to discard thousands of tons of perfectly edible fish yet since the turn of the 21st century something remarkable has happened in united states waters after decades of shrinking fish populations some trends have begun to shift the number of overfished stocks in federally managed fisheries has dropped by two thirds from 92 in 2000 to 29 in 2015 meanwhile the tally of federally managed fish populations that have been rebuilt went from zero to 39 what brought this change according to jane lubchenco the former head of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration n o a a the first piece of the puzzle was a new law with teeth and timetables we d had legislation with good language about ending overfishing for decades she says but fears about the economic impact of greater restrictions on fishing kept the legislation ineffective so the problem kept getting worse an amendment in 2007 to the 30 year old magnuson stevens fishery conservation and management act marked a big departure from this it mandated that by 2011 every federally managed fishery had to have a scientifically determined legally enforced annual catch limit and a management plan for how it would stick to it it was the culmination of years of work by dozens of groups inside and out of government but according to margaret spring who worked for senator daniel k inouye a democrat from hawaii at the time and is now chief conservation officer at the monterey bay aquarium an essential ingredient for success was strong bipartisan support and relationships particularly with the bill s sponsor senator ted stevens republican of alaska i didn t work for senator stevens i m a democrat right says spring but i was practically staffing him i was writing the bill the fact that the new catch limits were determined by science rather than economics or politics was a breakthrough says spring you can t skip the science you can t say i know the science says this but i m going to allow a higher catch because it s convenient or i need it for my community however good catch limits are only the start the real challenge is for managers to devise a plan that allows them to stick to these limits without sinking the fishing industry traditional techniques often fall short on this front cutting the length of the fishing season for example can encourage boats to enter into a frantic race to catch as much as they can before the fishery is shut down this can lead to missed targets and ultimately even shorter seasons for an industry already on its knees in the alaskan halibut fishery in the early 1990s the fishing season was reduced to a few perilous and chaotic 24 hour derby style openings one tool designed to fix this lose lose situation is known as a catch share under this system each boat is given a long term share say 5 percent of the total annual quota to give the fleet a strong vested interest in rebuilding fish stocks as lubchenco explains if you have 5 percent of the pie you d like to see the pie grow several fisheries including the pacific groundfish fleet adopted catch share programs also called individual fishing quotas as part of their plan to meet the new catch limits the total number of federal fisheries using catch shares rose from five in 2000 to 16 in 2015 giving fishermen a business incentive to fish sustainably can unleash their creative capacity to help solve the problem says shems jud pacific regional director of oceans at the environmental defense fund on the west coast members of the groundfish trawler fleet have worked with universities nongovernmental organizations and net makers to design and adopt more targeted trawl nets volunteered to create protected no take zones warn one another if an overfished species appears in a new area and have independent observers monitoring their catch on every trip the fleet has also become a valuable source of ecological knowledge as part of an unusual collaboration between environmental groups and the trawling industry which aims to improve vulnerable habitat protection while reopening some less sensitive areas to fishing once we established trust fishermen would bring decades of information to our meetings says jud some of them would even bring their old plotter charts with handwritten notations what we could glean from that material was a much finer scale assessment of where the sensitive coral sponge and rocky reef habitats really were compared with just using the n o a a essential fish habitat database the project has resulted in a 155 page proposal to the fishery s managers which the authors hope will be a boon for both the beleaguered marine environment and the struggling fishing industry unintended bycatch in the west coast groundfish fishery has gone from around 20 percent to under 5 percent under the new management system and in 2014 the marine stewardship council certified the fishery as sustainable and well managed noting that it was the most diverse and complex fishery it had ever assessed a consumer website and app seafood watch has also upgraded 21 west coast groundfish species in its sustainability rankings we ve shown we can be responsible stewards says pettinger catch shares have also brought business benefits by making fishers individually accountable for their annual catches giving them the flexibility to trade their allowances and allowing them to plan better no longer do we have to throw something over because we caught a little too much only to try to catch it again next week says paul kujala a fisherman he adds however that catch restrictions and high costs mean that much of the fleet has yet to see real increases in income related more from fixes read previous contributions to this series on a national level research suggests that catch shares lead to overall improvements in economic efficiency increase revenue and reduce waste and lead to more stable although not larger fish populations and catches a study published last month argues that modified versions of the tactics used successfully in the united states could help a majority of the world s fisheries recover in the next 10 years catch shares are not always the right solution however and they remain very controversial in some quarters for example the system can lead to consolidation with bigger more efficient boats buying up smaller boats shares an outcome that can devastate small fishing towns christopher costello a resource economist from the university of california santa barbara argues that many pitfalls can be avoided through good design consolidation isn t necessarily a bad thing but if that s something you want to avoid you can put in a cap he says for example in the alaskan halibut fishery catch share nobody can own more than 1 5 percent of the total quota quotas can also be allocated to community trusts and co ops to protect small scale fishers but what happens if despite everything the fish just don t come back this is the situation facing those trying to manage new england s iconic atlantic cod population which has hit a 40 year low despite scientifically set catch limits and a catch share program it s one of the 29 federally managed fish stocks that have so far failed to bounce back a major reason in this case is climate change specifically rapid and extraordinary warming in the gulf of maine that is interfering with cod spawning and survival as the oceans warm good fishery management and conservation are likely to become more challenging and more important back on the west coast fishers and nongovernmental organizations are still working together on bringing the fish and the industry that relies on them back to health representatives from both groups would now like to see some outdated regulation scrapped and are exploring the possibility of replacing human observers with electronic monitoring which is less expensive fishermen are very good at looking at the problem and fixing it if they have the tools in the toolbox to do it says pettinger we have the potential to land 40 million pounds of rockfish next year that s something that hasn t happened in 20 years it shows great promise sylvia rowley is a freelance british journalist and filmmaker she covers environmental solutions for al jazeera s program earthrise
unrelenting high temperatures and drought conditions are taking their toll on texas crop production texas a m agrilife photo by laura mckenzie lee tarpley ph d agrilife research plant physiologist beaumont said the recent heat wave arrived at a bad time for rice fields along the gulf coast the triple digit temperatures coupled with lingering drought conditions are also likely to negatively impact other crops during sensitive production stages all plants and vegetation experience heat stress when daytime and nighttime temperatures hit extreme highs like texas has experienced over recent weeks heat and drought can stress plants damage their cell membranes and disrupt metabolic efficiency during processes like photosynthesis and respiration tarpley said but the combination of high daytime and nighttime temperatures can economically damage commodity crops especially during sensitive growth periods like flowering he said the period of high temperatures came so early that it will likely hit a lot of crops when they are most sensitive he said high temperatures influence plant function for example tarpley said the cotton fields endured 100 plus degree days above normal nighttime temperatures and less than optimal soil moisture levels at bloom the convergence of conditions is likely to translate into aborted squares and thus fewer pounds per acre or discounted gradings rice and other grains experience similar yield loss under stressful conditions but differently heat and moisture stress lead to reduced seed set and grain fill as heat leads to oxidative stress and can damage flower parts and developing reproductive structure high temperatures can also negatively impact the viability of pollen which can influence how the ultimate crop sets and fills out tarpley said texas watermelon and cantaloupe producers reported pollination viability issues due to high temperatures earlier this season pollen development is a heat sensitive period for rice and some other crops he said that stage precedes flowering by 10 14 days and it was in the upper 90s during the day which is rare for beaumont so i expect there to be some impact on pollen development in rice fields some later planted crops like corn and cotton in the texas plains could also be more susceptible to the recent heat wave especially in drier areas and if hot dry conditions persist tarpley said texas a m agrilife extension service reports indicate dryland acres in drought stricken parts of the state were suffering even before the recent heat wave many planted crop acres have not emerged and were replanted with other crops that were also showing signs of drought stress or have not emerged water restrictions as drought deepens tarpley said he is concerned about water restrictions due to drought and their impact on irrigated crops including rice which needs shallow flooded fields restrictions could inhibit water pumping from canals as fields dry down nitrogen fertilizer becomes volatile in the heat and decreases its availability further contributing to production losses related to the input cost and the ultimate reduction in yield potential we ve heard some reports of anticipated lower yields in rice but nothing alarming so far he said the question for rice is keeping the fields flooded which comes down to water availability water restrictions are also a concern for other parts of the state including west and south texas pecan and cotton producers in west texas rely on water from the elephant butte reservoir in new mexico which has provided limited water some crops in that area have received effluent water from el paso the rio grande valley which produces a wide range of crops relies on water released from lake amistad near del rio and falcon lake south of laredo but reservoir capacities have been declining lake amistad sits just above 36 capacity while falcon lake is just under 16 full agrilife extension district reporters compiled the following summaries a map of the 12 texas a m agrilife extension districts central record hot conditions continued with no rainfall there were 20 100 plus degree days reported so far crop drought stress continued with virtually no soil moisture watering restrictions were now in effect corn crops were burning up rapidly and otherwise showing widespread insufficient kernel fill sorghum was coloring and declining but fields were still holding on cotton looked good and most fields were flowering pastures and rangelands were in poor condition stock tanks were becoming drastically low and local ranchers were purchasing hay bales to supplement pasture growth there were reports of round bales selling for 150 each with some reaching 200 some culling of beef herds was occurring due to the high feed and forage costs rolling plains extreme heat dried out soil moisture daytime temperatures reached beyond 100 degrees sudan grass looked good but was starting to die back some crop fields were burned up and plowed under wind heat and drought were taking a toll on the few acres of cotton that emerged some cotton reached the nine node vegetative stage with no pest issues and good beneficial insect populations sorghum fields had good beneficial insect numbers present as well corn and sorghum fields were declining weekly in some areas and yields were expected to suffer peanuts looked good cattle were being fed cake and supplemental feed bermuda grass fields had some green but grasses were dry most of the hay fields were cut and baled but producers will be lucky to get two cuttings based on their condition hay supplies were tight and expensive some crops burned up and needed to be plowed under coastal bend hot and dry weather persisted and soil conditions were extremely dry most corn fields were nearing full maturity and some producers were harvesting sorghum was close to harvest with some harvest beginning on early planted fields cotton fields were short and maturing at an accelerated rate due to heat and drought rice was heading out all crop yields were expected to be low due to extreme drought rangeland and pasture conditions continued to decline and forage supplies were tightening as supplemental feeding continued livestock on rangeland were finding mesquite beans which were helping to hold condition many producers were selling calves early and culling cows to conserve the remaining grass the livestock market was holding up under the increased number of cattle being sold the short term weather pattern showed an increased chance of rainfall east drought conditions worsened as very little to no rainfall was reported several counties implemented burn bans high temperatures and lack of moisture halted grass growth and drastically slowed hay production pasture and rangeland conditions varied from very poor to good subsoil and topsoil conditions were short to very short many producers were culling herds due to input costs livestock were in fair to good condition creek and pond levels were dropping and caused concern about water supplies horse flies were a problem south plains dry conditions continued across the district some counties reported some showers that could provide relief for rangelands much of the dryland cotton across the district was in poor to fair condition some irrigated cotton was starting to square cattle were on supplemental feed across the district irrigated corn was in fair condition panhandle soil moisture was short wheat harvest continued but very little wheat was being harvested due to drought and yields were low on surviving acres corn was doing well under irrigation dryland crops were suffering under extreme heat and drought isolated showers helped in those areas but significant widespread rains were needed overall rangeland and pasture conditions were poor and crop conditions were poor to fair north soil moisture was short following two weeks of 100 plus degree temperatures and sustained winds hit and miss rain showers did not help soil moisture levels some counties were under burn bans producers were cutting hay but only reporting one third of their normal production pastures continued to decline the sorghum crop looked good and appeared to be tolerating the dry heat rain in the next few weeks will be necessary for the sorghum to finish strong some corn was dying back prematurely due to the lack of moisture soybeans looked good but late planted fields were struggling cattle were in good condition parasite and fly loads were decreasing goat kidding was going well west central conditions were dry and temperatures remained over 100 degrees cotton was growing but most fields were spotty depending on when they were planted and moisture levels at planting hay fields were in trouble with many dollars invested the pecan crop did not look promising at all insect pests were increasing culling increased for all livestock but the cattle market was holding steady southwest conditions were extremely dry and windy with temperatures in the 100s irrigated crops were still in good shape corn was drying fast and many fields were being made into hay sorghum turned color rangelands were very dry and being de stocked supplemental feeding of livestock continued a local sale barn reported lower sale volumes due to the lack of cattle in the area prices were still fair as producers continued to reduce numbers fawn survival rates were questionable due to the heat and lack of vegetation local rivers and creeks were at historical lows tanks were drying up south most areas reported short soil moisture levels while others reported very short to adequate conditions all areas reported high temperatures including daytime highs above 100 degrees winds and heat were hurting irrigation applications vegetable crop production declined significantly and row crop conditions were declining as well producers were preparing row crop fields for harvest peanut planting was completed and early planted fields were pegging corn fields were denting and coloring and sorghum was showing signs of moisture stress sugarcane aphid numbers were increasing in sorghum

bed bath beyond faces long odds as it attempts to return to profitability while contending with rapidly changing consumer habits and the highest u s inflation in 40 years mark tritton was supposed to be the savior for bed bath beyond inc a hotshot executive from target corp who knew how to charm customers with in house brands and train stores on handling online and in person orders but the chief executive who took over in november 2019 never saw the fruits of his labor and the home goods retailer watched its sales melt away during the pandemic even as customers snapped up the same wares at nimbler competitors one last dismal quarterly report was all it took and tritton was unceremoniously dumped wednesday advertisement behind the scenes activist shareholder ryan cohen whose reddit fans had followed him into the stock had grown fed up with tritton s performance and pushed the board to fire him according to a person familiar with cohen s thinking cohen continues to believe the better performing buybuy baby unit is a great asset and sees tritton s departure as a chance to undo a series of missteps over the last three years the challenge with the stock down 80 in the last 12 months and bond yields rising is persuading other investors that bed bath beyond still has time to recover they re done i mean stick a fork in them said anthony chukumba managing director at loop capital markets which has a sell rating on bed bath beyond shares cohen s rc ventures is bed bath beyond s fourth largest holder with a 9 7 stake as of feb 24 according to data compiled by bloomberg advertisement sue gove a board member who was appointed interim ceo to replace tritton told analysts on an earnings call that the company is aware of interest in the baby products business and continues to evaluate its options cohen s role the person familiar with cohen s thinking said he believes the company needs to narrow its focus reduce spending and get back to catering to customers core demands and focus on national brands rather than pushing expensive private labels cohen thinks tritton was the wrong ceo with the wrong strategy the person said in a tweet wednesday cohen criticized executives who make too much money something that he previously had lamented about tritton s arrangement advertisement i m sick of seeing failed executives make millions in risk free compensation while shareholders are left holding the bag ryan cohen ryancohen june 29 2022 tritton now 58 was a superstar at target when bed bath beyond hired him in late 2019 after settling with a trio of activist investors who criticized it for failing to adapt quickly to online shopping he had been the architect of target developing more than 30 new private brands in areas such as apparel and home decor which seemed to fit well with bed bath beyond s goal of taking back market share from the likes of amazon com inc wayfair inc and tjx cos homegoods his task was straightforward reverse a deep sales slump but despite the pandemic driving a surge in demand for spruced up living spaces bed bath beyond has reported declining year over year sales in every quarter but one since the end of 2018 profitability has also suffered analysts didn t foresee two of the last three quarterly losses and the most recent one was twice as steep as they had expected advertisement long odds the odds are even longer now as bed bath beyond attempts to return to profitability while contending with rapidly changing consumer habits and the highest u s inflation in 40 years like other retailers bed bath beyond is also suffering from a glut of unwanted stuff most of that is private label products executives said on the earnings call the company will need to mark down items to clear out excess inventory which will put pressure on profit margins under tritton s leadership bed bath beyond cleaned up aisles but it also scaled back discounts a move that may have deterred foot traffic morningstar analyst jaime katz advertisement cleaning up the store to make the selection process easier for consumers was great but now you have to stay ahead of companies like wayfair on digital channels said katz who has a buy rating on the shares making matters worse bed bath beyond weakened its once strong balance sheet with a 1 billion accelerated share buyback program even as the foundations of its business operations were crumbling loop capital s chukumba said business as inflation soars how is arizona iced tea still 99 cents tall cans of arizona iced tea have cost 99 cents since 1992 the family behind the company says it s committed to that price even as the prices of aluminum and corn syrup climb higher if you re struggling and you re trying to turn the business around you ve got to pull back as much as you possibly can you want to preserve liquidity he said they did the exact opposite advertisement the company had 108 million in cash and equivalents at the end of may its total liquidity including availability under its revolving credit facility was about 900 million the board said it hired berkeley research group a retail advisory firm to focus on cash inventory and balance sheet optimization the company also tapped search firm russell reynolds to help find its next ceo katz said it s going to be tough to recruit someone in light of the company s floundering performance advertisement who s going to want to run this
if china and others needed a wake up call that was it it would have been immediately obvious to china that it would be hit with the same sanctions should it want to progress its ambitions towards taiwan it s not just the brutal demonstration of the power the role the dollar plays within the global financial system or its own ambition of challenging us hegemony that would provide motivation for china to try to promote its own currency loading the dollar s centrality within the global economy means that us economic and monetary policies also play an outsized role in the global economy the federal reserve s decisions on interest rates and the availability of credit have flow on effects to other economies and financial systems with the fed now raising rates and withdrawing liquidity from the us economy even as china is trying to stimulate its flagging growth rate a divergence of monetary policies and interest rates is occurring that with capital already flowing out of china towards the rising rates in the us has the potential to override china s policies and destabilise its economy or at least force it to take decisions it would otherwise not have made that s not a comfortable position particularly for a country with its own hegemonic ambitions china had already taken some small steps to putting in place the foundations for positioning the yuan as a meaningful alternative to the dollar for well over a decade it has been negotiating currency swap deals with other central banks to facilitate the direct use of its currency in trade that more commonly is denominated in us dollars loading it created its own version of swift the cross border interbank payment system in 2015 to facilitate cross border renminbi denominated trade settlements lobbied successfully to have the yuan included in the international monetary fund s special drawing rights basket of currency reserves and more recently developed a digital version of its currency it has been piloting yuan denominated oil deals with saudi arabia trying to negotiate iron ore purchases in yuan and more recently for obvious reasons has been settling deals with russia in yuan and roubles despite those efforts the yuan is still only used in just over two per cent of global payments the us dollar is used in about 42 per cent of global payments it is the currency for nearly three quarters of trade in the asia pacific two thirds of global securities issuance is in dollars and about 60 per cent of foreign exchange reserves china is slowly putting together the architecture infrastructure and relationships to build not a global challenger to us dollar primacy at this stage but a regional one the power of the us dollar has been on show with western sanctions effectively shutting russia out of the global financial system credit ap it s taking a long and incremental approach to its ambitions for the yuan and its own financial security and is focusing on its sphere of interest in the asia pacific and the developing economies where its belt and road program provide it with both influence and leverage a number of african countries for instance have begun settling payments in yuan and holding yuan within their currency reserves china wants to promote the yuan as a new anchor currency in asia and other small regional blocs with no great affection for us dollar dominance its efforts can only have intensified after the demonstration of the dollar s hegemony in the american response to the invasion of ukraine its ambitions are necessarily constrained by its own system and the communist party s obsession with control over every aspect of its society and economy the dollar s role in the global economy and financial system flows from the depth and liquidity of its financial markets the strength of the regulation of those markets the transparency of its judicial system the size of its economy and fact that its central bank is at arms length from its political class the currency is freely floating and fully and readily convertible china doesn t have fully developed financial markets it has capital controls the yuan isn t free floating or fully convertible and isn t driven primarily by market forces its regulation and judicial systems are opaque and untrusted by westerners the pboc will do what the party directs loading some of those things might be changeable at the margin china has been trying to open up its financial markets but more complete liberalisation is inconceivable and therefore china s international ambitions for the yuan are constrained by its domestic policies and priorities

if china and others needed a wake up call that was it it would have been immediately obvious to china that it would be hit with the same sanctions should it want to progress its ambitions towards taiwan it s not just the brutal demonstration of the power the role the dollar plays within the global financial system or its own ambition of challenging us hegemony that would provide motivation for china to try to promote its own currency loading the dollar s centrality within the global economy means that us economic and monetary policies also play an outsized role in the global economy the federal reserve s decisions on interest rates and the availability of credit have flow on effects to other economies and financial systems with the fed now raising rates and withdrawing liquidity from the us economy even as china is trying to stimulate its flagging growth rate a divergence of monetary policies and interest rates is occurring that with capital already flowing out of china towards the rising rates in the us has the potential to override china s policies and destabilise its economy or at least force it to take decisions it would otherwise not have made that s not a comfortable position particularly for a country with its own hegemonic ambitions china had already taken some small steps to putting in place the foundations for positioning the yuan as a meaningful alternative to the dollar for well over a decade it has been negotiating currency swap deals with other central banks to facilitate the direct use of its currency in trade that more commonly is denominated in us dollars loading it created its own version of swift the cross border interbank payment system in 2015 to facilitate cross border renminbi denominated trade settlements lobbied successfully to have the yuan included in the international monetary fund s special drawing rights basket of currency reserves and more recently developed a digital version of its currency it has been piloting yuan denominated oil deals with saudi arabia trying to negotiate iron ore purchases in yuan and more recently for obvious reasons has been settling deals with russia in yuan and roubles despite those efforts the yuan is still only used in just over two per cent of global payments the us dollar is used in about 42 per cent of global payments it is the currency for nearly three quarters of trade in the asia pacific two thirds of global securities issuance is in dollars and about 60 per cent of foreign exchange reserves china is slowly putting together the architecture infrastructure and relationships to build not a global challenger to us dollar primacy at this stage but a regional one the power of the us dollar has been on show with western sanctions effectively shutting russia out of the global financial system credit ap it s taking a long and incremental approach to its ambitions for the yuan and its own financial security and is focusing on its sphere of interest in the asia pacific and the developing economies where its belt and road program provide it with both influence and leverage a number of african countries for instance have begun settling payments in yuan and holding yuan within their currency reserves china wants to promote the yuan as a new anchor currency in asia and other small regional blocs with no great affection for us dollar dominance its efforts can only have intensified after the demonstration of the dollar s hegemony in the american response to the invasion of ukraine its ambitions are necessarily constrained by its own system and the communist party s obsession with control over every aspect of its society and economy the dollar s role in the global economy and financial system flows from the depth and liquidity of its financial markets the strength of the regulation of those markets the transparency of its judicial system the size of its economy and fact that its central bank is at arms length from its political class the currency is freely floating and fully and readily convertible china doesn t have fully developed financial markets it has capital controls the yuan isn t free floating or fully convertible and isn t driven primarily by market forces its regulation and judicial systems are opaque and untrusted by westerners the pboc will do what the party directs loading some of those things might be changeable at the margin china has been trying to open up its financial markets but more complete liberalisation is inconceivable and therefore china s international ambitions for the yuan are constrained by its domestic policies and priorities

madrid nato declared russia the most significant and direct threat to its members peace and security on wednesday and vowed to strengthen support for ukraine even as that country s leader chided the alliance for not doing more to help it defeat moscow the military organization s condemnation was not wholly surprising its chief earlier said russia s war in ukraine had created europe s biggest security crisis since world war ii but it was a sobering about face for an alliance that a decade ago called moscow a strategic partner nato also issued a warning about china accusing it of bullying its neighbors and forming a strategic partnership with moscow that poses a challenge to the west set up some 70 years ago to counter the soviet union nato held its summit in madrid in a world transformed by russia s invasion of its neighbor the war drove the alliance to pour troops and weapons into eastern europe on a scale unseen in decades and pushed sweden and finland to seek the safety of nato membership the two formerly nonaligned nations were formally invited to join on wednesday as secretary general jens stoltenberg said the war had brought the biggest overhaul of our collective defense since the end of the cold war but ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky lamented that nato s open door policy to new members did not appear to apply to his country advertisement the open door policy of nato shouldn t resemble the old turnstiles on kyiv s subway which stay open but close when you approach them until you pay zelensky said by video link hasn t ukraine paid enough he also asked for more modern artillery systems and other weapons and warned the leaders they either had to provide kyiv with the help it needed or face a delayed war between russia and yourself the question is who s next moldova or the baltics or poland the answer is all of them he said zelensky has acknowledged that nato membership is a distant prospect under nato treaties an attack on any of the 30 members would trigger a military response by the entire alliance so it is trying to strike a delicate balance letting its nations arm ukraine without sparking a direct confrontation with nuclear armed russia at the same time nato has moved quickly to ensure that its members are protected dramatically scaling up military force along its eastern flank where countries from romania to the baltic states worry about russia s future plans it plans to increase almost eightfold the size of the alliance s rapid reaction force from 40 000 to 300 000 troops by next year the troops will be based in their home nations but dedicated to specific countries in the east where the alliance plans to build up stocks of equipment and ammunition advertisement president biden whose country provides the bulk of nato s military power vowed the summit would send an unmistakable message that nato is strong and united we re stepping up we re proving that nato is more needed now than it ever has been said biden he announced a hefty boost in america s military presence in europe including a permanent u s base in poland two more navy destroyers based in rota spain and two more f35 squadrons to the u k still strains among nato allies have also emerged as the cost of energy and other essential goods has skyrocketed partly because of the the war and tough western sanctions on russia there also are tensions over how the war will end and what if any concessions ukraine should make money remains a sensitive issue just nine of nato s 30 members currently meet the organization s target of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense british prime minister boris johnson whose country does hit the target urged nato allies to dig deep to restore deterrence and ensure defense in the decade ahead at the summit the leaders published nato s new strategic concept its once a decade set of priorities and goals advertisement the last such document in 2010 called russia a strategic partner at the time the idea of russia waging a land war on nato s borders would have sounded far fetched now nato accused russia of using coercion subversion aggression and annexation to extend its reach the document also set out nato s approach on issues from cybersecurity to climate change and the growing economic and military reach of china for the first time the leaders of japan australia south korea and new zealand attended the summit as guests a reflection of the growing importance of asia and the pacific region and nato s desire to counterbalance china china is not our adversary but we must be clear eyed about the serious challenges it represents stoltenberg said we see a deepening strategic partnership between moscow and beijing and china s growing assertiveness and its coercive policies have consequences for the security of our allies and our partners he added the alliance said however that it remained open to constructive engagement with beijing advertisement nato also stressed the need to address political instability in africa s sahel region and the middle east aggravated by climate change fragile institutions health emergencies and food insecurity that is driving large numbers of migrants toward europe host spain and other european countries pushed for this new focus the summit which ends thursday opened with one problem solved after turkey agreed tuesday to lift its opposition to sweden and finland joining nato nato operates by consensus and turkish president recep tayyip erdogan had threatened to block the nordic pair insisting they change their stance on kurdish rebel groups that turkey considers terrorists after talks with leaders of the three countries stoltenberg said the impasse had been cleared the two countries accession has to be ratified by all nations but stoltenberg said he was absolutely confident finland and sweden would become members quickly finnish foreign minister pekka haavisto said his country was eager to get out of the gray zone of having applied for membership but not yet fully covered by nato s collective defense guarantee our aim is that that period should be as short as possible he said send questions comments to the

choppy trust inman to help you navigate the new york and southern florida luxury markets had a strong start to 2022 and despite some general market uncertainty real estate faces today agents in these markets have reason to remain optimistic according to a report released tuesday by new york city based brokerage serhant the 2022 signature mid year luxury report includes statistics trends and highlights for the new york city hamptons and south florida markets for 2022 it also features historic trends on luxury transactions priced at 10 million or higher or super prime properties the report produced by serhant s signature division the brokerage s luxury specific division was written by garrett derderian serhant s director of market intelligence the super prime market in new york had a robust start to 2022 derderian said in the report it was the strongest first half year since 2019 when an increase to mansion and transfer taxes took effect on july 1 which resulted in a flurry of activity in the first half of that year condos also sold at their fastest pace in years the super prime market has proven more resilient than the market at large as buyers at this price point tend to be less influenced by the rapid rise in mortgage rates although stock market volatility did begin to impact a percentage of luxury buyers toward the end of the second quarter he added in addition to new york city s strong showing the hamptons also had a good start to the year which however may soon be hampered by a lack of inventory derderian noted in south florida miami and palm beach were also impacted by low inventory but demand for miami is creeping up to palm beach s recent popularity run that s been going on for the last few years he added here are more of the details new york city new york city has seen 130 transactions at 10 million or higher so far in 2022 with a total sales volume of 2 17 billion in 2021 total sales volume on properties priced 10 million or higher during the first six months of the year was 1 26 billion in 2020 it was 1 11 billion and in 2019 it was 3 27 billion there were 112 condo sales which were up 84 percent year over year and 18 co op sales which were up 100 percent year over year on average properties spent 203 days on market down from 328 days in 2021 broken down into property types condos spent 194 days on the market down from 342 in 2021 and co ops spent 333 days on the market up from 269 the year before the median condo price was 14 29 million down 0 3 percent year over year while the median co op price was 11 25 million down 9 percent year over year derderian explained those lower prices were partially due to fewer new development closings since the middle of last year many super prime listings most notably on billionaires row have sold he said in the report there are fewer new development trophy apartments available for sale today than past years which skews the figures lower it does not reflect a loss in real value but does show where the concentration of sales is taking place contract signings were down from the same period last year 127 contracts signed on 10 million properties in 2022 compared to 161 in 2021 but derderian pointed out that those figures are still ahead compared to historical trends from the last 10 years while the number of trades is slightly below the records set in 2021 the number of super prime condo contracts is 28 percent above the rolling 10 year average while cooperatives trades are down just 8 percent derderian said of course super prime cooperative sales have been in a general decline since 2010 when new development condos began to emerge as the product of choice downtown emerged as the most popular market for condos at 37 contracts signed followed by the upper east side with 24 contracts signed meanwhile cooperative buyers favored the upper east side with 12 out of 22 contracts signed residing in that area new york is consistently viewed as a stable haven for the world s elite and despite some instability the market has been largely unphased derderian said given the limited number of shadow units left unsold and completion of all current billionaires row towers the super prime segment should remain stable in the second half of the year the hamptons the hamptons is still having its moment derderian said the market has been extremely active over the last two and a half years as more buyers looked to purchase co primary residences rather than vacation getaways the tony market outside of new york had 32 super prime sales during the first half of 2022 with the median price up 9 percent annually to 14 65 million and the average price up 33 percent annually to 20 88 million however a lack of inventory has started to impact sales since there are only so many turnkey properties available which is what is most desired by buyers at this time derderian said most buyers across the hamptons have little appetite to do major renovations in the current market given rising costs and supply chain disruptions derderian said it simply takes too long to complete this has driven up prices for move in ready homes the southampton region was most popular with 10 super prime sales followed by bridgehampton and east hampton which tied for second place with six super prime sales each bridgehampton was the priciest region with an average sales price of 27 85 million compared to southampton s 27 2 million and east hampton s 16 93 million average sales prices south florida low inventory contributed to a dip in sales in southern florida markets but still left sales well above historic levels in the region there were 48 sales of properties priced at 10 million or more in palm beach down 27 percent year over year but still 109 percent above the rolling 10 year average in miami beach there were 110 such sales down 33 percent from the same period in 2021 but 129 percent above the 10 year rolling average prices were down in both markets but derderian chalked that up to the size of homes that sold which were smaller compared to the previous year case in point the average price per square foot in palm beach hit a record 3 580 up from 3 125 the year before contract activity across the region was strong with 41 super prime contracts signed pending deals in palm beach during the first half of the year up from 40 during the same period in 2021 i cannot understate just how strong demand continues to be for super prime homes in palm beach derderian said as the world s wealthy flock to the market prices have reached astronomical levels although appreciation is beginning to slow miami inched closer to contract activity in palm beach with 83 contracts signed on super prime properties pending deals down 37 percent from 2021 levels however amidst limited supply the greater miami area has seen a flurry of luxury activity rivaling that of palm beach derderian said prices are likely to climb further as more firms relocate to the region just last week ken griffin announced he is relocating his investment firm citadel from chicago to miami citing a more favorable business and tax environment of course with florida not imposing a state income tax on its residents many high income earners have opted to move to the region given the continued flexibility of remote or hybrid work email lillian dickerson
