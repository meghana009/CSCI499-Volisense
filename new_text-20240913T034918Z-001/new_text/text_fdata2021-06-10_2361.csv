company is making significant progress with dr fang and his team in utah on both the hamr and gsd technologies and expects to make key updates including hamr powder production using the company s titanium minerals from the titan project commencement of gsd powder production from hamr titanium powders and or titanium recycled scrap techno economic assessment for the scale up of production of titanium metal and powders commenting on the agreement mr anastasios arima ceo and md of hyperion metals said titanium metal is the superior metal for a wide range of advanced applications from aerospace to defense and it should also be the logical choice for industrial and civilian applications titanium s widespread adoption has been held back in sectors such as consumer goods and electric vehicles due to its high cost the combination of the patented hamr and gsd technologies together with advances in 3d printing offers a pathway to dramatically reduce the cost and carbon emissions of titanium metal components furthermore recent studies by the fraunhofer news alert institute have shown that the fabrication of titanium parts using laser powder bed additive a 3d printing technique emits approximately 70 less co 2 than equivalent production by traditional milling processes hyperion s vision is to utilize these sustainable technologies and accelerate the rapid penetration of titanium in current and widespread applications in next generation mobility the light weighting of trucks trains drones and electric vehicles will lead to a quantum leap in the energy efficiency of these vehicles and will be large high growth new markets for titanium we aim to scale and commercialize these breakthrough technologies make the us the global leader in titanium production and deliver technological leadership for in titanium applications for aerospace space and defense commenting on the agreement dr z zak fang said we look forward to commercializing the hamr and gsd technologies with hyperion metals these technologies have produced titanium metal and powders that consistently met the purity requirements defined by industry standards and they have the potential to significantly lower the costs and carbon emissions of producing titanium metal and powders these technologies have the capacity to drastically alter the titanium stainless steel and aluminum markets and increase the range of applications for high performance lightweight and low cost titanium parts titanium powders for 3d printing additive manufacturing titanium has exceptional material properties including high strength light weight superior corrosion resistance and leading biocompatibility versus other metals producing high quality spherical powders from titanium and titanium alloys is one of the critical building blocks for the rapidly growing industrial scale 3d printing additive manufacturing sectors additive manufacturing with titanium can provide many benefits to the medical aerospace ev space and defense sectors including enhanced performance and sustainability by producing strong lightweight parts that have high levels of corrosion resistance and are 100 recyclable reduced production lead times through iterative software led design and rapid printing reduced waste and cost of producing a part with scrap rates of less than 10 compared to over 90 for complex milled parts in medical applications titanium powders allow the rapid production of made to measure medical implants that are strong lightweight and critically biocompatible to realize the benefits of utilizing titanium powders they need to meet very high chemical and physical standards this not only relates to high titanium or titanium alloy purities with low oxygen and other deleterious elements but physical properties of high sphericity specific particle size distribution and flowability hence these powders are typically produced via complex post processing techniques following on from the production of high purity titanium metal ingot or wire production spherical titanium powder production challenges the high cost of titanium spherical powders has curtailed its use in additive manufacturing for products that require its superior properties of strength to weight ratio corrosion resistance and biocompatibility the price of titanium metal is approximately 8 500 per ton1 with the price of titanium spherical powder suitable for 3d printing potentially over 300 000 per ton1 the current commercial processes for producing titanium spherical powders include gas atomization plasma atomization and the plasma rotating electrode process fine spherical powders can be produced with gas atomization and plasma atomization methods but after size classification the product yield is low the plasma rotating electrode process produces titanium powder with good purity and excellent spherical shape but the particle size is larger than required for many applications the limiting factor in all three processes is low product yield for fine powder which is one of the main technical reasons for the very high cost of titanium powder used in additive manufacturing gsd breakthrough spherical powder technology granulation sintering deoxygenation gsd is a thermochemical process for producing spherical titanium powders used in 3d printing and additive manufacturing and was invented by dr z zak fang and his team at the university of utah the gsd technology significantly improves the yield by up to 50 and produces a spherical powder with low oxygen controllable particle size and excellent flowability the gsd manufacturing process steps are titanium metal or alloy is hydrogenated to make friable hydride and is then milled into fine particles the fine hydride particles are granulated into spherical granules in the desired size range using spray drying the spherical granules are sintered to produce densified spherical titanium powder the densified spherical titanium powder is deoxygenated with magnesium to reduce the oxygen content to product specifications the gsd technology can also introduce desirable alloying ingredients with the titanium hydride powder made in step 1 to make titanium alloys for example titanium hydride powder can be blended with aluminum and vanadium powders to create the widely used alloy ti 6al 4v other alloying elements for titanium include fe nb zr and mo importantly the source material can also be recycled titanium scrap material the manufacturing of titanium components and structures can generate a large amount of titanium machining chips this scrap can be over 90 for complex traditionally milled parts this scrap titanium can be sorted cleaned and prepared for processing as the source material in step 1 above this recycling pathway for the gsd technology can reduce costs and significantly improve the sustainability of titanium metal manufacturing process advantages disadvantages granulation sintering deoxygenation controllable particle size low energy consumption very high powder yield very low waste a wide range of titanium alloys can easily be made excellent metallurgical quality excellent flowability recently invented and patented pilot scale requires commercial scale up gas atomisation excellent metallurgical quality high powder flow rates new and modified alloys can easily be made scalable technology very high volumes available and can easily support am growth large supply base variability in powder properties between suppliers large number of suppliers and atomising technologies can be confusing reactive and high melting point alloys not available few companies currently atomising titanium low product yield high cost plasma atomisation excellent metallurgical quality very high flow rates near perfect spheres reactive and high melting point alloys can be made titanium alloys available limited supply base only alloys available as wire can be made low product yield high cost plasma rotating electrode process excellent metallurgical quality very high flow rates perfect spheres reactive and high melting point alloys can be made titanium alloys available limited supply base but growing high quality bar needed as starting material low product yield high cost table 1 summary of powder characteristics by manufacturing process2 3 hamr technology hyperion already holds an exclusive license for the patented hamr technology that is a proven method for the production of titanium metal with significantly less energy than the current kroll process this technology was also developed by professor zak fang and his team at the university of utah with funding from the us department of energy the hamr technology has successfully produced titanium metal at pilot plant scale at product qualities that exceed current industry standards detailed economic energy analysis and process simulations indicate that the hamr process uses 50 less energy than the kroll process and offers a path to dropping the cost of titanium by approximately 50 using renewable electricity it can produce zero carbon titanium metal the opportunity the combination of the two patented technologies gsd and hamr plus the advent of wide scale industrial 3d printing capabilities offers a compelling market opportunity the successful scale up of these technologies could potentially produce zero carbon spherical titanium powders at a fraction of the cost with economic modelling indicating a reduction in costs per ton of over 75 oak ridge national laboratories reports that 3d printing can cut down manufacturers use of raw materials by up to 90 this quantum of efficiency and cost reduction would not just disrupt the titanium market but also the far larger aluminum and stainless steel markets titanium competes with metals such as aluminum and stainless steel for strength and corrosion resistance and while there are several other metals with excellent properties in these applications none have the same combined superior properties of strength weight and corrosive resistance as titanium the size of the global titanium primary metal market is us 4 2bn pa4 the size of the manufactured titanium part market which would be the relevant comparator for additive manufacturing with titanium powders is a multiple of us 4 2bn pa the global primary stainless steel market is us 115bn pa5 and the aluminum market us 150bn pa6 7 titanium is a superior metal for a wide range of high performance applications in the aerospace medical space and defense sectors it is only cost that has held it back from being used for its superior properties in larger consumer markets such as the global transportation industry the patented hamr and gsd technologies have the potential to provide a step change in the titanium supply chain process through eliminating process stages reducing energy consumption reducing carbon emissions and significantly cutting costs

a june 8 2021 investigative report by the nonprofit news outlet propublica revealed what many probably already knew but couldn t quantify in detail the nation s wealthiest people pay negligible taxes leaving modest wage earners footing the heftiest tax bills the report was based on 15 years of records obtained by propublica detailing taxes paid by the likes of elon musk jeff bezos mark zuckerberg warren buffet carl icahn and more for example tesla founder musk who is the second richest person in the world paid no federal income taxes in 2018 according to propublica the same went for amazon founder bezos in 2007 bezos is the world s richest person taken together it demolishes the cornerstone myth of the american tax system that everyone pays their fair share and the richest americans pay the most propublica reported the irs records show that the wealthiest can perfectly legally pay income taxes that are only a tiny fraction of the hundreds of millions if not billions their fortunes grow each year in sum propublica reports that the wealthiest people avoid paying taxes using legal means that the average american doesn t have access to because the government taxes income those living on an income pay the most tax but if you are a billionaire stashing your wealth in assets not defined as taxable income like stocks the majority of your wealth stream isn t subject to income tax for context propublica compared the rise in wealth each year for the 25 richest americans and their taxes paid the results are stark according to forbes those 25 people saw their worth rise a collective 401 billion from 2014 to 2018 they paid a total of 13 6 billion in federal income taxes in those five years the irs data shows that s a staggering sum but it amounts to a true tax rate of only 3 4 by comparison typical american wage earners in their 40s saw a wealth increase of about 65 000 between 2014 and 2018 but footed tax bills totaling 62 000 over that same period according to propublica nothing in the report surprised me said steven rosenthal senior fellow for the urban brookings tax policy center in a phone interview with snopes of course the very wealthiest recognize little of their wealth in the form of income every year in recent years with the dot com boom and the explosion in the value of intellectual property there have been some very successful zillionaires they start businesses of which they remain either the principal or one of the largest owners and then they don t sell their stock the current tax system doesn t tax stock gains unless the stock is sold which has been the case for a century rosenthal said rosenthal called u s president joe biden s proposal to tax assets at death a modest plan to tax this wealth at a minimum we ought not allow this accumulated wealth to escape any taxation he stated rosenthal pointed out that although the figures in the propublica story reveal a lot about the shortcomings of the current tax code the onus to fix it is on congress no one is obliged to pay more taxes than are due rosenthal said it s incumbent on congress to change the rules if we don t like the way the rules are operating we can t expect people to interpret rules or apply rules in the way that s the most favorable to the government
heartland express nasdaq htld is learning that higher pay alone is not going to be enough to retain drivers in a presentation to the ubs global industrials and transportation conference earlier this week two executives from the company told the virtual gathering that while heartland had increased pay it was finding that other steps to address driver concerns and not just another round of increases in the company s per mile rate were having a positive impact on retention in comments that at times echoed those told to freightwaves in a recent interview with usa truck cfo chris strain said heartland is learning that some drivers are willing to take less in pay for the trade off of being home every night that has helped squeeze driver supply but also in the mix are other reasons frequently cited for the current code red level of difficulty in hiring drivers lingering health concerns from the pandemic and the loss of drivers effectively kicked off the roads by their record in the federal drug and alcohol clearinghouse we see this extending for quite some time strain said we have not yet seen the inflection point that says there is something here and drivers are starting to come back into the industry as josh helmich the company s controller said in the presentation the company has needed to get creative a traditional increase in pay last fall didn t really move the needle he said but heartland did dedicate itself to getting drivers home more frequently and that has been a contributing factor in better retention levels but more radically heartland has started to move toward more guaranteed levels of compensation as long as the driver is doing what we ask them to do we are going to guarantee a minimum pay level helmich said they won t get that minimum compensation for doing nothing he said they still need to be available to run freight helmich said if they are looking at a significantly diminished paycheck through no fault of their own helmich said those paychecks will be adjusted to reach a minimum at its most extreme drivers who got stuck in texas during the february freeze might have sat for a week racking up no miles strain said instead drivers were paid the base level that heartland now pays is a starting point strain said its basic structure he added is that heartland pays the base and you have the upward potential it all comes down to how much you want to run and how long you want to stay out if you want to get home we ll meet you on that helmich offered some guidelines on what those base payments are for the drivers who get home the most the pay would be roughly 50 000 per year more active drivers get about 70 000 he said and the drivers we see week in and week out get significantly more than that strain suggested that selling the approach to drivers may have been a challenge it isn t a bait and switch he said but the program has given drivers peace of mind that their paycheck is never going to go below x keeping those hours up and ensuring that drivers get paid for the inevitable nonproductive hours has become particularly important helmich said the squeeze on employees that drivers are facing is being matched at the facilities operated by shippers or other warehouses so no matter how efficient heartland s operations might be the drivers often run into a buzzsaw of inefficiency at shippers facilities they are struggling to find dock workers and forklift drivers and that has been the bulk of the challenge helmich said but with all the freight that s available on the market a shipper that gets a poor reputation for service to drivers is going to find itself avoided that can incentivize shippers to operate more efficiently because for drivers you re able to pick very favorable freight helmich said the end result is that deadhead miles are down unproductive miles get better and the overall situation for drivers is getting better he added other key points by strain and helmich in the interview with ubs transportation analyst tom wadewitz during their 45 minute presentation about 99 of the company s miles are driven by company drivers heartland s expenses for purchased transportation in the first quarter were not even 1 million on revenues of about 152 million by contrast marten transportation nasdaq mrtn had first quarter revenues of 223 million and purchased transportation expenses of 40 7 million at the bottom of the trucking market in april may 2020 heartland was turning down about 1 000 loads every week that number hit 10 000 by the end of the fourth quarter and is holding there that allows us to do a little bit of shifting in our market basket strain said if the freight is not driver friendly it can be passed over for something that won t hold drivers up rate increases were being negotiated in the first quarter of the year at midsingle digits they are now solidly in double digits boosted by the texas freeze but progressing toward higher numbers before that strain said it won t be until the third quarter where we get the full effect of a full quarter of our rate increases he added between cash on hand and lines of credit heartland has about 350 million in liquidity helmich said there is plenty of wiggle room if heartland wants to make an acquisition but an acquisition would need to have 100 million in revenue strain said and would need to be positive to the company s operating ratio which in the first quarter was 86 5 on an adjusted basis one of the better ors in the truckload industry more articles by john kingston bravotran spins off from hubtran sets sight on freight forwarding efficiencies did trucking jobs rise in may it depends bmo s transportation sector writeoffs fall to lowest level in five years

new york ap after feeling the thrill of victory early this year by singlehandedly causing gamestop s stock to soar only to get crushed when it quickly crashed back to earth armies of smaller pocketed and novice investors are back for more these undaunted investors have resuscitated gamestop shares back above 300 up from 40 in february after plunging from a peak of 347 they re also hauling new stocks onto the bandwagon they say is heading for the moon including the lesser known health insurance company clover health investments this second wave of leaps for meme stocks are just as staggering the movie theater chain amc entertainment soared to 62 last week from 2 early this year and once again professional wall street is calling the gains illogical many of these professionals had predicted the phenomenon of regular small fry investors piling into a stock en masse and sending it incredibly higher would fizzle out particularly after they felt the pain of losing some money instead the frenzy has endured and shows how powerful these investors remain at least for now they re armed with social media where they can convince others to champion the same stocks they also have zero fee trading apps that allow many to buy stock options which can offer bigger gains at a smaller upfront cost than buying a share of stock in exchange for potentially bigger percentage losses they ll do surprising things if given the tools said hossein azari ceo of cmorq a company that helps customers get into cryptocurrencies and advocates for a new world of decentralized finance azari sees it all stemming from people feeling left out as they watched wealthy investors and firms suck up the majority of the economy s gains in recent years now they see a way to get some for themselves they are not out there trying to prove anything he said they just want to kind of materialize the american dream for themselves some of the meme stock buyers believe fervently in the financial futures of the companies they re backing others say on social media posts that they re merely looking to cash in on whatever the next hot stock is most say that as long as other like minded investors stick together and hold the stock they ll protect each other and the stock s price malcolm ethridge a financial adviser with cic wealth outside washington d c said a range of his clients want to talk about meme stocks as well as cryptocurrencies ethridge also says it s not only younger investors pushing up meme stocks he s gotten just as many requests from his clients who are retirees i think in most cases though they really just wanted a professional to tell them why it wasn t a good idea to get involved just so that they could stop feeling like they were missing out he said this resurgence for meme stocks is a little different from the earlier supernova for one it hasn t dragged down the broader stock market back in january the mania helped knock down the s p 500 to its worst day in months that was a result of fears that some hedge funds would have to sell big unrelated stocks to raise cash to cover losses they were taking after betting that gamestop would fall several of today s meme stock winners do have chunks of their shares sold short where investors have made trades to profit if the price falls but not to the same degree as in january at gamestop roughly one in five of its shares available to trade has been sold short for example earlier this year more than 100 of them effectively were with some getting shorted multiple times the buying activity this time around also seems less fervent trading in call options which can give a buyer the right to buy 100 shares of stock at a set price at a later date surged to a two month high recently but it s still below the heights set in january over the last year trading activity for call options on single stocks has tended to move up and down with how restricted the economy has been by the pandemic according to deutsche bank strategists when people have been leaving their houses more often call option trading has tended to fall off which makes the last few weeks a notable exception so if getting burned by plunging prices for meme stocks once before didn t stop them and the possibility of doing things other than trading options while sitting on a couch hasn t so far what could slow the phenomenon regulators and politicians in washington have been discussing some options though nothing s come out of it yet gary gensler chair of the securities and exchange commission gave a speech wednesday where he once again criticized gamified investing many trading apps use features that encourage customers to make trades more often that brings in more revenue for the apps but some research also suggests it leads to lower returns for the average investor gensler said he s asked the sec s staff to gather public input on the topic he also said he s asked the staff for recommendations on changes to rules that govern the stock market s plumbing and how trading apps route retail investors orders to make sure they re getting the best execution gamestop separately said late wednesday that the sec s staff is conducting an investigation into the trading activity in its stock and those of other companies gamestop which received a request for documents on may 26 said it doesn t expect the inquiry to adversely hurt the company the sec and other regulators could look for ways to force trading apps to offer more warnings to customers in hopes of slowing them down said john coffee a professor of law at columbia university they could start with making it clearer that trading options can be riskier than buying actual shares of a stock coffee is skeptical gamestop amc and others can hold onto their lofty prices which would need profits to explode higher extremely quickly to look rational according to traditional models used by financial analysts that means he s worried many retail investors may be setting themselves up for big losses in their zeal to ride the meme stock wave and he acknowledges that even if brokerages do offer more warnings that may not be enough to stop some traders as social media posts continue to encourage them to pile into certain stocks and given human nature as much as i believe in consumer protection coffee said i believe a fool and his money are parted

quay global real estate has made its first entry back into the office market in five years as it is optimistic that offices are coming back following the pandemic the firm bought office buildings in manhattan and said it did not foresee companies moving to a permanent work from home arrangement many banking and technology firms such as goldman sachs facebook and google had already stated they would have staff returning to offices later this year we didn t own any offices for five years but they were so cheap during covid 19 chris bedingfield quay principal and portfolio manager said we have cities for a reason people may work from home but firms will still need an office space to not give staff a desk or only have hot desking is creating a false narrative in manhattan offices are dirt cheap we like to buy offices below the cost of building and prior to covid 19 they were trading above the cost of building covid 19 has now given us the opportunity and we think there is still upside there he said it was crazy for firms to expect staff to work in offices outside of the cbd which was a trend during the pandemic i think it is crazy there is a reason that cbds exist and that is to maximise the catchment of employment pool he said infrastructure is geared towards the cbd and businesses deliberately set up here to have that catchment of labour people don t have the time or the money to be travelling out to business parks we think the cbd is coming back we are optimistic and the prices reflect that meanwhile he criticised managers who were capitalising on the covid 19 reopening trend as he felt they should take a more targeted approach there is a big re opening theme mostly being driven by equity managers who are using a scattergun approach he said people are only looking at the theme and not the fundamentals there has been a torrent of capital going into reopening stocks and no one is taking a surgical look they are just buying everything within that theme the quay global real estate fund returned 20 over one year to 31 may 2021 according to fe analytics versus returns of 16 7 by the global property sector within the australian core strategies universe it was the winner of money management s fund manager of the year award for global property securities last month performance of quay global real estate versus global property sector over one year to 31 may 2021

this week two telling stories about america s billionaire class first billionaires in space jeff bezos who owns the post announced that come july 20 he and his younger brother mark would be riding along on the first crewed rocket launched by his space company blue origin not to be outdone reportedly british billionaire richard branson may be going suborbital over the july fourth weekend the second story ran in propublica after an anonymous benefactor gifted the outlet a vast trove of internal revenue service data covering more than 15 years propublica analysis indicates that during that time jeff bezos mike bloomberg elon musk carl icahn and george soros each had at least one year during which they paid no income tax we ve always had rich people of course but today s rich people seem to be richer than in the past so fantastically wealthy that they can afford to stage their own private space race no wonder people suspect they re not paying enough taxes and reporters are eager to prove it advertisement yet propublica s reporting suggests they didn t pay taxes in years when they made no money and the deductions they were taking seem to be largely legitimate ones you ve heard of think charitable donations not hidden offshore accounts the main complaint is that propublica thinks the ultrawealthy ought to be taxed on a broader definition of income than the irs uses follow this author megan mcardle s opinions follow the super rich derive most of their income from financial assets which can appreciate for decades before they re finally sold the ability to defer taxes during those years is pretty valuable propublica calculated that from 2014 to 2018 the 25 richest americans paid taxes equal to 3 4 percent of their wealth gain and calls that their true tax rate propublica s formulation makes it sound like a loophole in fact that s how everyone s taxes work ordinary americans don t pay income tax every time our stock portfolios go up or our homes appreciate a bit we pay the tax when we sell why should american billionaires be different advertisement that s an important question we talk a lot about rich people paying their fair share but we re rarely clear on what exactly we mean by that we might for example want procedural fairness everyone operates under a single neutral set of rules so i pay taxes on capital gains when i sell and so does warren buffett but then buffett has a lot more stock than i do so he benefits more from this neutral rule we might prefer rules that produce a fair outcome or equity those competing visions of fairness remain at the heart of many of today s partisan debates because they both have merits and they are so often uncomfortably at odds a footrace run by neutral rules will inherently produce one winner and many losers yet almost everyone balks at choosing between them so much so that when we re talking about unequal outcomes we tend to insist we re really only mad because the winners broke the rules even if we must invent new rules for people to break such as you shouldn t wait until you sell an asset to pay taxes on your capital gains advertisement that idea has recently gained currency among some progressive academics but it s not how the u s tax code works for good reason it probably wouldn t feel very fair if it applied to you and me just because the value of your house jumped in a hot market doesn t mean you have enough cash to pay taxes on that appreciation and while the ultrawealthy wouldn t be forced out of their family homes they might be forced to sell off stock of a business they spent decades building eight of the 10 richest people in the united states got that way by building very successful firms from the ground up it s not even a rule you d make if you wanted to redistribute money to those more in need of it most of the european countries that had wealth taxes abandoned them after discovering they didn t raise enough money to justify the administrative headache of assessing a bunch of hard to value assets such as private companies and art or the economic distortions that resulted when wealthy people started trying to avoid the tax for example by investing elsewhere or keeping their companies private people should pay taxes on untaxed capital gains is what you come up with if you just don t think anyone should have enough money to be able to shoot themselves into space and you think that the government should tax that money even if it doesn t benefit anyone else heck even if it costs the rest of us something advertisement by some definitions of fairness that s a defensible position but given a choice between letting billionaires spend fortunes reaching for the stars or destroying those fortunes so that the rest of us don t have to look at them then personally i ll take the rockets

d roberson president and chief executive officer of lakeland industries stated lakeland delivered a very strong fiscal 2022 first quarter that demonstrates the sustainability of our data centric process improvements even as covid 19 related demand has pulled back as expected in fact while we have been a major beneficiary of covid 19 business conditions we believe that it has masked value generated by the fundamental operational and organizational improvements the company has made prior to the onset of the global pandemic we began a business transformation and put in place a 5 year growth plan that assumed successful implementation of our development plans covid 19 accelerated the pace of progress by approximately 1 year and in the process elevated our cash balance to over 60 million today we expect continued free cash flow generation for the foreseeable future which factors in the elimination of all covid 19 demand as early as the end of the present quarter the critical elements of our plan include the strengthening of our leadership team investing in capacity expansion and higher margin product development and focusing on profit enhancement initiatives led by a new data centric approach to planning and supporting our addressable markets the strengthening of our leadership team has been well documented from the boardroom to the c suite and even through middle management we ve made additions during the past 18 months that enable us to maximize our investments and grow organically and now inorganically most recently we added our first vice president for corporate development this move is intended for lakeland to put its sizeable cash position to work increasing shareholder value the actionable elements of our plan are to utilize our manufacturing operations and data centric culture as the cornerstone of our ongoing success lakeland has always owned its manufacturing operations and is therefore fairly unique in the ppe industry we have shown that with under 2 million in capital investments for production capacity expansions last year we were able to increase revenues by approximately 50 million lakeland has tremendous operating leverage that is proving to be sustainable outside of black swan events parallel investments in it systems have helped us become more efficient and more profitable as evidenced by our gross margin improvement our gross margin as a percentage of sales has shown sustainability above 40 a vast improvement from 35 2 in fiscal 2020 and 34 2 in fiscal 2019 with insights gained from our technology utilization our focus on new customer acquisition over the last year have yielded more than 500 new buyers these new buyers are showing significant loyalty in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 68 of whom placed reorders in q1 fy22 overall our erp installation has only been a factor for our us operations which are now less than 50 of our consolidated revenues as we implement the erp system globally we expect incremental benefits from the balance of our business the timing of our investment in technology could not have been better the current forecasts for economic growth and the return of industrial demand in most major markets around the world bode well for lakeland to realize post pandemic gains from increased market penetration rationalization of our product lines and our emphasis on higher margin specialized protective apparel lakeland has already elevated its profitability levels where we have fixed overhead enabling us to flex production for even greater returns as variable expenses are limited primarily to success based sales commissions and freight costs this is further confirmation of how actively managing expenses and driving costs out of the business through investments in technology and process improvements results in sustainability of our performance in a post covid business environment beginning in q4fy21 we began to see a decline in pandemic related sales and that trend has accelerated through q1fy22 because we sell through distribution and lack transparency as to the end users of our products our evidence of this trend is largely empirical yet still compelling since q4fy21 we have not seen any raw materials supply issues relating to demand in fact though prices remain above pre pandemic levels we have seen price reduction in raw materials that are indicative of declining global demand additionally we are seeing increasing pricing pressures within the protective clothing market that suggest that supply has not only caught up to demand but is now exceeding it resulting in increased inventory levels throughout the supply chain in q1fy21 we also saw a significant decline in our direct container sales which further reinforces this belief we anticipate that impact of covid 19 on sales in the u s canada and europe will be largely exhausted by the end of q2fy21 leaving only lesser levels of pandemic demand in developing regions of the world like india vietnam and some parts of south america we believe that surge related demand will continue to decline in the second half of fy22 and will be largely over by the end of fy22 lakeland has responded accordingly by scaling operational activities to address demand where it originates around the world and by accelerating our marketing efforts for the resumption of industrial economic growth which has been clearly evident over the past two quarters we used covid 19 to our advantage as a catalyst for transformation at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we have demonstrated resiliency in our operations and sustainability of our financial performance continued investments in our it systems data centric planning processes and organic growth initiatives are expected to drive ongoing improvements in productivity efficiencies and profitability these aspects of our business should be complemented by the inorganic growth opportunities such as business acquisitions that we are now pursuing or intend to pursue fiscal 2022 first quarter financial results net sales were 34 1 million for the three months ended april 30 2021 as compared to 45 6 million for the three months ended april 30 2020 and 36 9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 ended january 31 2021 on a consolidated basis for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 domestic sales were 15 7 million or 46 of total revenues and international sales were 18 4 million or 54 of total revenues this compares with domestic sales of 23 1 million or 51 of the total and international sales of 22 5 million or 49 of the total in the same period of fiscal 2021 while fiscal fourth quarter 2021 domestic sales were 16 0 million or 43 of total revenues and international sales were 20 9 million or 57 of total revenues during fiscal 2021 the company experienced significant growth in sales of disposable and chemical garments primarily relating to covid 19 demand and as a result of cultivating new industrial customers who could not procure these products from incumbent manufacturers or their subcontractors in addition global economic activity picked up beginning with the company s third quarter of fiscal 2021 as many businesses countries and industrial vertical markets eased earlier imposed temporary closures and lockdowns and due to a broader economic recovery the economic recovery has intensified through the fiscal 2022 first quarter as a result certain product lines outside of disposable and chemicals and international segments contributed increases in year over year sales for the first quarter foreign exchange currency translations negatively impacted sales in the uk europe canada and china as reported on a consolidated basis in u s dollars by approximately 0 2 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2022 gross profit of 14 4 million for fiscal 2022 first quarter decreased from 22 1 million for the same period of the prior year gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 42 2 for the fiscal 2022 first quarter as compared with 48 6 a year ago gross profit performance in the fiscal 2021 period benefited from higher volumes and related factory utilization favorable pricing and product mix the high gross margins as a percentage of sales in both periods continues to track above 40 this sustained performance level reflects the successful execution of strategies to enhance profitability particularly for new industrial customers select price increases growth in sales of new higher margin products manufacturing efficiencies and reduced product variations to isolate higher production runs on fewer garment lines the company s increased production hours and limited product skus from the first quarter of fiscal 2021 began to ease in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and have essentially been brought to a steady state by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022 lakeland reported operating profit of 6 2 million for the three months ended april 30 2021 as compared to 12 4 million for the quarter ended april 30 2020 operating margins were 18 3 for the three months ended april 30 2021 down from 27 1 for the first quarter of the prior fiscal year in fiscal 2021 performance was primarily elevated due to the company s operating leverage on the higher revenues and gross margins which more than offset increases in sales commissions and freight out and higher compensation tied in large part to the expanded workforce the company reported net income of 4 6 million or 0 58 per basic and 0 57 per diluted share for the three months ended april 30 2021 compared with 8 6 million or 1 08 per basic and 1 07 per diluted share in the prior year period as of april 30 2021 lakeland had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 60 3 million up from 52 6 million at

during an appearance on mobile al radio fm talk 106 5 rep jerry carl r al argued contradicting statements disclosed from national institute of allergy and infectious diseases director dr anthony fauci s emails revealed through a freedom of information act request and his public statements warranted scrutiny of his personal finances the alabama freshman republican lawmaker said one of the possible reasons for the discrepancies were financial gains earned from investments based on information fauci had access to and knowing how his own statements could influence markets carl acknowledged having no proof of wrongdoing but said there was no way of knowing because federal bureaucrats with such power are not held to the same accountability standards as federal elected officials my business side of my brain tells me there is more to this he said my common sense is it s going to be well covered up i should say us getting an answer is not necessarily expected but with that said we have so many bureaucrats that run so much of the government i think it is a fine opportunity for us as taxpayers to ask our bureaucrats did you make money off of this show us prove it to us in some way because we have so many bureaucrats obviously they re unelected there is no restraint on them their investment dr fauci may be a hundred percent clear i m quick to say i have nothing to prove this but the business side of my brain says there has got to be another angle and profit is the only other angle i can come up with in my head looking at his situation because his emails tell us he is telling the public one thing but he s telling his partners in that realm something totally different if you had the capacity to know that there are changes coming would you not step out there and buy stock or make an investment or take advantage of that situation if you think no one is watching carl added i m trying to raise the question more than i am trying to say this man is guilty of something i would love to look at his financials from a congressional standpoint i don t know how we can do that he is treated much different than i m treated but should he be i think that s the real question should he be treated different than an elected official as an elected official all of my finances are public if i trade or buy a stock based on knowledge that i have from being in congress that s insider trading it should be i ll never argue with that but you get someone in that position he can step out there and with a single statement change the stock market that s a strong question to start asking our bureaucrats follow jeff poor on twitter jeff_poor
new york after feeling the thrill of victory early this year by singlehandedly causing gamestop s stock to soar only to get crushed when it quickly crashed back to earth armies of smaller pocketed and novice investors are back for more these undaunted investors have resuscitated gamestop shares back above us 300 up from 40 in february after plunging from a peak of 347 they re also hauling new stocks onto the bandwagon they say is heading for the moon including the lesser known health insurance company clover health investments this second wave of leaps for meme stocks are just as staggering the movie theater chain amc entertainment soared to 62 last week from 2 early this year and once again professional wall street is calling the gains illogical many of these professionals had predicted the phenomenon of regular small fry investors piling into a stock en masse and sending it incredibly higher would fizzle out particularly after they felt the pain of losing some money instead the frenzy has endured and shows how powerful these investors remain at least for now they re armed with social media where they can convince others to champion the same stocks they also have zero fee trading apps that allow many to buy stock options which can offer bigger gains at a smaller upfront cost than buying a share of stock in exchange for potentially bigger percentage losses they ll do surprising things if given the tools said hossein azari ceo of cmorq a company that helps customers get into cryptocurrencies and advocates for a new world of decentralized finance azari sees it all stemming from people feeling left out as they watched wealthy investors and firms suck up the majority of the economy s gains in recent years now they see a way to get some for themselves they are not out there trying to prove anything he said they just want to kind of materialize the american dream for themselves some of the meme stock buyers believe fervently in the financial futures of the companies they re backing others say on social media posts that they re merely looking to cash in on whatever the next hot stock is most say that as long as other like minded investors stick together and hold the stock they ll protect each other and the stock s price malcolm ethridge a financial adviser with cic wealth outside washington d c said a range of his clients want to talk about meme stocks as well as cryptocurrencies ethridge also says it s not only younger investors pushing up meme stocks he s gotten just as many requests from his clients who are retirees i think in most cases though they really just wanted a professional to tell them why it wasn t a good idea to get involved just so that they could stop feeling like they were missing out he said this resurgence for meme stocks is a little different from the earlier supernova for one it hasn t dragged down the broader stock market back in january the mania helped knock down the s p 500 to its worst day in months that was a result of fears that some hedge funds would have to sell big unrelated stocks to raise cash to cover losses they were taking after betting that gamestop would fall several of today s meme stock winners do have chunks of their shares sold short where investors have made trades to profit if the price falls but not to the same degree as in january at gamestop roughly one in five of its shares available to trade has been sold short for example earlier this year more than 100 of them effectively were with some getting shorted multiple times the buying activity this time around also seems less fervent trading in call options which can give a buyer the right to buy 100 shares of stock at a set price at a later date surged to a two month high recently but it s still below the heights set in january over the last year trading activity for call options on single stocks has tended to move up and down with how restricted the economy has been by the pandemic according to deutsche bank strategists when people have been leaving their houses more often call option trading has tended to fall off which makes the last few weeks a notable exception so if getting burned by plunging prices for meme stocks once before didn t stop them and the possibility of doing things other than trading options while sitting on a couch hasn t so far what could slow the phenomenon regulators and politicians in washington have been discussing some options though nothing s come out of it yet gary gensler chair of the securities and exchange commission gave a speech wednesday where he once again criticized gamified investing many trading apps use features that encourage customers to make trades more often that brings in more revenue for the apps but some research also suggests it leads to lower returns for the average investor gensler said he s asked the sec s staff to gather public input on the topic he also said he s asked the staff for recommendations on changes to rules that govern the stock market s plumbing and how trading apps route retail investors orders to make sure they re getting the best execution gamestop separately said late wednesday that the sec s staff is conducting an investigation into the trading activity in its stock and those of other companies gamestop which received a request for documents on may 26 said it doesn t expect the inquiry to hurt the company the sec and other regulators could look for ways to force trading apps to offer more warnings to customers in hopes of slowing them down said john coffee a professor of law at columbia university they could start with making it clearer that trading options can be riskier than buying actual shares of a stock coffee is skeptical gamestop amc and others can hold onto their lofty prices which would need profits to explode higher extremely quickly to look rational according to traditional models used by financial analysts that means he s worried many retail investors may be setting themselves up for big losses in their zeal to ride the meme stock wave and he acknowledges that even if brokerages do offer more warnings that may not be enough to stop some traders as social media posts continue to encourage them to pile into certain stocks and given human nature as much as i believe in consumer protection coffee said i believe a fool and his money are parted

opening up many potential new markets the combination of these technologies has the potential to disrupt not just the high value titanium metals and powders market but also the far larger aluminum and stainless steel markets dr fang is a professor of metallurgy at the university of utah the hamr and gsd technologies were developed in part with the financial support provided by the advanced research project agency energy arpa e of the us department of energy from 2014 2019 dr fang is a leader in global advanced materials and manufacturing technologies for energy production storage and efficiency applications and is the sole or co inventor on more than 50 u s patents arpa e has provided over us 2 6 billion in r d funding for more than 1 000 potentially transformational energy technology projects arpa e analyzes and catalogues some of the agency s most successful projects through its impact sheets which explore a range of individual projects and their achievements the impact sheet for the hamr and gsd technologies is available here further development and optimization of titanium products from the hamr and gsd technologies has occurred subsequent to the arpa e funded activities the company is making significant progress with dr fang and his team in utah on both the hamr and gsd technologies and expects to make key updates including hamr powder production using the company s titanium minerals from the titan project commencement of gsd powder production from hamr titanium powders and or titanium recycled scrap techno economic assessment for the scale up of production of titanium metal and powders commenting on the agreement mr anastasios arima ceo and md of hyperion metals said titanium metal is the superior metal for a wide range of advanced applications from aerospace to defense and it should also be the logical choice for industrial and civilian applications titanium s widespread adoption has been held back in sectors such as consumer goods and electric vehicles due to its high cost the combination of the patented hamr and gsd technologies together with advances in 3d printing offers a pathway to dramatically reduce the cost and carbon emissions of titanium metal components furthermore recent studies by the fraunhofer news alert institute have shown that the fabrication of titanium parts using laser powder bed additive a 3d printing technique emits approximately 70 less co 2 than equivalent production by traditional milling processes hyperion s vision is to utilize these sustainable technologies and accelerate the rapid penetration of titanium in current and widespread applications in next generation mobility the light weighting of trucks trains drones and electric vehicles will lead to a quantum leap in the energy efficiency of these vehicles and will be large high growth new markets for titanium we aim to scale and commercialize these breakthrough technologies make the us the global leader in titanium production and deliver technological leadership for in titanium applications for aerospace space and defense commenting on the agreement dr z zak fang said we look forward to commercializing the hamr and gsd technologies with hyperion metals these technologies have produced titanium metal and powders that consistently met the purity requirements defined by industry standards and they have the potential to significantly lower the costs and carbon emissions of producing titanium metal and powders these technologies have the capacity to drastically alter the titanium stainless steel and aluminum markets and increase the range of applications for high performance lightweight and low cost titanium parts titanium powders for 3d printing additive manufacturing titanium has exceptional material properties including high strength light weight superior corrosion resistance and leading biocompatibility versus other metals producing high quality spherical powders from titanium and titanium alloys is one of the critical building blocks for the rapidly growing industrial scale 3d printing additive manufacturing sectors additive manufacturing with titanium can provide many benefits to the medical aerospace ev space and defense sectors including enhanced performance and sustainability by producing strong lightweight parts that have high levels of corrosion resistance and are 100 recyclable reduced production lead times through iterative software led design and rapid printing reduced waste and cost of producing a part with scrap rates of less than 10 compared to over 90 for complex milled parts in medical applications titanium powders allow the rapid production of made to measure medical implants that are strong lightweight and critically biocompatible to realize the benefits of utilizing titanium powders they need to meet very high chemical and physical standards this not only relates to high titanium or titanium alloy purities with low oxygen and other deleterious elements but physical properties of high sphericity specific particle size distribution and flowability hence these powders are typically produced via complex post processing techniques following on from the production of high purity titanium metal ingot or wire production spherical titanium powder production challenges the high cost of titanium spherical powders has curtailed its use in additive manufacturing for products that require its superior properties of strength to weight ratio corrosion resistance and biocompatibility the price of titanium metal is approximately 8 500 per ton1 with the price of titanium spherical powder suitable for 3d printing potentially over 300 000 per ton1 the current commercial processes for producing titanium spherical powders include gas atomization plasma atomization and the plasma rotating electrode process fine spherical powders can be produced with gas atomization and plasma atomization methods but after size classification the product yield is low the plasma rotating electrode process produces titanium powder with good purity and excellent spherical shape but the particle size is larger than required for many applications the limiting factor in all three processes is low product yield for fine powder which is one of the main technical reasons for the very high cost of titanium powder used in additive manufacturing gsd breakthrough spherical powder technology granulation sintering deoxygenation gsd is a thermochemical process for producing spherical titanium powders used in 3d printing and additive manufacturing and was invented by dr z zak fang and his team at the university of utah the gsd technology significantly improves the yield by up to 50 and produces a spherical powder with low oxygen controllable particle size and excellent flowability the gsd manufacturing process steps are titanium metal or alloy is hydrogenated to make friable hydride and is then milled into fine particles the fine hydride particles are granulated into spherical granules in the desired size range using spray drying the spherical granules are sintered to produce densified spherical titanium powder the densified spherical titanium powder is deoxygenated with magnesium to reduce the oxygen content to product specifications the gsd technology can also introduce desirable alloying ingredients with the titanium hydride powder made in step 1 to make titanium alloys for example titanium hydride powder can be blended with aluminum and vanadium powders to create the widely used alloy ti 6al 4v other alloying elements for titanium include fe nb zr and mo importantly the source material can also be recycled titanium scrap material the manufacturing of titanium components and structures can generate a large amount of titanium machining chips this scrap can be over 90 for complex traditionally milled parts this scrap titanium can be sorted cleaned and prepared for processing as the source material in step 1 above this recycling pathway for the gsd technology can reduce costs and significantly improve the sustainability of titanium metal manufacturing process advantages disadvantages granulation sintering deoxygenation controllable particle size low energy consumption very high powder yield very low waste a wide range of titanium alloys can easily be made excellent metallurgical quality excellent flowability recently invented and patented pilot scale requires commercial scale up gas atomisation excellent metallurgical quality high powder flow rates new and modified alloys can easily be made scalable technology very high volumes available and can easily support am growth large supply base variability in powder properties between suppliers large number of suppliers and atomising technologies can be confusing reactive and high melting point alloys not available few companies currently atomising titanium low product yield high cost plasma atomisation excellent metallurgical quality very high flow rates near perfect spheres reactive and high melting point alloys can be made titanium alloys available limited supply base only alloys available as wire can be made low product yield high cost plasma rotating electrode process excellent metallurgical quality very high flow rates perfect spheres reactive and high melting point alloys can be made titanium alloys available limited supply base but growing high quality bar needed as starting material low product yield high cost table 1 summary of powder characteristics by manufacturing process2 3 hamr technology hyperion already holds an exclusive license for the patented hamr technology that is a proven method for the production of titanium metal with significantly less energy than the current kroll process this technology was also developed by professor zak fang and his team at the university of utah with funding from the us department of energy the hamr technology has successfully produced titanium metal at pilot plant scale at product qualities that exceed current industry standards detailed economic energy analysis and process simulations indicate that the hamr process uses 50 less energy than the kroll process and offers a path to dropping the cost of titanium by approximately 50 using renewable electricity it can produce zero carbon titanium metal the opportunity the combination of the two patented technologies gsd and hamr plus the advent of wide scale industrial 3d printing capabilities offers a compelling market opportunity the successful scale up of these technologies could potentially produce zero carbon spherical titanium powders at a fraction of the cost with economic modelling indicating a reduction in costs per ton of over 75 oak ridge national laboratories reports that 3d printing can cut down manufacturers use of raw materials by up to 90 this quantum of efficiency and cost reduction would not just disrupt the titanium market but also the far larger aluminum and stainless steel markets titanium competes with metals such as aluminum and stainless steel for strength and corrosion resistance and while there are several other metals with excellent properties in these applications none have the same combined superior properties of strength weight and corrosive resistance as titanium the size of the global titanium primary metal market is us 4 2bn pa4 the size of the manufactured titanium part market which would be the relevant comparator for additive manufacturing with titanium powders is a multiple of us 4 2bn pa the global primary stainless steel market is us 115bn pa5 and the aluminum market us 150bn pa6 7 titanium is a superior metal for a wide range of high performance applications in the aerospace medical space and defense sectors it is only cost that has held it back from being used for its superior properties in larger consumer markets such as the global transportation industry the patented hamr and gsd technologies have the potential to provide a step change in the titanium supply chain process through eliminating process stages reducing energy consumption reducing carbon emissions and significantly cutting costs hyperion believes these breakthrough technologies offer a pathway to create the lowest cost lowest carbon titanium components globally next steps q3 2021 produce titanium powders at the blacksand

new york ap many u s companies have rushed to appoint black members to their boards of directors since racial justice protests swept the country last year but in the two preceding years progress on increasing racial diversity on boards stagnated a new study revealed tuesday black men even lost ground the study conducted by the alliance of board diversity and the consulting firm deloitte points to the steep deficit companies face when it comes to fulfilling pledges to diversity in their ranks an overwhelming 82 5 of directors among fortune 500 company boards are white according to the missing pieces report a board diversity census of women and minorities on fortune 500 boards the study suggests that until the may 2020 police killing of george floyd galvanized a national reckoning on systemic racism attention to racial diversity took something of a backseat to gender equality in boardrooms between july 2020 and may 2021 some 32 of newly appointed board members in the s p 500 were black according to an analysis by iss corporate solutions which advises companies on improving shareholder value and reducing risk that was a leap compared to 11 during the previous year but the time before then shows a sudden shift in priorities the missing pieces report found that the number of women serving on fortune 500 boards rose 4 percentage points to 26 5 between 2018 and june of 2020 a faster pace of progress than the 2 increase over the preceding two years in contrast the number of racial minorities on fortune 500 boards rose by just above a percentage point that was a slower pace than the 2 increase during the previous two years in a telling finding the number of black men on fortune 500 boards fell by 1 5 between 2018 and june 2020 even as the representation of black women rose by 18 attention to gender equality did bolster the ranks of minority women on fortune 500 boards though their numbers remain small at 6 according to the census the number of minority men remained virtually unchanged at just under 12 with racial minorities holding so few seats to begin with the findings underscore the need to pick up the pace of change said linda akutagawa chair for the alliance for board diversity asian hispanic and black women directors made the biggest percentage increases since 2018 but the raw number of seats each of those groups gained paled in comparison to the 209 seats gained by white women according to the study white women held three new seats for every new seat occupied by a woman from a racial minority the board diversity census based its findings on a two year review of public filings through june 30 2020 during that period companies responded to pressure to appoint more women to their boards california passed a law in 2017 requiring publicly traded firms headquartered in the state to have at least two or three women directors by 2021 depending on the size of their boards over the past year more pressure has arisen for boards to focus on racial diversity california gov gavin newsom signed a new law last year giving companies until the end of 2021 to have at least one board member from an underrepresented ethnic community or who identify as lgbt in december nasdaq filed a proposal with the securities and exchange commission to adopt new listing rules requiring companies to publicly disclose their board diversity statistics more than a dozen companies including zillow and m m lafleur signed a pledge in september to add at least one black director to their boards within a year carey oven national managing partner of deloitte s center for board effectiveness said that kind of rapid shift shows that progress on diversity is matter of corporate will rather than a lack of qualified minority candidates it s really a choice for boards to take steps to become more diverse oven said in april 140 racial justice leaders published a letter in the financial times demanding that the country s largest asset managers oppose all white boards at this year s shareholder meetings but the letter also called for them to oppose boards with arguably token representation by a single person of color boards draw a circle around everyone who is not a white male and call themselves diverse said eli kasargod staub executive director of majority action a nonprofit group that sponsored the letter that way of framing it often obscures that fact that they only have one person of color on their boards in december majority action along with the service employees international union released a report showing that 56 of the s p 500 companies had all white boards as of november 2020 the asset manager blackrock voted to approve the entire board at 52 of those companies at their 2020 shareholder meetings according to the report which cited research from iss analytics and public filings vanguard voted to support the entire board at 51 of the companies some fund giants have acknowledged they have been slower to push boardrooms to appoint more people of color compared to their advocacy to add more women but many say the momentum is turning blackrock said this year that it s raising its expectations for ethnic and gender diversity on corporate boards and it voted against more than 130 boards in the early part of 2021 because of a lack of it but it does not have a bright line rule for how many people of color should be on a board similar to how it expects u s companies to have at least two women on their board vanguard revised its proxy voting guidelines to warn it will vote against some board nominees at companies where lack of diversity is a concern but a vanguard spokeswoman said the investing giant believes there is no one size fits all mandate for board diversity and will evaluate each board individually state street global advisors the company behind the fearless girl statue that stared down the iconic charging bull statue near wall street said it will start voting against the chair of the board nominating committee at s p 500 companies next year if it doesn t have at least one underrepresented minority this year it began voting against nominating committee chairs of companies that fail to disclose the racial and ethnic composition of their boards we did see that progress was not being made quickly enough said benjamin colton state street s global co head of asset stewardship it was difficult for us to even gauge progress because we did not have that disclosure available

sampling techniques and data criteria commentary sampling techniques core samples are obtained from core drilling in proterozoic basement lithologies pq hq and nq diameter core was drilled on a 6m run core was cut using an automated core cutter and half core sampled at 1m intervals with breaks for major geological changes sampling intervals range from 0 2 1 0m cover sequences were not sampled drilling techniques permian paterson formation cover sequence was drilled using mud rotary drilling depths of cover typically observed to approximately 420m vertically below surface steel casing was emplaced to secure the pre collar core drilling was advanced from the base of the cover sequence with pq3 hq3 and nq2 diameter coring configuration core from inclined drill holes are oriented on 3m and 6m runs using an electronic core orientation tool reflex actiii at the end of each run the bottom of hole position is marked by the driller which is later transferred to the whole drill core run length with a bottom of hole reference line drill sample recovery core recovery is systematically recorded from the commencement of coring to end of hole by reconciling against driller s depth blocks in each core tray with data recorded in the database drillers depth blocks provided the depth interval of core recovered and interval of core drilled core recoveries were typically 100 with isolated zones of lower recovery cover sequence drilling by the mud rotary drilling did not yield recoverable samples logging geological logging recorded qualitative descriptions of lithology alteration mineralisation veining and structure for all core drilled 4 798 m for 7 drill holes all intersecting mineralisation including orientation of key geological features geotechnical measurements were recorded including rock quality designation rqd fracture frequency solid core recovery and qualitative rock strength measurements magnetic susceptibility measurements were recorded every metre the bulk density of selected drill core intervals was determined at site on whole core samples all geological and geotechnical logging was conducted at the havieron site digital data logging was captured on diamond drill core intervals only and all data validated and stored in an acquire database all drill cores were photographed prior to cutting and or sampling the core the logging is of sufficient quality to support mineral resource estimates sub sampling techniques and sample preparation sampling sample preparation and quality control protocols are considered appropriate for the material being sampled core was cut and sampled at the telfer and havieron core processing facility half core samples were collected in pre numbered calico bags and grouped in plastic bags for dispatch to the laboratory sample weights typically varied from 0 5 to 4kg sample sizes are considered appropriate for the style of mineralisation drill core samples were freighted by air and road to the laboratory sample preparation was conducted at the independent iso17025 accredited intertek laboratory perth intertek samples were dried at 105oc and crushed to 95 passing 4 75mm and the split to obtain up to 3kg sub sample which was pulverised using lm5 to produce a pulped product with the minimum standard of 95 passing 106µm routine grind size analysis is conducted duplicate samples were collected from crush and pulp samples at a rate of 1 20 duplicate results show an acceptable level of variability for the material sampled and style of mineralisation periodic size checks 1 20 for crush and pulp samples and sample weights are provided by the laboratory and recorded in the acquire database quality of assay data and laboratory tests assaying of drill core samples was conducted at intertek all samples were assayed for 48 elements using a 4 acid digestion followed by icp aes icp ms determination method 4a ms907 which is considered to provide a total assay for copper gold analyses were determined by 50g fire assay with aas finish method fa50n aa which is considered to provide a total assay for gold sampling and assaying quality control procedures consisted of inclusion of certified reference material crms coarse residue and pulp duplicates with each batch at least 1 20 assays of quality control samples were compared with reference samples in acquire database and verified as acceptable prior to use of data from analysed batches laboratory quality control data including laboratory standards blanks duplicates repeats and grind size results are captured in the acquire database and assessed for accuracy and precision for recent data extended quality control programs including pulp samples submitted to an umpire laboratory and combined with more extensive re submission programs have been completed analysis of the available quality control sample assay results indicates that an acceptable level of accuracy and precision has been achieved and the database contains no analytical data that has been numerically manipulated the assaying techniques and quality control protocols used are considered appropriate for the data to be used for reporting exploration drilling results verification of sampling and assaying sampling intervals defined by the geologist are electronically assigned sample identification numbers prior to core cutting corresponding sample numbers matching pre labelled calico bags are assigned to each interval all sampling and assay information were stored in a secure acquire database with restricted access electronically generated sample submission forms providing the sample identification number accompany each submission to the laboratory assay results from the laboratory with corresponding sample identification are loaded directly into the acquire database assessment of reported significant assay intervals was verified by re logging of diamond drill core intervals and assessment of high resolution core photography the verification of significant intersections has been completed by company personnel and the competent person qualified person no adjustments are made to assay data and no twinned holes have been completed there are no currently known drilling sampling recovery or other factors that could materially affect the accuracy or reliability of the data location of data points drill collar locations were surveyed using a differential gps with gnss with a stated accuracy of 0 5m for all drill holes reported drill rig alignment was attained using an electronic azimuth aligner downhole survey was collected at 6 12m intervals in the cover sequence and every 6 to 30m in diamond drill core segments of the drill hole using single shot axis mining champ gyro the single shot surveys have been validated using continuous survey to surface axis mining champ along with a selection of drill holes re surveyed by an external survey contactor using a devigyro tool confirming sufficient accuracy for downhole spatial recording a lidar survey was completed over the project area in nov 2019 which was used to prepare a dem topographic model for the project with a spatial accuracy of 0 1m vertical and 0 3m horizontal the topography is generally low relief to flat elevation within the dune corridors in ranges between 250 265m australian height datum ahd steepening to the southeast all collar coordinates are provided in the geocentric datum of australian gda20 zone 51 all relative depth information is reported in ahd 5000m data spacing and distribution within the south east crescent and breccia zone drill hole spacing ranges from 50 to 100m to 50 by 50m within the initial resource extents outside the initial resource boundary drill hole spacing ranges from 50 to 200m in lateral extent within the breccia zone over an area of 2km2 the data spacing is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity significant assay intercepts remain open further drilling is required to determine the extent of currently defined mineralisation no sample compositing is applied to samples drilling intersects mineralisation at various angles orientation of data in relation to geological structure drill holes exploring the extents of the havieron mineral system intersect moderately dipping carbonate and siliclastic sedimentary facies mineralised breccia and sub vertical intrusive lithologies geological modelling has been interpreted from historic and newcrest drill holes variable brecciation alteration and sulphide mineralisation is observed with a footprint with dimensions of 650m x 350m trending in a north west orientation and over 1000m in vertical extent below cover the subvertical southeast high grade arcuate crescent sulphide zone has an average thickness of 20m and has been defined over a strike length of up to 550m and extended to over 700m in vertical extent below cover drilling direction is oriented to intersect the steeply dipping high grade sulphide mineralisation zones at an intersection angle of greater than 40 degrees the drilled length of reported intersections is typically greater than true width of mineralisation sample security the security of samples is controlled by tracking samples from drill rig to database drill core was delivered from the drill rig to the havieron core yard every shift on completion of geological and geotechnical logging core processing was completed by newcrest personnel at the havieron facility high resolution core photography and cutting of drill core was undertaken at the havieron core processing facilities samples were freighted in sealed bags by air and road to the laboratory and in the custody of newcrest representatives sample numbers are generated directly from the database all samples are collected in pre numbered calico bags verification of sample numbers and identification is conducted by the laboratory on receipt of samples and sample receipt advise issued to newcrest details of all sample movement are recorded in a database table dates hole id sample ranges and the analytical suite requested are recorded with the dispatch of samples to analytical services any discrepancies logged at the receipt of samples into the analytical services are validated audits or reviews internal reviews of core handling sample preparation and assays laboratories were conducted on a regular basis by both project personnel and owner representatives in the competent person s opinion the sample preparation security and analytical procedures are consistent with current industry standards and are entirely appropriate and acceptable for the styles of mineralisation identified and will be appropriate for use in the reporting of exploration results and mineral resource estimates there are no identified drilling sampling or recovery factors that materially impact the adequacy and reliability of the results of the drilling

by leika kihara mfuneko toyana and karin strohecker tokyo johannesburg london reuters haunted by memories of past u s interest rate hikes the world s central banks are laying the groundwork for a transition to life with less global stimulus with many countries already signalling moves to the exit while the federal reserve is publicly committed to keeping interest rates near zero and no hikes are priced in until late next year at the earliest official comments about inflationary pressures could become a chorus in months ahead making tapering a more concrete prospect and likely heightening volatility in global financial markets for some developed economies a return to pre pandemic conditions means central bank stimulus withdrawal is already in the works meanwhile more vulnerable central banks are fortifying their financial systems to ward off the type of capital flight that hit emerging markets during the 2013 taper tantrum which was triggered by mere hints of fed tightening after years of super easy policy deployed during the global financial crisis there s a huge divergence among economies emerging from the pandemic and those lagging behind some emerging central banks may be forced to raise rates to defend their currencies even at the cost of hurting their still fragile economies said takahide kiuchi a former bank of japan boj board member this trend may broaden if the fed communicates its taper strategy in coming months this could be among risks for the global economy said kiuchi currently an economist at nomura research institute the fed has said it would not start scaling back its huge stimulus until there had been substantial further progress in healing the u s job market while job recovery remains patch stronger than expected inflation raises the possibility that the fed may have to tighten policy sooner than expected for now markets are bracing for the chance the fed will start to communicate its taper strategy at its jackson hole symposium in august with possible action later in the year some central banks are already responding in april canada s central bank became the first among group of seven nations to withdraw its pandemic era stimulus and signalled rates could begin to rise in 2022 the norwegian central bank has already announced plans to raise rates in the third or fourth quarter of 2021 new zealand and south korea have similarly dropped loud hints that policy tightening is on the agenda as conditions improve while decisions in such countries would primarily be driven by domestic considerations the fed s eventual withdrawal of support looms large as a global risk for every central bank even japan s central bank which has hardly budged from its ultra accommodative settings through decades of global cycles may see an opportunity to dial back stimulus a fed rate hike may give the boj a perfect opportunity to normalise policy without worrying too much about triggering a yen spike nomura s kiuchi said wobble watch developing economies face the biggest risks from fed tightening which have in the past caused market gyrations as rising u s interest rates attracted funds into dollar assets and away from emerging markets as happened in the 1998 and 2013 asian markets the epicentre of the 1998 asian financial crisis remain in significantly better shape with strong foreign reserves to support any currency rout india s central bank governor last week said its reserves now exceed 600 billion which it expects will help against challenges from global spillovers but some analysts warn that lessons from asia s financial crisis may not apply to the current pandemic induced shock this crisis is like no other in that it s not a financial crisis or an economic crisis said former boj official nobuyasu atago who is now an economist at japan s ichiyoshi securities the unevenness of the current global economy creates various risks for emerging economies among nations looking warily at the fed is indonesia which relies on overseas inflows to fund its current account deficit next year we must prepare for possibilities of the u s central bank the fed to shift its monetary policy reducing its liquidity intervention bank indonesia governor perry warjiyo said last month adding such u s policy shifts would likely impact local bond yields the more vulnerable emerging market central banks such as brazil ghana and armenia have already started their tightening cycle on rising inflation pressures russia s central bank is expected to raise rates on friday for the third time in a row with inflation well above its target according to a reuters poll turkey was ahead of the pack and aggressively tightened last year a move its central bank governor hopes will serve as a shield against any fed pivot but heavy foreign debt keeps turkey vulnerable to talk of fed tapering rising u s yields recently helped push the lira to all time lows delaying planned rate cuts for now policymakers in places such as thailand the philippines and south africa buy the view the fed won t hike prematurely and are confident that its communication to markets will be transparent but they acknowledge risks the fed has said it would like to see more inflation in the united states they ve indicated they d have some tolerance for inflation south african reserve bank deputy governor fundi tshazibana told reuters what all of us don t know is what that tolerance band is reporting by leika kihara in tokyo mfuneko toyana in johannesburg karin strohecker in london additional reporting by jonathan spicer in

production plan a spokesman said via email the update we provided on our most recent earnings call and in yesterday s updated sec filing indicated that increased r d spending due to covid related supply chain issues and the strategic decision to in source production of certain parts simply means we now have confirmed that we will need that additional funding in the near term to ramp to commercial production levels the fledgling youngstown company went public last year lordstown motors stock dropped sharply at the general concern filing news down to 10 12 at wednesday s opening bell on wall street continuing a more than 30 percent slide that began on the release of the filing tuesday afternoon hill also a member of the ohio manufacturing institute at osu believes lordstown s filing is likely a result of issues company auditors found around the time of a may 24 earnings call when ceo steve burns said more cash on hand to make its initial production forecast of 2 200 trucks per year lordstown is spending a lot of money on a third party engineering staff hill said partly at technology licensor workhorse in cincinnati but also an office recently opened in michigan freight rates and sensor shortages are also impacting cash flow and hill also believes the electric truck market is due for a consolidation betting on a buyout those companies that have weak finance or weak product the vultures will start circling pretty quickly but they can indeed make it out if i had to place a bet the bet i would place is someone else buys them out hill said the most likely outcome is a takeover by an existing automotive brand that thinks there s something distinctive about the technology then the question is do they want the plant what that would mean for the mahoning valley is unclear hill said economic developers can t be blamed for promoting the area after general motors unallocated the chevy cruze plant in march 2019 but the voltage valley hype was premature i ve never been a fan of economic development marketing taglines that are in advance of market reality he said you know they make lovely bumper stickers hill said he also doesn t blame lawmakers like youngstown area rep tim ryan or gov mike dewine for defending ohio s economy but backlash is possible when government gets involved in betting on technologies and trying to establish industries that aren t there yet when they crash and burn there s going to be a price to be paid hill said other developments ryan for his part said wednesday he was concerned about the news from the electric truck company but optimistic about the mahoning valley s overall manufacturing future undoubtedly the news coming out of lordstown motors is concerning and while i will continue to use my position to assist them wherever possible it is important to remember that they are one piece of a larger movement transforming our region into what has been coined as voltage valley ryan said between the amazing work being done at brite energy innovators the ultium cells llc electric battery plant in lordstown which will be up and running early next year and is slated to create 1 100 new high tech jobs and the numerous companies in the electric vehicle supply chain that the youngstown warren regional chamber is currently aiding our community is still leading the jobs of the future hill added that while southeast michigan is ahead of ohio in terms of electric vehicle research and development and battery plants he agreed with ryan that the mahoning valley is making some of the right economic moves even without lordstown motors in the equation with small companies moving into digital production the 3 d printing emphasis is real hill said you ve got a company like m7 technologies kind of at the cutting edge of blending traditional manufacturing with digital manufacturing so there s stuff going on there for most regional economies there is not one silver bullet one golden ring on the merry go round that turns around the economy hill said general motors and south korean company lg chem broke ground on a battery plant last summer which is very positive for the region according to hill but hill said lordstown motors recent lack of transparency is also affecting confidence as is the established competition gm has two trucks well under development and you know they re real that s the hummer and their version of the silverado that s electric hill said ram truck has announced their electric truck ford has the f 150 there s no way those three companies are going to give up the largest source of profits without a fight ohio democrat sen sherrod brown called the company s financial news concerning i remain committed to helping lordstown motors and workers in the valley brown told ideastream we re continuing to support lordstown motors efforts to secure an advanced technology vehicles manufacturing loan from the department of energy and stand ready to offer support in any other ways we can

competition within legal psychedelic drugs has only barely taken shape but companies focused on therapy will be the ultimate winners as legalization expands and researchers seek regulatory approval for such drugs paired with therapy one industry executive said wednesday x ronan levy co founder and executive chairman of therapy clinic operator field trip health ftrpf said in an interview wednesday that competition currently revolves around clinics that administer ketamine within those clinics there are those that focus on therapy which can cost more and those that don t most other competitors just provide people with a ketamine iv infusion and then send them on their way he said in an interview wednesday so they re treating it like an antidepressant as this industry evolves he continued ketamine infusion centers are not necessarily going to be well equipped to provide other psychedelic assisted therapies field trip stock listing levy made the remarks after field trip a day earlier said it submitted an application to list on the nasdaq a potential listing on the exchange he said wednesday would help it reach a more global investor audience u s listed shares which currently trade over the counter rose 4 4 in wednesday the stock market trading field trip plans to have 20 clinics that offer ketamine assisted psychotherapy operating or under construction by the end of the year the company said in a release on tuesday the company s website currently lists clinics in cities toronto new york los angeles chicago atlanta houston and amsterdam those clinics currently offer psychotherapy using ketamine but could offer other psychedelic drugs as they receive approval ketamine drug routinely used as an anaesthetic has seen its reputation evolve from rave drug to therapeutic researchers say it can function as an antidepressant spravato a drug from johnson johnson jnj that uses a derivative of ketamine was approved in 2019 for treatment resistant depression clinics that offer ketamine assisted psychotherapy which generally combines a dose of ketamine with music and talk therapy already exist in the u s sessions are often bunched together into the first few weeks of therapy and spaced out after a single session can run at around 500 however practices at each clinic can differ expertise at ketamine clinics overall be it in anesthesiology or psychotherapy can vary elsewhere drug developer compass pathways cmps is researching a therapy regimen that uses a crystalline form of psilocybin the psychoactive compound in magic mushrooms the nonprofit multidisciplinary association for psychedelic studies or maps said last month that most patients in a trial for mdma assisted therapy therapy using the drug mdma commonly known ecstacy no longer qualified for a ptsd diagnosis psychedelic drugs u s exchanges field trip s nasdaq listing would follow similar moves from psychedelic drug developers mindmed mnmd has listed on the nasdaq compass pathways debuted on the exchange last year atai life sciences meanwhile has filed for an ipo more private companies are trying to cash in on psychedelic drugs potential to combat depression anxiety and addiction the trend has brought investor money to a community where nonprofits and universities have driven research and competition is regarded with suspicion despite the potential benefits the risks to running a psychedelics business are similar to those of any legal drug developer where research can hit snags and where regulatory approval isn t a given additionally research is expensive drug developers will also need to show their products are original to secure patents and profits and profits and revenue for the companies trading on u s exchanges could be years way potentially straining investors patience still oregon in november voted to legalize psilocybin therapy but executives in the industry have said the path to developing more psychedelic medication would likely be carved by fda approval more than state legalization last month field trip health also appointed former u s senator tom daschle a onetime senate majority leader as special advisor the company said he would receive a stipend and options consistent with grants made to the members of the board of directors of field trip levy declined to provide further specifics on that compensation he said daschle would help build awareness in political circles new psychedelic drug to begin human trial he also said field trip is developing a psychedelic compound called ft 104 he said that substance comes from a known psychedelic molecule whose composition the company has tweaked the intent he said was to develop a drug that worked like psilocybin but with a shorter duration two to three hours as opposed to four or more potentially lowering the costs for treatment a patient or a person has to be in a clinical setting for essentially an entire day levy said of working with the currently existing form of psilocybin that means a doctor is present for the entire day you may need all of the support and administrative staff for the entire day however levy said the substance which he described as a tryptamine was not derived from psilocybin he declined to share other details about ft 104 more details he said would be available in the coming months when they file for a patent field trip on tuesday said it anticipates being able to start phase 1 human trials for the substance by the end of the year where and how many patients might be involved was unclear compass pathways

stan choe associated press new york after feeling the thrill of victory early this year by singlehandedly causing gamestop s stock to soar only to get crushed when it quickly crashed back to earth armies of smaller pocketed and novice investors are back for more these undaunted investors have resuscitated gamestop shares back above 300 up from 40 in february after plunging from a peak of 347 they re also hauling new stocks onto the bandwagon they say is heading for the moon including the lesser known health insurance company clover health investments this second wave of leaps for meme stocks are just as staggering the movie theater chain amc entertainment soared to 62 last week from 2 early this year and once again professional wall street is calling the gains illogical many of these professionals had predicted the phenomenon of regular small fry investors piling into a stock en masse and sending it incredibly higher would fizzle out particularly after they felt the pain of losing some money instead the frenzy has endured and shows how powerful these investors remain at least for now they re armed with social media where they can convince others to champion the same stocks they also have zero fee trading apps that allow many to buy stock options which can offer bigger gains at a smaller upfront cost than buying a share of stock in exchange for potentially bigger percentage losses they ll do surprising things if given the tools said hossein azari ceo of cmorq a company that helps customers get into cryptocurrencies and advocates for a new world of decentralized finance azari sees it all stemming from people feeling left out as they watched wealthy investors and firms suck up the majority of the economy s gains in recent years now they see a way to get some for themselves they are not out there trying to prove anything he said they just want to kind of materialize the american dream for themselves some of the meme stock buyers believe fervently in the financial futures of the companies they re backing others say on social media posts that they re merely looking to cash in on whatever the next hot stock is most say that as long as other like minded investors stick together and hold the stock they ll protect each other and the stock s price malcolm ethridge a financial adviser with cic wealth outside washington d c said a range of his clients want to talk about meme stocks as well as cryptocurrencies ethridge also says it s not only younger investors pushing up meme stocks he s gotten just as many requests from his clients who are retirees i think in most cases though they really just wanted a professional to tell them why it wasn t a good idea to get involved just so that they could stop feeling like they were missing out he said this resurgence for meme stocks is a little different from the earlier supernova for one it hasn t dragged down the broader stock market back in january the mania helped knock down the s p 500 to its worst day in months that was a result of fears that some hedge funds would have to sell big unrelated stocks to raise cash to cover losses they were taking after betting that gamestop would fall several of today s meme stock winners do have chunks of their shares sold short where investors have made trades to profit if the price falls but not to the same degree as in january at gamestop roughly one in five of its shares available to trade has been sold short for example earlier this year more than 100 of them effectively were with some getting shorted multiple times the buying activity this time around also seems less fervent trading in call options which can give a buyer the right to buy 100 shares of stock at a set price at a later date surged to a two month high recently but it s still below the heights set in january over the last year trading activity for call options on single stocks has tended to move up and down with how restricted the economy has been by the pandemic according to deutsche bank strategists when people have been leaving their houses more often call option trading has tended to fall off which makes the last few weeks a notable exception so if getting burned by plunging prices for meme stocks once before didn t stop them and the possibility of doing things other than trading options while sitting on a couch hasn t so far what could slow the phenomenon regulators and politicians in washington have been discussing some options though nothing s come out of it yet gary gensler chair of the securities and exchange commission gave a speech wednesday where he once again criticized gamified investing many trading apps use features that encourage customers to make trades more often that brings in more revenue for the apps but some research also suggests it leads to lower returns for the average investor gensler said he s asked the sec s staff to gather public input on the topic he also said he s asked the staff for recommendations on changes to rules that govern the stock market s plumbing and how trading apps route retail investors orders to make sure they re getting the best execution gamestop separately said late wednesday that the sec s staff is conducting an investigation into the trading activity in its stock and those of other companies gamestop which received a request for documents on may 26 said it doesn t expect the inquiry to adversely hurt the company the sec and other regulators could look for ways to force trading apps to offer more warnings to customers in hopes of slowing them down said john coffee a professor of law at columbia university they could start with making it clearer that trading options can be riskier than buying actual shares of a stock coffee is skeptical gamestop amc and others can hold onto their lofty prices which would need profits to explode higher extremely quickly to look rational according to traditional models used by financial analysts that means he s worried many retail investors may be setting themselves up for big losses in their zeal to ride the meme stock wave and he acknowledges that even if brokerages do offer more warnings that may not be enough to stop some traders as social media posts continue to encourage them to pile into certain stocks and given human nature as much as i believe in consumer protection coffee said i believe a fool and his money are parted

providence whether selling city bonds to investors is a creative solution to the seemingly intractable providence pension problem or an overly risky venture with potentially devastating consequences depends who you ask mayor jorge o elorza made his pitch to the house finance committee on wednesday on the proposed 704 million pension obligation bond based on legislation sponsored by rep scott slater d providence the 25 year fixed interest rate pension obligation bond requires legislation to bypass state laws that limit the amount of debt municipalities can take on relative to their assessed property value elorza acknowledged the risks involved in what many financial experts consider a controversial borrowing plan but insisted it was better than the alternative of a woefully underfunded pension saddled with ballooning annual payments and court ordered mandates that limit alternatives the risk of a pension obligation bond is negligible compared to the risk of doing nothing elorza said advertisement the city currently faces a 1 2 billion unfunded pension liability and escalating annual payments that according to city projections would hit 227 million by 2040 city solicitor jeffrey dana said the city is far more at risk of bankruptcy for failing to meet these pension payments than for not defaulting on the pension obligation bond borrowing money would bring the pension fund up to 65 funding the day the bond closes reaching 78 by 2033 according to city projections it would also decrease the city s annual pension payments beginning by shaving off 10 million from its fiscal 2022 payment elorza also highlighted the opportune timing provided by low interest rates which allow the city to turn a profit in the margin between borrowing costs and investment returns but timing was also an issue of concern for some detractors michael debiase ceo and president of the rhode island public expenditure council in a letter to the house finance committee described pension obligation bonds as a bet on timing of capital markets and that low interest rates were offset by high stock market valuations that the bond is more than the entire city operating budget also increases risk for substantial loss which the city has little cushion to absorb dibiase wrote r i general treasurer seth magaziner recommended against the proposal in written testimony magaziner pointed to analysis by the state investment consultant that the city faces a 35 1 risk of higher overall costs based on current asset allocations and a 4 5 return on investment the city s analysis is based on its current 7 return rate though city stress tests presented wednesday showed a net positive result as long as returns hit or exceeded 4 47 elorza also said the city was willing to be flexible in details such as the borrowing amount the amortization period and the schedule of bond payments which were among magaziner s concerns whether the bond is the only option left was also a source of disagreement elorza insisted it was noting that even after a decade of meeting its annual pension obligation payments the fund is still suffering due to the structure of payments to retirees a 2020 r i supreme court decision also limits the city s ability to negotiate terms of these payouts that were set under a 2012 settlement there is not a single serious alternative proposal that has been put forward elorza said dibiase however criticized the plan for its lack of structural reforms he suggested reducing benefits or increasing employee contributions as potential alternatives to solve the pension crisis in the long term the bond plan would remove any incentive to address these structural issues for the foreseeable future dibiase wrote not to be forgotten was the botched pension obligation bond that still haunts woonsocket nearly 20 years after it issued its own 90 million pension obligation bond a stock market crash and poor investment decisions created what steven frias rhode island s republican national committeeman described as a financial meltdown in an op ed for the cranston herald that was also submitted to the house finance committee the pension plan is still about 70 unfunded according to frias seeking to differentiate the providence proposal from its failed woonsocket predecessor elorza pointed to a 10 year par call provision in the city s proposal that allows for refinancing favorable market conditions and a more conservative rate of return also guarantee a better spread for providence elorza said finance committee members questioned elorza and city financial advisers on details of the proposal with several mentioning the government finance officers association s recommendation against issuing pension obligation bonds

hyperion s titan project has the potential to provide a sustainable zero carbon low cost and fully integrated titanium spherical metal powder supply chain in the usa hyperion has secured the exclusive rights to the patented granulation sintering deoxygenation gsd technology developed by dr z zak fang for producing zero carbon low cost spherical titanium powders gsd offers major advantages in the production of spherical titanium for use in 3d printing including production of titanium and titanium alloy powders with low oxygen controllable particle size and excellent flowability higher manufacturing yields than current processes leading to significantly lower costs energy efficient process leading to a zero carbon process when coupled with renewable power ability to utilize lower cost and sustainable feedstocks including recycled titanium metal powders scrap or hamr titanium powders the combination of producing titanium metal via the hamr process followed by the production of titanium spherical powders via the gsd process has the potential to substantially reduce the total cost of titanium powders for 3d printing opening up many potential new markets opening up many potential new markets the combination of these technologies has the potential to disrupt not just the high value titanium metals and powders market but also the far larger aluminum and stainless steel markets dr fang is a professor of metallurgy at the university of utah the hamr and gsd technologies were developed in part with the financial support provided by the advanced research project agency energy arpa e of the us department of energy from 2014 2019 dr fang is a leader in global advanced materials and manufacturing technologies for energy production storage and efficiency applications

making significant progress with dr fang and his team in utah on both the hamr and gsd technologies and expects to make key updates including hamr powder production using the company s titanium minerals from the titan project commencement of gsd powder production from hamr titanium powders and or titanium recycled scrap techno economic assessment for the scale up of production of titanium metal and powders commenting on the agreement mr anastasios arima ceo and md of hyperion metals said titanium metal is the superior metal for a wide range of advanced applications from aerospace to defense and it should also be the logical choice for industrial and civilian applications titanium s widespread adoption has been held back in sectors such as consumer goods and electric vehicles due to its high cost the combination of the patented hamr and gsd technologies together with advances in 3d printing offers a pathway to dramatically reduce the cost and carbon emissions of titanium metal components furthermore recent studies by the fraunhofer institute have shown that the fabrication of titanium parts using laser powder bed additive a 3d printing technique emits approximately 70 less co 2 than equivalent production by traditional milling processes hyperion s vision is to utilize these sustainable technologies and accelerate the rapid penetration of titanium in current and widespread applications in next generation mobility the light weighting of trucks trains drones and electric vehicles will lead to a quantum leap in the energy efficiency of these vehicles and will be large high growth new markets for titanium we aim to scale and commercialize these breakthrough technologies make the us the global leader in titanium production and deliver technological leadership for in titanium applications for aerospace space and defense commenting on the agreement dr z zak fang said we look forward to commercializing the hamr and gsd technologies with hyperion metals these technologies have produced titanium metal and powders that consistently met the purity requirements defined by industry standards and they have the potential to significantly lower the costs and carbon emissions of producing titanium metal and powders these technologies have the capacity to drastically alter the titanium stainless steel and aluminum markets and increase the range of applications for high performance lightweight and low cost titanium parts titanium powders for 3d printing additive manufacturing titanium has exceptional material properties including high strength light weight superior corrosion resistance and leading biocompatibility versus other metals producing high quality spherical powders from titanium and titanium alloys is one of the critical building blocks for the rapidly growing industrial scale 3d printing additive manufacturing sectors additive manufacturing with titanium can provide many benefits to the medical aerospace ev space and defense sectors including enhanced performance and sustainability by producing strong lightweight parts that have high levels of corrosion resistance and are 100 recyclable reduced production lead times through iterative software led design and rapid printing reduced waste and cost of producing a part with scrap rates of less than 10 compared to over 90 for complex milled parts in medical applications titanium powders allow the rapid production of made to measure medical implants that are strong lightweight and critically biocompatible to realize the benefits of utilizing titanium powders they need to meet very high chemical and physical standards this not only relates to high titanium or titanium alloy purities with low oxygen and other deleterious elements but physical properties of high sphericity specific particle size distribution and flowability hence these powders are typically produced via complex post processing techniques following on from the production of high purity titanium metal ingot or wire production spherical titanium powder production challenges the high cost of titanium spherical powders has curtailed its use in additive manufacturing for products that require its superior properties of strength to weight ratio corrosion resistance and biocompatibility the price of titanium metal is approximately 8 500 per ton1 with the price of titanium spherical powder suitable for 3d printing potentially over 300 000 per ton1 the current commercial processes for producing titanium spherical powders include gas atomization plasma atomization and the plasma rotating electrode process fine spherical powders can be produced with gas atomization and plasma atomization methods but after size classification the product yield is low the plasma rotating electrode process produces titanium powder with good purity and excellent spherical shape but the particle size is larger than required for many applications the limiting factor in all three processes is low product yield for fine powder which is one of the main technical reasons for the very high cost of titanium powder used in additive manufacturing gsd breakthrough spherical powder technology granulation sintering deoxygenation gsd is a thermochemical process for producing spherical titanium powders used in 3d printing and additive manufacturing and was invented by dr z zak fang and his team at the university of utah the gsd technology significantly improves the yield by up to 50 and produces a spherical powder with low oxygen controllable particle size and excellent flowability the gsd manufacturing process steps are titanium metal or alloy is hydrogenated to make friable hydride and is then milled into fine particles the fine hydride particles are granulated into spherical granules in the desired size range using spray drying the spherical granules are sintered to produce densified spherical titanium powder the densified spherical titanium powder is deoxygenated with magnesium to reduce the oxygen content to product specifications the gsd technology can also introduce desirable alloying ingredients with the titanium hydride powder made in step 1 to make titanium alloys for example titanium hydride powder can be blended with aluminum and vanadium powders to create the widely used alloy ti 6al 4v other alloying elements for titanium include fe nb zr and mo importantly the source material can also be recycled titanium scrap material the manufacturing of titanium components and structures can generate a large amount of titanium machining chips this scrap can be over 90 for complex traditionally milled parts this scrap titanium can be sorted cleaned and prepared for processing as the source material in step 1 above this recycling pathway for the gsd technology can reduce costs and significantly improve the sustainability of titanium metal manufacturing process advantages disadvantages granulation sintering deoxygenation controllable particle size low energy consumption very high powder yield very low waste a wide range of titanium alloys can easily be made excellent metallurgical quality excellent flowability recently invented and patented pilot scale requires commercial scale up gas atomisation excellent metallurgical quality high powder flow rates new and modified alloys can easily be made scalable technology very high volumes available and can easily support am growth large supply base variability in powder properties between suppliers large number of suppliers and atomising technologies can be confusing reactive and high melting point alloys not available few companies currently atomising titanium low product yield high cost plasma atomisation excellent metallurgical quality very high flow rates near perfect spheres reactive and high melting point alloys can be made titanium alloys available limited supply base only alloys available as wire can be made low product yield high cost plasma rotating electrode process excellent metallurgical quality very high flow rates perfect spheres reactive and high melting point alloys can be made titanium alloys available limited supply base but growing high quality bar needed as starting material low product yield high cost table 1 summary of powder characteristics by manufacturing process2 3 hamr technology hyperion already holds an exclusive license for the patented hamr technology that is a proven method for the production of titanium metal with significantly less energy than the current kroll process this technology was also developed by professor zak fang and his team at the university of utah with funding from the us department of energy the hamr technology has successfully produced titanium metal at pilot plant scale at product qualities that exceed current industry standards detailed economic energy analysis and process simulations indicate that the hamr process uses 50 less energy than the kroll process and offers a path to dropping the cost of titanium by approximately 50 using renewable electricity it can produce zero carbon titanium metal the opportunity the combination of the two patented technologies gsd and hamr plus the advent of wide scale industrial 3d printing capabilities offers a compelling market opportunity the successful scale up of these technologies could potentially produce zero carbon spherical titanium powders at a fraction of the cost with economic modelling indicating a reduction in costs per ton of over 75 oak ridge national laboratories reports that 3d printing can cut down manufacturers use of raw materials by up to 90 this quantum of efficiency and cost reduction would not just disrupt the titanium market but also the far larger aluminum and stainless steel markets titanium competes with metals such as aluminum and stainless steel for strength and corrosion resistance and while there are several other metals with excellent properties in these applications none have the same combined superior properties of strength weight and corrosive resistance as titanium the size of the global titanium primary metal market is us 4 2bn pa4 the size of the manufactured titanium part market which would be the relevant comparator for additive manufacturing with titanium powders is a multiple of us 4 2bn pa the global primary stainless steel market is us 115bn pa5 and the aluminum market us 150bn pa6 7 titanium is a superior metal for a wide range of high performance applications in the aerospace medical space and defense sectors it is only cost that has held it back from being used for its superior properties in larger consumer markets such as the global transportation industry the patented hamr and gsd technologies have the potential to provide a step change in the titanium supply chain process through eliminating process stages reducing energy consumption reducing carbon emissions and significantly cutting costs hyperion believes these breakthrough technologies offer a pathway to create the lowest cost lowest carbon titanium components globally next steps q3 2021 produce titanium powders at the blacksand technology s

spotlight pa is an independent nonpartisan newsroom powered by the philadelphia inquirer in partnership with pennlive the patriot news triblive pittsburgh tribune review and witf public media sign up for our free newsletters a dissident group of trustees for pennsylvania s largest pension fund on wednesday was seeking to gain majority support to fire the retirement plan s chief executive and top investment officer as the fund grapples with an fbi investigation and management mistakes the dissidents have drafted and are circulating a detailed seven page letter castigating the investment strategy and governance of glen grell the former republican state legislator who leads the psers fund and investment chief james h grossman jr a fund veteran who is the highest paid employee in state government a draft of the letter obtained by spotlight pa and the inquirer says grell and grossman must depart now to fix an irrevocable loss of trust and confidence that is a consequence of persistent underperformance and repeated governance failures leaders of the ouster would not talk publicly wednesday nor would psers official spokespeople while the number of trustees on the 15 member board favoring an ouster was in flux people familiar with the proposed move say as many as six may have endorsed firing the two executives in an unusual bipartisan twist the sources identified republican state treasurer stacy garrity and the democrat she defeated former state treasurer joe torsella both board members now as working closely together to drum up support for the change the sources also identified state sen katie muth d montgomery in particular as firmly committed to the effort the situation appears nearly set for a boardroom showdown as the fund leaders plan to conduct two days of meetings thursday and friday the ouster plan is emerging as grell and grossman are pushing for the psers board to green light nearly 1 2 billion in new investments that would double down on the pair s signature alternative investments this is the very investment approach that critics say has led to the lackluster performance of a fund crucial to 265 000 retired public school teachers in a sign of growing dissatisfaction with grell and grossman five members of the board voted against the investments staff recommended at psers march board meeting those still passed each with nine votes including that of board chair christopher santa maria the proposed ouster comes after federal prosecutors and the fbi launched an investigation in the spring into the 64 billion fund the public school employees retirement system which sends 6 billion annually to retirees grand jury subpoenas have been sent to the fund and to top officials and were obtained by spotlight and the inquirer those documents reveal that authorities were investigating the fund s 5 million appropriation to buy harrisburg properties near its headquarters and the board s botched adoption last year of a false and exaggerated figure for investment performance critics have also focused on the luxury worldwide business travel by its investment staff and on monday the fund s management disclosed that it had filed numerous error filled forms with the irs misstating the role of investment staffers on nonprofits that own the system s real estate investments in the draft letter though the dissidents refer only briefly to the federal probe instead they marshal figures and charts to say that the psers fund has been poorly managed for years by executives and an investment staff who have shrugged off board oversight to pursue unsuccessful strategies the letter notes psers now has 63 of its money in so called alternative investments whose true value is hard to measure because they aren t traded on public stock markets this is more than double the alternatives bet made by other public pension plans as a group it said if the plan had been more conventional the draft letter says psers would have spent much less and profited far more by the critics math it would have 81 billion to pay future pensions not 64 billion had the plan kept pace with the top group of public pension plans over the last decade in a mistake now under fbi scrutiny the board in december endorsed what turned out to be an incorrect number for its performance returns it did so after skeptical board members led by torsella questioned the management s math and after grossman said we did our due diligence we covered it i m not worried about it in april the board reversed course abandoned the december number as a flawed calculation and adopted one that fell slightly beneath a target a state law links teachers payments into the fund to performance results thus the miss on the target meant that 100 000 teachers and other staff hired since 2011 will have to pay 26 million more into the plan yearly the letter says yet the dissidents write even after the calculation debacle psers management continued to give raises to the 50 member investment staff headed by grossman grossman is paid 485 000 yearly more than twice the governor s salary he joined the fund s staff 24 years ago and became the investment chief eight years ago grell who is paid 227 000 served in the state house for a harrisburg area district for 11 years before taking the helm at psers in a long list of complaints the draft letter portrays psers staff as dominating the psers board it said executives provided key material to the panel only at the last minute hired staff without board approval wrested control of the choice of consultants and talked down board dissidents to the media in a sign of the schisms on the board muth on tuesday sued the agency itself in commonwealth court accusing it of improperly keeping her in the dark about the fund s policies on wednesday psers managers hit back the agency is aware of and disappointed by sen muth s unnecessary action in filing her meritless lawsuit spokesperson evelyn williams said she added that managers look forward to getting the suit thrown out but garrity and torsella rallied behind muth withholding important documents from a trustee is outrageous garrity said in a statement much of what senator muth has requested are either past documents already provided to the board internal investment memoranda prepared to support recommendations to the board or documents that are public records said torsella in a separate statement i have long believed that psers management should embrace rather than resist transparency and robust board oversight i am disappointed but not surprised they are taking this unfortunate approach while you re here if you learned something from this story pay it forward and become a member of spotlight pa so someone else can in the future at

since president joe biden floated the idea of banning oil imports from russia in response to president vladimir putin s invasion of ukraine there has been considerable speculation as to which countries can fill the supply gap in early march 2022 washington sent an official mission to caracas to open negotiations with president nicolas maduro s pariah authoritarian regime the trip sparked fears that biden s administration would ease sanctions against venezuela in a cynical attempt to boost u s petroleum supplies thereby easing domestic gasoline prices guyana ecuador and colombia have also been considered by analysts as well as industry insiders as potential sources of the additional crude oil needed to fill the supply gap all three south american nations despite possessing burgeoning hydrocarbon sectors lack the capacity to rapidly ramp up output to meet growing u s supply needs latin america s largest petroleum producer brazil however is a different story brazil s hydrocarbon sector proved resilient to the covid 19 pandemic which sharply impacted petroleum operations in other jurisdictions in the region including colombia ecuador and argentina latin america s largest oil producer was the only country in south america to report an increase in petroleum production during 2020 as the chart from the u s eia shows source u s eia by march 2022 data from brazil s hydrocarbon regulator national agency for petroleum natural gas and biofuels anp portuguese initials showed total hydrocarbon output had reached a daily average of 3 8 million barrels of petroleum equivalent 78 weighted to crude oil that number was 1 9 higher month over month and a notable 5 greater than the equivalent period a year earlier oil output for that period of 2 98 million barrels daily was 2 2 higher than february 2022 and a notable 4 8 higher than match 2021 that production growth was driven by brazil s vast deep water pre salt oilfields with pre salt production for march 2022 rising by an impressive 8 year over year to 2 88 million barrels or almost 87 of crude oil output for that period greater production growth is expected as national oil company petrobras which is responsible for 94 of brazil s hydrocarbon production ramps up investment in response to significantly higher oil prices in late 2021 petrobras announced its 2022 to 2026 strategic plan which included lifting investment by 24 compared to the previous plan to 68 billion of that figure 57 3 billion will be spent on exploration and production activities with 63 of that amount allocated to pre salt operations petrobras estimated that investment will allow the company to grow its oil output by 18 compared to 2021 to 2 6 billion barrels daily by 2026 with 79 of that volume comprised of pre salt production the investment earmarked by brazil s national oil company is predicated on an assumed average brent price of 61 per barrel over that period when it is considered that the international brent benchmark price is trading at over 106 per barrel and has averaged 101 55 since the start of 2022 it is likely that petrobras will consider increasing the capital allocated to its strategic plan if petrobras further ramps up capital spending then production growth will accelerate boding well for increased oil supply in a world suffering from energy supply constraints and shocks that will reduce inflationary pressure with the sharp rally in oil prices since october 2020 a key driver of surging prices around the globe which is weighing heavily on the post pandemic global economic recovery related is it fair to blame oil companies for high prices brazil s massive offshore oil boom is not only being driven by petrobras the quantity and quality of the discoveries coupled with the desirability of the light and medium crude oil grades produced are attracting considerable attention internationally global oil supermajors totalenergies and royal dutch shell recently shelled out 947 million and 1 1 billion respectively to increase their stakes in the petrobras operated atapu offshore deep water oilfield on completion of the deals petrobras now owns a 52 5 stake in atapu with 25 held by shell and the remaining 22 5 by totalenergies the atapu field is located near the buzios field which is one of petrobras priorities for development the medium grade low sulfur content crude oil pumped from buzios is particularly popular in asia china is now a leading recipient of brazilian crude oil exports with latin america s largest oil producer supplying 6 of the country s 2021 petroleum imports recent global oil supply shortages see the world s fastest growing major economy india looking to ink long term crude oil deals with brazil although long shipment times and excessive costs remain an impediment it is brazil s proximity to the u s particularly the gulf coast which makes it an ideal supplier of additional crude oil to make up for the shortfall triggered by the ban on russian oil imports many refineries located on the gulf coast are configured to process heavy crude oil grades and venezuela was a key source of feedstock before the trump administration enacted strict sanctions blocking the latin american country s oil exports a sizable proportion of brazil s oil production is comprised of heavier crude oil grades although it is the production of medium grade pre salt crude oil grades that are expected to grow significantly for the reasons outlined brazil s crude output will expand at a steady clip between 2022 and 2026 brazil s energy minister announced in march 2022 that latin america s largest oil producer will boost production by 300 000 barrels per day during the year which amounts to a 10 increase over the 2 9 million barrels daily pumped during 2021 this handy increase could not come at a more crucial time for global energy markets and an increasingly volatile world economy it also provides the opportunity for u s refiners to fill the supply gap left by the loss of russian crude oil imports advertisement by matthew smith for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com

your attention and now i d like to turn the call over to tom chubb thomas c chubb iii chairman chief executive officer and president thank you anne and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon we are extremely pleased to be reporting an incredibly strong start to fiscal 2021 we took decisive actions at the start of the pandemic to protect our people our brands and our liquidity this combined with our focus over the past year on delivering happiness to our customers and investing in enhanced digital marketing and store capabilities as well as in our bars and restaurants have strengthened our foundation for profitable growth as consumers have become increasingly more comfortable returning to physical shopping our overall engagement levels have greatly accelerated leading to strong momentum across our entire portfolio of brands given conditions last year it is not surprising that we were able to post strong sales gains across all brands and all channels of distribution during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020 what s much more impressive about our first quarter 2021 performance is how it compares to the first quarter of 2019 we believe that the comparison to 2019 is much more informative for most purposes than comparing to 2020 accordingly during our discussion today we will focus on the positive traction we have made toward returning to and even exceeding our 2019 levels of performance first quarter sales came in at 266 million compared to 282 million in fiscal 2019 and versus our guidance range of 220 million to 240 million it is worth noting that 14 million of the 16 million sales decrease from the first quarter of fiscal 2019 is due to lower sales in lanier apparel which as you know we are in the process of exiting on an adjusted basis earnings per share increased to a 1 89 compared to our earnings of a 1 30 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 scott will provide more detail in a few minutes but these results were driven by very strong performance in our e commerce businesses and outstanding gross margins our bar and restaurant business also performed very nicely during the quarter in our bricks and mortar stores we generally saw a sequential improvement in traffic and sales in the quarter with regions in florida the southeast and texas showing the most strength while the mid atlantic the northeast and the midwest are recovering at a somewhat slower pace there is no question that we are benefiting from some pent up demand so far this spring and summer and the alignment of our brands focus on products related to travel vacation and social occasions with the consumers desire to travel and reengage socially we expect this to continue as more regions of the country begin to normalize that said we believe that the results we have seen thus far this year and that we are projecting for the balance of the year also demonstrate the value of staying true to our brands during the challenges that we faced last year our commitment to the happy upbeat and optimistic messages of our brands and delivering those messages to our consumers through our products and services is paying off handsomely as the world reengages in addition we are seeing positive returns on the investments we have made and continue to make in enhancing our brands creative content in improving our omni channel customer service and continuing to hone our digital marketing capabilities and in our stores bars and restaurants in our biggest brand tommy bahama we are anchored in the relaxed island lifestyle we deliver this lifestyle to our guests through our amazing products our wonderful stores and e commerce website and very importantly through our bars and restaurants by staying true to our live the island life brand message and making the types of investments outlined above we were able to deliver outstanding first quarter results sales overall came close to 2019 levels driven by healthy gains in e commerce and restaurants while stores in the wholesale continued to improve sequentially very importantly increased full price selling and stronger initial imus coupled with excellent expense control helped contribute to a marked improvement in gross margin operating margin and a 36 increase in operating income over first quarter of 2019 we are delighted with the margins we achieved for the quarter finally we were pleased to see that while performance in our men s business was strong our women s business at tommy bahama was even stronger we are honored to have the dedicated cadre of true tommy bahama fans that comprise our very loyal customer base that said we believe there is room on the island to delight even more customers through the investments we are making and the priorities we have established we are intent on expanding our customer reach while continuing to serve our loyal guests staying anchored to its resort chic lifestyle and as we say being the sunshine served lilly pulitzer very well during the first quarter lilly s product priority for spring 21 was feel good fashion with a focus on the happy color and print easy chic comfortable pieces and a resort state of mind this focus together with the investments that we have made in enhancing our brand creative and enhancing our store and digital capabilities paid off in strong first quarter results we continue to see strong growth from e commerce while our stores in the wholesale business continue to improve as consumers feel increasingly comfortable engaging in the physical world in total first quarter 21 sales exceeded first quarter 2019 sales and operating margin came in at an impressive 27 as compared to 21 in 2019 our luxletic and lounge product continued to drive growth and we saw a healthy rebound in our dress business as for social calendar begins to fill up at the same time our golf and tennis collections have also been bright spots and the consumer is showing strong renewed interest in swim as she thinks about travel and vacation this summer our recent results demonstrate that we have the product she wants and our brand message is resonating with her we look forward to continuing to drive a strong business through the balance of the year our smaller brands southern tide the beaufort bonnet company and duck head also had a great first quarter all posting meaningful sales gains above first quarter 2019 levels all three are poised to contribute to our profitability this year we are very pleased with our first quarter results and are excited about the balance of the year scott will provide more details in our guidance momentarily but i will say that we do expect to have a strong year particularly in terms of profitability our enthusiasm is based on both external factors as well as the internal priorities that we have been focusing on for the last year i ll start with the external factors as the summer progresses we expect some of the regions that have been slower to recover for us namely the mid atlantic the northeast and the midwest to pick up momentum we also believe that consumers will continue to have a high degree of interest in travel vacation and social events through the year finally after a long pandemic consumers appreciate the highly differentiated happy colorful upbeat nature of our brands and products more than ever all of these external factors portend a strong 2021 we are also excited about the benefits we are seeing as the result of our internal priorities there are many but i will highlight five here first in our brand message we are taking care to ensure that our messages are both true to our core brand values and relevant for today s consumer and marketplace second we have realigned our creative teams and are enhancing our creative content to make sure it is delivering the full impact of our powerful brand messages third as part of our effort to enhance our digital capabilities we are improving our ability to capture and analyze customer data in a way that respects her privacy but also puts us in position to serve her in a better and more personalized way it also helps us identify and reach new audiences of potential customers fourth we are honing our skills in measuring the effectiveness of and optimizing the various channels many of them digital media that we used to reach both existing and potential new customers fifth we continue to enhance our store order fulfillment capabilities this allows us to use inventory located anywhere in our footprint to satisfy demand from anywhere the implications for inventory efficiency sell through rates and ultimately gross margin are huge we believe the combination of the positive external factors as well as the benefits from our work on our internal priorities gives us ample reason to be bullish on 2021 in closing please allow me to express my sincere appreciation for our wonderful and loyal customers and for our world class employees an incredible group of women and men who worked harder than ever over the last year and a half to deliver happiness to those customers thank you for all you do and now i will turn the call over to scott for additional detail on our results and our outlook for the balance of the year scott k scott grassmyer executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you tom as tom just mentioned fiscal 2021 is off to a great start with record earnings in the first quarter i ll walk you through how we got there sales were stronger than expected and excluding the impact of the exit of the lanier apparel business were comparable to 2019 levels our full price e commerce channel was 55 higher than in 2019 with significant growth over 2019 in all of our branded businesses our retail store performance reflects the significant regional differences in the pace of recovery we saw real strength in the southeast and southwest particularly in florida where retail sales achieved 2019 levels however we are experiencing a much slower recovery in other parts of the country where sales levels in the northeast mid atlantic and midwest while improving versus q4 were still over 30 lower than in 2019 overall our retail sales were 16 lower than in 2019 we continue to see improvement so far in the second quarter and expect that improvement to continue as restrictions lift and as summer arrives in these areas our restaurants benefited from the addition of five marlin bars and the strong recovery in certain regions with a sales increase of 7 compared to 2019 all restaurants are now open except for new york which we plan to reopen this fall we are particularly proud of the work we have done to improve our gross margin which on an adjusted basis expanded 520 basis points over 2019 to 64 as demand remained high more of our sales in the first quarter were at full price than in the first quarter of 2019 gross margin also benefited from our focus and investments in our direct to consumer businesses and lower sales in lanier apparel which has resulted in a meaningful shift in our sales mix to these higher margin channels of distribution in the first quarter of 2021 our direct business was 72 of revenue compared to 64 in the first quarter of 2019 we have also increased our imus by reducing product cost and selectively increasing prices sg a modest decreased modestly from 2019 levels with lower employment costs occupancy costs variable expenses and travel costs partially offset by increased performance based incentive compensation putting it altogether in the first quarter our consolidated adjusted operating margin expanded 410 basis points over 2019 to 15 with operating margin expansion in all operating groups our business is supported by our strong balance sheet and cash flow from operations here are some highlights on a fifo basis inventory decreased 29 compared to the end of the first quarter of 2020 excluding lanier apparel which we are exiting fifo inventory decreased 22 compared to the end of the first quarter of 2020 tommy bahama lilly pulitzer and southern tide each decreased inventory levels significantly year over year with conservative purchases of seasonal inventory and higher than expected first quarter sales ongoing enhancements to enterprise order management systems are also contributing to a more efficient use of inventory on a lifo basis inventory decreased 36 compared to the end of the first quarter of 2020 supply chain challenges including higher transit cost and production and transit delays are ongoing however our emphasis on direct to consumer channels gives us more flexibility on product release dates our liquidity position is strong with 92 million of cash and no debt at the end of the first quarter in the first quarter of 2021 cash provided by operating activities was 41 million compared to cash used in operating activities of 46 million in the first quarter of 2020 turning to our outlook the positive momentum we experienced in the first quarter has continued and we expect to deliver strong revenue and earnings in the second quarter sales in the second quarter expected to be in a range of 300 million to 310 million compared to 302 million in the second quarter of 2019 impacting sales in the second quarter is the wind down of our lanier apparel business we estimate lanier apparel revenue to decline to approximately 5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to 20 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 strong full price sales a shift of our sales mix toward our brands and our direct to consumer channels and higher imus in the second quarter are expected to contribute to a meaningful increase in consolidated gross margin over 2019 on an adjusted basis earnings per share for the second quarter of 2021 are expected to be in a range of 2 15 to 2 35 compared to 1 84 per share in the second quarter of 2019 our third quarter is historically our smallest sales and earnings quarter due to the seasonality of our brands we also cleared end of season inventory in both the third and fourth quarters with the highly profitable lilly pulitzer after party sales as the most notable of our events high sell throughs in the first quarter and elevated sales plan levels planned in the second quarter are expected to reduce the availability of excess inventory for these clearance events as a result of lower planned revenue from clearance events in the third quarter and the impact of the lanier apparel exit we are projecting an adjusted loss in the quarter in a range of 0 20 per share to 0 35 per share compared to adjusted earnings of 0 10 per share in the third quarter of 2019 with our better than expected first quarter results combined with our projection for a strong finish to the year driven by continued strength planned in our full price e commerce channel retail and restaurant channels of distribution we are raising our previously issued guidance for 2021 we now expect sales in the range of 1 015 billion to 1 05 billion compared to net sales of 1 12 billion in 2019 for the full year lanier apparel sales are expected to be approximately 20 million or 75 million lower than 2019 with no lanier comparable sales planned in the fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share for 2021 are expected to exceed 2019 levels benefiting from meaningful gross margin expansion sg a for the full year is expected to be comparable with 2019 with lower employment cost occupancy cost and travel cost partially offset by increased performance based incentive compensation and investments in marketing including top of the funnel expenditures we now expect adjusted earnings in a range of 4 85 per share to 5 15 per share compared to 4 32 per share in 2019 we plan to continue investing in our growth opportunities primarily in information technology initiatives such as the redesign and relaunch of the lilly pulitzer mobile app and additional development of digital marketing and customer service enhancements we also plan to open new retail stores and a new marlin bar at town square in las vegas which will replace our full service restaurant in the center in 2021 capital expenditures for the full year is expected to be approximately 35 million comparable to 2019 levels we appreciate your time today and we ll now turn over the call for questions hillary questions and answers operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session our first question is from edward yruma of keybanc capital markets please state your question edward yruma keybanc capital markets analyst hey good afternoon guys thanks for taking the question congrats on a great quarter i guess first i want to click on our gross margin a little bit obviously an incredibly powerful performance there in terms of last year i know you had inventory that you packed away was there a benefit from a cost basis when you kind of brought that inventory back into flow this year and then as a follow up as you think longer term about the dtc penetration particularly in the tommy brand do you think you ve kind of hit a peak or do you think that the direct business can continue to grow as a percent of overall sales thanks thomas c chubb iii chairman chief executive officer and president i ll maybe take the first one ed and then flip it to or i ll take the second one excuse me and then flip it over to scott to talk about any benefit that we might have had to gross margin but i do ed believe that dtc as a percentage of the total can continue to grow certainly it will be a larger part this year i think than it was in 2019 as wholesale is recovering i do think our wholesale business is very healthy we re performing well at all of our key customers which is great to see but over the long term we do expect dct dtc to be the primary driver of growth scott do you want to talk about the gross margin k scott grassmyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the there was really no any kind of significant cost difference from what we carried over what has that allowed us to do was really not have a lot of excess inventory last year that we are flooding the market with and i think it really helped with our brand health and i think our merchandising teams did a great job of really taking what we could merchandise well into that spring line and it just allowed us not to have to buy a bunch of inventory for early spring we already had it it also helped with some of the transit delays because that inventory was already here so we really had no delays there edward yruma keybanc capital markets analyst got it and one other follow up i know you guys mentioned you re taking some tactical price increases i know historically you ve done that as you ve introduced new product or roll out some new functionality are the price increases on kind of a similar basis as you bring out new product or are you taking more kind of wholesale approach to some of the price increases thanks thomas c chubb iii chairman chief executive officer and president it s more selective ed than it is across the board type of pricing increases k scott grassmyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and then also as we get into more performance type products where new products that we introduced in the performance area tend to have a higher gross margin also edward yruma keybanc capital markets analyst great thank you thomas c chubb iii chairman chief executive officer and president thank you operator our next question is from paul lejuez of citigroup please state your question tracy kogan citigroup analyst thanks it s tracy kogan filling in for paul i had two questions i guess the first is on the supply chain i m wondering if the delays you re seeing there are contributing to what you expect to be able having a lack of clearance inventory in third quarter is that really just more related to your sell throughs and then my second question was i was just wondering in the tommy business how much your outlet business was hurt by lack of international tourism if you could maybe give some color on the difference in performance in your outlet versus your full price stores or those in tourist regions versus those that are not thanks a lot thomas c chubb iii chairman chief executive officer and president okay on the supply chain question and any impact that that may be having on the lilly pulitzer after party sale later in the year the way that i would answer that tracy is the primary driver or the root cause if you will of not having as much inventory is the higher sell through that we ve had year to date however the supply chain issues make it harder for us to chase inventory really for full price business as well as as for that would ultimately end up leaving us possibly with more inventory for the after party sales so the we are having some challenges with delays in shipping as well as some delays in production at the factory and due to the covid pandemic as much as possible we ve obviously tried to factor all of that into our forecast and think we ve sort of captured that but the real cause is the higher than anticipated full price selling during the early part of the year and then on the outlet stores k scott grassmyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah our outlets are down similar to our total retail we don t really benefit that much from international travel it s not the way some brands might and our outlet stores there while the sales are down the gross margins are very healthy in our outlets so we just have a much leaner inventory and inventory is very good inventory and we re able to get a little bit better pricing having to discount a little less than we had to in previous years so overall our outlet business is sales are down but margins are up so it s pretty healthy tracy kogan citigroup analyst got it thanks very much thomas c chubb iii chairman chief executive officer and president thank you tracy operator our next question is from susan anderson of b riley please state your question susan anderson b riley analyst hi good evening nice to see the improvement in the quarter i m curious i think you mentioned that you expect the northern states to pick up as they ve started to open i m curious if you ve seen that penetrate or seen them start to pick up just yet and then also if the south has continued to perform well and then also curious what you re seeing in hawaii as that s opened up now thomas c chubb iii chairman chief executive officer and president yeah so as to the mid atlantic northeast and midwest which were the three sort of lagging regions that we called out they are improving if you look at the more recent performance versus the performance earlier in the year the general trend there is good and i think it s as you would expect as people start to get out more feeling more comfortable and some of the restrictions start to get lifted and more people are vaccinated people want to be out shopping and buying stuff and we think that actually plays out for us really well in those states summer time is a really good time to have people out shopping for our brands which are all about warm weather and sunshine and all those types of things and in the south i d say that relative to any other year the performance continues to be very good we re pleased with what we re seeing there i will point out that florida always slows down for us during the summer time a bit versus other times of the year and i think you have that it won t be a relative slowdown as compared to other years but it will be less of our overall sales picture during the summer months and then as to hawaii it s a bit of a mixed bag there the places that rely heavily on international tourists especially people coming in from japan or australia and that would be the island of oahu because there s still issues with travel from those places they ve not recovered as fast as some of the locations like maui and the big island that are more driven by u s tourists and there are still restrictions in place but we are seeing a nice recovery and i think that will continue as the year progresses i think all of hawaii will continue to get better which is a positive for us we re thrilled with the results that we saw in the first quarter but again that was with certain regions still depressed from where they were in 2019 and as they come back online we think that bodes well for us susan anderson b riley analyst great that s very helpful and then i m just curious are you seeing new customers come in to all of the brands or the existing customers that are coming back now that may be were shopping the brands pre covid but hadn t shopped in because maybe they hadn t gone a vacation or something and now they re coming back or if you re also capturing new customers and if that s in store or online or both thomas c chubb iii chairman chief executive officer and president the answer is yes yes and yes customer counts are building we re seeing customers that are customers that we ve had in the past and we re adding new customers both online and in stores and it s really across all brands and some of that got a little choppy during the pandemic obviously it was hard that new customers in stores when the stores were closed and there was a lot going on there but all the customer metrics are really looking pretty good through the first quarter of the year and we think we ll be able to continue that trend and it s obviously an area of a lot of focus for us as well susan anderson b riley analyst great that sounds positive thanks so much good luck for the rest of the year thomas c chubb iii chairman chief executive officer and president thank you operator our next question is from dana telsey of telsey advisory group please state your question dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst hi good afternoon and congratulations on the terrific results as you think about e commerce and i believe last year e commerce reached nearly 43 of sales and you had 55 increase in full price now how are you thinking about percentage of total sales that comes from e commerce and the margin accretion relative toward that for each of the brands thomas c chubb iii chairman chief executive officer and president yeah so the highest penetration or as you know lilly has a higher penetration of e commerce than tommy does they both took a big step up last year last year was a very unusual year as a percentage of the total it will be a bit smaller this year than it was last year but it will still in both brands be significantly higher than it was in 2019 and overall total enterprise i think we re estimating it to be at about 33 for 2021 which will be up pretty significantly over where it was in 2019 i think 22 is probably the first year where you will really be able to see where that s going to sort of what the new baseline of e commerce is because you do still have stores in the wholesale still in a bit of a recovery mode this year dana and so 2022 you d probably get that baseline but then from there i think e comm probably continues to be the fastest growing part of the business and we like it it s a very profitable business for us i ll let scott maybe elaborate a little more on the margin impact of the e comm business k scott grassmyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah yeah you know our e comm is a very profitable business even though you have some extra cost around it you do have a high ticket which is growing our average ticket has been growing and our initial gross margins are higher so we are able to easily fund the extra cost with that margin so we really do like the e commerce business and we have been investing in it and those investments have been paying off and will continue to invest in that business dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst and then just two more follow ups one of the things it sounded like you had learned coming out of covid is how to run the stores more efficiently regarding store labor as stores have reopened is this part of the flow through beyond the gross margin of what s leading to the operating margin increases and how do you think about labor go forward thomas c chubb iii chairman chief executive officer and president dana i would say yes it is part of the flow through we did learn how to operate more efficiently and i think we re benefiting from that right now there is a part of that that is sort of intentional if you will are deliberate and i think there is actually a little bit of it that has to do with trouble as many employers are having right now and filling open positions and we re actually running a little thinner than we want at the margins it s probably costing us a few sales dollars so i m not sure it would hurt us on labor cost as a percentage of sales but in absolute dollars that s probably we re spending less just because we can t get people in dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst got it thomas c chubb iii chairman chief executive officer and president we ll work on it dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst and then if you think about inventory going through the balance of the year how do you think about inventories approaching the fourth quarter and how long this congestion lasts everything we hear it seems like it continues to be extended k scott grassmyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it does and one thing we have adjusted merchandising calendars to order earlier to build in a little more time for any kind of transit delays especially for that fourth quarter especially we get into resort and then into early deliveries of spring which some of those happened in the first quarter we plan on attempting to at least ordering the inventory earlier and hopefully any delays will be that cushion that we celebrated the orders will absorb that so and inventory levels we are operating more efficiently with inventory as far and we expect to be below 20 the whole year and whether it will be quite as big percentage or not i m not quite sure that it should be lower all year i think we can just run the business with less inventory due to some of the investments operator thank you our final question is from steve marotta of cl king please state your question steve marotta cl king analyst good afternoon tom scott and anne tom maybe you could address given how this year is shaping up and there is the reopening performance is actually very good very very good to the extent i know can t talk about next year from a guidance standpoint but maybe you can talk at a very high level about what you think optimal operating margin is for the business and for the long term i d like to ask you how do you expect to lap this next year but that would be maybe giving too much specific guidance on next year if you just if you could just frame it a little bit on where you are and where you think you can how this can you could build off of this or if maybe the margins are playing a little bit above themselves at the moment given all of the dynamics in the industry thomas c chubb iii chairman chief executive officer and president yeah thank you steve thanks for the question and then i ll let my partner scott chime in here in a minute with some further detail and thinking on the operating margin long term but what i would tell you at the very highest level steve and this is a message that we ve been trying to deliver since this time last year is the first couple of months of the pandemic we were very focused on making sure that we would get through it and financially survive and as you know we did that with flying colors but really about this time last year we also pivoted to make sure that we were doing everything we could across all of our brands to emerge from the pandemic even stronger than we went into it and this was part of our prepared remarks today is that we believe that we are seeing not only the benefits from the reopening but also the benefits of the priorities that we have internally and that those are paying off and we do believe that we have come out of this as brands which ultimately drive our business in a stronger position and what that s helping us do is drive sales no doubt the reopening is part of it but we think the strength of our brands and the activities and priorities that we ve done to bolster those are also paying off that s resulting in higher gross margins we ve developed skills that have helped or helping us operate more efficiently from an operating expense leverage standpoint as well as an inventory efficiency standpoint and we re also focused on and while we love wholesale and we want to continue our wholesale business we re very focused on driving our direct to consumer businesses and when you look at all of those what i would tell you is it s really hard for me to predict what next year looks like but over the long term i do believe we will be expanding our enterprisewide operating margin and scott if you want to k scott grassmyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and yeah total company i mean we really expect to be a low double digit operating margin company i think we can enter that double digit territory this year and at tommy bahama we ve always felt there was a lot of room for operating margin improvement and we really believe this year we re going to have a lot of progress and they can get into double digits this year also we want to get them 12 in north i don t think that will happen this year but i think that s certainly in the not too long term future to get them there so and then lilly has great operating margins they always have and we think they can maybe expand slightly over 19 margin levels so and so we think our margin profile is certainly improving and i think it can continue to improve steve marotta cl king analyst that s very helpful thank you i ll take the rest of my questions offline thanks again thomas c chubb iii chairman chief executive officer and president thank you steve operator we have reached the end of the question and answer session i will now turn the call over to tom chubb for closing remarks thomas c chubb iii chairman chief executive officer and president thank you hillary and thanks to all of you for your interest in our company and your support and we look

new york after feeling the thrill of victory early this year by singlehandedly causing gamestop s stock to soar only to get crushed when it quickly crashed back to earth armies of smaller pocketed and novice investors are back for more these undaunted investors have resuscitated gamestop shares back above 300 up from 40 in february after plunging from a peak of 347 they re also hauling new stocks onto the bandwagon they say is heading for the moon including the lesser known health insurance company clover health investments this second wave of leaps for meme stocks are just as staggering the movie theater chain amc entertainment soared to 62 last week from 2 early this year and once again professional wall street is calling the gains illogical many of these professionals had predicted the phenomenon of regular small fry investors piling into a stock en masse and sending it incredibly higher would fizzle out particularly after they felt the pain of losing some money instead the frenzy has endured and shows how powerful these investors remain at least for now they re armed with social media where they can convince others to champion the same stocks they also have zero fee trading apps that allow many to buy stock options which can offer bigger gains at a smaller upfront cost than buying a share of stock in exchange for potentially bigger percentage losses they ll do surprising things if given the tools said hossein azari ceo of cmorq a company that helps customers get into cryptocurrencies and advocates for a new world of decentralized finance azari sees it all stemming from people feeling left out as they watched wealthy investors and firms suck up the majority of the economy s gains in recent years now they see a way to get some for themselves they are not out there trying to prove anything he said they just want to kind of materialize the american dream for themselves some of the meme stock buyers believe fervently in the financial futures of the companies they re backing others say on social media posts that they re merely looking to cash in on whatever the next hot stock is most say that as long as other like minded investors stick together and hold the stock they ll protect each other and the stock s price malcolm ethridge a financial adviser with cic wealth outside washington d c said a range of his clients want to talk about meme stocks as well as cryptocurrencies ethridge also says it s not only younger investors pushing up meme stocks he s gotten just as many requests from his clients who are retirees i think in most cases though they really just wanted a professional to tell them why it wasn t a good idea to get involved just so that they could stop feeling like they were missing out he said this resurgence for meme stocks is a little different from the earlier supernova for one it hasn t dragged down the broader stock market back in january the mania helped knock down the s p 500 to its worst day in months that was a result of fears that some hedge funds would have to sell big unrelated stocks to raise cash to cover losses they were taking after betting that gamestop would fall several of today s meme stock winners do have chunks of their shares sold short where investors have made trades to profit if the price falls but not to the same degree as in january at gamestop roughly one in five of its shares available to trade has been sold short for example earlier this year more than 100 of them effectively were with some getting shorted multiple times the buying activity this time around also seems less fervent trading in call options which can give a buyer the right to buy 100 shares of stock at a set price at a later date surged to a two month high recently but it s still below the heights set in january over the last year trading activity for call options on single stocks has tended to move up and down with how restricted the economy has been by the pandemic according to deutsche bank strategists when people have been leaving their houses more often call option trading has tended to fall off which makes the last few weeks a notable exception so if getting burned by plunging prices for meme stocks once before didn t stop them and the possibility of doing things other than trading options while sitting on a couch hasn t so far what could slow the phenomenon regulators and politicians in washington have been discussing some options though nothing s come out of it yet gary gensler chair of the securities and exchange commission gave a speech wednesday where he once again criticized gamified investing many trading apps use features that encourage customers to make trades more often that brings in more revenue for the apps but some research also suggests it leads to lower returns for the average investor gensler said he s asked the sec s staff to gather public input on the topic he also said he s asked the staff for recommendations on changes to rules that govern the stock market s plumbing and how trading apps route retail investors orders to make sure they re getting the best execution the sec and other regulators could look for ways to force trading apps to offer more warnings to customers in hopes of slowing them down said john coffee a professor of law at columbia university they could start with making it clearer that trading options can be riskier than buying actual shares of a stock coffee is skeptical gamestop amc and others can hold onto their lofty prices which would need profits to explode higher extremely quickly to look rational according to traditional models used by financial analysts that means he s worried many retail investors may be setting themselves up for big losses in their zeal to ride the meme stock wave and he acknowledges that even if brokerages do offer more warnings that may not be enough to stop some traders as social media posts continue to encourage them to pile into certain stocks and given human nature as much

business bruised but unbowed meme stock investors are back for more the movie theater chain amc entertainment soared to 62 last week from 2 early this year ap photo lm otero file the associated press new york ap after feeling the thrill of victory early this year by singlehandedly causing gamestop s stock to soar only to get crushed when it quickly crashed back to earth armies of smaller pocketed and novice investors are back for more these undaunted investors have resuscitated gamestop shares back above 300 up from 40 in february after plunging from a peak of 347 they re also hauling new stocks onto the bandwagon they say is heading for the moon including the lesser known health insurance company clover health investments this second wave of leaps for meme stocks are just as staggering the movie theater chain amc entertainment soared to 62 last week from 2 early this year and once again professional wall street is calling the gains illogical many of these professionals had predicted the phenomenon of regular small fry investors piling into a stock en masse and sending it incredibly higher would fizzle out particularly after they felt the pain of losing some money advertisement instead the frenzy has endured and shows how powerful these investors remain at least for now they re armed with social media where they can convince others to champion the same stocks they also have zero fee trading apps that allow many to buy stock options which can offer bigger gains at a smaller upfront cost than buying a share of stock in exchange for potentially bigger percentage losses they ll do surprising things if given the tools said hossein azari ceo of cmorq a company that helps customers get into cryptocurrencies and advocates for a new world of decentralized finance azari sees it all stemming from people feeling left out as they watched wealthy investors and firms suck up the majority of the economy s gains in recent years now they see a way to get some for themselves they are not out there trying to prove anything he said they just want to kind of materialize the american dream for themselves some of the meme stock buyers believe fervently in the financial futures of the companies they re backing others say on social media posts that they re merely looking to cash in on whatever the next hot stock is most say that as long as other like minded investors stick together and hold the stock they ll protect each other and the stock s price advertisement malcolm ethridge a financial adviser with cic wealth outside washington d c said a range of his clients want to talk about meme stocks as well as cryptocurrencies ethridge also says it s not only younger investors pushing up meme stocks he s gotten just as many requests from his clients who are retirees i think in most cases though they really just wanted a professional to tell them why it wasn t a good idea to get involved just so that they could stop feeling like they were missing out he said this resurgence for meme stocks is a little different from the earlier supernova for one it hasn t dragged down the broader stock market back in january the mania helped knock down the s p 500 to its worst day in months that was a result of fears that some hedge funds would have to sell big unrelated stocks to raise cash to cover losses they were taking after betting that gamestop would fall several of today s meme stock winners do have chunks of their shares sold short where investors have made trades to profit if the price falls but not to the same degree as in january at gamestop roughly one in five of its shares available to trade has been sold short for example earlier this year more than 100 of them effectively were with some getting shorted multiple times advertisement the buying activity this time around also seems less fervent trading in call options which can give a buyer the right to buy 100 shares of stock at a set price at a later date surged to a two month high recently but it s still below the heights set in january over the last year trading activity for call options on single stocks has tended to move up and down with how restricted the economy has been by the pandemic according to deutsche bank strategists when people have been leaving their houses more often call option trading has tended to fall off which makes the last few weeks a notable exception so if getting burned by plunging prices for meme stocks once before didn t stop them and the possibility of doing things other than trading options while sitting on a couch hasn t so far what could slow the phenomenon regulators and politicians in washington have been discussing some options though nothing s come out of it yet gary gensler chair of the securities and exchange commission gave a speech wednesday where he once again criticized gamified investing many trading apps use features that encourage customers to make trades more often that brings in more revenue for the apps but some research also suggests it leads to lower returns for the average investor gensler said he s asked the sec s staff to gather public input on the topic he also said he s asked the staff for recommendations on changes to rules that govern the stock market s plumbing and how trading apps route retail investors orders to make sure they re getting the best execution advertisement gamestop separately said late wednesday that the sec s staff is conducting an investigation into the trading activity in its stock and those of other companies gamestop which received a request for documents on may 26 said it doesn t expect the inquiry to adversely hurt the company the sec and other regulators could look for ways to force trading apps to offer more warnings to customers in hopes of slowing them down said john coffee a professor of law at columbia university they could start with making it clearer that trading options can be riskier than buying actual shares of a stock coffee is skeptical gamestop amc and others can hold onto their lofty prices which would need profits to explode higher extremely quickly to look rational according to traditional models used by financial analysts that means he s worried many retail investors may be setting themselves up for big losses in their zeal to ride the meme stock wave and he acknowledges that even if brokerages do offer more warnings that may not be enough to stop some traders as social media posts continue to encourage them to pile into certain stocks and given human nature as much as i believe in consumer protection coffee said i believe a fool and his money are parted

new york new york june 8 2021 ens oceans cover 70 percent of the earth and produce at least half of the planet s oxygen the united nations reminds us every year on june 8 observed as world oceans day oceans are inhabited by most of earth s biodiverse species they are the main source of protein for more than a billion people and a source of medicines for the world the ocean life and livelihoods is the theme for world oceans day 2021 the un projects that 40 million people will be employed in ocean based industries by 2030 the theme of life and livelihoods also serves as a declaration of intention launching a decade of challenges to achieve sustainable development goal 14 conserve and sustainably use the oceans seas and marine resources by 2030 challenges indeed for now the world s oceans need help and support the nonprofit oceanic global which masterminded the un s livestream event for world oceans day 2021 points out some dismal ocean facts 93 percent of fisheries are fully fished or overfished every 60 seconds a truckload of plastic enters the ocean 90 percent of coral reefs are projected to die by 2050 and only 5 3 percent of the ocean is currently protected as the earth s temperature rises climate change and ocean acidification are affecting species ecosystems and people around the globe jeopardizing food security shoreline protection individual livelihoods and sustainable economic development activities planned around world oceans day have extended into a month with events scheduled during all of june they are intended to inform the public of the impact of human actions on the ocean and mobilize and unite the world s population on a project for the sustainable management of the world s oceans this year s theme is especially relevant in the lead up to the un decade of ocean science for sustainable development which will run from 2021 to 2030 the decade will strengthen international cooperation to develop the scientific research and innovative technologies that can connect ocean science with the needs of society marine protected areas as a climate solution june opened with five nations chile costa rica france the united kingdom and the united states announcing a new global partnership to advance the role of marine protected areas mpas as a nature based solution in the fight against climate change the announcement on june 2 came ahead of world oceans day and ahead of the united nations climate change cop 26 and biodiversity cop 15 conferences later this year the climate crisis is having profound impacts on marine ecosystems said john kerry u s special presidential envoy for climate at the same time the ocean is a source of sustainable climate solutions these include marine protected areas which can help build climate resilience and store carbon while conserving biodiversity kerry said this is a decisive decade to dramatically scale up ocean and climate action which are two sides of the same coin all nations rely on healthy marine ecosystems to support life on this planet said marine ecologist jane lubchenco deputy director for climate and environment at the white house office of science and technology policy marine protected areas but especially highly protected ones are an effective nature based solution for adapting to and mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity nations must act now to protect key ocean habitats and the services the ocean provides to nature and people lubchenko urged the international partnership on marine protected areas biodiversity and climate change with scientific support from members of the international union for conservation of nature and the marine alliance for science and technology for scotland will work with global leaders to ensure they have the information and tools needed to understand the contribution of mpas and the biodiversity they protect as a solution in helping mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change on the global ocean the partnership has launched a website with tools and case studies about mpas and will host webinars in each partner country on the role mpas play in addressing climate change and conserving biodiversity global collaboration is key to realizing the climate benefits provided by marine protected areas said ben friedman acting noaa administrator members of the partnership are committed to sharing knowledge and expertise and working cooperatively to address scientific knowledge gaps together we will develop a deeper understanding of how marine protected areas may combat climate change while supporting sustainable economic development while enhanced greenhouse gas reduction targets are vital to protect the ocean and avoid further irreversible impacts of climate change mpas are increasingly recognized as a key tool for maintaining and restoring ecosystem resilience and providing positive outcomes for biodiversity mpas can protect habitats that capture and or provide long term blue carbon storage of atmospheric carbon including salt marshes seagrasses mangroves and the seafloor they also conserve biodiversity and provide many ocean and coastal ecosystem services including storm protection and erosion control food production employment opportunities and recreation and tourism well integrated marine protected area networks increase species survival by allowing them to move around to reduce exposure to pressures such as rising sea temperatures hope for troubled sharks and rays in the west african country of gabon a new partnership for sharks and rays was announced on world ocean day that is intended to protect species as diverse as whale sharks giant manta rays scalloped hammerheads and guitarfish the first new law in gabon fully regulates shark and ray catches special authorization will now be needed to target sharks and rays the law mandates that sharks are landed whole and bans the practice of shark finning and all export of shark and ray products from gabon a second law adds many sharks and rays to gabon s list of fully protected marine species black tipped reef shark american samoa april 21 2012 photo courtesy national marine sanctuaries sharks are top predators that are essential to healthy marine environments but sharks grow slowly and are vulnerable to overfishing when not properly managed some of gabon s species have already been lost including both species of sawfish a large shark like ray last recorded in gabon s waters in the 1990s the partnership between the government of gabon and the u s based international nonprofit wildlife conservation society launches a new global initiative to save the world s sharks and rays this world oceans day the wildlife conservation society wcs is launching the 10 x 10 initiative a new shark conservation plan that seeks to deliver comprehensive science based well implemented shark management reforms in 10 key geographic areas across the globe over the next 10 years to 2030 writes luke warwick director of shark and ray conservation for wcs wcs has identified priority regions and countries within them over the last 18 months and already has shark and ray conservation projects in place in these locations warwick says the organization is now collecting scientific data and building relationships with governments and local communities that will ensure the 10 x 10 initiative is successful stopping marine litter at the source in south africa environment minister barbara creecy says the government is focused on solving the problem of marine litter there is sufficient evidence that a large percentage of pollution in the ocean originates from sources on land said creecy in response to this growing concern the department has developed a source to sea initiative focusing on managing litter sources mainly from upstream catchments where the litter gets transported to the ocean and coastal areas by rivers and tributaries that discharge into the ocean the source to sea programme involves multiple government departments at national provincial and local level as well as the private sector and other stakeholders working in priority catchment areas and providing job opportunities through the working for the coast program said creecy on world oceans day marine litter primarily comes from towns and cities located along rivers and waterways which become pathways for litter into the marine environment creecy said that her department is expanding the source to sea programme into 16 coastal districts with the target of creating approximately 1 600 job opportunities that will address marine litter globally plastic production has reached new highs she said with over 320 million tons now being produced annually it has been estimated that between four to 12 million tons of plastic are added to the oceans each year south africa recognizes the oceans contribution to tourism our oceans are globally recognised as unique and a hotspot of marine biodiversity creecy said the atlantic southern and indian ocean s fishing grounds are among the healthiest worldwide and coastal tourism is and has the potential to be a significant income earner for many african coastal nations disappearing quickly indian ocean tuna could get help indian ocean yellowfin tuna thunnus albacares one of the most profitable fisheries in the world is just a few years away from collapse a meeting that began june 7 will decide the species fate as the indian ocean tuna commission begins its 2021 annual meeting the item at the top of its agenda how to save the overfished indian ocean yellowfin tuna thunnus albacares stock from collapse mongabay reports the crisis has pitted a group of distant water fishing nations led by the eureopan union which hauls in the largest share of yellowfin against indian ocean states like the maldives kenya and south africa two proposals are under discussion one from the maldives backed by coastal states many of whom are developing countries and the other from the eu which has the support of other distant water fishing nations like south korea and japan fisheries experts say the maldives plan would result in deeper reductions to catches a starting point to end overfishing and rebuild the stock and is more equitable than the eu s proposal young people work now to assure sustainable ocean future powered by

science without borders challenge from more countries than ever before a total of 680 students from 63 countries sent in artwork illustrating this year s theme the magic of mangroves mangrove forests are important marine ecosystems that protect the coast from storms filter the water removing sediment and pollutants sequester carbon and provide critical habitat for many species above and below the waterline sharon choi 16 won first place in the category for 15 19 year old students in the 2021 science without borders challenge for her artwork the guardians of the sea a student at sunny hills high school in fullerton california choi illustrated how mangrove forests provide a refuge for marine species in their early stages of life i really liked the idea of mangroves being a safe haven for young fish like a kindergarten so that is what i wanted to portray in my piece she said i don t think that most people know about mangroves so i hope that my art raises awareness about this ecosystem so that it is equally talked about like coral reefs choi said first place in the category for students 11 14 years old went to dana chung 13 a korean boarding school student at indian mountain school

blooms an unprecedented analysis of almost 10 000 harmful algal bloom events worldwide over the past 33 years was launched june 9 by unesco s intergovernmental oceanographic commission ioc the first ever global statistical analysis examined some 9 500 harmful algal bloom events over 33 years and found that the harm they caused rose in step with growth of the aquaculture industry and marine exploitation and calls for more research on linkages conducted over seven years by 109 scientists in 35 countries the study found that reported harmful algal bloom events have increased in some regions and decreased or held steady in others a widely stated view that harmful algal blooms are on the rise throughout the world perhaps due to climate change was not confirmed however the study perceived global increase in algal blooms is attributable to intensified monitoring and emerging bloom impacts published in the journal nature communications earth environment creates the world s first baseline against which to track future shifts in the location frequency and impacts of harmful algal blooms which differ depending on which of the 250 harmful marine algae species is involved and where requiring assessment on a species by species and site by site basis a public webinar on the global harmful algal bloom status report will take place tuesday june 15 2021 at 1 pm paris time

skywatchers who get up early on thursday june 10 are in for a rare treat on that morning people in the northeastern united states and eastern canada will see the sun rise while in the midst of a deep partial eclipse the event will be of special interest to photographers who will have the chance to capture the rising sun looking not like a circular disk but a dramatic crescent why alex garland loves science fiction cc share subtitles off english view video why alex garland loves science fiction everything about this particular eclipse is a bit unusual no one will experience totality with the moon near the farthest point from earth in its orbit it will appear too small in the sky to completely block the sun observers in northern ontario and in the high arctic will get to see a so called annular eclipse sometimes called a ring of fire in which the moon blocks out most of the sun leaving only a thin ring of sunlight visible however the 430 mile wide path of annularity only encompasses very sparsely populated areas after hitting ontario the moon s shadow heads up over hudson bay baffin island the north pole and into eastern siberia in contrast tens of millions of people live in the area where the partial eclipse will be visible and in particular those observing from a line stretching roughly from toronto to new york city will see the sun maximally eclipsed as it rises for those northeast of that line maximum eclipse comes after the sun has risen for those southwest of the line maximum eclipse will have already happened before sunrise advertisement to see a thin crescent sun rising it s something you ll remember for the rest of your life said steve fentress planetarium director at the rochester museum and science center advertisement in fact depending on one s exact location the two horns of the crescent sun may poke above the horizon first before the full crescent is visible though a nearly flat northeastern horizon would be essential for such a view fentress is planning to observe from the southern shore of lake ontario which is likely to draw quite a few eclipse chasers that morning the new jersey shoreline between new york and atlantic city should also be a prime viewing area advertisement safety of course is paramount even a tiny sliver of the sun s disk is unsafe to look at for any length of time without proper protection such as the solar viewing glasses that you may have saved from the 2017 total eclipse but there s a qualifier most of us have glimpsed the sun just as it was rising or setting with no serious eye damage so a very quick glance is probably fine just don t stare no matter how extraordinary the sight is at sunrise or sunset you re looking through an enormous amount of atmosphere and that atmosphere protects you to a certain extent said jackie faherty a senior scientist at the american museum of natural history it is not 100 protective though my advice is to definitely use those eclipse viewing glasses the american astronomical society maintains a handy list of reputable manufacturers of eclipse glasses and of retailers who stock them as well people may want to check with their local science center or planetarium or the astronomy department at their local university before turning to the web advertisement photographers meanwhile are hoping to produce spectacular images of the substantially eclipsed sun just above the horizon like this amazing shot of the partially eclipsed sun rising behind the empire state building in 2013 captured by chris cook or this shot of the mostly eclipsed sun setting behind a row of wind turbines in new mexico snapped by evan zucker during an annular eclipse in 2012 advertisement safety is an issue for photographers as well if you have a dslr the light comes through the lens and into your eye which is dangerous said zucker but if you have the option of viewing the image on your camera s lcd screen instead then you re good to go even so photographers should be cautious of unfiltered sunlight hitting their camera s sensor for a prolonged period of time as it could damage the sensor a bit of planning will go a long way online tools like this sunrise and sunset calculator at timeanddate com are great for getting the exact time of sunrise as well as the direction in which the sun will rise on any given day data tables like this one at eclipsewise com list the exact times for the june 10 eclipse for various locations start by clicking on your region e g north america advertisement wherever you are an alarm clock may be essential in new york city the sun will rise at 5 24 a m with maximum eclipse happening just eight minutes later when the sun will be 73 obscured by the moon for those in toronto sunrise comes at 5 35 a m with maximum eclipse just five minutes later with 80 of the sun covered the second map on this page at greatamericaneclipse com shows exactly what the sun will look like as it rises from a number of locations in the northeast for those determined to see the actual ring of fire and those who fear that the morning of june 10 might be cloudy which is always possible the editors of sky telescope have arranged a charter flight for keen eclipse chasers setting out from minneapolis saint paul international airport the three hour flight with strictly limited seating will take eclipse enthusiasts into the path of annularity north of lake superior giving passengers a solid four and a half minutes to gawk at the spectacle of a doughnut shaped sun looming just above the horizon advertisement especially in these pandemic times when there s so little to be excited about this is a celestial sky show not to be missed said kelly beatty a senior editor at sky telescope who is helping to organize the eclipse flight but even those stuck at ground level are again weather permitting in for a rare treat all you need to do is get up early on june 10 and you ll be rewarded with something that s both beautiful and awe

the pti government is on the back foot on the proposed digital regulation draft after a strong protest by the media and journalists community calling for a struggle to preserve free speech while the government was thinking of some curbs on the content of the social media the mainstream journalists are adamant not to allow such restrictions as they believe electronic media is already subjected to over regulation but is the government right in imposing curbs and how far we need to go in preserving constitutional safeguards like freedom of speech are we aware of the new challenges that come with the advent of evolving cyberspace the debate is more relevant in the broader context of new realities the exponential growth of net usage its effects on the consumers particularly the youth the power of international media platforms and the abuse of cyberspace by hackers terrorists and dark propagandists in the post covid 19 world concerning net usage covid 19 has multiplied reliance on the internet as a means of education communication diplomacy trade and services from take aways to household shopping due to staying home to avoid contraction of covid 19 physical societal space has dramatically shrunk diffusing virtual interactions and communication the extent of digitalization of pakistani society is by and large measured from these numbers as of april 2021 the percentage of internet users in pakistan is almost 50 percent which means approximately 100 million citizens while 70 of consumers are youth a good as well as bad news the good news is the youth has mounting aspirations exposure and new avenues to explore opportunities in their lives through the net the bad news is they are also exposed to dark propaganda twisted narratives influences and ominous content targeting their innocent minds to sign up to particular agendas since cyberspace is a new realm the state has no digital sovereignty as a result it has grave implications unfolding in various ways besides sexting among kids a 2 years old kid can watch cartoons equally tagged for other messages then there are manuals of bomb making and all sorts of terrorist activities which can be performed as a lone wolf warrior whereas various chat rooms can encourage them to imbibe the dark propaganda and hence respond for example the rise of isis in syria and iraq getting traction and recruitment in the western world was due to the net based propaganda its influence and information operations in pakistan s context the virtual world brings in new challenges to the youth of balochistan in particular as it subjects them to the consumption of all sorts of information propaganda and influences of militants and terrorist outfits balochistan has around 70 percent youth under the age of 22 years they have the keyboards and the time of the whole world but can hardly make sense between what is valid information and what is dark propaganda the influence of militant operations and their sponsors through dozens of websites and servers operating mostly out of india underscores the vulnerabilities of the youth to get access to their nefarious activities from a narrative building claiming terror incidents of bomb blast to delegitimising the statehood of pakistan worse the manipulation of the youth of balochistan through social media is an art only to exacerbate biases stereotypes and mischaracterization of pakistan and balochistan s future aspirations through cpec and its development trajectory it is very important that the authorities concerned invest in digitalized projects to engage the youth of balochistan and give a counter narrative to militants and also check what is being churned out through social media at the country level the net platform is a digital window to be an interface between an individual and the state between society and the state and hence it necessitates a case for a legitimate much larger debate as to what restrictions and regulations should space be subjected to and who should decide the good for the state and society learning from western experiences hackers cyber schemers and dark propagandists are already undermining the digital sovereignty of advanced countries like america the uk and russia recent examples of how digital threat in real life is unfolding as a bigger problem to advanced economies are as follows recently non state actors attacked a gas pipeline called colonial pipeline in america disrupting supply to the entire east coast in recent times ransomware extorting money through digital blackmail or hacking from companies and cyber attacks have targeted financial markets schools hospitals and other government networks and influence operations for diverse purposes like recruitment terrorism and other anti state criminal activities in other instances india subjecting twitter to indian it laws and the power of private giants like facebook instagram and twitter suspending individual accounts president trump s accounts suspension under the pretext of checking hate speech demonstrate the extent of the power a the influence of global social media giants and b the limits of freedom of speech interestingly india banned chinese apps like tiktalk and wechat most european countries including the uk and france banned hawaii 5g while china has threatened two eu companies like erricson and samsung to be proscribed it already has its own version of fb twitter and whatsapp the above examples have brought a new debate to the fore the de facto corporate sovereignty vs state s digital sovereignty lessons learnt pakistan also has to transit from analog sovereignty to digital sovereignty which encompasses control and direction of anarchic content software development and companies power here one point extrapolation of digital sovereignty with some complete border control is not meant but a state directing the speed of companies and regulating the content of digital social space so it does not create threats to the state and society s integrity and sanctity the problem pakistan is facing is we as a whole have yet to evolve a strategic coherence about the challenges of digital threats our elite from media to judiciary and policymaking need to recognize compelling cases to assert digital sovereignty by imposing regulations on free for all content that it has to regulate the borders of cyberspace and develop the capability to counter virtual threats to its digital systems and society at large rather than clinging to archaic laws and principles meant for addressing the challenges of the bygone era we need to balance the state s case for regulated digital platforms and content and the free speech imperative which is not absolute in its very nature and is already subject to limits even in the western societies currently individuals and big companies boards decide what to say and how to say hence the law unto themselves where they should be subject to a sovereign state s law this should be the baseline for the country to start with the recent debate of free speech and the anarchic content on social media platforms need to be understood and broadly debated to draw a line as to where a state can regulate and how far should it go vis à vis the recognition of the limits of free speech so that we do meet the challenges of the new de facto realities of the virtual world
