since the federal government with the consent of both parties just lit another 1 7 trillion dollars of imaginary money on fire the generally quiet period between christmas and the new year might be an opportune time to consider an important matter that has been almost completely ignored by both elected officials and the media that would be the national debt in case you hadn t noticed america s debt has now reached a staggering level of 31 3 trillion dollars that s a figure so huge that it s almost impossible to wrap your brain around it in the boston globe this week business and finance reporter jim puzzanghera has raised an important red flag warning that this level of debt represents a rapidly growing death spiral for our nation as he correctly points out the gargantuan debt number obscures a more pressing crisis for the country the federal government has to pay interest on that debt every year and as you may have heard the fed has been steadily raising interest rates ever since the biden recession began we had to pay nearly 400 billion in interest in 2022 and that figure is currently projected to climb to nearly 1 2 trillion over the next decade advertisement like a consumer grappling with a massive credit card balance the federal government is paying more just for the interest on the national debt government projections show those interest costs tripling from 399 billion this year to 1 19 trillion in 2032 borrowing most likely will have to increase just to pay for the higher interest expenses and on it goes a vicious cycle that promises bruising fights over debt and spending in washington next year partisan conflict which could shake financial markets and an economy already at risk of falling into recession if you re borrowing more and more every year on autopilot to fund programs that we promised which lack the revenue to pay for you then have a compounding problem where interest on the debt compounds and just adds to the burden said michael a peterson chief executive of the peter g peterson foundation currently the country s gdp is sitting at roughly 32 trillion virtually the same as our national debt put in a way that may be easier to comprehend we are now on track to wind up paying interest that will equal more than three percent of the nation s entire economic output in the next decade over the following two decades the cbo projects that figure will surpass seven percent that s simply not sustainable and the house of cards is going to collapse at some point a senior official at the centrist bipartisan policy center think tank described the situation for the globe as being the equivalent of termites under your porch they re working away at it you don t see them but one day you step out on that porch and you go through it advertisement so what happens when we can no longer service that debt there are two options the first is that we start massively slashing spending on a variety of popular and in some cases critical programs including social security and medicaid the other choice is that we begin to default on portions of the debt and our nation s credit rating is marked down again growing closer and closer to junk bond status and when the faith of the world in america s ability to pay its debts collapses so too does our entire economy we would see an era that would make the great depression look like a holiday picnic and it would take generations to recover assuming we could how did we ever let things get this far out of whack perhaps we ve stopped paying attention to our gargantuan national debt because we ve become too numb to be shocked by it anymore if you walk past one dead body on the sidewalk near your home you would no doubt be horrified and immediately call the authorities but if you re in the middle of a war zone and you march past hundreds of bodies each day you eventually stop noticing them and just get on with the mission unfortunately this is one situation that we won t be able to simply ignore forever the clock is ticking and i do not envy the generations of working class american families who will be stuck holding the bag when that alarm goes off

entergy affirms adjusted eps guidance and outlooks commits to continue to work with regulators on behalf of customers new orleans dec 26 2022 prnewswire on dec 23 2022 the federal energy regulatory commission issued two orders in ongoing proceedings involving the customer rate impacts of the grand gulf nuclear station seri operates grand gulf and owns or leases 90 of the station we believe friday s ferc orders are a positive step toward resolving a number of long standing issues raised by our retail regulators while we disagree with some elements of ferc s findings in particular its ruling on the sale leaseback claim we are pleased that ferc s remedy results in no additional refunds due to customers beyond those already provided in 2021 on the uncertain tax positions taken by seri said drew marsh entergy s chief executive officer seri has consistently maintained that its tax strategy was in the best interest of customers and ultimately provided them with millions of dollars in savings we are committed to working with our regulators to resolve outstanding ferc issues for the benefit of our customers regarding the uncertain tax position issue ferc s orders address a series of decommissioning uncertain tax positions that seri took in order to benefit customers seri assumed the risk of internal revenue service penalties and interest that could have resulted from unsuccessful portions of these positions the irs ultimately allowed over 100 million of an uncertain tax position seri took in 2015 the remedy in ferc s order directed seri to compute a refund based on the accumulated deferred income tax or adit amounts resulting from the irs s partial allowance of seri s 2015 decommissioning uncertain tax position consistent with ferc s order upon resolution with the irs of the 2015 uncertain tax position seri began to provide an ongoing rate base credit for the adit associated with the successful portion of the uncertain tax position which is estimated to result in a benefit of 69 million to customers over the remaining expected life of grand gulf additionally in 2021 seri provided a one time credit of 25 million inclusive of interest for the adit created by the 2015 decommissioning uncertain tax position which is consistent with the directives of ferc s order therefore seri s position is that it has already satisfied the remedy required in ferc s order ferc s order also specified that the remedy must not reestablish adit balances for tax positions that were denied by the irs as seri received no tax benefits from tax positions that were not successful beyond the partial acceptance of the 2015 tax position the irs did not allow any portion of seri s other decommissioning uncertain tax positions under the remedy specified by ferc for uncertain tax positions that the irs fully disallowed and for which seri received no tax benefits no refunds are due we therefore calculate the remaining refund for the uncertain tax positions issue to be 0 seri intends to file a compliance refund report reflecting that calculation as required by the order which ferc will review and address in a future order on the sale leaseback case the order calls for seri to refund approximately 149 million including interest resulting from the disallowance of 17 million in annual lease payments from 2015 through 2022 taking into account seri s previous settlement with the mississippi public service commission the total sale leaseback refund amount is 89 million the order also states that seri can no longer collect 17 million in annual lease payments on a prospective basis net of the entergy mississippi settlement the prospective exclusion would be approximately 10 million annually pre tax seri disagrees with this ruling and will seek rehearing this sale leaseback renewal was entered into to lower costs to customers which is a benefit that ferc previously recognized customers also continue to receive the power produced by the leased portion of the plant regarding the financial impacts of these ferc orders assuming there are no changes to either order upon rehearing entergy affirms its adjusted eps guidance for 2022 and adjusted eps

micron technology the second largest american semiconductor maker has announced plans to reduce its workforce by about 10 in response to the worst downturn in the semiconductor industry since 2009 micron is among us tech companies including amazon cisco facebook microsoft and twitter that in total have laid off more than 120 000 employees this year in the san francisco bay area silicon valley and environs alone more than 44 000 tech workers have lost their jobs since november 1 according to the san francisco chronicle merry christmas on december 21 micron announced results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2023 which ended on december 1 revenue was down 38 4 from the previous quarter and down 46 8 year on year as a result of the sharp decline in sales the company dropped into the red recording a net loss of 195 million compared with net profits of 1 5 billion the previous quarter and 2 5 billion a year earlier ceo sanjay mehrotra said micron s fiscal first quarter revenue and earnings per share were within guidance ranges despite challenging conditions during the quarter that means that the company s official forecast had been accurate presumably their second quarter guidance is also on target revenues down another 7 another net loss and a gross profit margin of only 7 5 plus or minus 2 5 that compares with gross margins of 21 9 last quarter and 47 0 in the first quarter of last fiscal year micron s strong technology manufacturing and financial position put us on solid footing to navigate the near term environment mehrotra said and we are taking decisive actions to cut our supply and expenses we expect improving customer inventories to enable higher revenue in the fiscal second half and to deliver strong profitability once we get past this downturn micron ceo sanjay mehrotra photo micron if that sounds like the proverbial american soft landing then why are they planning to lay off so many people the form 8 k statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec says they expect to reduce our headcount by approximately 10 over calendar year 2023 through a combination of voluntary attrition and personnel reductions this is a serious restructuring plan to deal with challenging industry conditions which may continue for quite some time micron can control its own costs and both it and its customers can reduce their inventories but they cannot control final demand which depends on the state of the economy whether or not sales will start to recover in the second half of this fiscal year remains to be seen what can be said is that visibility drops off sharply more than one quarter ahead and the us china trade dispute looming recession in europe and the impact of higher interest rates in the united states are not encouraging signs in fact it looks like ceo mehrotra and cfo mark murphy are preparing for the possibility of a hard landing which is the responsible thing to do micron plans to cut capital spending to 7 0 billion to 7 5 billion this fiscal year a 37 5 to 41 7 reduction from 12 0 billion last fiscal year with spending on production equipment dropping by about 50 we are now significantly reducing our fiscal 2024 capex from earlier plans to align with the supply demand environment mehrotra said the company expects fiscal 2024 wafer fab equipment to fall from fiscal 2023 levels even as construction spending increases year on year in other words even if revenues pick up after excess inventories have been eliminated purchases of silicon wafer fabrication semiconductor production equipment are likely to decline both this fiscal year and next micron has not changed its plans to invest 40 billion in the construction of memory chip production facilities in the us by 2030 last august the company stated that in the short run however the production schedule of the company s new 1 beta dram has been slowed and the introduction of nand flash memory beyond 232 layers has been delayed so as not to get ahead of market demand in november the company announced a 20 cut to wafer starts silicon wafer inputs average selling prices have declined by more than 20 since last quarter how bad could things get in fiscal 2009 at the bottom of the last severe downturn micron reported a 43 4 decline in sales a negative gross margin minus 9 2 and a net loss of 1 9 billion as of friday december 23 micron s stock price was down 49 from its 52 week and all time high which was reached last january us markets closed monday because christmas came on a sunday reopen tuesday december 27 that price drop might suggest that the worst is behind us and some stock market analysts rate micron a hold or a buy but history suggests otherwise after the dot com bubble burst in 2000 micron s share price dropped by 90 from its peak in 2006 through the sell off in the great recession associated with the collapse of lehman brothers in 2008 it dropped by 85 note that both of those declines took more than

conference over to stan ross please go ahead photo by thom holmes on unsplash advertisement advertisement stanton ross thank you very much thanks everybody for joining us today i appreciate your time with me today is tom heckman the company s cfo and also brody green our chief accounting officer what we ll do today just to give you a little insight tom will go over the operations and brody as well will be contributing with his input and then i ll be sharing some new events that have occurred and some things that we re looking forward to finishing up 2022 and also some insight on how 2023 looks so with that being said tom i ll turn it over to you tom heckman thank you stan and good morning to everybody welcome to our call we did file our 10 q on monday so hopefully everyone s had a chance to at least look at it and see the details behind the numbers for our third quarter ended september 30 2022 first i d like to start out with talking about several corporate events or matters which you may or may not have seen form 8 ks and other filings on before we get into the actual operating segments or results of the operations the first one i d like to talk about is the form 8 k that we filed back in july regarding the nasdaq delisting notice that we received for the minimum bid price being under 1 that delisting notice gives us until january 30 2023 to rectify that situation we are however we believe we re eligible for an additional 180 day grace period in which to meet the minimum requirements which would actually put us out to july of 2023 now that s not a given but we believe we are eligible for that 180 days obviously that s the whole delisting notice and matter is of great importance to management and obviously the shareholders so management we have been dealing with this issue and are talking about several alternatives which leads me to the following matter we filed a form 8 k in october 22 so it s after the september 30 quarter ended wherein we issued 15 million worth of series a and b preferred stock redeemable preferred stock the series a preferred stock votes on specific matters only on an as converted basis and the series b votes on a mere basis and a mere basis meaning the exact percentages of the other votes including the preferred series a as well as the common stock and the votes on a 2 500 share to 1 basis and there s 100 000 shares of series b issues so obviously a big matter and probably of importance to you all and hopefully you ve had a chance to read that 8 k the proceeds the 50 million proceeds of that issuance is an escrow pending redemption there is a 5 premium on the redemption there was a 5 discount on the issuance the redemption period starts on the date of the shareholder meeting the annual shareholder meeting and ends 90 days thereafter so that s what you might ask why do we do this and there s simply one answer we needed to get our voting quorum and a majority at our annual meeting you probably and hopefully have received a proxy statement from us for our annual meeting dated december 7 2022 which is coming up rather quickly and the reason we did the preferred stock is that if we are providing voting matters that actually amend the company s articles and incorporation per our bylaws and articles incorporation it requires over 50 vote of all outstanding shares not just those shares voted advertisement advertisement so in other words if we got 53 million shares outstanding we ve got to get at least 53 million half of that 26 million 27 million shares voting yes on that matter even though usually not that many people vote on matters so what we ve done is in the past we ve tried to raise our authorized shares and a couple of other matters for the last four or five years that required over 50 vote of outstanding shares and we always received a majority of the shares voted but we never did reach the point where we got more than 50 of all shares outstanding hence that is the reason we did this preferred stock so we can ensure ourselves that we re a we re going to get a quorum for the meeting and b that we ve got enough votes to equal 51 or just over 50 of all shares outstanding not just those that are voted there are several reasons that we are going to these lengths to get the quorum and the shares voted by issuing the preferred stock first is there s been a rise in the non interested shareholders that don t vote it s kind of what i call the robin hood type shareholders that just don t have the interest in voting so they leave it unvoted their shares unvoted and also there s been several major brokers including charles schwab and td ameritrade that no longer those non voted shares in the past they usually voted those non objecting beneficial owners what we call novo votes on their behalf and in that way we got the quorum and to 50 vote majority so without them doing it at this point it makes it very very difficult to reach quorum much less 50 of all shares outstanding so the preferred stock is out there merely to help us get to the 50 quorum and voting majority in order to get some issues passed now let s look at the matters that are going to be voted out at the annual meeting again the meeting of december 7 2022 it s coming up shortly i encourage everybody to vote their shares please vote your shares because it s important to us and we need to get this a couple of these matters voted in there s a total of six items on the agenda two of which require 50 voting majorities of outstanding votes in other words these are the two items that are going to be voted on by the preferred shareholders the first is to approve an amendment to increase capital stock from 110 million to 210 million that you might ask why we ve only got 53 million or 54 million shares outstanding now why we need to go to 210 million but we do have from time to time warrants outstanding sometimes convertible debt so on and so forth so those have to be reserved for in our capital stock so very important for us to get up to 210 million in total approved capital stock so that s item number 1 is going to be voted on by the preferred shareholders as well as the common shareholders the second one is to pre approve the board of directors decision and discretion on whether a reverse split is needed to meet the nasdaq delisting requirement in other words in order to get up to the 1 minimum bid the board may have to at last resort do some type of reverse split in order to get there and we re asking for pre approval of their voting for this advertisement advertisement that doesn t mean it s going to happen it will only happen if it s needed and necessary but we need that matter voted and approved upon at the annual meeting so those are the two items that are very important to us the board and hopefully to all shareholders and you guys everyone understands the reasons we re doing this it s in order to get matters past at the annual meeting again and i can t stress this enough i encourage all shareholders to vote their shares i know it sometimes it s a pain to do it sometimes you ll lose the proxy control number or whatever but please call us and get the voting instructions or getting or even come to the annual meeting itself if you have to but we want everyone to vote in order to get these matters passed the other item that happened during the quarter a corporate item that happened during the quarter that i ll mention is that we extinguished pretty much all our warrant derivative liabilities in q3 it resulted in a 3 6 million gain on the books and if you remember the previous investor calls i ve always expressed that there s a 3 million gain and there s a 6 million loss non cash it s funny money it s accounting gymnastics because of the way you have to treat warrant derivative liabilities so we got rid of all those warrant derivative liabilities in q3 recorded a 3 6 million gain and hopefully we don t have to run into that issue again because number one it s hard to explain and number two it s hard to understand for a lot of people a lot of investors so okay let s move on to the operating segments and how they did for the third quarter first of all the video solutions segment revenues increased 65 000 in q3 2022 over 2021 or about 3 increase not a huge increase but it s important because it shows that our subscriptions revenues are increasing and quite frankly the traction that our new first few models are receiving in the marketplace we re getting a lot of new subscriptions versus hardware sales and i call that mailbox money it s very steady it comes in it s predictable and you don t have the ups and down movements of hardware sales whether it closes the day before quarter ends versus the day after so on and so forth so we re happy with the improvement and the migration to the subscription agreement also i will say that deferred revenue which is basically these subscription agreements increased to 7 2 million at the end of september 30 2022 again 7 2 million of deferred revenue which means that we ll recognize that as it rolls off in what i call mailbox money the subscriptions if you look at 12 31 december 31 2021 we only had 4 3 million of deferred contract revenues so we ve increased that in a matter of nine months by 2 9 million or 67 so we re very pleased with the growth in the subscription model and how it s affecting on video segment the margins for the quarter were down slightly to 24 6 versus 29 1 the year prior and it really i think it really reflects the fact that we are moving to the subscription model versus a onetime hardware sale normally a onetime hardware sale upfront yields very good margins but that s it advertisement advertisement and there are no continuing impact so i think this is indicative of us moving to a subscription model and we re very pleased with it okay let s move on to the revenue cycle management segment that is our medical billing segment which we have started a roll up strategy i think we started that last year second or third quarter our revenues were down slightly in q3 2 015 million in 2022 versus 2 050 million in 2021 which is a very slight decrease however if you look at the margins generated by those sales it increased dramatically in 2022 versus 2021 we reached 866 000 of positive gross margins or 43 gross margin percentage versus 197 000 or 9 6 gross margin percentage in 2021 and really this reflects the synergy we re getting the synergies that are the part of the roll up strategy and the consolidations of the acquisitions we made previously we did not make any acquisitions in q3 so we had time to concentrate on assimilating and consolidating and achieving those synergies and i think the gross margins are a testament to that effect it is working our roll up strategy is working and it s growing into a very steady profitable business for us and we look forward to further growth down the road okay now let s go to the ticketing segment which is our ticketsmarter business our revenue increased to 4 4 million in 2022 versus 560 000 in 2021 obviously a huge increase but remember we bought ticketsmarter effective september 1 2021 so there was only one month of revenue in the 2021 period but even if you take that time straight it s a heck of an improvement year over year in revenues now let s look at the bad news the gross margins were disappointing we had negative gross margins in 2022 of 786 000 and over 612 000 in 2021 the reasons for this margin issue that we re dealing with is we had unanticipated write off of unsold tickets and really there s a hundred reasons for that but i ll tell you one we have generally received a lot of ticketing revenue for on broadway shows and ballets and such up in new york and really the whole covid thing has changed the buying patterns of many people and predominantly the older generation and i m one of those obviously but anyway the older generation is has really shown a popular interest in those shows and that and with covid they just haven t come back the way we thought they would so that s just an example and there s probably four or five other ones similar to that that we can go over the second area is our strategy that we implemented last year to doing a sponsorship relationship really is not working very well and i m talking about things like iheartradio contract the gannett usa today contract there s several others this sponsorship model did not pan out the way we thought and obviously the click through revenues did not reach the levels that we expected we re hearing the same sort of problems being experienced by other tech companies such as facebook and such that the click through revenues are not there like they have been in the past so what we ve done is we have decided to end this strategy and this model and therefore started in the third quarter to reduce non renew or terminate existing contracts that are out there advertisement advertisement so in other words we re going to let these things run out if they haven t run out terminate early if we can and non renew obviously in order to get away from this model we believe this will restore profitability in the ticketing segment within the near future so we ve got a plan to fix the ticketing segment its generating revenues obviously very good revenues but we ve got to fix the gross margin because we obviously do not want those margins to go negative on us like that okay let s look a little bit at the balance sheet at september 30 we had roughly 6 3 million of cash on the balance sheet 21 million of positive working capital we have only 1 2 million in interest bearing debt obligations and remember those are primarily earn out notes and the roll up strategy for the medical billing segment so it s 1 2 million of interest bearing debt obligations and we have 48 million in equity so balance sheet remains strong we intend to continue the positive trends in our video and revenue segments and go ahead and make the necessary changes in the ticketing segment to get to profitability that we all would like to see and expect so with that i will turn it over to brody he s probably got some more insight into the operating segments and what happened to us in the third quarter and what to expect in the future quarters see also 15 best e commerce stocks to buy and countries by gdp 30 biggest economies in the world brody green yes thanks tom and we covered off on most everything i was going to mention as well so just a few things he didn t mention we re we still have our shield revenue segment still up and running and they ve got some exciting traction coming up here late this year into early 2023 that we re really looking forward to in a couple of announcements we ll be able to make here soon regarding their new ventures they ve got going and some new contracts that are coming due here soon tom obviously mentioned the excitement we have surrounding the deferred revenue and how that s growing rather quickly and we re seeing the success of the subscription plans 7 2 million in deferred revenue is exciting and we only expect that to grow at the same pace it s been growing if not faster advertisement advertisement so we re looking forward to seeing that and we ll recognize that revenue quarter over quarter similarly with ticketsmarter tom mentioned we re just kind of rightsizing it right now trimming out some of those contracts that going quite come to provision like we were hoping for but we ve been focusing quite a bit on primary ticketing and becoming a primary ticketing group for a lot of these events and festivals and what not and we have some exciting announcements we re going to be able to make here yet before the end of this year that i think will be beneficial for all of us here and then obviously touched on the consistency in nobility showing and how it s really starting to increase its gross margins and the plan is coming together as we expected it to so that s exciting to see as well so all in all we re making some corrections here but we re also seeing some things trending in the right direction and we re very excited about here going forward and heading into 2023 as well with that stan stanton ross yes thanks brody and tom yes a couple of things that i ll circle back to and we ll start with the ticketing side of things one of the things once we acquired that platform realizing that they normally were just a secondary market and trying to do some unique packages that put them in a primary position and we ve been able to establish quite a few of those as a matter of fact i think we re up to over 40 different relationships that we have that were actually the primary ticketing platform for these venues and so with that and all the relationships we have with the secondary markets and the universities one of the things that we established is a new entity that you will be seeing quite a bit in 2023 and that is kustom440 entertainment this is a platform that will allow us to not only through our relationships that we have with the different theaters and amphitheaters and different stadiums and ballparks be able to present and have our own concerts or festivals and be able to generate quite a bit of revenue and also believe that it will be very healthy bottom line that being said if you look at the growth that we ve had with ticketsmarter and what we re anticipating with the kustom440 marriage right now i think we ve identified a minimum of six concerts and we hope to have that raised up to well over 15 possibly in 2023 so being a little bit conservative if you look at the revenue side of just those events very very possible another 9 million to 15 million in additional revenue from that aspect and that particular opportunity advertisement advertisement and that is not a very very high risk area as there is a tremendous amount of data on the individuals that you would be bringing in to perform what they typically draw what their typical ticket sales are so providing you ve got the right structure venue primary ticketing utilize the digital ally security side of things with our connections for video solutions it puts us really in a nice position to be all encompassed in regards to being able to throw these events and also maximize the return from doing those events so real excited about ticketsmarter and kustom440 the marriage that they would have and being able to work together and shield as brody did mention we really do anticipate some nice announcements in the very near future on that it s taken a while to educate the public on the safetiness of our product being the non alcohol or chemical based disinfectant sanitizer that has all the what you say cleaning capabilities and to handle viruses and other issues that are out there but also very safe around children pets and food so we do think that that s getting a lot of momentum and you should see some good news coming out of that as well so anyway i m sure there s some questions that are out there so we ll go ahead and open up the floor for q a to continue reading the q a session please click here
bloomberg malick diop felt something shifting on wall street most read from bloomberg advertisement advertisement he d joined morgan stanley in the grim days of 2009 when big banks were trying to pay back taxpayer bailouts and deflect public fury but four years later the ire was fading and ambition was the order of the day it really felt like for the first time the job and the career weren t defined by the context of the financial crisis diop said we are past this now and now it s time for us to do new deals in the years that followed his rise to managing director traced a new boom he helped orchestrate a multibillion dollar deal with softbank group whose breakneck investments defined an era then closed a huge spac merger at the height of that rush diop didn t know it but he was playing a small role in something almost unfathomably lucrative the first trillion dollar decade for the six giants of us banking that s not 1 trillion of total revenue it s pure profit such a haul didn t seem possible before the decade began when wall street was the target of a global protest movement and politicians at both ends of the spectrum were seething over bailouts or aiming to break up too big to fail lenders advertisement advertisement they swelled instead outpacing corporate america so handily that jpmorgan chase co bank of america corp and even hobbled wells fargo co are on track to make more profit over those 10 years than all but a few publicly traded us companies according to data compiled by bloomberg citigroup inc goldman sachs group inc and morgan stanley aren t far behind and together the six are poised to make even more next year while much of the world s attention was focused on the riches minted by silicon valley banks were gaining momentum there isn t one way to explain how they pulled it off volatility juiced wall street s trading hauls investment bankers like diop rode a dealmaking boom and donald trump boosted bottom lines by slashing taxes likewise there isn t one reaction across the industry to the milestone sometimes there s this sense that the fact that they profited that much is somehow terrible and i just don t think that s the case said betsy duke a former federal reserve governor who chaired wells fargo s board until 2020 about everything you could throw at the financial system has been thrown at it in the last 10 years these banks have not just survived but they ve actually thrived in a decade of public anger at the banks tougher rules geopolitical havoc the pandemic and some treacherous market swings banks were able to cope with all of that and not only cope with it but earn 1 trillion duke said advertisement advertisement analyst estimates show the six banks are quickly closing in on that feat 1 trillion in a 10 year period and that if they don t reach the milestone at the end of this month they will sometime in the first few weeks of 2023 it isn t just the scale of profit that s so startling though but the industry s ability to push through scandals and thrive anew ten years ago jpmorgan now the most profitable and valuable us bank by market capitalization was in the doghouse after the london whale trading fiasco wells was on top of the big six the most valuable and the sole member of the group pulling in more than 20 billion though its earnings were later derailed over revelations of consumer abuses analysts see it nearing that level again in 2023 what didn t transform over those years is the broad outline of the business banks sell stocks and bonds trade financial instruments advise on corporate takeovers manage wealth handle payments and lend back in 2013 some traders were already mourning the casino style risk taking that dodd frank of 2010 threatened even if washington was still hammering out the exact rules paying for scandals advertisement advertisement to get out of the shadow of the global crisis the banks had to pay in 2014 bank of america agreed to a record breaking 16 7 billion settlement to end probes into shoddy mortgage practices passing jpmorgan s 13 billion by then some banks were mining new veins of profit that got them into trouble employees inside wells fargo under pressure to meet sales targets set up millions of accounts for customers who hadn t asked for them the most famous in a series of scandals that ultimately spanned most of its businesses and in malaysia goldman sachs finished raising billions of dollars in 2013 for a state owned investment fund known as 1mdb which was then pilfered by a group including the former prime minister my biggest regret in the last decade was not stopping the 1mdb transaction said former goldman partner robert mass a compliance executive each issue was vetted in some cases multiple times but in the end the answers that we received satisfied us mass who now teaches philosophy at hunter college in new york said the firm was misled by our own people who were in on the bribe in a way that we had no reason to doubt and could not disprove he wasn t sure if he learned any lessons other than to be less trusting the magnitude of profit makes those mistakes look like hiccups one person the industry can thank trump taunted banks on the campaign trail before putting two goldman alumni in charge of a tax overhaul that helped transform corporate profits banks that had gotten used to paying three in ten dollars to the government found themselves forking over less than one in five for 2018 their tax bills went down from there advertisement advertisement that year marked a new intensity for wall street s growth banks that had made less than 70 billion in 2017 made 120 billion in 2018 thanks to tax cuts an uptick in interest rates and surges in retail banking and dealmaking their combined assets which hovered around 10 trillion for years began to shoot up the way top wall street lawyer h rodgin cohen sees it all of this shouldn t be a surprise banks may be seen as always winning with a couple of exceptions because of their role in the economy said cohen who s now senior chair of sullivan cromwell llp they are intermediaries they re borrowing and they re lending the decade was a frothy time to be a banker personnel expenses for the six companies which had hovered around 148 billion at the beginning of the era before dropping for a few years jumped to 154 billion in 2019 never mind that their overall number of employees had actually fallen jamie dimon the jpmorgan boss who d already become a billionaire would eventually get such a big pay package that a proxy advisory firm told shareholders to vote against it one of the goals of a good society is that everyone including those people at the bottom have enough to survive and flourish said mass the former goldman partner who now studies ethics i am ok that people are paid well for producing products and services that increase the overall level of wealth in society but only when we combine that with appropriate taxation and sufficient social safety so that those at the bottom can flourish he added that he isn t enough of an expert to say if current taxes and safety nets are the right size advertisement advertisement few things transformed the landscape of wall street as profoundly as the pandemic s arrival in 2020 to avoid economic cataclysm the government rolled out relief programs for consumers and businesses and the fed bought trillions of dollars of assets the market mayhem brought back the volatility that trading floors crave corporations lined up to borrow raise capital or buy weakened competitors things were changing inside the banks too when police murdered george floyd that may diop found himself inundated with messages from classmates and colleagues it was from an actual good place and well meaning but at the same time you get 20 of those calls because you are the lone person that comes up he said it was exhausting to be everyone s black friend at that moment that september the news that jane fraser would become the first woman to run one of the big us banks was greeted by her colleagues with cheers but also frustration for how long it took advertisement advertisement i tried to change the industry from the inside out at the three largest banks and i failed i have the shards of glass on my head to show it said anne clarke wolff a former executive at citigroup jpmorgan and bank of america who founded independence point advisors last year in 10 years at a big bank the ceo didn t spend 10 minutes with me and i was among the most senior women in

a british historian an italian archaeologist and an american preschool teacher have never met in person but they share a prominent pandemic bond plagued by eerily similar symptoms the three women are credited with describing naming and helping bring long covid into the public s consciousness in early 2020 rachel pope of liverpool took to twitter in late march 2020 to describe her bedeviling symptoms then unnamed after a coronavirus infection elisa perego in italy first used the term long covid in a may tweet that year amy watson in portland oregon got inspiration in naming her facebook support group from the trucker cap she d been wearing and long hauler soon became part of the pandemic lexicon nearly three years into the pandemic scientists are still trying to figure out why some people get long covid and why a small portion including the three women have lasting symptoms millions of people worldwide have had long covid reporting various symptoms including fatigue lung problems and brain fog and other neurological symptoms evidence suggests most recover substantially within a year but recent data show that it has contributed to more than 3 500 u s deaths here s some of the latest evidence women more at risk many studies and anecdotal evidence suggest that women are more likely than men to develop long covid there could be biological reasons women s immune systems generally mount stronger reactions to viruses bacteria parasites and other germs noted sabra klein a johns hopkins professor who studies immunity women are also much more likely than men to have autoimmune diseases where the body mistakenly attacks its own healthy cells some scientists believe long covid could result from an autoimmune response triggered by the virus women s bodies also tend to have more fat tissue and emerging research suggests the coronavirus may hide in fat after infection scientists also are studying whether women s fluctuating hormone levels may increase the risks another possible factor women are more likely than men to seek health care and often more attuned to changes in their bodies klein noted i don t think we should ignore that she said biology and behavior are probably both at play klein said it may thus be no coincidence that it was three women who helped shine the first light on long covid pope 46 started chronicling what she was experiencing in march 2020 flu like symptoms then her lungs heart and joints were affected after a month she started having some ok days but symptoms persisted she and some similarly ill colleagues connected with perego on twitter we started sort of coming together because it was literally the only place where we could do that pope said in 2020 we would joke that we d get together for christmas and have a party pope said then obviously it went on and i think we stopped joking watson started her virtual long haulers group that april the others soon learned of that nickname and embraced it related lingering covid 19 symptoms affect middle aged women the worst according to studies mono virus several studies suggest the ubiquitous epstein barr virus could play a role in some cases of long covid inflammation caused by coronavirus infection can activate herpes viruses which remain in the body after causing an acute infection said dr timothy henrich a virus expert at the university of california san francisco epstein barr virus is among the most common of these herpes viruses an estimated 90 of the u s population has been infected with it the virus can cause mononucleosis or symptoms that may be dismissed as a cold henrich is among researchers who have found immune markers signaling epstein barr reactivation in the blood of long covid patients particularly those with fatigue not all long covid patients have these markers but it s possible that epstein barr is causing symptoms in those who do although scientists say more study is needed some scientists also believe that epstein barr triggers chronic fatigue syndrome a condition that bears many similarities to long covid but that also is unproven related long covid could be aging organs faster by 3 4 years research shows obesity obesity is a risk factor for severe covid 19 infections and scientists are trying to understand why stanford university researchers are among those who have found evidence that the coronavirus can infect fat cells in a recent study they found the virus and signs of inflammation in fat tissue taken from people who had died from covid lab tests showed that the virus can reproduce in fat tissue that raises the possibility that fat tissue could serve as a reservoir potentially fueling long covid could removing fat tissue treat or prevent some cases of long covid it s a tantalizing question but the research is preliminary said dr catherine blish a stanford infectious diseases professor and a senior author of the study scientists at the university of texas southwestern medical center are studying leptin a hormone produced by fat cells that can influence the body s immune response and promote inflammation they plan to study whether injections of a manufactured antibody could reduce leptin levels and in turn inflammation from coronavirus infections or long covid we have a good scientific basis together with some preliminary data to argue that we might be on the right track said dr philipp scherer related today is day 353 woman takes 189 pills a week nearly 1 year after covid 19 diagnosis to combat symptoms creative stock image of lungs with virus via getty images duration it has been estimated that about 30 of people infected with the coronavirus will develop long covid based on data from earlier in the pandemic most people who have lingering recurrent or new symptoms after infection will recover after about three months among those with symptoms at three months about 15 will continue to have symptoms for at least nine more months according to a recent study in the journal of the american medical association figuring out who s at risk for years long symptoms is such a complicated question said dr lawrence purpura an infectious disease expert at columbia university those with severe infections seem to be more at risk for long covid although it can also affect people with mild infections those whose infections cause severe lung damage including scarring may experience breathlessness coughing or fatigue for more than a year and a smaller group of patients with mild initial covid 19 infections may develop neurologic symptoms for more than a year including chronic fatigue and brain fog purpura said the majority of patients will eventually recover he said it s important for people to know that it s small consolation for the three women who helped the world recognize long covid perego 44 developed heart lung and neurologic problems and remains seriously ill she knows that scientists have learned a lot in a short time but she says there is a gap between long covid research and medical care we need to translate scientific knowledge into better treatment and policy she said watson approaching 50 says she has never had any kind of recovery she has had severe migraines plus digestive nerve and foot problems recently she developed severe anemia she wishes the medical community had a more organized approach to treating long covid doctors say not knowing the underlying cause or causes makes that difficult i just want my life back watson said and it s not looking like that s all that possible

with an ambitious goal of creating a viable renewable fuel source for the transportation industry chevron has teamed up with lone star state researchers on the diesel nut project the partnership is a five year multimillion dollar collaboration between chevron and researchers at texas a m agrilife extension service focusing on creating a genetically engineered breed of low input peanut lines that can produce higher yields of oil for use as a renewable biodiesel the fuel produced could be viable for everything from passenger cars and tractor trailers to airplanes trains and more said luis ribera a professor of agricultural economics at the extension service the diesel nut will be converted into renewable diesel which is chemically identical to fossil diesel so it can be used in anything that uses diesel ribera told freightwaves texas a m agrilife is one of the country s premier research agencies in agriculture natural resources and the life sciences the agency is based in college station as part of the partnership chevron nyse cvx is building the capacity to produce 100 000 barrels per day of renewable fuels by 2030 the company said we expect all of our u s diesel sales to have renewable or biodiesel content by 2030 chevron said in an email to freightwaves chevron declined to say how much it is investing in the diesel nut project ribera who will lead research transportation shelling and crushing infrastructure for the project said chevron has discussed targeting the california market for use of renewable diesel chevron is mainly looking at domestic and right now they are looking at the california market ribera said the diesel nut project comes at a time when the u s is using more diesel fuel than ever in 2021 the u s transportation sector used about 47 billion gallons of diesel fuel an average of about 128 million gallons per day according to the u s energy information administration eia this accounted for about 77 of total u s consumption of diesel diesel engines are used in everything from trucks trains boats and barges to farm and construction equipment the u s military also uses diesel fuel in tanks and trucks in recent months supply chains were hammered when soaring diesel prices hit the trucking and rail freight transport industries on june 20 diesel was as high as 5 81 a gallon nationwide diesel prices have fallen in recent weeks to 5 27 and the eia predicts retail diesel prices will average 4 73 per gallon for the rest of the year the eia also said in its july short term energy outlook it expects the demand for renewable diesel fuel to continue to increase consumption of biofuels has risen in the u s in 2022 and we expect this growth to continue the eia said increasing demand for transportation fuels higher 2022 renewable fuel standard program targets announced on june 3 and new renewable diesel production capacity coming online all contribute to this growth converting peanut oil into diesel fuel is actually a concept that dates back to the 1890s when german scientist rudolf diesel first used peanut oil to power an automobile engine in 1900 at the paris world s fair diesel tested an engine that purportedly ran on 100 peanut oil one issue with using peanut oil to produce diesel fuel is that current food grade peanut varieties don t have a high oil content approximately 48 according to texas a m agrilife and produce only about 123 gallons of biodiesel per acre existing peanut lines also require significant amounts of water to raise soybeans need 15 to 25 inches of water per year whereas peanuts need 20 to 39 inches the primary plant oil used in the u s to make biodiesel is soy oil the diesel nut project is developing peanut lines that have 55 to 60 oil content and could produce as much as 350 gallons of biodiesel per acre the diesel nuts are also being bred to perform under limited irrigation and dryland production agrilife said john cason a texas a m agrilife researcher who will lead the diesel nut project said the goal of the project is to create peanuts that yield more oil while also introducing new peanut lines that farmers can use as cash crops in drier climates researchers are also designing a system of production transportation and distribution for the diesel nuts once the crops are harvested one thing that will help the diesel nut succeed is that when you don t irrigate a peanut you run the risk of aflatoxin which can be devastating to food grade peanuts cason said referring to a toxin created by fungus that can contaminate food crops but that won t matter when the crop is being crushed for biofuel so regardless of how much moisture if the grower can grow something they can market it using peanut oil as a fuel also has a lower carbon intensity that encompasses the energy needed to produce it as well as water pesticides and fertilizer agrilife said in texas farmers typically begin planting peanuts the first week of may and harvest occurs around october during the first year of the diesel nut project texas a m agrilife will conduct testing at three key peanut production areas in stephenville vernon and yoakum texas the project aims to bring production back to areas that previously grew peanuts but ran out of water cason said for now texas a m researchers are focused on testing diesel nut harvests and yields in the lone star state but the idea is to expand production elsewhere eventually the end goal of the project is to develop a high oil peanut that could be grown across the southern u s cason said at this point i anticipate the breeding lines we have being the best adapted to a texas climate that is where most of our work is focused and where almost all of our testing occurs but with a little breeding for disease resistance i think these could be adapted to other areas of the u s watch freightwaves what the truck discusses the trucker purge click for more freightwaves articles by noi mahoney more articles by

bloomberg malick diop felt something shifting on wall street he d joined morgan stanley in the grim days of 2009 when big banks were trying to pay back taxpayer bailouts and deflect public fury but four years later the ire was fading and ambition was the order of the day it really felt like for the first time the job and the career weren t defined by the context of the financial crisis diop said we are past this now and now it s time for us to do new deals in the years that followed his rise to managing director traced a new boom he helped orchestrate a multibillion dollar deal with softbank group whose breakneck investments defined an era then closed a huge spac merger at the height of that rush diop didn t know it but he was playing a small role in something almost unfathomably lucrative the first trillion dollar decade for the six giants of us banking that s not 1 trillion of total revenue it s pure profit such a haul didn t seem possible before the decade began when wall street was the target of a global protest movement and politicians at both ends of the spectrum were seething over bailouts or aiming to break up too big to fail lenders they swelled instead outpacing corporate america so handily that jpmorgan chase co bank of america corp and even hobbled wells fargo co are on track to make more profit over those 10 years than all but a few publicly traded us companies according to data compiled by bloomberg citigroup inc goldman sachs group inc and morgan stanley aren t far behind and together the six are poised to make even more next year while much of the world s attention was focused on the riches minted by silicon valley banks were gaining momentum there isn t one way to explain how they pulled it off volatility juiced wall street s trading hauls investment bankers like diop rode a dealmaking boom and donald trump boosted bottom lines by slashing taxes likewise there isn t one reaction across the industry to the milestone sometimes there s this sense that the fact that they profited that much is somehow terrible and i just don t think that s the case said betsy duke a former federal reserve governor who chaired wells fargo s board until 2020 about everything you could throw at the financial system has been thrown at it in the last 10 years these banks have not just survived but they ve actually thrived in a decade of public anger at the banks tougher rules geopolitical havoc the pandemic and some treacherous market swings banks were able to cope with all of that and not only cope with it but earn 1 trillion duke said analyst estimates show the six banks are quickly closing in on that feat 1 trillion in a 10 year period and that if they don t reach the milestone at the end of this month they will sometime in the first few weeks of 2023 it isn t just the scale of profit that s so startling though but the industry s ability to push through scandals and thrive anew ten years ago jpmorgan now the most profitable and valuable us bank by market capitalization was in the doghouse after the london whale trading fiasco wells was on top of the big six the most valuable and the sole member of the group pulling in more than 20 billion though its earnings were later derailed over revelations of consumer abuses analysts see it nearing that level again in 2023 what didn t transform over those years is the broad outline of the business banks sell stocks and bonds trade financial instruments advise on corporate takeovers manage wealth handle payments and lend back in 2013 some traders were already mourning the casino style risk taking that dodd frank of 2010 threatened even if washington was still hammering out the exact rules paying for scandals to get out of the shadow of the global crisis the banks had to pay in 2014 bank of america agreed to a record breaking 16 7 billion settlement to end probes into shoddy mortgage practices passing jpmorgan s 13 billion by then some banks were mining new veins of profit that got them into trouble employees inside wells fargo under pressure to meet sales targets set up millions of accounts for customers who hadn t asked for them the most famous in a series of scandals that ultimately spanned most of its businesses and in malaysia goldman sachs finished raising billions of dollars in 2013 for a state owned investment fund known as 1mdb which was then pilfered by a group including the former prime minister my biggest regret in the last decade was not stopping the 1mdb transaction said former goldman partner robert mass a compliance executive each issue was vetted in some cases multiple times but in the end the answers that we received satisfied us mass who now teaches philosophy at hunter college in new york said the firm was misled by our own people who were in on the bribe in a way that we had no reason to doubt and could not disprove he wasn t sure if he learned any lessons other than to be less trusting the magnitude of profit makes those mistakes look like hiccups one person the industry can thank trump taunted banks on the campaign trail before putting two goldman alumni in charge of a tax overhaul that helped transform corporate profits banks that had gotten used to paying three in ten dollars to the government found themselves forking over less than one in five for 2018 their tax bills went down from there that year marked a new intensity for wall street s growth banks that had made less than 70 billion in 2017 made 120 billion in 2018 thanks to tax cuts an uptick in interest rates and surges in retail banking and dealmaking their combined assets which hovered around 10 trillion for years began to shoot up the way top wall street lawyer h rodgin cohen sees it all of this shouldn t be a surprise banks may be seen as always winning with a couple of exceptions because of their role in the economy said cohen who s now senior chair of sullivan cromwell llp they are intermediaries they re borrowing and they re lending the decade was a frothy time to be a banker personnel expenses for the six companies which had hovered around 148 billion at the beginning of the era before dropping for a few years jumped to 154 billion in 2019 never mind that their overall number of employees had actually fallen jamie dimon the jpmorgan boss who d already become a billionaire would eventually get such a big pay package that a proxy advisory firm told shareholders to vote against it one of the goals of a good society is that everyone including those people at the bottom have enough to survive and flourish said mass the former goldman partner who now studies ethics i am ok that people are paid well for producing products and services that increase the overall level of wealth in society but only when we combine that with appropriate taxation and sufficient social safety so that those at the bottom can flourish he added that he isn t enough of an expert to say if current taxes and safety nets are the right size few things transformed the landscape of wall street as profoundly as the pandemic s arrival in 2020 to avoid economic cataclysm the government rolled out relief programs for consumers and businesses and the fed bought trillions of dollars of assets the market mayhem brought back the volatility that trading floors crave corporations lined up to borrow raise capital or buy weakened competitors things were changing inside the banks too when police murdered george floyd that may diop found himself inundated with messages from classmates and colleagues it was from an actual good place and well meaning but at the same time you get 20 of those calls because you are the lone person that comes up he said it was exhausting to be everyone s black friend at that moment that september the news that jane fraser would become the first woman to run one of the big us banks was greeted by her colleagues with cheers but also frustration for how long it took i tried to change the industry from the inside out at the three largest banks and i failed i have the shards of glass on my head to show it said anne clarke wolff a former executive at citigroup jpmorgan and bank of america who founded independence point advisors last year in 10 years at a big bank the ceo didn t spend 10 minutes with me and i was among the most senior women in early 2020 analysts were writing obituaries for wall street s run of record profits instead the banks helped spark the boom of blank check companies known as spacs later once regulators got jittery and prices soured investors were left holding the bag profits in 2021 also got help from an accounting move the banks felt good enough about the economy thanks to government intervention to release some of the reserves they had set aside in case loans soured the big six made more profit in 2021 than in 2013 and 2014 combined even when russia invaded ukraine this year the chaos helped traders defy expectations of hard times the tally of profits from the past 10 years eclipses the prior decade s even if you take into account inflation and big bank mergers during the financial crisis yet other corporate titans especially in silicon valley did too well for wall street to claim a monopoly on success apple inc alone made more than half a trillion dollars microsoft corp berkshire hathaway inc and alphabet inc topped jpmorgan followed by exxon mobil corp edging out bank of america and wells fargo banks would attribute some of their gains to innovation after they invested in tech platforms and improved offerings including credit card rewards they ve also helped companies tap capital markets to grow the economy and they ve held on to some of the profit adding more than 200 billion to their capital buffers over the past decade to make a repeat of 2008 less likely critics would counter that the banks didn t do it alone many of them wouldn t have survived 2008 if it weren t for taxpayer aid and those buffers are the result of stiffer capital rules sometimes enacted over bankers strident objections moreover it was another government intervention that propped the economy up during the pandemic teeing up those record profits among other knocks some banks have focused on a narrower slice of clients limiting opportunities for many communities and have been slow to pass along rate hikes to savers betting that customers won t flee to smaller rivals ultimately banks fortunes depend on the health of their clients cohen said their epic profits will drop if the economy takes a downturn a real downturn he said diop s career shows the potential pitfalls two major mortgage companies he helped bring to the public markets during the pandemic are down more than 50 battered by higher interest rates and economic concerns even when markets were ebullient diop worried about how things would look when the mood turned but you can t be on the sidelines for every deal he said this year he left morgan stanley to become an executive at hoorae the media company run by the actor and producer issa rae his sister i actually already miss it a little bit he said i miss figuring out what s next with

we ve spoken in the past about how some folks seem to use twitter often at night to make embarrassing rants rep adam kinzinger r il is one prime example of this problem unfortunately he doesn t have anyone who cares enough about him in his family or on his staff to tell him to stop or to rein him in so we get embarrassing things like his comment on christmas eve about jan 6 and the national guard which showed how members of the jan 6 committee are just farcically ignorant about the facts or trying to push bull on people who they think might not know any better advertisement but i m not sure what was going on with this twitter thread of predictions from former russian president dmitry medvedev who is now the deputy chair of the security council of the russian federation he said that on new year s eve people are often making predictions for the coming year so these were his offerings they are in a word wacky what can happen in 2023 1 oil price will rise to 150 a barrel and gas price will top 5 000 per 1 000 cubic meters 2 the uk will rejoin the eu 3 the eu will collapse after the uk s return euro will drop out of use as the former eu currency 4 poland and hungary will occupy western regions of the formerly existing ukraine 5 the fourth reich will be created encompassing the territory of germany and its satellites i e poland the baltic states czechia slovakia the kiev republic and other outcasts 6 war will break out between france and the fourth reich europe will be divided poland repartitioned in the process 7 northern ireland will separate from the uk and join the republic of ireland 8 civil war will break out in the us california and texas becoming independent states as a result texas and mexico will form an allied state elon musk ll win the presidential election in a number of states which after the new civil war s end will have been given to the gop 9 all the largest stock markets and financial activity will leave the us and europe and move to asia 10 the bretton woods system of monetary management will collapse leading to the imf and world bank crash euro and dollar will stop circulating as the global reserve currencies digital fiat currencies will be actively used instead advertisement medvedev finished off with an insult to the anglo saxon west season greetings to you all anglo saxon friends and their happily oinking piglets yikes too much adult libation too many of the wrong medications whatever it was it wasn t going over well i ll have to admit his prediction for the result of an american civil war with musk ending up being president is certainly creative texas and mexico becoming one there s so much in there that wouldn t happen one has to think that somehow this was some form of joke but so far i m not seeing any clarification that he isn t just being nuts or posting agitprop to tick people off more than a little disconcerting when you have a russian official tweeting such insanity but what set some on the left off was twitter head elon musk responded epic thread to medvedev epic thread elon musk elonmusk december 26 2022 now it s essential to understand that epic thread in internet speak means someone just said something incredibly stupid that is going to have a lot of people talking so it s not a compliment to the thread quite the contrary if anything it s an encouragement to pile and tweet about how ridiculous medvedev s thread is advertisement but as with so many other things the left didn t get it and then started claiming that musk must be a russian asset but if he were a russian asset why would he have given starlink to both ukraine to help the ukrainians just one of the many reasons that idea is ridiculous but as we ve seen in the past the left thinks everyone they don t like is a russian asset meanwhile musk continued to mock medvedev s thread even as the left continued to go over a cliff not understanding what he was saying or caring to get it right lol remindme_ofthis in one year elon musk elonmusk december 26 2022 elon musk elonmusk december 26 2022 of course musk while an american citizen was born in south africa so he couldn t possibly become president which is just one of the many problems with medvedev s farcical thread warning for language elon musk elonmusk december 27 2022 this wasn t the first time that musk had trolled medvedev taunting him in the past about russia not doing well in bakhmut at the time in october but the left is the left because they have difficulty with reality and they just would rather hate anyone they think doesn t support their narrative

statements even if it becomes apparent that any projected results will not be realized i will now turn the call over to mr humphreys bob humphreys good afternoon and thank you for your interest in delta apparel we are extremely pleased with our performance in fiscal year 2022 as you saw in our press release this afternoon we delivered full year sales of 484 9 million and an operating margin of 6 6 resulting in 2 80 of earnings per diluted share our ability to navigate the dynamic economic conditions and consumer environment throughout the year and achieve both double digit sales growth of 11 and solid bottom line results for our shareholders is a testament to the resiliency and reach of our diversified go to market strategies and of course our people i m incredibly proud of our entire organization s ability to quickly adapt to change throughout the year yet remain focused on the execution of our business goals and strategic initiatives all five of our primary market channels delta direct global brands retail direct dtg2go and salt life delivered year over year sales growth in fiscal year 2022 the growth was driven by higher units sold in most product categories as well as price increases across product lines within our delta group segment demand between its various market channels shifted as the u s economy continued to evolve in the post pandemic environment with strong early overall demand for our products moderating as the year progressed we continue to see strong demand in our dtg2go channel and our delta direct channels regional screen print and ad specialty businesses moreover the strategic investments we ve made in our vertical manufacturing platform immediately adjacent to the u s market and our distribution network across the u s market continue to generate increased demand in our global brands and retail direct channels brand and retailer interest in the near shore and domestic sourcing and fulfillment strategies our platform offers is accelerating due not only to u s market proximity and speed but also to better risk management associated with evolving u s trade relations social environmental and sustainability priorities inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions these favorable dynamics coupled with new investment in screen print production and other value adding ancillary services as well as higher selling prices from our pass through of rising input costs manifested itself in solid sales growth in our delta group segment we were heavily impacted by strong inflationary pressures throughout our fiscal year like the rest of our industry but we were able to move quickly to capitalize on the flexibility of our vertically integrated platform and recalibrate our production to manage inventory levels and mitigate higher input cost our team did a great job of responding to the fluid environment and navigating the challenges brought on by the volatility in raw material pricing the price of cotton one of our key inputs increased almost 50 in a five month period and reached a high of over 1 50 per pound in our third quarter we started reducing our forward cotton purchase commitments as futures prices escalated beyond a level that we believe would be accepted at retail and when we saw declines in overall demand for basic t s in the fourth quarter we began reducing manufacturing output to level off our finished goods inventory these inflationary input costs of course increase the value of our inventory and put pressure on our gross margins as inventory is sold we saw this margin impact in the second half of fiscal 2022 and expect it to continue in the first half of fiscal 2023 we currently expect to operate some of our production facilities below full capacity until inventories become better aligned with market demand in fiscal year 2023 we ve seen our retail partners encounter similar challenges in managing their inventory levels to the fluctuations in consumer demand the overall economic uncertainty going into the holiday season caused by the inflationary environment has hampered replenishment orders for activewear from our mass retail partners but we continue to stay close to our partners and we ll be prepared to support demand as we progress through the first half of fiscal 2023 our dtg2go business continues to grow and solidify its leadership position in the make on demand digital printing and fulfillment through its digital first strategy achieving year over year increases in both units sold and sales revenue we ended the fiscal year with eight digital print locations six of which also operate as blank garment distribution centers and the latest technology to support dtg2go s digital first strategy is now in four locations more and more customers see the clear benefits of our digital make on demand model versus traditional inventory heavy make to forecast model particularly when coupled with our unique ability to vertically supply blank delta garments on demand our seamless blank supply reduces not only our customer s garment costs but also risk associated with adding another third party layer to their supply chain for us this model eliminates non value added costs creates a more efficient operation and lowers working capital needs while we experienced additional cost and some production delays in fiscal year 2022 as we brought new print and equipment online and worked through challenges from the tight u s labor market which depressed our margins we see both sales and margin growth potential at dtg2go going forward as selling prices continue to grow we also expect to see increased output through productivity gains additional staffing and extending operating schedules to meet demand in this high growth channel for our company we saw great success with our lifestyle brand salt life in fiscal year 2022 with over 20 growth from the prior year we are pleased with the continued demand for the salt life brand across all three legs of our omni channel go to market strategy our salt life branded retail doors continue to serve as a valuable brand awareness tool and drivers of accretive revenue we ended the year with 21 branded retail doors spread along the u s coast line and reached a milestone of eight new doors opened during the year our new location in rehoboth beach delaware is exceeding expectations and we are excited to open another six to eight salt life owned and operated stores in fiscal 2023 including an additional store in long branch new jersey to give salt life even more visibility in the northeast salt life s e commerce business was challenged by supply chain shortages in the first half of the year but was able to work through them to drive organic growth in this important market segment during the fourth quarter in addition our wholesale customers continue to promote salt life into more floor space and valuable shop in shop opportunities to drive incremental sales and increase brand awareness our other efforts to elevate the salt life brand s profile and appeal to drive increased consumer engagement were also paying off the salt life youtube channel reached 7 1 million views in fiscal 2022 a 37 increase compared to fiscal 2021 largely driven by the success of youtube shorts these short segment videos are designed to appeal to a broader audience and we target producing two to three shows per week beyond youtube salt life s social channel net audience grew nearly 85 in fiscal 2022 spanning facebook instagram twitter linkedin and pinterest we also continue to interact with our customers through salt life s online content portal the daily salt which includes published articles featuring reviews of the best gear in the industry how to articles team member travel articles and other content additionally we continue to produce our salt life podcast above and below hosted by professional surfer and salt life team member kieran anderson overall fiscal 2022 was another excellent year

performance highlight the range of our five distinct go to market strategies the widespread demand for the unique products and services we offer the flexibility and efficiencies of our vertically integrated operations and first mover advantages in digital printing and fulfillment and emotional connection that our lifestyle brand salt life has with a broad range of consumers let me now turn the

stocks to buy for beginners and 15 biggest bitcoin mining companies in the world simone walsh thank you bob for both our delta group and salt life group fiscal 2022 was another strong year and we are entering fiscal 2023 with positive momentum across many areas of our business we delivered strong top line growth of 11 year over year including 9 8 growth in the delta group and over 20 growth in the salt life group over the prior year within the delta group our three key sales channels in activewear delta direct retail direct and global brands all experienced year over year sales growth while delta direct was challenged in the second half of fiscal 2022 as a result of scale back orders particularly from mass channel activewear at large retailers we are pleased with our ability to maintain year over year sales growth in that channel and to achieve double digit sales growth in both the retail direct and brand direct sales channels on increased units and higher selling prices as a reminder in our retail direct and global brands sales channels we serve as a supply chain partner to global brands including the development of custom branded garments the provision of ancillary value adding retail ready services and shipping logistics these sales channels also serve retailers by providing our portfolio of delta delta platinum and soffe products directly to retail locations and their e commerce fulfillment centers also within the delta group our dtg2go make on demand business experienced both unit and selling price growth year over year and order flow for our digital first strategy exceeds our current capacity we are excited to continue to expand our digital first initiatives across our markets and plan additional investments in the latest digital print equipment to meet the growing customer demand in the sales channel bob shared a lot regarding salt life s engagement with consumers which drive strong direct to consumer sales for salt life and also enhances its wholesale business as consumers seek out the brand while shopping at department stores outdoor retailers resort shops specialty stores and other retail outlets with the strength of the salt life brand and growth we re experiencing in our direct to consumer channels we remain extremely excited about salt life s potential in fiscal 2023 and beyond our business is significantly influenced by the price of cotton used in our manufacturing operation during the fiscal year the elevated price and volatility negatively impacted the gross margins in our business we expect our margins to continue to be depressed in the first half of fiscal 2023 as we sell through the inventory we produced in the latter half of fiscal 2022 which was impacted by both the higher priced cotton and other elevated input costs although we took action to use less of the higher priced cotton by reducing our production we do expense additional unabsorbed fixed costs from these measures the fourth quarter reduction resulted in 1 1 million of unabsorbed expense which impacted gross margins by approximately 90 basis points for the quarter in addition we expect to take additional targeted production shutdowns and continue to operate some of our facilities below full capacity until inventories are better aligned with overall demand these adjustments are expected to result in approximately 2 million and 775 000 of additional unabsorbed expense in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2023 respectively currently with the price of cotton declining and stabilizing recently from the volatility and peak price in last year s third quarter we anticipate we will return to margin expansion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 additionally we note that our inventory on hand has increased from the prior year this increase is a result of the price of inventory escalating due to the rising input and labor costs as a result of inflationary pressures coupled with an increase in units on hand we are closely monitoring inventory levels and will continue to monitor our manufacturing output and make adjustments as necessary to align with market conditions the vast majority of our inventory consists of basic delta blank garment that we fully expect to sell through our various channels as demand arises now i ll go through a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year financial results for the fourth quarter net sales were 115 5 million compared to 114 7 million in the prior year fourth quarter with delta group sales decreasing 1 and salt life group sales up nearly 16 over the prior year fourth quarter during the fourth quarter delta group net sales declined to 101 5 million compared to 102 6 million in the prior year fourth quarter global brands growth helped to offset the softness in our retail direct channel the salt life group fourth quarter revenue grew 16 to 14 million compared to 12 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 the segment s growth was driven by organic growth across all three of its market channels wholesale retail and e commerce gross margins were 18 7 overall for the quarter compared to 23 1 in the prior year fourth quarter the 440 basis point decline was driven by higher input costs in both our activewear and dtg2go businesses as well as unbudgeted production curtailments offset by an improvement in the salt life group segment in the delta group gross margins were 14 1 for the fourth quarter a decline from the prior fourth quarter margins of 20 2 gross margins were mostly negatively impacted by higher cost inventory flowing through cost of sales including elevated cotton energy dyes and chemicals freight and labor costs as bob mentioned we started reducing production of basic tees in the september quarter which resulted in 1 1 million of unabsorbed fixed costs expensed in our fourth quarter our plan to reduce production further in the first half of fiscal 2023 until inventories get in better alignment will result in additional unabsorbed fixed costs impacting our gross margin the salt life group segment s gross margins improved to 51 8 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to 48 in the prior year fourth quarter resulting from a favorable mix of sales including increased salt life branded retail store sets selling general and administrative expenses sg a were 19 8 million in the quarter increasing 170 basis points to 17 2 of sales this increase was primarily driven by a higher percentage of our sales coming through the salt life retail stores and increased distribution labor costs across all of our business operations as a result operating profits were 2 2 million or 1 9 of sales declining from 10 1 million or 8 8 of sales in the prior year quarter other income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 0 5 million this is substantially made up of valuation changes in our contingent consideration liabilities of 0 6 million associated with the acquisition of dtg2go in the prior fiscal fourth quarter other income was 1 3 million driven primarily by a valuation change in the dtg2go contingent consideration liability of 1 2 million interest expense was 2 4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 up from the prior year fourth fiscal quarter expense of 1 6 million due primarily to higher debt levels overall we incurred a net loss for the september 2022 quarter of 0 3 million or negative 0 04 per diluted share as compared to net income of 6 8 million or 0 96 per diluted share in the prior year now turning to our full fiscal year results for the full 2022 fiscal year net sales increased 11 to 484 9 million with almost 10 growth in the delta group and approximately 21 growth in the salt life group over the prior year for the delta group net sales for fiscal 2022 were 424 8 million up from 387 million in the prior year for salt life net sales were 60 1 million up 10 3 million from the prior year net sales of 49 7 million in the comparable period gross profit increased 6 8 to 108 8 million with gross margins contracting 90 basis points to 22 4 of sales driven by a decrease in the delta group segment of 190 basis points that was partially offset by an improvement of 370 basis points in the salt life group within the delta group gross margins were 18 3 compared to 20 2 in the prior year with the decline driven by increasing input and labor costs as well as production curtailments in the salt life segment gross margins grew 51 6 of sales from 47 9 in the prior year driven by sales channel mix and higher selling prices sg a expenses were 79 5 million in the fiscal year 2022 or 16 4 of sales a decline of 20 basis points from the prior year overall the increased input costs coupled with slightly increased sg a expenses resulted in 31 8 million in operating profit or a 6 6 operating margin in the prior year operating profit was 32 7 million or a 7 5 operating margin other income of 2 4 million in 2022 included 0 9 million in profits related to our honduran equity method investment as well as 1 9 million in income from the net reduction in contingent consideration liability offset by a loss on disposable fixed assets of 0 4 million in the prior year other income of 1 6 million included 0 5 million of profits related to our honduran equity method investment as well as 2 4 million of income from the net reduction in contingent consideration liability partially offset by 1 3 million of expenses related to the two hurricanes that disrupted our honduran manufacturing facilities in the prior year december quarter interest expense was 7 7 million in fiscal 2022 up from the prior year interest expense of 6 8 million due primarily to higher debt levels our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was 17 9 down from the prior year effective tax rate of 21 9 as a result our net income for fiscal 2022 was 19 7 million on just under 7 1 million shares these earnings translated to 2 80 per diluted share compared to the prior year net income of 20 3 million or 2 86 per diluted share net debt including capitalized financing and cash on hand was 170 6 million at year end cash on hand and availability under our u s revolving credit facility totaled 34 6 million total inventory at year end was 248 5 million compared to 161 7 million a year ago when the market was generally in a low inventory position the year over year inventory expansion reflects both higher input costs impacting materials transportation and labor and an increase in units on hand we continue to work across the delta group to balance our manufacturing output with demand and appropriately manage on hand inventory during the fiscal year we invested approximately 20 million in capital expenditures this capital spending was mainly focused on digital print equipment to support our dtg2go business retail store openings and information technology initiatives we have completed our planned manufacturing expansion projects for our delta group also in fiscal 2023 we plan to further invest in salt life s retail location openings and continue to focus on improving manufacturing efficiency we will also continue to invest in additional digital print capacity in fiscal 2022 the company purchased 136 181 shares for 4 million under the previously announced share repurchase program bringing the total amount repurchased to 56 4 million over the life of the program at the end of fiscal 2022 the company had 3 6 million of remaining repurchase capacity under its existing board authorization looking forward to 2023 we expect to see continued growth in our retail direct and global brand channels which should be moderated by slower sales in our delta direct channel in the first half of the year due primarily to a rebalancing of replenishment orders for activewear from large mass retailers as inventories continue to work their way through the channel we expect the activewear business to achieve sales in the first half of 2023 comparable to the prior year and anticipate growth in the back half of the year as mass market demand strengthens as we head into the all important holiday season we expect to see another year of strong year over year sales growth for dtg2go at salt life we expect the growth in our direct to consumer channel to continue and anticipate another year of overall double digit sales growth in fiscal 2023 as referenced earlier with the price of cotton declining and stabilizing recently from the volatility and peak price in q3 fiscal 2022 we currently anticipate a return to margin expansion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 sg a cost drivers are expected to remain consistent in the first half of fiscal year 2023 commensurate with our sales expectations and we expect to have greater sg a leverage in the second half of the year we look forward to updating you as the year progresses i will now turn the call back over to bob for some final remarks bob humphreys thanks simone we are moving into fiscal year 2023 with positive momentum across many aspects of our business but also with uncertainty across the apparel industry and the economy at large we will continue to leverage the flexibility our vertical manufacturing platform gives us to adjust production levels to meet demand and expect to manage our working capital and capital expenditures similarly as the year progresses we have successfully operated through periods of economic ambiguity in the past and believe that our diversified distribution channels and wide range of customer touch points should position us well to take advantage of market opportunities as they may arise we ll be ready to move quickly decisively and in the best interest of all of our stakeholders and now we ll be glad to open up the call for any questions q a session follow delta apparel inc nyse dla follow delta apparel inc nyse dla or subscribe with google we may use your email to send marketing emails about our services click here to read our privacy policy operator our first question comes from the line of dana telsey with telsey advisory please proceed with your question dana telsey hi good afternoon bob and simone as you think about the market trajectory going towards the fourth quarter what the tailwinds and headwinds could be to potentially impacted whether it s from our material costs or other costs from freight cost i mean can you bucket our gross margin and sg a tailwinds and headwinds and frankly going into 20 the following year do we get back to the previous level margins or what do you think the trajectory could be thank you bob humphreys dana we weren t getting about every other word there would you mind repeating that slowly dana telsey sure just wondering on the margin trajectory if we go through the year what would be the tailwinds and headwinds and as you look forward past next fiscal year would you be able to attain what your previous year s operating margins were what are the hindrances and the opportunities to meet or exceed that thank you bob humphreys so i think as we go through fiscal 23 you know the headwinds are going to be higher priced raw materials and other input costs that will be flowing through our cost of sales and particularly cotton and higher labor cost in particularly our distribution centers dtg2go s domestic operations and i think the tailwinds are strong consumer demand for many parts of our business and demand for our service levels that we can provide on blank t shirts and also on decorated t shirt so you know our dtg2go business is continuing to grow strongly both in unit growth and average selling price out the door and i would expect this first quarter of fiscal 23 to be an all time record of revenue for a quarter in our dtg2go business and of course we saw a strong growth in our salt life business last year and expect that to continue into this year so i think both of those two things will be tailwinds for you know our company and our revenue and profitability in the years to come we do think another headwind this year as we are taking production time down in our manufacturing facilities and we expense that as we go so we did that in the fourth quarter as we just mentioned and we ll do more in the second quarter and then a likelihood in our third quarter and then get back to running our manufacturing facilities more full and absorbing more fixed cost and leveraging that fixed cost so anyway i think those are the main drivers of those simone you got anything else you want to add there simone walsh i ll just add then i think in terms of the supply chain overall we are seeing those fuel surcharges have gone away so that is helpful i think if you look though at freight northbound and southbound from the u s into central america there are still elevated freight costs that we have in the supply chain encouragingly out of asia those freight costs have come down so that is also helpful you referenced sg a as well i think that you will see over the course of the year the biggest driver of dollar cost in our sg a expense is opening retail stores so we opened eight stores during the year and those store costs and operating costs lease expenses are all in sg a so you ll see that also dana telsey thank you operator our next question comes from the line of peter johnson a private investor please proceed with your question unidentified analyst yes good afternoon can you give us a little bit of an update on the fanatics opportunity

factors that could impact our actual results with that i ll now turn the call over to kim kim ryan thank you sam and good morning everyone thanks for joining us today as we review our fiscal year 2022 performance and provide our outlook to fiscal year 2023 2022 was a pivotal year for hillenbrand and we made significant progress in executing our strategy to grow as a world class global industrial company with a portfolio of highly engineered mission critical processing technologies and solutions and leading global brands that serve customers throughout the lifetime of our equipment in our q1 earnings call which was my first after officially taking over as ceo i communicated several key priorities for the year first to ensure our company culture values and working norms were aligned to the needs of the evolving workforce second to successfully complete the milacron integration and finally to drive continued growth for hillenbrand through innovation new product development and strategic acquisitions we made tremendous progress on these priorities and now i ll cover some of our highlights in june we introduced our company s purpose shape what matters for tomorrow which serves as the foundation of our culture and unites all of our associates around the globe through a shared vision of how we can drive a positive impact in the world through our people our products and our partnerships internally our associates have taken ownership of our purpose which they helped to create it s been truly inspiring to watch the organization embed this purpose and our unified core values into our culture externally purpose is demonstrated in our recent acquisition of herbold meckesheim and also by the progress we have made in increasing our transparency through additional disclosures around energy emissions and de i and by forging key partnerships with organizations like the american heart association girls inc and net impact just to name a few of the ways this purpose influences our company in addition i recently signed the united nations women s empowerment principles as another step in our commitment to advance gender diversity and equality in our company industry and the broader community turning to the milacron integration next week we ll reach the end of the third and final year of the integration program as we announced last quarter we achieved and have since surpassed our target of 75 million in run rate cost synergies ahead of schedule i m very proud of the commitment our teams displayed as they worked tirelessly in pursuit of achieving our goals and creating significant value for the company as you know this integration used the hillenbrand operating model to build a scalable foundation for functions like finance it and hr as well as global engineering and supply chain that is leveraged by the entire enterprise we believe the hom is a key success factor that enables us to drive continuous improvement in our existing businesses and accelerated growth and value realization in our acquisitions now turning to performance highlights despite significant macro headwinds from inflation supply chain disruptions and foreign currency throughout the year we achieved record levels for revenue and adjusted ebitda in our industrial segments in fiscal year 2022 our molding technology solutions segment had annual revenue and margin expansion that came in near the high end of our expectations and while we did see a slowdown in orders in the fourth quarter largely due to the rise in global macro uncertainty we are entering fiscal 2023 with a strong backlog we re closely monitoring the demand environment as well as the continued zero covid policy situation in china and are taking appropriate action to protect overall margins bob will cover this when he discusses our financial performance and outlook in our advanced process solutions segment we entered fiscal 2023 with another record level of backlog providing us confidence and visibility in this uncertain operating environment as discussed last quarter we saw some delays in customer decision timing but finished strong with a record q4 order performance on an fx adjusted basis and we continue to see solid order pipeline for our large plastic systems aftermarket parts and service and our food recycling applications last month several of our teams across aps and mts attended the k fair in dusseldorf germany the world s largest plastics convention each of our participating businesses saw a significant amount of lead and quote volume coming out of the show which is a testament to the strength of this industry as evolving trends around durable plastics and especially sustainability provide a tailwind for long term demand in both our mts and aps segment in particular we have received considerable interest in the expanded recycling capabilities we can now bring to the market as a result of our acquisition of herbold meckesheim herbold is a leader in the front end of the recycling process with technologies that separate shred fine grind wash and dry recycled plastic which can then be fed through our coperion feeding and extrusion equipment to be made back into plastic pallets these plastic pallets can then be extruded or molded into products by our injection molding extrusion and hot runner equipment which are all fully equipped to process recycled content to create high quality more sustainable products this circularity within the plastics value chain is a perfect example of how our business helps to shape what matters for tomorrow we re excited to share more details with you as a coperion and herbold teams continue their integration and leverage our combined technologies to create enhanced customer solutions to serve this fast growing end market now turning to our recent acquisitions in food yesterday in our earnings release we announced the tuck in acquisition of peerless a premier supplier of industrial food processing equipment which is expected to close before the end of the calendar year together with the coperion linxis group and gabler brands we anticipate our total food and pharma revenue to be over 400 million now providing meaningful scale and balance to our portfolio we re excited about the opportunities ahead of us from bringing together the complementary technologies across these brands to drive enhanced value propositions for our customers to the improved operational efficiency we expect to achieve through the deployment of the hillenbrand operating model since closing the linxis transaction in early october our integration teams have been working quickly together and are on track to drive synergy realization we re confident in our ability to effectively integrate and improve our combined businesses as we have proven before through the successful integrations at milacron and before that coperion in total including peerless we executed our disciplined m a strategy to deploy approximately 740 million towards these acquisitions expanding our position in complementary end markets with attractive long term growth characteristics where we believe our highly engineered mission critical processing capabilities and engineering expertise create a compelling opportunity to win we believe these actions position hillenbrand for continued long term growth and shareholder value creation finally before i turn the call over to bob to cover our financial details and outlook i want to touch briefly on the status of batesville s strategic alternatives review the process remains ongoing and we are confident the final outcome will be the best result for our associates our customers and our shareholders we will provide additional updates as appropriate with that i ll now turn the call over to bob to cover our financial performance and outlook see also 10 best immunotherapy stocks to invest in and 10 best indian stocks to buy for short term bob vanhimbergen thanks kim and good morning everyone turning to slide 6 as a reminder throughout my section i will be discussing our performance compared to the prior year on a pro forma basis which has been adjusted for the divestitures of abel red valve and terrasource global from the advanced process solutions segment we believe this view provides a clear assessment of our performance and you will find a reconciliation of reported and pro forma results in the appendix of the earnings slide deck in our fourth quarter we delivered revenue of 750 million an increase of 1 compared to the prior year or 7 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange this growth was led by pricing and higher volume in our molding technology solutions and advanced process solutions segments partially offset by lower volume in batesville adjusted ebitda of 135 million decreased 3 but increased 3 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange as favorable pricing and productivity improvements along with higher industrial volume more than offset inflation lower batesville volume and an increase in strategic investments adjusted ebitda margin of 18 decreased 80 basis points primarily due to the dilutive effect of price cost and lower volume in batesville we reported gaap net income of 57 million or 0 81 per share an increase of 9 compared to the prior year adjusted earnings per share of 1 05 came in slightly above the high end of our expectations and was 0 05 or 5 higher than the prior year as favorable pricing productivity higher volume in our industrial segments and lower shares outstanding were partially offset by inflation lower batesville volume and the impact of foreign currency exchange the adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 27 9 we had cash flow from operations of 97 million in the quarter an increase of 13 year over year primarily due to higher customer advances and timing of cash paid for taxes partially offset by an increase in inventory capital expenditures were 18 million in the quarter which was in line with expectations now moving to segment performance on slide 7 aps revenue of 328 million was approximately flat compared to the prior year but up 11 excluding the impact of foreign currency primarily driven by favorable pricing and higher volume of aftermarket parts and services adjusted ebitda of 69 million decreased 1 year over year but increased 9 excluding the impact of foreign currency as pricing and productivity improvements and higher volume were partially offset by inflation and strategic investments adjusted ebitda margin of 20 9 was essentially flat as the dilutive effect of price cost mostly offset productivity and operating leverage from higher volume record backlog of 1 4 billion increased 6 compared to the prior year or 22 excluding the impact of foreign currency driven by strong order volume for large plastic projects record aftermarket orders and the acquisition of herbold looking forward as kim mentioned the project pipeline remains healthy as we continue to see good demand for our leading products and solutions across the key end markets we serve turning to molding technology solutions on slide 8 quarterly revenue of 276 million increased 6 year over year or 11 excluding the impact of foreign currency primarily driven by favorable pricing and higher volume for injection molding equipment adjusted ebitda of 60 million increased 11 compared to the prior year or 16 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange while adjusted ebitda margins of 21 6 increased 100 basis points as pricing and productivity improvements and operating leverage from higher volume more than offset inflation backlog of 364 million was essentially flat compared to the prior year or up 3 excluding the impact of foreign currency and still remains at historically strong levels as kim mentioned order volume slowed in q4 due to a delay in customer decisions resulting from the increasing macro uncertainty we expect these customer delays to negatively impact orders and revenue through at least the first half of fiscal 2023 which i ll discuss further when i cover our outlook in response to the slowdown in orders in our mts segment we have taken measures towards containing discretionary costs only hiring for critical roles and a prioritization of key investments additionally our global supply management organization remains focused on optimizing our global supply chain costs while the continued deployment of the hillenbrand operating model drives further operational efficiencies particularly within our injection molding product line now turning to batesville on slide 9 compared to the prior year revenue of 146 million decreased 6 due to lower burial casket volume resulting from an estimated decrease in deaths associated with the declining effects of the covid 19 pandemic and an estimated increase in the rate at which families opted for cremation this decrease was partially offset by the price surcharges implemented earlier in the year to offset the significant increase in commodity costs adjusted ebitda of 24 million decreased 28 and adjusted ebitda margin of 16 6 declined 500 basis points due to the dilutive effect of price cost and lower volume margin in the quarter came in below expectations but we still anticipate the normalized margins for this business to be approximately 20 as we have communicated previously now i will briefly cover full year results on slide 10 consolidated revenue of 2 94 billion increased 5 over the prior year or 9 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange aps revenue of 1 27 billion increased 8 or 14 excluding currency exchange and mts revenue of 1 05 billion grew 5 or 8 excluding currency exchange batesville revenue of 626 million was roughly flat year over year largely due to the commodity price surcharges which offset lower volume total backlog of 1 76 billion increased 5 or 18 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange with approximately 75 of the backlog expected to convert over the next 12 months as we head into fiscal 2023 the macro environment remains challenging but our business has shown its resiliency and our strong backlog provides us confidence as we move forward adjusted ebitda of 527 million decreased 1 compared to the prior year but increased 3 excluding the impact of foreign currency as pricing and productivity improvements and higher volume in aps and mts were partially offset by inflation lower batesville volume and an increase in strategic investments adjusted ebitda margin of 17 9 decreased 110 basis points primarily due to the dilutive effect of price cost coverage adjusted ebitda margin for aps of 19 6 increased 10 basis points while adjusted ebitda margin for mts of 20 7 increased 40 basis points batesville s adjusted ebitda margin of 20 3 decreased 540 basis points due to the dilutive effect of price cost coverage and lower volume gaap net income of 209 million or 2 89 per share decreased from 3 31 in the prior year primarily due to the prior year gain of the sale of abel adjusted earnings per share of 3 93 increased 0 14 or 4 compared to the prior year as pricing and productivity improvements higher industrial volume and lower shares outstanding were partially offset by inflation lower batesville volume unfavorable foreign currency exchange and an increase in strategic investments the adjusted effective tax rate for the year was 29 1 we generated operating cash flow for the year of 191 million down 337 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the unfavorable timing of working capital related to large plastic projects and an increase in inventory due to higher customer demand and supply chain disruptions while cash flow was lower this year our three year average conversion remains at approximately 120 and our underlying working capital processes continue to be healthy with working capital turns over 8 turns looking forward we re confident in our ability to average 100 conversion and drive roughly 10 times working capital turns over the long term capital expenditures for the year were 50 million while we expect capex to be higher in fiscal 2023 due to the catch up effect of supplier delays we ve experienced in fiscal 2021 and 2022 we will be actively monitoring the demand environment and prioritize investments accordingly in the case of an increased or prolonged market softness now turning to the balance sheet on slide 11 net debt at the end of the fourth quarter was 988 million and the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio was 1 8 at quarter end we had liquidity of approximately 1 1 billion including 234 million in cash on hand and the remainder available under our revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan facility as we previously announced we closed the linxis transaction on october 6 upon close of the peerless transaction and including the debt incurred for the acquisition of linxis we expect pro forma net leverage to be approximately 2 8 with liquidity of approximately 555 million turning to slide 12 as you know we have a proven track record of deleveraging following acquisitions and with the increase in leverage from our recent acquisitions we plan to prioritize debt reduction until we return comfortably within our guardrails of 1 7 to 2 7 times net leverage which we expect to achieve by the end of fiscal 2023 moving to capital deployment on slide 13 we returned approximately 266 million to shareholders during the year with 62 million of that through our quarterly dividends and 204 million through the repurchase of approximately 4 8 million shares including approximately 900 000 shares for 37 million in our fourth quarter as we enter fiscal year 2023 we will be focused on reducing debt while also continuing to make strategic investments for long term growth and operational efficiency such as automation but we will be cautious as we monitor the overall demand environment now let me conclude my prepared remarks with our fiscal 2023 outlook on slide 14 our guidance will be on an organic basis excluding fx impacts and a total basis including the acquisitions of linxis herbold and gabler and the impacts of fx we have not yet closed the peerless transaction but do not anticipate it to have a material impact on our guidance as a basis for our outlook we enter the year with record backlog and continued strength in our aps segment including strong momentum in our aftermarket business however we expect order and revenue softness for our mts segment to persist through at least the first half of the fiscal year but at this time we are not incorporating a broad based recession into our guidance we also expect foreign currency headwinds to be more pronounced in the first half of the fiscal year while supply chain disruptions and inflation have moderated slightly we still expect it to be some time before these issues resolve we expect full year revenue of 3 3 billion to 3 4 billion up 11 to 16 which represents organic growth of 3 to 6 a contribution from acquisitions of 12 to 13 offset by a foreign currency headwind of roughly 3 we re providing a wide range for adjusted eps to reflect the potential impacts of the global macro uncertainty as a result we expect full year adjusted earnings per share in the range of 4 10 to 4 50 with the second half of the fiscal year expected to be stronger than the first half we expect free cash flow as a percent of adjusted net income to be approximately 100 for the year with capex of approximately 70 million now to our full year segment outlook starting with advanced process solutions we expect full year revenue to be 1 66 billion to 1 74 billion up 31 to 37 representing organic growth of 9 to 13 primarily driven by continued strength in large plastic projects as well as solid growth in aftermarket revenue additionally we expect a contribution of 28 to 30 from acquisitions and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 6 we expect adjusted ebitda margin of 19 to 20 organic margin is anticipated to be up roughly 60 basis points to 100 basis points as previously discussed the acquired businesses are dilutive to segment margins but we fully anticipate to bring these margins in line over time as we integrate and drive synergy realization to the deployment of the hillenbrand operating model we assume relatively normal seasonality throughout the year with the first quarter being our lowest quarter and fourth quarter being our highest turning to molding technology solutions we expect full year revenue to be down 2 to up 1 including a foreign currency headwind of approximately 2 given the strong backlog we expect moderate growth in injection molding products while our quicker turn hot runner product line will be more heavily impacted by the current market situation resulting in a modest decline year over year we expect adjusted ebitda margin of 20 to 21 compared to 20 7 in fiscal 2022 primarily due to unfavorable mix from a higher proportion of injection molding equipment which comes at a lower relative margin as mentioned we expect a softer first half compared to the second half for batesville we expect revenue to be down 2 to 4 due to an anticipated decline in burial volume largely due to the impact of the omicron variant in the first half of fiscal 2022 which contributed to nearly 300 000 covid 19 deaths in north america during that period this volume decline is largely offset by the carryover of the surcharges we implemented starting in fiscal q2 of last year we expect adjusted ebitda margin of 19 5 to 20 5 down 30 basis points at the mid point primarily due to lower volume partially offset by productivity actions we expect price cost coverage to be relatively neutral for the year for phasing we anticipate a tougher year over year comparison in the first half largely due to the decline in volume and higher expected level of inflation now given the macroeconomic uncertainty we are providing a q1 guidance range for adjusted eps of 0 85 to 0 93 this is down moderately from the prior year primarily due to lower volume in batesville as a result of the impact of the omicron variant in the prior year and lower volume in mts particularly for high margin hot runner product line due to customer order delays this will be partially offset by eps growth and lower shares outstanding we expect a contribution of approximately 0 06 from acquisitions in the quarter net of interest which is offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange please review slide 14 for additional guidance assumptions overall heading into fiscal 2023 we have strong backlog and a solid pipeline within our aps segment which will help mitigate the order softness we re experiencing in our mts segment we continue to be focused on investing for growth and delivering world class solutions to our customers in a variety of growing end markets while utilizing the hillenbrand operating model to help us navigate through the difficult global environment our teams have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to execute through challenging circumstances and i am confident that we will continue to drive sustainable improvements that will create long term value for our shareholders while remaining nimble in deploying our downturn playbook to contain costs in response to a broader market downturn scenario and now i ll turn the call back over to kim kim ryan thanks bob i ll end our discussion with a few final remarks before taking questions we continue to operate in a dynamic and challenging macro environment as i mentioned we remain vigilant towards the external environment and we are taking appropriate action to protect the business in the short term while not sacrificing our long term opportunity for growth our backlog remains at record levels and we remain intensely focused on deploying the hillenbrand operating model to help our teams effectively guide and execute through these challenging global times guided by our purpose shape what matters for tomorrow we continue to invest in innovative solutions that help our customers solve their most difficult problems and we re confident that we re taking the right steps to further position hillenbrand to drive long term

president to the call and doug will have some comments in just a few minutes so welcome doug as stated in the press release we are pleased with our sales volume productivity improvements and market share gains the consumer demand for our offering is high and as credit continues to tighten we expect demand to increase even more absent consumer affordability challenges our volume and profit opportunities would be higher we will be ready to support the expected increase in customers that we will see in the future our long term outlook for the business and our place in the market is solid and the investments we re making will ensure that we continue to be the clear leader in our segment advertisement advertisement we re excited about the addition of key leaders to our experienced and dedicated team who will be vital in our efforts going forward we have great cultural fits with a mix of specific industry knowledge and experience and we re very excited about the initiatives and process and the opportunities we have to take the company to the next level as for gross margin external factors are clinging to our results supply and demand imbalances have continued and resulted in a shortage of vehicles in our price categories inflationary pressures with parts labor logistics and all indirect cost of sales are contributing to this difficult operating environment but even in this market we expect to be performing at a much higher level as we move forward due diligence with buying shipping and repairing vehicles we did not pass along all of our costs and our selling prices to consumers overall having an approximate 200 basis point negative effect on gross margin percentages for the quarter additionally significant wholesale drag resulted from quality challenges due to product shortages our inability to get repairs process timely for cars that were designated for retail but because of delays and capacity issues ended up they hope to and the decrease in wholesale prices for older model cars which began in the early summer months overall our wholesale challenges had another negative 200 basis point effect on overall gross margin percentages with our retail and service contract price adjustments mentioned in the press release we expect to recapture this gross margin percentage over time as we move forward and the market conditions normalize our corporate procurement efforts are designed to supply our dealerships with most of their product needs at good prices in retail ready condition allowing our talented and dedicated dealership staff led by the general managers to spend their time working on the business and profitably growing the number of customers we serve when a portion of cars show up to dealerships not retail ready the direct negative effects are seeing broadly valuable management time is lost reconditioning costs increase wholesale losses are higher and repossessions increase improved procurement and inventory management provides significant indirect opportunities for efficiencies including increased turns better utilization of data and leveraging the centralization of key functions such as wholesale management titles and logistics we did bring inventory down by 15 million in the quarter and with tax time just around the corner this will allow us to move our product out efficiently as we go forward we will be increasing turns as we move forward at the end of the day our most important opportunity as the company is leveraging our size and scale and supplying our customers with affordable mechanically sound vehicles while minimizing a lot level time and effort in car related friction points along with the expectation that used vehicle prices will continue to level off and decrease we expect to be taking significant costs out of our procurement channels while at the same time improving quality while leveraging strong partnerships throughout the chain specifically reconditioning partners advertisement advertisement our centralization efforts have been directed at gaining scale in procurement hr it collections and eliminating manual processes that can be performed more efficiently and effectively by a dedicated group of less turnover examples include certain collection processes title processing procurement logistics customer insurance tracking online sales accident protection plan product claims administration all this with the goal of freeing up time at the dealership to increase productivity by serving more customers since 2019 we estimate that we re investing from 5 million to 10 million more annually in corporate sg a to support our erp crm and los efforts and projects and other centralization initiatives this is really at the heart of the initiatives i mentioned earlier and described in our press release we have the opportunity to serve more customers add efficiencies throughout the organization remove tasks from the field and offer better more affordable vehicles that is also a focus in the senior talent that we ve added to our team and we re excited i m excited for the enhancements that they will make and have already begun to make to our company as to credit losses as mentioned in the press release credit losses are higher than anticipated as inflation continues to run at extremely high levels affecting our customers disproportionately at present losses have simply reverted to historical levels after a sustained period of below average losses we ve been the canary in the coal mine with credit losses due to how close we are to the ground that being said it does appear likely that industry credit losses by reference to 60 plus past due delinquencies and subprime used auto could be much higher down the road for competition we are seeing competition scaling back and even closing locations something we ve not seen in many years in our industry and of course that creates tremendous opportunity for us we do expect net charge off levels to level off as the competitive landscape for credit continues to tighten we are strengthening our deal structures to help more customers succeed with vehicle prices coming down some our procurement efforts improving quickly and the los rolling out we will be in a great spot to pick up higher credit quality customers as we ve seen during prior recessionary periods while we hope for the best and prepare for the worst we do expect inflation to come down over time from all time highs that we ve seen recently alleviating some of the intense pressure on consumers although this is not a requirement for us to resume earning above average returns we spent 37 million on long term capital expenditures over the last 18 months approximately 10 million of that is it related and the remainder is primarily related to store relocations remodels and rebranding upgrades we ve opened 3 new store locations completed significant remodels at 6 locations and relocated 6 dealerships with 1 more in process the expenditures have been made at locations that have the potential to serve significantly more customers that did not have the physical facilities to allow for it advertisement advertisement our physical facilities are very important in attracting the best associates and the better credit customers and we ve had some catch up to do recently we are confident that capital expenditures have appropriate returns and will lead to greater volume and productivity measures and we ve been pleased with our results we ve had great success with a limited number of acquisitions we made and we believe we will see more opportunities come our way as conditions in the industry become more difficult we are excited about this opportunity we believe there are good operators that would love to join our team and in his new position steve taylor is the perfect person to lead this effort and effectively making contacts we can and will do better as we ve done for 40 years our industry is one of the most dramatic and rapid changes that we ve seen in our lifetimes we have numerous tools at our disposal and we re confident that we re in a far better position than the vast majority of our competition to succeed over the long term that said we recognize that our job is to earn consistently high returns and we will not hesitate to make changes required that allow us to earn appropriate returns in any environment and we will continue to adapt thank you and i will now turn it over to doug doug doug campbell thanks jeff and good morning everyone it s nice to be with you today i ll start with some color on why i chose america s car mart there are many reasons but are limited to the biggest drivers in my decision making process first is the opportunity regarding the buying and selling of vehicles and associated logistics it s an area within car mart that has tremendous opportunity and the potential to drive significant cost savings i have over 25 years of experience in both the automotive retail and wholesale sectors of our industry my most recent role in leading both the acquisition and disposal of vehicles for one of the largest fleets in the world should align nicely with the work in front of us and proven valuable for our collective futures second was a belief that it was the right for my wife and 2 children northwest arkansas and a fantastic place to raise a family they re looking forward to the transition in the upcoming months and becoming part of the northwest arkansas community lastly with the culture of the company and what drives them over their 40 year history they have remained disciplined in their purpose to help people which is capturing their mission vision and values there is strong alignment here between the company and me i know it sounds somewhat cliche but one of the more difficult attributes of an organization is the development and the perpetuation of a strong culture in my first couple of weeks here i ve had a chance to spend time with both leaders in the field and at headquarters which is only bolstered in support of my decision to come here advertisement advertisement i m very fortunate to become part of what is already a fantastic team and enhance these cultural elements i want to now shift over to some comments jeff has mentioned over the last couple of quarters about the investment in areas of the business as it relates to the centralization of certain functions the leveraging of data and inventory i ll briefly take the opportunity to touch on some of these initiatives in more detail now i ll start with inventory over time we ve been transitioning inventory procurement from our stores with local purchasing agents to larger vendors who help both acquire and prep the units for sale we re now centralizing some of those efforts by launching several pilots to both scale the acquisition and reconditioning of vehicles with strategic partners who have a footprint that closely aligns in the markets we operate units out of these production environments will have improved quality consistency and overall lower cost during the quarter we re seeing initial results that look promising and meaningful in terms of reducing the cost of sale of these assets we re still looking at how we might leverage associated financial benefits as we could utilize those savings to increase gross profit margins and or grow market share all while reducing the incidents of credit losses in the future getting these retail ready inventory units ready for our stores is essential and leveraging these partnerships in a challenging environment should work in our favor lastly it will represent a significant increase in our overall procurement capacity allowing for future growth while creating additional bandwidth for our operators of our stores more to come about this in the future we re still in our preliminary stages of the pilot but are optimistic regarding their outcomes i ll pivot it now over to the los or loan origination system customers come to us primarily for credit our new los is designed to increase our funnel of potential customers by giving them a great online application experience with loan pre approvals in hand our current platform alis has served us well for several decades although it s gone through several iterations we know the data collected on both vehicle and customer performance has not been fully optimized with respect to qualifying scoring or approving our customers this was some of the rationale in creating a modernized platform with the obvious benefits of being faster leveraging our historical information while consolidating some of the systems we use became evident throughout its development that it also serves as an opportunity of future proof certain parts of our business as it relates to digital retailing while most of our customers aren t asking for some of the functionality that s being introduced in the marketplace today we wanted to ensure that we can participate in those areas if needed our aim in the short term is to move the application and approval process online and have the customers time spent at the dealership around product selection and test drives more functionality can and will be introduced over time but i d like to focus on what we ve launched during the quarter regarding the los we launched our pilot of our los in the month of september with 9 of our stores in october we activated an additional 27 stores enabling nearly 1 4 of our locations to utilize the new los and their customers to have an improved online experience advertisement advertisement the pilot phase of the los is having the following benefits a large part of our existing business is generating traffic for our stores through our online credit application portal the stores will then reach out to customers as more qualifying questions and then set appointments the new los is now prequalifying and preapproving customers without the interaction from the stores once preapproved we can centrally schedule these appointments on behalf of the stores this would allow the stores to leverage our resources in a differentiated way and create capacity to serve more customers and spend that time on collections and other business critical efforts two is an important metric is the submission of an oca or online credit application it s a measurement of digital traffic that will mature into floor traffic but has also acted as a lead generator for our stores a kpi we ve tracked over time is a conversion ratio of credit applications to sales and we utilize this to augment advertising dollars or to drive more traffic when needed for the stores that are on the pilot online application sale ratios have shown meaningful increases we re also seeing a level of enthusiasm from our customers who are arriving at our lots who are now powered with these pre approvals and retail locations while the concept of preapproving customers is not new it s unique within this cohort of credit quality and financial demographic of customer this will be an essential tool for market share growth as new customers entering from the upper end of our credit spectrum might be accustomed to this level of both visibility and service it also serves as a differentiator from many of our current competitors and allows us to compete with these upper funnel customers who might have more options available to them lastly is around the consolidation of stores currently are using a couple of separate systems to perform the underwriting function during the sales process does require a certain level of proficiency to operate and can be problematic with employee turnover traffic environment our new system is now consolidating and simplifying its operation by integrating those external tools needed with apis in a faster overall operating system all these benefits will make it quicker and easier to get approval and declination decisions while maintaining a higher level of business continuity and provide the ability to perform regression analysis on customers who did not back from us we look forward to updating you in the future quarters as we progress and i ll now turn it over to vickie to cover both sales and financial results vickie advertisement advertisement see also 10 best passive income stocks to invest in and 10 best mlp stocks to buy now vickie judy thank you doug and good morning everyone a 13 increase in the retail sales price combined with a 30 increase in interest income drove a 24 revenue increase over the prior year quarter additionally while many of our competitors are down in volumes we had a 7 sales volume increase our per store productivity improved to 34 4 or 5 over the prior year quarter as jeff and doug both mentioned this demonstrates the demand for our product even in a tough environment and the results of some of our investments that we ve been making the gross profit dollars per unit increased slightly to 6 132 and the gross profit percentage was 32 1 down from the sequential quarter at 34 4 this decrease primarily resulted from increased costs for repair parts transportation fees fuel costs and other cost of sales expenses and declining wholesale prices and some internal efficiencies in our inventory and procurement also contributed to this margin decline for the current quarter net charge offs as a percentage of receivables despite the recent increased frequency of losses were at 5 8 this was in line with our prior 5 year average and below our 10 year average of 6 3 for second quarter this compared to 4 4 in the prior year quarter for a historical comparison pre pandemic net charge offs were also 5 8 for the quarter ended 10 31 19 the primary driver of the increased charge offs was an increased frequency of losses but we also experienced a smaller increase in the relative severity of losses the declining wholesale prices had an effect as well recovery rates decreased about 50 basis points to just under 30 as the credit environment normalizes and credit above us tightens now is the time that we need to work with our customers to keep them in their car and on the road our dealerships will be focused on this especially as we approach the holidays over the third quarter and the upcoming income tax refund time our accounts 30 plus past due was at 3 6 compared to 4 in the prior year quarter and in line with historical quarters pre pandemic and 3 5 at 10 31 19 total collections were up over 12 to 151 million and total collections per active customer per month were up 6 to 514 we added 74 million of finance receivable principal balance during the quarter and 290 million over the last 12 months this growth results in a larger provision requirement and a resulting higher credit loss reserve on the balance sheet our deferred revenue from ancillary products is at 107 million and an increased 31 million during the last 12 months advertisement advertisement the average originating contract term for the quarter was 42 6 months compared to 39 7 for the prior year quarter and down slightly to 42 8 months sequentially the average selling price was up 2 099 with a 2 9 increase in the term compared to the prior year second quarter we did see a slight decrease in the average selling price sequentially we continue to remain focused on strong underwriting and we were able to reduce terms slightly as prices moderate our weighted average contract term for the entire portfolio including modifications was 44 8 months compared to 40 for the prior year and the weighted average age of the portfolio increased 10 from approximately 8 4 months to 9 3 months this demonstrates our ability to work with customers and keep them on the road our sg a spend increased 5 8 million over the prior year quarter sg a was up due in large part to inflation from the prior year the current quarter does include the cost for the key leaders who have recently joined our team and for the prior year quarter costs were still somewhat muted from the lingering pandemic conditions however the last 12 months have seen significant inflation especially in the labor market said another way in the prior year s quarter we benefited from a far more affordable car environment without the corresponding increase in costs that dynamic has now reversed most of the sg a increase relates to wage inflation as we need to remain competitive in the marketplace over 72 of our sg a is people costs since 2019 our revenues are up over 200 annualized the number of customers we serve is up 32 from 75 000 we believe we have the opportunity to serve a much larger customer base at appropriate returns many of our people investments have been discretionary investments that are viewed as necessary to grow and scale the business our expectation is to leverage these investments by serving more customers at quarter end our revolving debt was approximately 302 million we had 4 5 million in cash and approximately 50 million in additional availability under our revolving credit facilities based on our current borrowing base of receivables and inventory our securitized nonrecourse notes payable was 250 million with 33 million in restricted cash related to those notes we are preparing for our second securitization expected to be towards the end of the third quarter we will continue to be mindful of efficiencies in our funding costs in terms of advance rates credit costs and other funding costs while ensuring we have access to the capital necessary for a growing business our total debt net of cash to finance receivables ratio is 40 9 our solid balance sheet strong operating history and access to securitization market should provide us with the appropriate access to capital moving forward although that cost of capital does continue to increase as we fund the growing receivable base with higher retail sales prices in longer terms the business requires a higher debt level our cash on cash returns are still attractive and growing our finance receivable and customer base is the best use of our capital advertisement advertisement during the quarter we grew finance receivables by 74 million we decreased inventory by 15 million and we funded 8 million in capital expenditures thank you and i ll let jeff close this out jeff williams okay thank you vickie we are convinced of our unique place in the world and the fact that our business model is the best way to serve our customer base with the capital constraints affecting competition market share opportunities are real and near as we ve said repeatedly over the years ultra low interest rates have supported some marginal competition that will now have to raise prices shrink or even close for over 40 years we ve been nimble and adaptable our current and future value proposition is solid and we ve leaned into the challenges and opportunities to scale the business to allow for productivity improvements we re blending data in digital with our bricks and mortar footprint which is powerful from a consumer s viewpoint we are the market leader today and we re investing to be the market leader 5 and 10 years from now the market we serve has been disrupted which will be a good thing for us over the near and longer term our

chief executive officer bobby martin and chief financial officer katrina o connell with that i ll turn the call over to bobby bobby martin thank you cammeron and good afternoon everyone after four months as interim president and ceo i have even deeper conviction that we have a portfolio of iconic brands that our customers love an increased confidence in our platform to drive leverage and economies of scale and belief in this team s ability to deliver we know where we ve gotten things wrong and the team and i are at work to correct them as i told you last quarter we can and we should win in any environment and the management team and i continue to hold the company accountable to deliver on that we ve taken action to optimize profitability and cash flow while rebalancing and reducing inventory to drive near and long term improvements across our entire business advertisement advertisement we ve sharpened our focus on execution or bringing more rigor to our operations and are responding to what our customers are telling us with respect to trend while our efforts drove sequential improvement during the quarter our expectations are set on the consistency of execution quarter after quarter year after year that we know is crucial to delivering the sustainable profitable growth and value that our people and shareholders expect let me provide an update on our progress during the quarter starting with actions taken on cost as i last shared we are aggressively managing costs and have taken the state action in this quarter alone resulting in roughly 250 million in estimated annualized savings these actions include the elimination of 500 existing and open roles in our corporate offices and a pause on hiring and contractor spend for the remainder of the year resulting in 125 million in estimated annualized savings initially the renegotiation of our advertising agency contracts resulting in approximately 75 million in annualized savings and a reduction in technology operating costs and rationalized investments resulting in estimated 50 million of annualized savings beginning in fiscal 2023 we are early in our work here and yet already these savings are expected to help offset higher incentive compensation and increasing labor costs in fiscal 2023 however there is still work to be done to transform our cost structure and improve overall efficiency so that we are fit for the future next let me share more on our inventory actions and assortment rebalancing efforts we continue to rely heavily on markdowns and discounting to sell through reliable styles this quarter and have reduced receipts in q4 these actions will allow us to enter fiscal 2023 in an improved inventory position and beginning in q1 our brands will benefit from our reinstated responsive capabilities to chase into product demand we re seeing an improved balance in the assortment across the portfolio compared to the first half of the year and each of our brands were better positioned in the categories that resonate with the base consumer preferences and our customers rewarded us for that we saw consistent category strength in dresses sweaters pants and woven tops across the portfolio with active underperforming across the board as consumers continue to shift away from the cozy at home lifestyle while athleta isn t immune to the change in consumer preference despite moderation of growth in the women s active market the brand is showing strength in lifestyle categories like dresses and accessories that are demonstrating disproportionate growth in today s current environment now let me take a moment and speak to each of our brands starting with old navy old navy delivered net sales growth of 2 over last year showing early signs of improvement as the brand continues its efforts to right size inventory balance assortment relevance and sizing across its channels and the brand saw strength in its women s business in categories including pants outerwear sweaters and woven tops all this was offset however by softness in active in kids and baby as we lapped last year s strong demand which we believe was driven in part by the us child tax credit and of course the heightened post covid back to school spending old navy customers still have a propensity to buy that being said it continues to experience softness in spending and shopping frequency from its lowest income consumers advertisement advertisement as we continue to attract a wide range of consumers we still believe old navy is well positioned in the marketplace particularly as consumers become more value conscious next gap brand gap delivered net sales flat to last year and is seeing signs of strength in its core with a significant shift in trend performance across its women s business iconic gap store brands who were delivering in trend right fabrics like faux leather and occasion based categories like dresses woven tops sweaters and pants all drove comparable sales growth similar to old navy gap brand experienced softness in kids and baby and activewear overall over the last 18 months gap brand has successfully transitioned its france italy and uk businesses to franchise partners as part of our partner to amplify strategy and last week we signed agreement to transition the gap greater china business to baozun inc who will operate our end market sites in stores under a franchise agreement pending closing conditions and regulatory approval early next year this strategy allows gap brand to operate its businesses through a more asset light cost effective model and to benefit from the local expertise of our partners moving to banana republic we saw net sales growth of 8 compared to last year september marked the one year anniversary of their brand relaunch shifting from a highly promotional workwear brand catering to everybody banana republic spent the last year reimagining every element of the customer journey with a special focus on quality products differentiated experiences and relevant branding positioning it as a premier lifestyle brand that enhances people s lives wherever they are this accessible luxury differentiates banana republic from others at this price point and has brought in a more premium consumer we hope that you ll take a look soon during the quarter banana republic experienced strong demand for suiting and its finer fabrics including silk and cashmere as post pandemic consumer preferences began to balance from the current trend of occasion and workwear it will be important that banana republic continues to use its unique customer proposition as a lifestyle brand to differentiate itself for years to come finally on athleta athleta delivered net sales growth of 6 compared to last year while the women s activewear market has continued to be soft against the growth trajectory in the past few years athleta is holding share as i mentioned last quarter athleta has made quick pivots to print and pattern as well as with their performance lifestyle product to better meet the customers preferences the new fall and holiday product is resonating well with the customer and athleta saw growth in both bottoms and tops the largest categories in the women s apparel market and key to the brand s long term strategy before i pass it off to katrina to share more details on our financials let me end with how i began on the state of the business i have no doubt we have world class brands that our customers love and we drive value and scale through the synergy of our platform but i m also very clear that there is work to be done to right size our cost structure streamline inventory and capitalize on our creative strengths to deliver the products and experience our customers deserve and employees and shareholders expect advertisement advertisement lastly the board remains active in its search for a permanent chief executive officer we re focused on a hands on leader who can greatly increase our operating rigor moving us past our deficiencies while in parallel enabling strong creative direction and brand architecture as they develop the vision for how our portfolio should evolve over time to create a sustainable business model this is a great company with strong assets and one that demands a leader who can hold to its value and ensure it remains fit and capable of scaling its omni platform and market leadership and with that i ll turn the call over to katrina see also david tepper stock portfolio and 15 biggest copper companies in the world katrina o connell thank you bobby and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon let me start with our third quarter results third quarter net sales of 4 04 billion increased 2 versus last year or 3 on a constant currency basis driven by an improvement in trend relative to the first half of the year and in part due to the timing of franchise sales sales in the third quarter were 1 above pre pandemic levels in 2019 comparable sales were up 1 on top of negative 1 comp last year and a significant sequential improvement from the negative 10 comp last quarter primarily as our assortment rebalancing efforts at old navy and gap are starting to take hold and resonating with our customers as well as the benefit of an early holiday promotional event at old navy in october store sales increased 1 from the prior year year to date we have closed a net total of 29 gap and banana republic stores in north america and now anticipate closing approximately 30 additional stores this year bringing us to close to 90 of our goal of closing 350 stores in north america by the end of fiscal 2023 as we look to the remainder of fiscal 2022 we remain on track to open a net 30 athleta stores and now expect to open a net 10 old navy stores this year online sales increased 5 versus last year and represented 39 of total sales in the quarter compared to pre pandemic levels in 2019 online sales increased 55 turning to sales by brand starting with old navy sales in the third quarter of 2 1 billion were up 2 versus last year and increased 10 relative to pre pandemic levels in 2019 advertisement advertisement old navy comparable sales were down 1 representing a sequential improvement from the negative 15 comp last quarter driven by improvements in category mix and a more balanced assortment that now includes more of the product that our customers have been looking for as preferences have shifted from cozy casual to work occasion this year however we do believe that old navy did benefit from a slight pull forward of sales from the fourth quarter into october as a result of its efforts to get out earlier than typical with its first holiday promotional event gap brand global sales of 1 04 billion were flat versus last year with global comparable sales up 4 driven by improved category mix and a more balanced assortment including more occasion based and fast and driven categories as well as comp growth in asia as a result of lapping the outsized negative impact of covid related restrictions last year north america comparable sales were flat a sequential improvement from negative 10 last quarter banana republic sales grew 8 from last year to 517 million with comparable sales up 10 as the brand continued to capitalize on the shift in consumer preference and the relaunch and elevated positioning of the brand last year athleta sales grew 6 to 340 million or an increase of 57 compared to 2019 pre pandemic levels comparable sales improved sequentially to a flat comp in the third quarter compared to negative 8 comp last quarter and negative 7 in the first quarter as we look to sales in the fourth quarter we continue to take a prudent approach given the uncertain macro and consumer environment as well as the competitive promotional environment also as stated earlier third quarter net sales benefited in part by the timing of franchise sales as well as the october holiday event at old navy in addition gap brands will be up against an approximate 1 point headwind as we anniversaried yeezy gap sales last year that will not be in the base this year as a result of these factors and the continued uncertain environment we anticipate that total company sales in the fourth quarter could be down mid single digits year over year now to gross margin gross margin in the third quarter was 37 4 deleveraging 470 basis points versus last year inclusive of 130 basis points of deleverage related to a 53 million yeezy gap impairment charge on an adjusted basis gross margin was 38 7 deleveraging 320 basis points versus last year as we continue to experience higher levels of markdowns in order to better position our inventory excluding the impairment related to yeezy gap merch margin deleveraged 370 basis points as a result of higher discounting due to the previously communicated assortment imbalances as well as more aggressive focus on better positioning and clearing excess inventory as we exit fiscal 2022 airfreight contributed approximately 200 basis points of leverage as spend levels normalized during the quarter and we lapped the 70 million of incremental air freight expense last year equally offsetting this was approximately 200 basis points of deleverage due to inflationary and commodity cost related headwinds turning to rod we continue to benefit from our fleet restructuring efforts through lower rod costs which were relatively in line with last year on a nominal basis advertisement advertisement excluding a yeezy gap impairment charge rod as a percentage of sales leveraged approximately 50 basis points as we look to gross margin in the fourth quarter we will lap last year s 245 million of incremental airfreight which is expected to add approximately 540 basis points to gross margin versus last year we continue to anticipate an approximate 200 basis point inflationary and commodity cost headwinds and that rod will likely be about flat as a percentage of sales versus last year as we communicated last quarter while we are taking actions to right size inventory in an increasingly promotional environment we continue to expect significant variability in discount rate as a reminder gross margin in the second and third quarters were impacted by approximately 370 basis points of deleverage stemming from higher discounting turning to sg a reported sg a was 1 3 billion or 32 8 of sales leveraging 540 basis points from the prior year and includes an 83 million net benefit from the sale of our uk dc now that our european partnership model transition is complete in addition we recorded an immaterial amount of severance related to the overhead reductions taken in the third quarter adjusted sg a excluding the uk dc benefit decreased 5 versus last year to 1 4 billion as a percentage of sales adjusted sg a leveraged 280 basis points from the prior year s adjusted rate primarily as a result of higher sales volumes lower bonus accrual and lower marketing expense compared to last year as bobby discussed we ve begun to take actions to right size our cost structure and improve profitability focusing acutely on areas where we may have invested without commensurate returns in recent years as it relates to overhead marketing and technology we ve already acted on approximately 250 million in annualized savings stemming from the reduction of approximately 500 existing and open corporate roles in the quarter the renegotiation of advertising agency contracts and the reduction of technology operating costs and rationalization of digital investments these actions will not have a material impact on sg a as we look to the fourth quarter as a result of timing and severance offsets in addition to headwinds in the quarter related to higher seasonal labor costs relative to last year however these actions will provide a significant offset to the higher incentive compensation and wage inflation headwinds we anticipate in fiscal 2023 reported operating income increased 22 to 186 million or 4 6 as a percentage of sales adjusted operating income decreased 8 from the prior year to 156 million adjusted operating margin of 3 9 was 40 basis points lower than last year s adjusted rate reflecting the elevated promotional activity and higher inflationary costs offset by the air freight leverage and the sg a leverage relative to last year moving to interest and taxes we recognized 18 million in net interest expense a 25 million savings versus last year due to the refinancing of our long term debt last fall during the quarter we recorded an income tax benefit of 114 million on pre tax income of 168 million which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 68 this income tax benefit was related to the cumulative impact of a change in the estimated annual tax rate as a result of quarterly earnings variability advertisement advertisement this year to date tax benefit is expected to reverse and result in at least 200 million of tax expense in the fourth quarter offsetting the tax benefit on a fiscal year basis reported eps was 0 77 adjusted eps which excludes an approximate 0 18 net benefit related to the uk dc sale and a 0 12 negative impact due to the yeezy gap impairment charge was 0 71 adjusted eps includes 0 33 related to the tax benefit in the quarter share count ended at 365 million turning to balance sheet and cash flow starting with inventory we are making initial progress on our plan to right size inventories and move to levels below last year by the end of the fiscal year our more aggressive markdowns combined with moderated holiday receipts drove a sequential improvement in the inventory growth during the quarter total ending inventory was up 12 versus last year a sequential improvement from 37 inventory growth in the second quarter the 12 year over year growth in the third quarter includes a 13 percentage point benefit related to in transit as we lapped last year s supply chain challenges 9 percentage points of growth related to pack and hold and close to two thirds of the remaining increase is attributable to elevated levels of slow turning basics and the remainder seasonal products compared to pre pandemic levels in the third quarter of 2019 ending inventory was up 12 while an improvement in trend versus the first half as we expected we are entering the fourth quarter with overall elevated inventory levels and some carryover of fall product despite the increased markdown activity in the third quarter although we did take action earlier this year to reduce holiday receipts we continue to anticipate a competitive promotional environment given the increased inventory levels industry wide and plan to continue to take aggressive action to clear inventory in order to enter fiscal 2023 better positioned as we look to fiscal 2023 we continue to moderate buys and expect to begin to lean into our responsive levers this spring which will provide further flexibility to better align inventory levels with demand trends next year in addition we are releasing some of last year s holiday pack and hold inventory and we ll continue to integrate our pack and hold inventory into future assortments as you know while pack and hold is the use of cash in the short term we are able to optimize our margin in the near term and benefit working capital next year as we buy lower receipts and sell through the pack and hold inventory quarter end cash and equivalents were 679 million net cash from operating activities was an inflow of 95 million in the quarter driven by a moderation in working capital usage as a result of our progress on improving inventory levels and composition coupled with our receipt cuts and leaner buys as we stated last quarter we anticipated beginning to see more normalized cash flow in the back half of the year and we are seeing that play out we continue to focus on fortifying our balance sheet and cash position as discussed last quarter we ve cut or deferred some capital spending and reduced the number of old navy stores slated for back half of the year and continue to expect capex of approximately 650 million for the year we remain committed to delivering an attractive quarterly dividend as a core component of total shareholder returns advertisement advertisement during the quarter we paid a dividend of 0 15 per share and on november 8th our board approved a 0 15 dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we repurchased 1 2 million shares early in the quarter as discussed last quarter we have completed our goal of offsetting dilution in fiscal 2022 and do not anticipate repurchasing additional shares this year we continue to have 476 million available under our current share repurchase program authorization before closing we understand that there has been increased focus on freight and commodity related tailwinds in fiscal 2023 across the industry as we ve all begun to see favorability in rates as a reminder we have experienced a more modest freight headwind throughout fiscal 2022 as compared to many other retailers as a result of our long term ocean contracts which were locked in at favorable rates these negotiated rates remain below current ocean container rates as a result as ocean container rates come down this will not represent a significant tailwind to our margin as it may for other retailers as we look to fiscal 2023 in addition as it relates to cotton and commodity costs we have already made purchases through the first half of fiscal 2023 and therefore will not begin to benefit from advantaged pricing until we enter the back half of next year in closing while we continue to navigate an uncertain consumer environment and promotionally competitive environment we are confident in the actions we re taking and believe we are taking the right steps to position gap inc back on its path towards sustainable profitable growth and delivering value to our shareholders over the long term with that we ll open the line for questions operator to continue reading the q a session please click here

kuching the domestic pepper market has fared poorly in 2022 with prices of the spice falling between 13 5 and 25 from 2021 due to a drop in global consumption kuching grade 1 black pepper s price has fallen by rm4 430 per tonne or more than 25 to rm12 900 per tonne last friday from rm17 330 per tonne at end december 2021 similarly kuching grade 1 white pepper lost rm3 550 per tonne or 13 5 to rm22 900 from rm26 430 per tonne during the same period based on the malaysian pepper board s daily published prices the domestic pepper market has undergone a steep correction after posting a strong relief rally in 2021 due to crop failure in 2021 when both black and white pepper prices soared by about 90 from rm9 050 per tonne and 65 from rm16 000 per tonne respectively over the registered in december 2020 at the historical peaks in 2016 black and white pepper prices hit rm30 000 and rm50 000 per tonne respectively according to international pepper community ipc executive director firna azura ekaputri marzuki the bearish global pepper market in 2022 was primarily due to demand erosion because of deficit changing to surplus inventory she said the rising interest rates in many countries to tame inflation and the war in ukraine pushed up the prices of essential commodities while the european energy crisis and global credit crunch had caused most currencies of consuming countries to depreciate which has led to higher cost of import these factors and the fact that china still implements the zero covid policy with lockdowns has caused demand erosion for pepper furthermore along with the convergence of brazil and indonesia new crop harvest the unsold vietnam s inventory following china s lockdown as well as the demand of western europe and the united states being covered the global pepper industry expects the bearish sentiment to persist she said in a statement she said china as one of the highest pepper consumers in the world has greatly influenced the pepper movement due to the country s lockdown implementation vietnam the world s no 1 producer and exporter of pepper was reported to have exported more than 208 000 tonnes of the spice in the first 11 months of 2022 and this was a drop of 37 650 tonnes or over 15 from the corresponding period in 2021 as china is the traditional key export market for vietnamese pepper the closure of the vietnam china border due to the covid 19 pandemic has affected the sales of spice to china the united states and europe are the other key markets for vietnamese pepper vietnam s lower export volume was also attributed to the higher interest rate environment which sapped away demand on concerns of a global economic recession while weaker currencies led to the absence of speculative activity in the pepper export market reviewing this year s domestic pepper market performance sarawak s leading pepper exporter nguong aik kuching sdn bhd director william s c yii said pepper prices reached their highest levels this year in the second quarter when black pepper was traded at between rm18 000 rm19 000 per tonne while white pepper around rm26 000 per tonne this year s market is one of the quietest in years due to crop failure malaysia s pepper production volume this year is slightly lower than last year because of the weaker prices shopkeepers and the richer farmers are holding onto their stocks and are reluctant to sell at the current low prices the stocks in hand in sarawak is quite high now some shops have stocked about 100 gunny bags of pepper and households in some longhouses have five to 10 bags of pepper inventory each yii told starbiz he said sarawak pepper s traditional export markets japan and south korea still offer good purchase prices on the outlook for the global pepper market in 2023 yii said based on reports all the major pepper producing countries except brazil are expected to either maintain or reduce their production outputs in 2023 he said certain regions in vietnam have now started to harvest the new crop and the peak harvest season is in february with the new crop coming into the market in first quarter of 2023 it is expected to put more pressure on the global pepper price overall 2023 will be another not so good year for the pepper market in the first half of next year pepper prices are expected to be maintained around the current levels but may move higher in the second half year he said however if china reopens following the relaxation of its covid 19 measures it will help to boost the pepper market a plus factor for the global pepper market is the normalisation of international shipping freight rates which have come down by about 20 from last year s peak while the shortage of containers has been resolved said firna the global pepper supply is expected to be on the safe side due to the record harvest reported by brazil and surplus of the end of the year stock levels which devalue the price of pepper as we are heading towards the new crop in 2023 it would be best to take extra care in estimating the market condition it is best to pay more attention on the demand as the supply is expected to be on the plus side it is the view of the ipc that it is recommended to move forward by selling and buying in tranches instead of extreme speculating it is with high hope that china will lift the lockdowns and start buying pepper again she said malaysia should use use this opportunity to maintain the promotion of pepper across the markets in order to boost the consumption so as to offset the surplus inventory caused by china

you may have as noted in today s press release third quarter results were above our expectations as we delivered stronger value throughout our stores operating margin for the period was 9 8 versus 11 4 last year reflecting the deleveraging effect from the comparable sales decline as well as pressure from higher markdowns and unfavorable timing of packaway related costs earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended october 29 2022 were 1 on net income of 342 million this compares to 1 09 per share or net earnings of 385 million for the 13 weeks ended october 30 2021 total sales for the quarter

billion compared to 3 82 per share on net income of 1 4 billion for the same period in 2021 sales for the year to date period totaled 13 5 billion with comparable store sales down 5 versus a strong 14 increase last year for the third quarter at ross shoes was the best performing business while florida and texas were the top performing regions as they were bolstered by the outperformance of border and forex locations at dd s discounts sales trends improved versus the first half but continue to trail ross s results due to ongoing inflationary pressures that are having a larger impact on dd s lower income customers inventory levels moderated significantly from the first half of the year with total consolidated inventories at the end of the quarter up 12 compared to last year average store inventory during the quarter were up 4 versus 2021 and down compared to pre pandemic loans packaway merchandise represented 41 of the total compared to 31 last year when we used packway merchandise to

99 locations comprised of 71 ross and 28 dd s discounts we now expect to end the year with 1 693 ross stores and 322 dd s discounts locations for a net increase of 92 stores now adam will provide further details on our third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance advertisement advertisement see also 12 best affordable energy stocks to buy and 11 best aggressive stocks to buy now adam orvos thank you barbara as previously stated comparable store sales were down 3 in the quarter although traffic improved from the second quarter it still declined versus the prior year partially offsetting these declines was a higher average basket size operating margin of 9 8 for the third quarter was down 160 basis points from last year cost of goods sold grew by 230 basis points in the quarter merchandise margin declined 165 basis points primarily due to higher markdowns distribution costs were up 140 basis points mainly due to unfavorable timing of packaway related costs and deleverage from our new distribution center while occupancy delevered by 20 basis points these higher expenses were partially offset by a 75 basis point decrease in buying costs mainly from lower incentives lastly pressure from domestic freight expenses eased in the third quarter and improved 20 basis points as we anniversaried the freight headwinds that began in the second half of last year sg a for the period improved by 70 basis points as deleverage from the negative comparable sales was more than offset by lower incentives during the third quarter we repurchased 2 8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of 244 million we remain on track to buy back a total of 950 million in stock for the year now let s discuss our fourth quarter guidance we continue to expect a very promotional holiday selling season and ongoing inflationary headwinds to pressure our low to moderate income customers that said we face our easiest sales and earnings comparisons in the fourth quarter and are raising our guidance given our third quarter sales momentum and improved holiday assortments for the 13 weeks ending january 28 2023 we now expect comparable store sales to be flat to
