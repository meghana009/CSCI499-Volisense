getting out of the economic anarchy bt garvin karunaratne it is good news that we have reached an input of 1 billion aid from india and that china is considering and very likely to give a 2 5 b loan but this can bring us out of the economic mess we are in if only we act in a prudent manner it all depends on how we spend the funds we do not have to wonder far because if we closely copy the blueprint economic model of the days of premier dudley senanayake 1965 1970 days when we had no food gas and fuel queues we can be dead certain of victory that was also the one model we followed earlier too when we built the gal oya project spending dollars we had in 1950 1954 when my father in law had purchased his a 40 brand new as the first owner not from the company but from someone who had deposited money and waited long there were small allocations for valued imports in 1958 i waited for two months to buy a new peugeot 203 then we did not provide any foreign exchange for foreign studies or for foreign travel when i marched out of the administrative service and went abroad for study i was not given even a single dollar i had to earn live and study foreign exchange was a guarded item and we did not have private currency dealers buying and selling dollars emassing a profit the total intake of every bank was the property of the government and disposed as decided by the controller of foreign exchange of the central bank today unless we are strict and spend for essentials first and see to an era of no queues for food and essentials like cooking gas medicines and then detail a small allocation for fuel etc we will not win we have to forget skyscrapers bridges roads flyovers for the time being till we do not have to hear of deaths of common people in food and gas queues it is sad that four people have succumbed to deaths in queues by today 22 3 then very small allocations were given for non essentials like cars fridges grapes etc working as the additional government agent in kegalla in 1969 i knew of no food queues or any shortages of essentials like food including medicines our automobiles can easily guzzle out billions we have that many the rich have not one or two but fleets of vehicles and enjoy endless travel allowing the rich to revel while some citizens are confined to be in queues for days to buy a can of gas is a no no situation that needs never to happen my mind travels back to my days at matara as the government agent when the jvp struck on 5 thapril 1971 when the jvp actually controlled 90 of the district for close on three weeks no fuel bowsers could be expected till roads were opened up as the ga i was in charge only some ten officers out of some 400 reported for work and that included my assistant govt agent sugatadasa jayawickrema the two of us decided that we will impound all stocks of petrol and diesel all petrol shed were closed to the public told to issue only to army and police vehicles and on permits issued by either of us if i had not made that decision the fuel would have run out and we would not have had any fuel for the army police and essential services like the distribution of essential food then the police withdrew the security at the katcheri closed the police station gates and barricaded the entrance with a large tree and were armed to the teeth with machine guns inside awaiting the enemy the jvp matara was saved by the gemunu watch volunteers running in katcheri jeeps with petrol found from my development funds ensuring essential food transport for the area near matara and the coast which we controlled at times if i had not controlled the use of available fuel the jvp would have had a walk over and we would not have lived to tell the tale casualties due to jvp bullets included my jeep driver major wettasinghe and the member of parliament for deniyaya sumanapala dahanayake the latter two moved to colombo hospitals in haste we must limit the use of fuel to produce electricity and for essential services there is no other way ahead permits have to be issued by the divisional secretaries to owners of motor vehicles for the essential travel like going to work and for schooling unless this is done the dollars will end in smoke one can also look to the manner in which mahatir muhammed responded when the east asian financial crisis hit east asia i quote from my book how the imf ruined sri lanka alternative programmes of success godages 2006 in 1997 the east asian financial crisis caused the death of many economies in east asia malaysia thailand indonesia korea succumbed and the malaise spread to russia brazil and argentina all these countries had their currencies trashed and their economies ruined prime minister mahatir muhhamed of malysia declared war with the imf by doing the exact opposite of the imf advice he effectively controlled the economy of his own country he was entitled to do it he imposed very strict controls every country earns foreign exchange through exports and services and remittances he grabbed this money and did not allow any foreign bank or anyone to spend on unnecessary imports he clamped severe restrictions on the use of foreign exchange this even went to the extent of stopping funds for malaysians studying abroad there was mayhem in student circles in london some of my students took leave of studies and flew home those who stayed back were compelled to do menial work in restaurants etc to pay themselves pg 238 it was only malaysia that faced the crisis without falling into debt thailand was given a loan of 17 1 billion korea 58 2 billion indonesia 39 9 billion their foreign debts commensurately increased by that amount in each case the imf insisted that the local economy should be further prise opened more to foreign investment this means that the doors are yet being wider and wider opened for foreign exploitation as professor stiglitz states the imf chose to squeeze the countries further thus driving their banks and corporations to deeper crisis and worsening investor confidence stiglitz imf policies make patient sicker the imf has come up with two aid schemes the highly improvised poor countries initiative hipc and supplemented with the multilateral debt relief initiative mdri both declare loans as paid up but open up the country more for foreign investment as carrasco of the university of ohio opines that the hipc is a program designed by creditors to protect creditor s interests leaving countries with unsustainable debt burdens foreign debt forgiveness repudiation university of iowa center for international finance debt 2007 the mdri is no better sri lanka is currently negotiating with the imf it is hoped that the imf will provide a chance for sri lanka to wipe out the food and fuel queues and subsequently provide a development agenda which is not yet on its books it is sad that the imf despite helping giving loans on strict conditions to some 80 odd countries cannot quote a single instance where any country has developed under their tutelage however it is hoped that this message will serve to open their eyes and enable them to speak of success these words come from someone who designed and implemented the largest and premier employment creation programme the world has known the youth self employment programme ysep of bangladesh created when he served as the commonwealth fund advisor to the ministry of labour and manpower in 1982 that happened in the face of an ilo programme that spent millions and failed to establish a self employment programme in tangail bangladesh in 1980 1982 the ysep has in its four decades 1982 2022 guided over three million youths to be commercially viable entrepreneurs it is hoped that the imf will kindly consider allowing sri lanka the chance to wipe out the food and fuel queues first and will also help the country to stand on its feet in development may i suggest that the imf detail that sri lanka should show the development starved world that it is possible to enable true economic development creating production locally bringing about employment and incomes for the people within a successful development programme such a programme will be a feather in the cap for the imf and will get into the history of successes in development like mahatir muhammed in malaysia in the days of the east asian financial conflict of 1997 and the youth self employment programme of bangladesh the sri lankan high commissioner in delhi his excellency milinda moragoda in his manifesto for mayor of colombo in 2011 refers to a scheme to solve the problems of youth unemployment in this regard he should seek to implement the youth self employment programme of bangladesh which incidentally was an amazingly successful scheme introduced to that country by a distinguished son of sri lanka dr garvin karunaratne who served bangladesh as an international consultant let me live in hope that the imf will get this message garvin karunaratne ph d michigan state university author of how the imf ruined sri lanka alternative programmes of success godages 2006 how the imf sabotaged third world development godages kindle 2017 how the imf s structural adjustment destroyed sri lanka godages 2022 23032022

the 21st century tornado problem is far different from the wizard of oz killer tornadoes hit the southeast far more than they do in kansas oklahoma or texas an analysis shows that nearly 89 of tornado deaths since 2000 have happened from missouri arkansas and eastern louisiana experts say there are more people in the way tuesday s deadly tornado in the new orleans area was a perfect example of this tornadoes outside the great plains are also more likely to strike at night than they do in oklahoma especially in the springtime trees hills and buildings also make it harder for people to track and take tornado warnings seriously victor gensini a professor of meteorology at northern illinois university who specializes in severe storms said the mid south does get a lot of tornadoes but in the mid south we have more things to hit we have more bull s eyes on the dartboard we have more cities we have more weak frame housing stock tornadoes happen more often there at night which is exactly what we saw last night gensini said it s a function of the human built environment scientists say that the west is getting drier because of climate change which makes it more difficult for the air to become moist and unstable that part is critical for tornado formation the southeast on the other hand is seeing its air become warmer and that holds more water vapor this all creates the instability needed for tornadoes the associated press reported with nighttime tornadoes people cannot see them coming tornadoes in the southeast tend to happen more often in springtime when there are fewer daylight hours the southeast also has more trees hills and buildings which also block views and don t allow for more warning time

2 2 reuters file photo judge ketanji brown jackson testifies during a senate judiciary committee confirmation hearing on her nomination to the u s supreme court on capitol hill in washington us march 22 2022 reuters elizabeth frantz file photo 2 2 by moira warburton lawrence hurley and andrew chung washington reuters republicans on wednesday pressed their attacks on a range of issues against ketanji brown jackson president joe biden s nominee to become the first black woman on the us supreme court as she inched closer to the end of an intense two days of questioning with democrats coming to her defense jackson who had remained even tempered throughout marathon questioning during her senate judiciary committee confirmation hearing showed impatience over repeated questions posed by republicans who accused her of being too lenient as a judge in sentencing child pornography offenders republican senator josh hawley again pressed her on one child pornography case involving an 18 year old defendant in which jackson imposed a three month sentence he asked her if she regretted the sentence senator what i regret is that during a hearing about my qualifications to be a justice on the supreme court we ve spent a lot of time focusing on this small subset of my sentences jackson replied jackson since last year has served as a federal appellate judge after eight years as a federal district judge she noted that she had sentenced more than 100 people as a judge democrats and sentencing experts have said jackson s approach to child pornography sentencing was similar to the vast majority of federal judges republican senator lindsey graham nyse who repeatedly interrupted jackson as she was trying to answer his questions told her that every judge who does what you re doing is making it easier for these children to be exploited i know how serious these crimes are jackson said in her defense adding that her approach was to ensure the most serious offenders get the longest time democratic senator dick durbin the committee s chairman pushed back on republican requests for more information on jackson s child pornography cases saying the issue had already been debated in detail over two days there s an absurdity to this that is almost comical if it wasn t so dangerous democratic senator cory booker said of the republican attacks you have earned this spot you are worthy you are a great american booker told jackson who could be seen wiping a tear from her eye so far there is no sign that the republican attacks are likely to derail jackson s confirmation with democrats narrowly controlling the senate with a simple majority needed for confirmation and the senate divided 50 50 between the parties she would get the job if democrats remain united regardless of how the republicans vote harvard case under questioning from her former harvard law school classmate senator ted cruz jackson said that if confirmed to the lifetime job she planned not to participate in a major supreme court case involving the university because she serves on its board of overseers the case to be heard in the court s next term that begins in october involves a challenge to the affirmative action admissions policy harvard uses to increase its number of black and hispanic students her confirmation would not change the court s ideological balance it has a 6 3 conservative majority but would let biden freshen its liberal bloc with a 51 year old jurist young enough to serve for decades the democratic president nominated jackson last month to the lifetime post to succeed retiring liberal justice stephen breyer facing more long hours of often antagonistic questioning during the hearing s third day she remained mostly unflappable beginning most responses with a polite thank you senator durbin praised jackson for her poise and said some republicans had used the hearing as an opportunity to showcase talking points for the november election when control of congress is up for grabs including the argument that democrats are soft on crime well you have made a mess of their stereotype durbin said pointing to the fact that she has been endorsed by various law enforcement groups republicans also have criticized her legal representation earlier in her career of some detainees at the u s naval base at guantanamo bay cuba and tried to link jackson to activist groups on the left and to critical race theory which argues american history and institutions are infused with racial bias there are signs that not all republican senators agree with targeting jackson s record on sentencing republican senator thom tillis said during the hearing he was sympathetic to some of it not necessarily all of it when describing claims made to his colleagues republican senator mitt romney told the washington post the attacks on jackson were off course jackson s testimony is due to end on wednesday with outside experts scheduled for thursday s final day of the hearing if confirmed jackson would be the 116th justice to serve on the high court the sixth woman and the third black person with jackson on the bench the court for the first time would have four women and two black justices

while amazon is not named in the interim zoning controls on proposed parcel delivery service uses the supervisors approved tuesday it s crystal clear they re playing hardball with amazon s plans for a mission bay delivery warehouse when amazon announced some 15 months ago that they were buying up the recology site at seventh and berry streets for 200 million it was fair to assume that the san francisco board of supervisors was going to extract another pound of flesh out of the extravagantly profitable company whose stock is trading at more than 3 000 a share then two weeks ago amazon announced a 20 1 stock split which is a complex proposition but the gist of it is that amazon will likely become even more extravagantly profitable icymi amazon hits on a proposed last mile warehouse in san francisco after supes unanimously approve an 18 month moratorium on all new parcel delivery services in the city the latest salvo from organized labor via sfjkdineen pic twitter com ntqesi7akt rachael myrow rachaelmyrow march 23 2022 that stock split may or may not have played a role in the supervisors unanimously approving an 18 month moratorium on parcel delivery sites as reported by the chronicle the legislation does not mention amazon or the seventh street site but it s pretty obvious who they re targeting here and amazon for now is agreeing to abide rather than threatening lawsuits we will continue to evaluate our long term use of the site and in the short term we will work with our neighbors to look at ways to use the location to serve the community an amazon spokesperson said in a statement to the chronicle according to the chronicle organized labor groups held a rally in support of the moratorium before the vote with an 18 wheeler emblazoned with a teamster banner as a backdrop teamsters power in san francisco joint council 7 is proud to co sponsor shamannwalton s critical legislation to stop amazon s intrusion into our communities until they agree to actually uplift our communities meaning good paying union jobs that benefit us all pic twitter com nkxmsnfava teamsters local 2010 ibtlocal2010 march 22 2022 free market die hards will complain that the supervisors are holding back progress but have you ever walked past the amazon delivery warehouse on toland street there are exactly two types of vehicles in that area decrepit rvs that people are living in and super slick new amazon delivery vans the smiley amazon logo on the vans only rubs the staggering income inequality in your face even more there could be ways to legislate around the seventh street site becoming a similar scene if you are going to come into our neighborhoods you are going to talk to the people in the neighborhood supervisor shamann walton who proposed the moratorium and whose district contains the seventh street site told the chronicle you are going to provide them with community benefits walton does not specify what benefits he is looking for but higher wages and union jobs would be a fair assumption after all earlier in the day the man gave a speech in front of a giant teamsters sign many of these fights including the new push for legislation in san francisco are being led by the teamsters who alongside other activists have been declaring victories in struggles to block amazon warehouse plans and tax breaks laurenkgurley 1u teamsters teamsters february 15 2022 so in effect the board is siding with the labor unions in a larger national fight over amazon unionization yes this project is delayed but i doubt anyone s going to see delays in their amazon prime deliveries the board can always rescind the moratorium this is all a negotiating tactic and amazon is still at the bargaining table willing to negotiate and not boo hooing that can t get their way so they might run off to austin texas there will not be a same day delivery on a compromise here but this may be resolved in less than 18 months related amazon buys recology site in sf for 200 million scuttles plan to make it housing image view of an amazon delivery van with an amazon prime logo parked at an apartment complex in downtown chicago illinois april 2019 photo by interim archives getty images

a deadly tornado in new orleans has highlighted a shift tornados have shifted to the south and threaten lives and property in new areas outside the great plains example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video forget the wizard of oz tornadoes are causing far more deaths and destruction east and south of kansas these days and they re often doing it in the dark of night tuesday night s deadly tornado that struck the new orleans area is the ideal example of what experts say is the 21st century problem with twisters killer tornadoes have shifted a bit out of the vast emptiness of the great plains more into the southeast where there are more people to hit poorer populations and more trees to obscure twisters from view and if that s not enough these southeast twisters are more likely to strike at night when they are more dangerous here s a closer look at what s behind the shift why are tornadoes killing more people outside the great plains since 2000 nearly 89 of the 1 653 americans killed by tornadoes not counting this week s victims lived east of the dakotas nebraska kansas oklahoma and texas according to an associated press analysis of national oceanic and atmospheric administration data last year 100 people were killed by tornadoes in kentucky alabama illinois tennessee north carolina arkansas missouri louisiana mississippi and pennsylvania one person was killed in texas it s not so much a meteorology problem but a people one tornado experts said it s a function of the human built environment said victor gensini a professor of meteorology at northern illinois university who specializes in severe storms the mid south does get a lot of tornadoes but in the mid south we have more things to hit we have more bull s eyes on the dartboard we have more cities we have more weak frame housing stock tornadoes happen more often there at night which is exactly what we saw last night harold brooks a senior scientist at noaa s national severe storms laboratory said traditional 20th century tornadoes the type that make oklahoma and kansas famous are less deadly because they go for miles without anything in the way in 1991 he and his wife chased for 66 miles a tornado in oklahoma that had winds hit 286 mph it hit two barns no one but a few cows were hurt put that storm near new orleans at night and dozens of people would be killed probably many more in the southeast all it takes is a weather event to occur and you ll have people in the way brooks said does climate change have a role in 2018 brooks and gensini published a scientific study showing deadly tornadoes were happening less frequently in the tornado alley of oklahoma kansas and texas and more frequently in tornado fatality alley which is the mid south gensini said what s likely happening is that the west is getting drier because of human caused climate change which makes it harder for the air to become moist and unstable which is crucial for tornado formation they said the southeast is getting warmer air which holds more water vapor which creates that important instability gensini said climate models predict this type shift 50 years in the future or so yet it appears to be happening now gensini said but gensini brooks and university of ohio meteorology professor jana houser emphasized that they don t see a climate change signal in tuesday s deadly louisiana tornado there s a la nina a natural periodic cooling of parts of the pacific that shifts global weather patterns and that usually means more tornadoes in the southeast because of changes in the jet stream and moisture they said what s different about night tornadoes tuesday s nighttime tornado illustrated a problem because when twisters hit at night people can t see them coming as easily and often don t react as well the tornado experts said about three quarters of the tornadoes that hit oklahoma and other great plains states occur between 5 and 9 p m so people know when to expect them and its more daylight brooks said but in the southeast they can hit any time which means more often at night than in oklahoma making them more dangerous related articles whirlwind stories from those who survived the arabi tornado another reason they happen more at night in the southeast is because they happen more in the springtime and there are just fewer daylight hours gensini said spring storms are juicier and stronger than summer ones so they don t need the sun s daytime heat to add that extra kick of energy to spur tornadoes he said what about the landscape the southeast is also hurt by having more trees hills and buildings that block people s views of incoming storms when there s a tornado warning in the southeast often people are out to their front porch and they don t really see anything and it just kind of looks like you know a dark sky houser said they may be less likely to actually heed those warnings than if they are walking out their door and they see a tornado on the horizon even if it s far away so there s a little bit of geography that plays a role there any good news for the region

sufficient resilience to avert a recession about 0 3 percentage point of the downward revision in 2022 growth is traced to sharp contractions in russia and ukraine while another 0 3 percentage point reflects slower growth in western europe a region hit particularly hard by the surge in prices of natural gas oil and electricity nearly every region is hurt by war related supply disruptions and commodity price increases a notable exception is the middle east and north africa where oil and gas exporters will benefit from substantially higher energy prices russia faces its deepest recession since the 1990s and diminished growth potential in response to severe sanctions by western governments and a mass exodus of businesses real gdp is projected to plummet 22 over the four quarters of 2022 reaching its lowest level since 2006 on an annual basis output will fall 11 1 in 2022 and 3 7 in 2023 with sharp declines in fixed investment private consumption and exports the downward spiral began in late february when the united states european union united kingdom and canada imposed new sanctions to block the russian central bank s access to its external assets and to block major russian banks from using the financial messaging services of swift these actions triggered a collapse in the rouble s exchange value prompting the bank of russia to raise its policy rate from 9 5 to 20 0 its highest level in two decades s p global market intelligence analysts expect the rouble will come under further pressure forcing the central bank to raise its policy rate to 30 in may currency depreciation and supply chain disruptions will lift russian consumer price inflation from 6 7 in 2021 to 23 6 in 2022 a difficult investment environment will impede economic recovery real gdp is not

tentatively estimate a real gdp contraction of about 40 in 2022 along with a 30 surge in consumer prices the pace of recovery will depend on the course of the war governance international aid for reconstruction and a return of population the united nations estimates that 3 17 million refugees 7 of the population have left ukraine while nearly 2 million have been internally displaced the russia

its natural gas consumption with russia accounting for 45 of that total russia also accounts for 25 of the eu s oil imports and 45 of its coal imports the forecast of us real gdp growth in 2022 is revised down to 3 3 from 3 7 last month the markdown is driven by sharply higher prices of food and energy a tightening of financial conditions in light of elevated risks and weaker growth in export markets higher commodity prices and lower stock prices will discourage consumer spending by reducing real income and wealth us consumer price inflation is now projected to pick up from 4 7 in 2021 to

opec and the u s energy information administration are the most bullish on russian crude outlook self sanctioning amid a global backlash against russia has left analysts dividend in their forecasts for the future of russian oil it s exactly one month since russia invaded ukraine and the oil markets remain as volatile as ever with little clarity as to how direct and self sanctions will impact russian crude output as well as global oil demand after the volatility induced speculative unwind which caused the 30 price fall from the 7 march high oil prices have moved sharply higher over the past week front month brent settled at 115 62 per barrel bbl on 21 march a w w increase of 8 72 bbl and 18 69 bbl above the 16 march intra day low the value of the opec basket rose by 3 17 bbl w w to 113 84 bbl and by eur 2 18 bbl to eur 103 34 bbl volatility remains high according to commodity analysts at standard chartered the 30 day annualized realized brent volatility rose 10 1ppt w w to a 21 month high of 72 8 while the 10 day measure rose 4 9ppt to 108 with positioning reset and significantly less crowded crude oil prices have been staging another rally yet market experts can t seem to agree on the oil price trajectory with key energy agencies revealing large differences in views on russian oil output stark differences between forecasts for russian oil output source standard chartered divergent views opec and the u s energy information administration are the most bullish on russian crude outlook while the international energy agency and standard chartered are less optimistic the latest forecast comes from the iea in its march 16 report the paris based energy watchdog warned of a potential global oil supply shock with 3 million b d of russian oil production likely to be shut in next month in its latest monthly report the iea projects lower demand growth for 2022 by 1 1 million b d to 2 1 million b d thanks to reduced russian consumption and higher prices the main reductions in the iea growth forecast by country were russia 430kb d the u s 180kb d and china 70kb d the eia was more conservative than the iea in cutting its 2022 forecast by 415kb d to 3 13mb d and increasing its 2023 forecast by 77kb d to 1 95mb d while acknowledging the scale of the potential demand risks the opec secretariat has maintained its 2022 demand growth forecast at 4 15mb d big supply deficit for its part stanchart has become even more pessimistic about the russian outlook in its march 9 report stanchart lowered its 2022 forecast to 1 94mb d nearly a million b d lower than its february forecast stanchart says ongoing sanctions continuing consumer reluctance to buy from russia as well as shortages of capital equipment and technology will continue to depress russian output over at least the next three years the commodity experts have predicted that russia s output decline will peak at 2 306mb d in q2 2022 stanchart says that rebalancing the oil markets would require around 2mb d extra supply for the remainder of 2022 mainly due to the current very low inventory levels and an additional 2mb d in q2 to ease the dislocations caused by the displacement of russian oil stanchart s model assumes that the current opec deal continues no increase in iran s exports and u s output growth y y is just over 1 5mb d but here s the main kicker from the stanchart report only opec can bridge the big supply deficit stanchart estimates that an iran deal could potentially provide an extra 1 2mb d in h2 2022 still leaving a significant gap that can only be realistically filled by those opec members with spare capacity particularly saudi arabia and the uae and prospects for a sharp increase in u s shale production are not looking great at the moment advertisement according to the latest baker hughes survey the u s oil rig count fell by three w w to 524 while the gas rig count gained two to 137 the largest w w increase in oil activity came in the midland basin where the rig count gained four to 123 elsewhere in the permian basin delaware basin oil drilling activity fell by two w w to 158 while other permian activity fell by three to 32 rigs the bakken region of montana and north dakota registered its first w w fall in activity in over a year with the oil rig count losing one to 32 the latest eia drilling productivity report showed a m m increase of 13 to 429 for permian well completions in february leaving them 48 lower than 2019 average monthly completions permian drilled but uncompleted wells ducs fell 86 m m to 1 396 in february allowing monthly completions to stay significantly ahead of wells drilled with the inventory of ducs as well as production per rig having fallen off a cliff u s producers need to sharply ramp up drilling activity just to maintain current production clips according to stanchart russian oil exports to europe could be cut to zero without medium term price overheating but only if q2 dislocations are eased by large strategic stock releases and if opec production increases significantly the prospects for the latter depend on whether there is a deal in the nuclear negotiations with iran in vienna and whether key opec members particularly saudi arabia uae kuwait and iraq are nimble enough in their policy thinking to move away from the opec agreement if opec ministers accept the lower two lines as a base case see chart above they will conclude that there are few advantages and multiple disadvantages in staying within the current opec agreement by alex kimani for oilprice com more top

the 21st century tornado problem is far different from the wizard of oz killer tornadoes hit the southeast far more than they do in kansas oklahoma or texas an analysis shows that nearly 89 of tornado deaths since 2000 have happened from missouri arkansas and eastern louisiana experts say there are more people in the way tuesday s deadly tornado in the new orleans area was a perfect example of this tornadoes outside the great plains are also more likely to strike at night than they do in oklahoma especially in the springtime trees hills and buildings also make it harder for people to track and take tornado warnings seriously victor gensini a professor of meteorology at northern illinois university who specializes in severe storms said the mid south does get a lot of tornadoes but in the mid south we have more things to hit we have more bull s eyes on the dartboard we have more cities we have more weak frame housing stock tornadoes happen more often there at night which is exactly what we saw last night gensini said it s a function of the human built environment scientists say that the west is getting drier because of climate change which makes it more difficult for the air to become moist and unstable that part is critical for tornado formation the southeast on the other hand is seeing its air become warmer and that holds more water vapor this all creates the instability needed for tornadoes the associated press reported with nighttime tornadoes people cannot see them coming tornadoes in the southeast tend to happen more often in springtime when there are fewer daylight hours the southeast also has more trees hills and buildings which also block views and don t allow for more warning time

florida fined its largest medicaid payment vendor nearly 9 1 million over software problems that delayed payments for nearly three months for tens of thousands of health care claims for the state s sickest and neediest children the government s health regulator said wednesday in a letter to the ceo of sunshine state health plan inc of tampa the agency for health care administration also demanded detailed explanations for how the problems occurred and how the company responded it also required the company to demonstrate within 30 days that future claims were being paid promptly and asked for weekly updates in phone calls with the ceo nathan landsbaum or another senior executive the payment problems left families in florida with critically ill children who relied on medicaid paid health providers stranded they affected children receiving care under the company s sunshine health medicaid program and the children s medical services health plan it operates on behalf of the florida department of health for patients under 21 who are eligible for medicaid and who have serious chronic conditions a spokeswoman for sunshine state did not immediately respond to a phone message or emails asking whether the company intended to pay the large fine of 9 092 025 or planned to appeal the state said the fine was calculated as 75 for each failed payment claim the state s health care regulator also revealed that the number of affected claims 121 227 was far higher than sunshine state had previously acknowledged the company had previously said the problems affected one half of 1 of its 9 2 million total payment claims it processed during the period or about 46 000 claims the state identified problems that included denials for invalid diagnosis codes incorrect age restrictions claims processed under incorrect benefit packages and more sunshine state previously said the glitches stemmed from the company s merger on oct 1 with the second largest payment vendor wellcare of florida inc combined sunshine and wellcare have multi year contracts worth 31 6 billion from the state s agency for health care administration according to figures from the state s chief financial officer the billing problems were described in an investigative report last month by fresh take florida a news service at the university of florida college of journalism and communications the state s letter informing sunshine state about the fine was dated march 17 one day before a reporter s latest inquiries asking whether the company would be fined but was not released publicly until wednesday before then the payment problems drew almost no public attention sunshine acknowledged payment issues in a press release it published on its website jan 20 blaming it on an unspecified information technology problem and not hinting at the scale or seriousness of the issue dan miller 57 and his son with autism nathan miller 17 pose for selfies together in their house in lake worth contributed fresh take florida the payment problems were among the most serious technology meltdowns affecting one of the most vulnerable populations under the administration of gov ron desantis since unemployment claims overwhelmed florida s department of economic opportunity early in the pandemic the agency for health care administration in its letter acknowledged that sunshine state s billing problems were non willful the letter signed by florida s assistant deputy secretary for medicaid operations brian meyer also provided the company with instructions on how to dispute the fine which would have to take place within 21 days the company said last month the improperly rejected payments were all re processed by jan 31 but new interviews with health care providers demonstrated payment problems have been continuing in at least one case a company in orlando was asked to stay quiet before sunshine state would agree to pay part of the money it already owed the provider an executive said brendan ramirez a mental health advocate and ceo of pan american behavioral health services llc in orlando said he had spent months trying to recover payments he was owed from sunshine state ramirez said that during negotiations over the payments sunshine state s parent company centene corp asked him to sign a non disclosure agreement before he could receive 234 225 90 of what he said he was owed he provided a copy of the agreement which he declined to sign ramirez said the amount centene offered was less than the total he should have been paid they said before we wire money into your account we want you to sign this document ramirez said the agreement would have prohibited ramirez from publicly disclosing terms of his settlement with centene for the payment it did not include any provision that would have prevented ramirez from criticizing the company or talking to journalists i called them back and i said i m not signing this i m not comfortable with signing this it s almost like a document from litigation and we re not in litigation i m just trying to get money that you guys owe me he said ramirez said the company eventually paid him without a signed copy of the agreement he said he is still owed as much as 80 000 by the company he said it also has improperly denied about 100 000 more worth of claims submitted by his company centene s stock price closed at 82 46 down nearly 6 on wednesday other health care companies also were trading lower wednesday this story was produced by fresh take florida a news service of the university of florida college of

history suggests the recent dip in the stock market should be treated as a long term buying opportunity there s one surefire method to overcoming short term jitters in the stock market it has been used for decades among the world s most successful investors including the oracle of omaha warren buffett and it s incredibly simple the method invest for the long term past experience has shown that a falling market is the best time to buy shares in u s companies because in the long run the broader market has always recovered an index fund can be a great way to execute this strategy but if you re interested in buying individual stocks it can be helpful to focus on high growth companies operating in the industries of the future here are two stocks to get you started during the current tech sell off the case for tesla when it comes to electric vehicles evs tesla motors tsla 5 59 has become the most identifiable brand in the industry it s the leader in technology and sales and the company has even drawn praise from the ceo of car manufacturing giant volkswagen group for its innovative production processes in 2021 tesla delivered over 936 000 vehicles which was an 87 jump from 2020 that highlights how rapidly demand is rising for evs and the company is quickly growing alongside the industry with the recent addition of two gigafactories in texas and germany tesla has managed to build evs profitably which is something many detractors thought it wouldn t achieve in fact its automotive gross profit margin expanded to 29 3 in 2021 and it ll likely improve as the company continues to build scale and the gross profit margin is flowing through to the bottom line with earnings per share growing 666 to 4 90 last year for context key competitor ford motor company most recently had a gross margin of just 15 9 but tesla is more than just a carmaker its residential solar roof deployments grew 68 in 2021 and battery storage deployments were up 32 these will likely feature as important pieces of the tesla story as the technology becomes cheaper and more accessible for consumers evs are on track to dominate the car industry with one estimate suggesting they could account for 60 of total vehicle sales by 2050 but with global governments fast tracking green energy initiatives that could happen even more quickly therefore buying the top company in the business might be the way to go especially with its stock currently trading down about 25 from its all time high the case for uber technologies investors might be familiar with the concept of the gig economy where tech platforms connect consumers with workers providing various services uber technologies uber 2 50 is one of the strongest drivers of this phenomenon offering a way for people to work independently in mobility food delivery and freight delivery services as with any new and disruptive technology uber has faced challenges lawmakers around the world have raised concerns about the company treating its workers as contractors which deprives them of benefits and the united kingdom has even forced uber to begin classifying them as employees but the company has shown resilience by turning in a strong financial performance during 2021 with analysts expecting 2022 to be even better metric 2020 2021 2022 estimate cagr revenue 11 1 billion 17 4 billion 27 4 billion 57 uber has historically been a loss making company but in the fourth quarter of 2021 it managed to turn a profit of 0 46 per share the next step is to deliver positive earnings on a yearly basis and while analysts don t expect it to happen in 2022 the company appears to be inching closer to the mark uber stock has declined 46 from its all time high amid the tech sell off and it now trades at a price to sales multiple of 3 6 based on 2021 revenue its key competitor in the food delivery business doordash trades at a multiple of 7 8 more than double that of uber despite doordash having a less diverse business and less than a third of the annual revenue given uber s financial strength especially the fact its up and coming freight segment grew 245 in q4 2021 there s a legitimate argument to be made that uber stock should be trading significantly higher that combined with the ongoing expansion of the gig economy makes uber stock a great buy for the long run
a deadly tornado in new orleans has highlighted a shift tornados have shifted to the south and threaten lives and property in new areas outside the great plains example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video forget the wizard of oz tornadoes are causing far more deaths and destruction east and south of kansas these days and they re often doing it in the dark of night tuesday night s deadly tornado that struck the new orleans area is the ideal example of what experts say is the 21st century problem with twisters killer tornadoes have shifted a bit out of the vast emptiness of the great plains more into the southeast where there are more people to hit poorer populations and more trees to obscure twisters from view and if that s not enough these southeast twisters are more likely to strike at night when they are more dangerous here s a closer look at what s behind the shift why are tornadoes killing more people outside the great plains since 2000 nearly 89 of the 1 653 americans killed by tornadoes not counting this week s victims lived east of the dakotas nebraska kansas oklahoma and texas according to an associated press analysis of national oceanic and atmospheric administration data last year 100 people were killed by tornadoes in kentucky alabama illinois tennessee north carolina arkansas missouri louisiana mississippi and pennsylvania one person was killed in texas it s not so much a meteorology problem but a people one tornado experts said it s a function of the human built environment said victor gensini a professor of meteorology at northern illinois university who specializes in severe storms the mid south does get a lot of tornadoes but in the mid south we have more things to hit we have more bull s eyes on the dartboard we have more cities we have more weak frame housing stock tornadoes happen more often there at night which is exactly what we saw last night harold brooks a senior scientist at noaa s national severe storms laboratory said traditional 20th century tornadoes the type that make oklahoma and kansas famous are less deadly because they go for miles without anything in the way in 1991 he and his wife chased for 66 miles a tornado in oklahoma that had winds hit 286 mph it hit two barns no one but a few cows were hurt put that storm near new orleans at night and dozens of people would be killed probably many more in the southeast all it takes is a weather event to occur and you ll have people in the way brooks said does climate change have a role in 2018 brooks and gensini published a scientific study showing deadly tornadoes were happening less frequently in the tornado alley of oklahoma kansas and texas and more frequently in tornado fatality alley which is the mid south gensini said what s likely happening is that the west is getting drier because of human caused climate change which makes it harder for the air to become moist and unstable which is crucial for tornado formation they said the southeast is getting warmer air which holds more water vapor which creates that important instability gensini said climate models predict this type shift 50 years in the future or so yet it appears to be happening now gensini said but gensini brooks and university of ohio meteorology professor jana houser emphasized that they don t see a climate change signal in tuesday s deadly louisiana tornado there s a la nina a natural periodic cooling of parts of the pacific that shifts global weather patterns and that usually means more tornadoes in the southeast because of changes in the jet stream and moisture they said what s different about night tornadoes tuesday s nighttime tornado illustrated a problem because when twisters hit at night people can t see them coming as easily and often don t react as well the tornado experts said about three quarters of the tornadoes that hit oklahoma and other great plains states occur between 5 and 9 p m so people know when to expect them and its more daylight brooks said but in the southeast they can hit any time which means more often at night than in oklahoma making them more dangerous related articles whirlwind stories from those who survived the arabi tornado another reason they happen more at night in the southeast is because they happen more in the springtime and there are just fewer daylight hours gensini said spring storms are juicier and stronger than summer ones so they don t need the sun s daytime heat to add that extra kick of energy to spur tornadoes he said what about the landscape the southeast is also hurt by having more trees hills and buildings that block people s views of incoming storms when there s a tornado warning in the southeast often people are out to their front porch and they don t really see anything and it just kind of looks like you know a dark sky houser said they may be less likely to actually heed those warnings than if they are walking out their door and they see a tornado on the horizon even if it s far away so there s a little bit of geography that plays a role there any good news for the region

2000 nearly 89 of the 1 653 americans killed by tornadoes not counting this week s victims lived east of the dakotas nebraska kansas oklahoma and texas according to an associated press analysis of national oceanic and atmospheric administration data last year 100 people were killed by tornadoes in kentucky alabama illinois tennessee north carolina arkansas missouri louisiana mississippi and pennsylvania one person was killed in texas it s not so much a meteorology problem but a people one tornado experts said it s a function of the human built environment said victor gensini a professor of meteorology at northern illinois university who specializes in severe storms the mid south does get a lot of tornadoes but in the mid south we have more things to hit we have more bull s eyes on the dartboard we have more cities we have more weak frame housing stock tornadoes happen more often there at night which is exactly what we saw last night harold brooks a senior scientist at noaa s national severe storms laboratory said traditional 20th century tornadoes the type that make oklahoma and kansas famous are less deadly because they go for miles without anything in the way in 1991 he and his wife chased for 66 miles a tornado in oklahoma that had winds hit 286 mph it hit two barns no one but a few cows were hurt put that storm near new orleans at night and dozens of people would be killed probably many more in the southeast all it takes is a weather event to occur and you ll have people in the way brooks said does climate change have a role in 2018 brooks and gensini published a scientific study showing deadly tornadoes were happening less frequently in the tornado alley of oklahoma kansas and texas and more frequently in tornado fatality alley which is the mid south gensini said what s likely happening is that the west is getting drier because of human caused climate change which makes it harder for the air to become moist and unstable which is crucial for tornado formation they said the southeast is getting warmer air which holds more water vapor which creates that important instability gensini said climate models predict this type shift 50 years in the future or so yet it appears to be happening now gensini said but gensini brooks and university of ohio meteorology professor jana houser emphasized that they don t see a climate change signal in tuesday s deadly louisiana tornado there s a la nina a natural periodic cooling of parts of the pacific that shifts global weather patterns and that usually means more tornadoes in the southeast because of changes in the jet stream and moisture they said what s different about night tornadoes tuesday s nighttime tornado illustrated a problem because when twisters hit at night people can t see them coming as easily and often don t react as well the tornado experts said about three quarters of the tornadoes that hit oklahoma and other great plains states occur between 5 and 9 p m so people know when to expect them and its more daylight brooks said but in the southeast they can hit any time which means more often at night than in oklahoma making them more dangerous related articles whirlwind stories from those who survived the arabi tornado another reason they happen more at night in the southeast is because they happen more in the springtime and there are just fewer daylight hours gensini said spring storms are juicier and stronger than summer ones so they don t need the sun s daytime heat to add that extra kick of energy to spur tornadoes he said what about the landscape the southeast is also hurt by having more trees hills and buildings that block people s views of incoming storms when there s a tornado warning in the southeast often people are out to their front porch and they don t really see anything and it just kind of looks like you know a dark sky houser said they may be less likely to actually heed those warnings than if they are walking out their door and they see a tornado on the horizon even if it s far away so there s a little bit of geography that plays a role there any good news for the region

u s intelligence agencies see concrete evidence of war crimes by russian troops in ukraine the biden administration said wednesday as president biden arrived in europe to rally nato support for ramping up economic and military pressure against moscow russia launched fresh missile strikes against residential neighborhoods in kyiv and other key cities as the war reached the four week mark while ukrainian troops pressed ahead with a counteroffensive that liberated parts of makariv a strategic suburb west of the capital that came under attack by russian forces three weeks ago the counterattack dealt a blow to moscow s efforts to encircle kyiv but journalists visiting the enclave witnessed savage shelling and said russian occupiers continued to hold parts of the town russian troops have suffered heavy losses in ukraine including between 7 000 to 15 000 deaths since start of the invasion according to a new estimate by a senior nato military official advertisement airstrikes and shelling by russia have devastated civilian infrastructure across large swaths of the country including schools and hospitals the world health organization on wednesday said it had confirmed 64 attacks on health care facilities patients and medical workers during the nearly month old war killing 15 people and wounding 37 health systems facilities and health workers are not and should never be a target who director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said at a news conference rescuers rushed to rescue people beneath the rubble after a shopping district in northwest kyiv was shelled on march 20 ukraine s state emergency service said video the washington post such attacks are partly behind the white house s claim of war crimes by russian troops secretary of state antony blinken citing a careful review of intelligence assessments and publicly available imagery said the evidence appeared conclusive although it would have to be formally reviewed by a court blinken specifically pointed to russian strikes against facilities that clearly are identified as civilian advertisement putin s forces used these same tactics in grozny chechnya and aleppo syria where they intensified their bombardment of cities to break the will of the people blinken said in a statement their attempt to do so in ukraine has again shocked the world biden last week had called russian president vladimir putin a war criminal a remark that prompted the russian government to summon the u s ambassador to deliver a protest and blinken previously had said he believed war crimes had taken place biden is expected to echo some of the same themes in meetings with nato and group of seven leaders this week the president flew to brussels on wednesday for emergency summits and he is expected to make a stop in poland on friday amid preparations for the meetings nato secretary general jens stoltenberg announced the alliance would deploy new battle groups to countries on its eastern flank stoltenberg said four groups will be sent to bulgaria hungary romania and slovakia as part of an immediate response to russia s invasion of ukraine while leaders discuss longer term plans advertisement stoltenberg speaking to reporters in brussels also called on russia to stop its nuclear saber rattling referring to suggestions by russian leaders that nuclear weapons could be used to counter threats against moscow the nato chief vowed to help ukraine deal with possible chemical and biological attacks though he declined to offer specifics stoltenberg said china s role in the conflict will also be on the summit agenda china has provided russia with political support including by spreading blatant lies and disinformation he said allies are concerned that china could provide material support for the russian invasion the pentagon declined wednesday to rule out additional u s military deployments to eastern europe to reassure allies as a nato member the united states could feasibly fill at least some of the eastern european deployments but a senior u s defense official said he did not yet have details to share advertisement thousands of u s troops have been deployed to poland and other eastern european countries on what have been termed temporary assignments with no fixed end date in sight i think it s safe to assume that all of us will be looking at this going forward the senior defense official said speaking on the condition of anonymity according to ground rules set by the pentagon we re just not in a position right now to speculate the official said the first wave of a substantial aid package for the ukrainian military is on the way and should be arriving in the country very soon the package totaling 800 million authorized by the biden administration expands the size and scope of security assistance provided to ukraine including armed kamikaze drones that crash into targets thousands of antitank weapons and shoulder fired missiles that can bring down aircraft national security adviser jake sullivan speaking to reporters traveling with the president on air force one said biden would discuss possible new restrictions on russian oil and gas with european partners and also would coordinate with g 7 leaders on measures intended to prevent russia from evading sanctions sullivan said the united states would separately announce a new package of sanctions targeting individual russians including political figures oligarchs advertisement beth van schaack biden s ambassador at large for global criminal justice said the administration was continuing to gather information about possible war crimes in ukraine and planned to share its findings with international partners and organizations she said u s officials also were supporting efforts by the ukrainian prosecutor general s office and civil society groups to document events on the ground it s incredibly important to shed a light on what s happening within ukraine so that the people in ukraine understand that the world knows what they are suffering she told reporters at the state department prosecutors in poland which borders ukraine have launched a probe into alleged war crimes there and the international criminal court s prosecutor has also announced an investigation the united states is not a party to the international criminal court advertisement brian finucane a senior adviser at the international crisis group who previously served in the office of the state department s legal adviser said it was too early to say where war crimes charges were most likely to advance he said the united states ability to compile evidence and help other countries do the same could prove valuable to such proceedings in the future share this article share the statement itself does not move accountability forward but it does indicate the administration is taking concrete steps to assist accountability finucane said in moscow putin responded to western pressure with new retaliatory measures he announced that unfriendly countries including all european union states and the united states would now have to pay for their natural gas supplies in rubles putin said the move to be implemented within a week could bolster the ruble by raising demand for the russian currency swatting at western companies that have severed ties with russia he said unlike some colleagues we value our business reputation as a reliable partner and supplier advertisement crude oil prices crept upward wednesday as analysts anticipated a furthering tightening of energy supplies west texas intermediate crude the u s benchmark jumped about 5 percent to trade near 115 per barrel brent crude the international benchmark sailed past 121 50 per barrel up 5 4 percent the ruble has plummeted against major international currencies since the start of the invasion and the moscow stock exchange has been closed for a month russian officials announced the market will partially reopen thursday for trading in russian stocks russian leaders also swatted down a proposal by poland to send an international peacekeeping mission into ukraine warning that such a move could have dangerous consequences kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov called the idea very reckless telling reporters in moscow that a peacekeeping mission increased the risk of a contact between russian and nato forces which could have clear consequences that would be hard to repair russian foreign minister sergei lavrov also condemned the proposal arguing it would lead to a direct clash between russia and nato armed forces that everyone has not only tried to avoid but said should not take place in principle fighting between russian and ukrainian forces has settled into a grueling slog in recent days with invading forces appearing to lose momentum and in some cases forced into a retreat the pentagon said russia appeared to be pouring new energy into an offensive staged from the eastern ukrainian provinces that are under separatist control a seeming shift in strategy as the kremlin s assault continues to stall in other areas of the country russia enjoys a base of support in the areas of donetsk and luhansk where separatists have asserted a degree of independence from kyiv that has been formally recognized by moscow but not by the west elsewhere in the country however russians have been met with stiff resistance as they try to claim authority over population centers to the point where they have started to establish defensive positions outside ukraine s capital advertisement we now assess that the ukrainians have pushed them back further to the east and northeast of kyiv a senior u s defense official said speaking on the condition of anonymity under terms set by the pentagon that is a change from yesterday the official said russia had fired more than 1 200 missiles since the start of the invasion ukrainian officials have been particularly elated over recent military successes at makariv but a visit there wednesday by a team of washington post journalists found the town still contested russian forces retained control of roughly 15 percent of makariv after nearly three weeks of shifting battle lines according to the town s mayor there were no signs that any of the roughly 15 000 residents who have fled were returning as the post journalists entered the town ukrainian soldiers ordered them to leave warning them of incoming russian grad rockets minutes later the sound of shells falling was heard and black plumes of smoke rose over the town

menafn globenewswire nasdaq vancouver british columbia march 23 2022 globe newswire riley gold corp tsx v rlyg otcqb rlygf riley gold or the company is pleased to announce newly identified high priority geophysical targets resulting from its ongoing exploration programs at its tokop gold project tokop located in esmeralda county nevada tokop s land package includes more than 21 square kilometres sq km within nevada s prolific walker lane trend as a result of riley gold s cumulative exploration efforts to date tokop is now being interpreted to have two styles of mineralization within the project land package reference is being made to tokop north and tokop south within the global tokop project as the mineralizing systems tend to dominate by area the reduced intrusive related gold rirg orogenic system is better seen in the tokop north area while the low sulfidation epithermal system akin to the bullfrog mine is more prevalent in exposures in tokop south this release will focus on geophysics results from tokop north with additional results from the tokop south area forthcoming the goal of utilizing geophysics along with other exploration tools such as rock sampling soil sampling and structural mapping is to layer additional information in order to target and identify the best drill hole locations for success we have only been working on tokop for a little over a year and have made considerable progress in understanding previous work and augmenting that information with our own exploration in preparing a geological model for discovery of a gold deposit this includes the epithermal mineralization in the southern portion of the project tokop south which was recently identified as a secondary style of mineralization and augments the intrusive related main tokop area tokop north our collective work completed last year has culminated into several high priority drill targets that we are excited about and are advancing towards being drill ready stated todd hilditch ceo of riley gold corp geophysics ground magnetics and gravity surveys were conducted by magee geophysical of reno nevada during the fall of 2021 at tokop raw data was provided to jim wright of wright geophysical in spring creek nevada for interpretation and assistance in targeting future drilling preliminary interpretation suggests several targets that coincide with recent mapping and surface sampling the data are simultaneously being added to ongoing modeling that includes drilling surface mapping as well as rock and soil sample data magnetic lines were run ne sw every 200 metres m several anomalies of interest have confirmed previously identified prospects which are now at the drill ready stage of exploration these anomalies primarily represent alteration via magnetite destruction as well as potential carbonate skarn targets in precambrian carbonate units wyman formation and reed dolomite additionally the survey indicates a deeper intermediate intrusive potentially related to the rirg mineralizing event the gravity survey was conducted on a 200 m grid gravity data revealed the potential for very prospective drill targets that appear relatively shallow in the newly defined target areas for example drill targets are indicated near strong gravity gradients and relatively large areas of low density possibly altered rocks gravity has also aided in understanding depth to bedrock under pediment cover in areas which mineralization is predominantly concealed the current interpretation of the ground magnetic dataset comes after an initial round of prospect scale and regional scale mapping at tokop the riley gold team has found that subdued magnetic highs are primarily associated with granitoids of the sylvania pluton but are also associated with the shaley carbonate wyman formation figure 1 tokop north ground magnetics survey overlain by rock soil samples and structural interpretation prospect scale mapping observations include intermediate dike swarms often associated with magnetic highs while small intermediate dikes at the surface are not large enough to visualize at the survey s resolution these mapped dikes are thought to overlie a larger intermediate intrusive at depth it is clear from ground magnetic data that the same structural fabric observed at tokop extends beyond the main area within tokop north which was drilled in 2021 by riley gold surface rock sampling trends in the locations of historic adits and shafts and subsequent drilling indicate that mineralized faults at main strike northwest this same northwest trend in mineralization is noted in the cabin area to the southwest of main additionally faults which strike north south are also confirmed to host mineralization based on mapping and sampling these northwest and north south faults have been truncated by northeast trending faults which are thought to be post mineralization initial structural interpretation on the tokop property has been further confirmed with ground magnetic geophysics based on the trends of magnetic highs figure 2 cabin prospect structural interpretation rock soil samples results overlain on ground magnetics rtp res dem figure 3 cabin prospect gold bearing quart breccia vein with mapped strike length of 500 m possibly extending further under cover photo taken from historic cut located at structural intersection highlighted with a red ellipse on figures 1 2 photo view northeast geologic overview recent work at tokop has revealed more than one style of gold mineralization and host rock one is a rirg system hosted in granitoids and carbonate units while the other a system is typical walker lane style epithermal mineralization hosted in tertiary volcanics ammonia tanks tuff as well as wyman formation carbonate this style of mineralization is more akin to ore deposits approximately 30 miles south and east of the project like those of the bullfrog district deposits of the bullfrog district surrounding beatty nevada are low sulfidation volcanic and sedimentary hosted epithermal gold deposits like the bullfrog mine operated by barrick gold which produced over 2 3 million ounces of gold and 3 0 million ounces of silver from 1989 1999 i from open pit and underground workings additional exploration and deposit development in the bullfrog district includes work by corvus gold now anglogold coeur mining kinross and augusta gold corp the rirg model is similar to large mines in the tintina gold belt of central alaska and contiguous parts of the yukon the best known and most economically important of these include fort knox 8 0 m oz gold produced through 2020 with an additional 2 47 m oz p p reserve ii pogo gold mine 4 0 m oz gold produced through 31 march 2021 with additional 3 956 m oz m i resource and 1 740 m oz inferred resource iii and the eagle mine of the dublin gulch properties in the yukon m i resource of 2 98 m oz gold iv at tokop similar to those mines sheeted quartz veins in a multi phase reduced calc alkaline granitoid intrusive as well as surrounding metamorphosed sedimentary rocks coupled with widespread hydrothermal alteration may host gold mineralization of significant potential shear hosted veins extend for nearly two kilometres along strike at tokop to date sampling of these vein systems returned grades of up to 71 73 gpt gold and 970

were producing in aggregate slightly more than 4 0 mmcf d net or 4 6 mmcf d working interest gas production prior to shut in michael raleigh ceo commented during the past year the company performed exceptionally well with ebitda and free cash flow rising significantly year over year our cash balance grew roughly 100 to 27 mm even with our share repurchases of 2 4 mm and the company remains debt free we expect to benefit in this more constructive price environment throughout the remainder of the 2022 calendar year as consolidation coupled with capital discipline provides support for constructive commodity prices the e p industry has committed to capital spending restraint and generating free cash flow rather than simply expanding production the new paradigm is flat or slight 5 or less y o y production growth and living within cash flow we continued our measured appraisal program on our meramec acreage in oklahoma in early 2022 the company will complete 2 gross 55 net wells during early april 2022 the timing of these completion operations coincides with our expectation for very constructive prices for oil and natural gas liquids our evaluation of these two wells will inform our decision regarding further appraisal and development in 2022 after evaluating our capital expenditures strong balance sheet and outlook for 2022 we expect another solid year of cash generation the board of directors elected to expand our commitment to returning capital to shareholders through additional share repurchases and the initiation of a quarterly dividend all dividends

reserves recovery timing and amount of capital expenditures ability to transport production marketability of oil and natural gas royalty rates the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs all of which may vary materially from actual results for those reasons estimates of the oil and natural gas reserves attributable to any particular group of

may vary the actual reserves of the company may be greater or less than those calculated in addition the company s actual production revenues development and operating expenditures will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material statements relating to reserves are deemed to be forward looking statements as they involve the implied assessment based on certain estimates and assumptions that the reserves described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and can be profitably produced in the future there is no assurance that forecast price and cost assumptions will be attained and variances could be material proved reserves are those reserves which are most certain to be recovered there is at least a 90 probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimated proved reserves undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure for example when compared to the cost of drilling a well is required to render them capable of production they must fully meet the requirements of the reserves classification proved probable to which they are assigned proved undeveloped reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty and are expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure is required to render them capable of production the estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same confidence level as estimates of reserves and future net revenue

will a new delaware supreme court ruling regarding directors and officers liability insurance make it more difficult for your company to get future claims covered a recent ruling by the delaware supreme court interpreting a related claims provision in a d o policy refused to endorse a bright line test that would enable policyholders to better understand when multiple claims made in different policy periods may be deemed a single claim made in one policy period a bright line test would provide some needed consistency to applying related claims provisions in the absence of such a test insurance companies generally take whatever position will minimize their payouts when treating two claims as one would narrow coverage to the limits of a single policy insurance companies broadly interpret what makes claims related however when the applicable self insured retention is larger than the value of any of single claim the insurance company will narrowly interpret these same provisions in the hopes that multiple claims will result in multiple retentions placing any possibility of coverage out of reach the delaware case at issue is first solar v national union first insurance co which was decided on march 16 2022 it arose out of a coverage dispute in which the insurance company denied coverage of a new securities lawsuit against the insured the insurance company asserted that the new claim was related to an earlier class action lawsuit and applied a related claims provision to the new claim the related claims provision in the policy aggregated all claims alleging arising out of based upon or attributable to the same or related wrongful acts because the limits of the policy in effect when the prior lawsuit had been exhausted by the payment of defense and settlement costs in the class action the insurance company s position effectively left no remaining coverage for the newer securities lawsuit in the resulting coverage litigation the trial court addressed this dispute by applying what it called the fundamentally identical standard to the related claims provision under this standard claims are related if the subject of the claims is the exact same it was not enough for the claims to share thematic similarities the trial court granted the insurance company s motion to dismiss on grounds that the claims were related because both lawsuits alleged the same fraudulent scheme artificially raising stock prices by misrepresenting first solar s ability to produce solar electricity at costs comparable to the costs of conventional energy production on appeal the delaware supreme court affirmed the trial court s ruling but rejected its reasoning it observed hether a claim relates back to an earlier claim is decided by the language of the policy not a generic fundamentally identical standard using the same or related wrongful acts language in the policy s related claims provision the appellate court concluded that the lawsuits were related because the thrust of the wrongful acts alleged in the two actions is the same even if there were minor differences in the specific allegations or the damages sought what does this mean for d o policyholders first the first solar case highlights the fact that in the end insurance policies are contracts where the rules of contract interpretation are applied to the particular words of the contract as sold to the policyholder following that logic the court reasoned that the issue as to whether two claims are deemed related might depend on the precise wording of the related claims provision for example does the provision require a thematic or merely a causal relationship second a best practice is to consider the impact of this decision when buying a d o policy are there scenarios in which the company would prefer to separate old claims and new claims as clearly as possible or vice versa a best practice would be to evaluate the terms and conditions in new policies along with other factors that might have an effect on how a related claims provision could impact the policyholder third whether in the market for a new d o policy or involved in a coverage dispute over an existing policy policyholders are well served to consider the arguments that an insurance company might assert to try to limit or eliminate coverage it is always a best practice to be better prepared to explore solutions that maximize coverage options and respond to insurance company efforts to wriggle out of coverage

will a new delaware supreme court ruling regarding directors and officers liability insurance make it more difficult for your company to get future claims covered a recent ruling by the delaware supreme court interpreting a related claims provision in a d o policy refused to endorse a bright line test that would enable policyholders to better understand when multiple claims made in different policy periods may be deemed a single claim made in one policy period a bright line test would provide some needed consistency to applying related claims provisions in the absence of such a test insurance companies generally take whatever position will minimize their payouts when treating two claims as one would narrow coverage to the limits of a single policy insurance companies broadly interpret what makes claims related however when the applicable self insured retention is larger than the value of any of single claim the insurance company will narrowly interpret these same provisions in the hopes that multiple claims will result in multiple retentions placing any possibility of coverage out of reach the delaware case at issue is first solar v national union first insurance co which was decided on march 16 2022 it arose out of a coverage dispute in which the insurance company denied coverage of a new securities lawsuit against the insured the insurance company asserted that the new claim was related to an earlier class action lawsuit and applied a related claims provision to the new claim the related claims provision in the policy aggregated all claims alleging arising out of based upon or attributable to the same or related wrongful acts because the limits of the policy in effect when the prior lawsuit had been exhausted by the payment of defense and settlement costs in the class action the insurance company s position effectively left no remaining coverage for the newer securities lawsuit in the resulting coverage litigation the trial court addressed this dispute by applying what it called the fundamentally identical standard to the related claims provision under this standard claims are related if the subject of the claims is the exact same it was not enough for the claims to share thematic similarities the trial court granted the insurance company s motion to dismiss on grounds that the claims were related because both lawsuits alleged the same fraudulent scheme artificially raising stock prices by misrepresenting first solar s ability to produce solar electricity at costs comparable to the costs of conventional energy production on appeal the delaware supreme court affirmed the trial court s ruling but rejected its reasoning it observed hether a claim relates back to an earlier claim is decided by the language of the policy not a generic fundamentally identical standard using the same or related wrongful acts language in the policy s related claims provision the appellate court concluded that the lawsuits were related because the thrust of the wrongful acts alleged in the two actions is the same even if there were minor differences in the specific allegations or the damages sought what does this mean for d o policyholders first the first solar case highlights the fact that in the end insurance policies are contracts where the rules of contract interpretation are applied to the particular words of the contract as sold to the policyholder following that logic the court reasoned that the issue as to whether two claims are deemed related might depend on the precise wording of the related claims provision for example does the provision require a thematic or merely a causal relationship second a best practice is to consider the impact of this decision when buying a d o policy are there scenarios in which the company would prefer to separate old claims and new claims as clearly as possible or vice versa a best practice would be to evaluate the terms and conditions in new policies along with other factors that might have an effect on how a related claims provision could impact the policyholder third whether in the market for a new d o policy or involved in a coverage dispute over an existing policy policyholders are well served to consider the arguments that an insurance company might assert to try to limit or eliminate coverage it is always a best practice to be better prepared to explore solutions that maximize coverage options and respond to insurance company efforts to wriggle out of coverage

federal emergency and recovery benefits mitigated the pandemic s economic impact march 23 2022 gatineau quebec employment and social development canada since the start of the covid 19 pandemic the government of canada has taken action to support canadians and the canadian economy the economic shock wrought by the pandemic required an unprecedented government response to help canadians weather its aftereffects today minister of families children and social development karina gould welcomed the results of the 2020 canadian income survey which showed that the government s swift action in 2020 resulted in a substantial decrease in canada s overall poverty rate federal emergency and recovery benefits introduced in 2020 through canada s covid 19 economic response plan in addition to programs at the provincial territorial and municipal levels played a key role in mitigating the pandemic s impacts among vulnerable populations between 2019 and 2020 the overall poverty rate fell by more than one third from 10 3 to 6 4 representing over 1 4 million fewer canadians living in poverty including 332 000 children and 162 000 seniors in particular the supports introduced in 2020 helped lift canadians with the lowest income those who were on the brink out of poverty in addition income inequality in 2020 was at its lowest level in 45 years which demonstrates meaningful progress towards the government s goal of building a more inclusive and resilient economy the poverty rate in canada has decreased steadily since 2015 while the results in the 2020 canadian income survey are encouraging they must be considered in the context of a year which saw unprecedented and temporary government income support measures as canada continues its recovery from the pandemic with february 2022 seeing unemployment rates falling below pre covid 19 levels for the first time the government will continue to work to ensure a strong recovery for everyone

a deadly tornado in new orleans has highlighted a shift tornados have shifted to the south and threaten lives and property in new areas outside the great plains example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video forget the wizard of oz tornadoes are causing far more deaths and destruction east and south of kansas these days and they re often doing it in the dark of night tuesday night s deadly tornado that struck the new orleans area is the ideal example of what experts say is the 21st century problem with twisters killer tornadoes have shifted a bit out of the vast emptiness of the great plains more into the southeast where there are more people to hit poorer populations and more trees to obscure twisters from view and if that s not enough these southeast twisters are more likely to strike at night when they are more dangerous here s a closer look at what s behind the shift why are tornadoes killing more people outside the great plains since 2000 nearly 89 of the 1 653 americans killed by tornadoes not counting this week s victims lived east of the dakotas nebraska kansas oklahoma and texas according to an associated press analysis of national oceanic and atmospheric administration data last year 100 people were killed by tornadoes in kentucky alabama illinois tennessee north carolina arkansas missouri louisiana mississippi and pennsylvania one person was killed in texas it s not so much a meteorology problem but a people one tornado experts said it s a function of the human built environment said victor gensini a professor of meteorology at northern illinois university who specializes in severe storms the mid south does get a lot of tornadoes but in the mid south we have more things to hit we have more bull s eyes on the dartboard we have more cities we have more weak frame housing stock tornadoes happen more often there at night which is exactly what we saw last night harold brooks a senior scientist at noaa s national severe storms laboratory said traditional 20th century tornadoes the type that make oklahoma and kansas famous are less deadly because they go for miles without anything in the way in 1991 he and his wife chased for 66 miles a tornado in oklahoma that had winds hit 286 mph it hit two barns no one but a few cows were hurt put that storm near new orleans at night and dozens of people would be killed probably many more in the southeast all it takes is a weather event to occur and you ll have people in the way brooks said does climate change have a role in 2018 brooks and gensini published a scientific study showing deadly tornadoes were happening less frequently in the tornado alley of oklahoma kansas and texas and more frequently in tornado fatality alley which is the mid south gensini said what s likely happening is that the west is getting drier because of human caused climate change which makes it harder for the air to become moist and unstable which is crucial for tornado formation they said the southeast is getting warmer air which holds more water vapor which creates that important instability gensini said climate models predict this type shift 50 years in the future or so yet it appears to be happening now gensini said but gensini brooks and university of ohio meteorology professor jana houser emphasized that they don t see a climate change signal in tuesday s deadly louisiana tornado there s a la nina a natural periodic cooling of parts of the pacific that shifts global weather patterns and that usually means more tornadoes in the southeast because of changes in the jet stream and moisture they said what s different about night tornadoes tuesday s nighttime tornado illustrated a problem because when twisters hit at night people can t see them coming as easily and often don t react as well the tornado experts said about three quarters of the tornadoes that hit oklahoma and other great plains states occur between 5 and 9 p m so people know when to expect them and its more daylight brooks said but in the southeast they can hit any time which means more often at night than in oklahoma making them more dangerous another reason they happen more at night in the southeast is because they happen more in the springtime and there are just fewer daylight hours gensini said spring storms are juicier and stronger than summer ones so they don t need the sun s daytime heat to add that extra kick of energy to spur tornadoes he said what about the landscape the southeast is also hurt by having more trees hills and buildings that block people s views of incoming storms when there s a tornado warning in the southeast often people are out to their front porch and they don t really see anything and it just kind of looks like you know a dark sky houser said they may be less likely to actually heed those warnings than if they are walking out their door and they see a tornado on the horizon even if it s far away so there s a little bit of geography that plays a role there any good news for the region

this article appears in the march 25 2022 issue of executive intelligence review may 4 2001 winning the ecumenical battle for the common good editorâ s note this presentation was first published in eir vol 28 no 19 may 18 2001 pp 21 31 the following is lyndon h larouche jr â s keynote address to the may 4 6 2001 schiller institute conference in bad schwalbach germany a report on that conference and the speeches given there by russian economists dr sergei glazyev and prof stanislav menshikov are available in the may 18 2001 issue of eir further links to the full conference are available here we face at this point a turning point in history the story is that the secret service of the united states wanted to get a dummy to use for security purposes as a duplicate for president george bush to get the dummy with the exterior appearances was not too difficult but to get a dummy who would function with a certain amount of verisimilitude was more difficult but fortunately hewlett packard stepped in and together with texas instruments they found some scrap discard from their production line and by inserting these non functioning components into the dummy they made one that would sound and talk exactly like president george bush now this is actually quite a serious business because he is a dummy heâ s obviously a mental case and this was not a secret prior to the time he was elected the question you have to ask is when you look at the way the election was riggedâ between two dummies one a psychotic and another stupid and psychotic al gore and bush both equally evil one would have been as bad as the other but the fact that the election campaign in the press and by the leading parties was limited to these two dummies who said nothing about anything of importance that they were going to do or that was going to happen to the united states or the world they were put in the front position and by an unconstitutional act by a bunch of fascists on the supreme court one of them was selectedâ george bush did they know they were doing that did the group of wealthy financial powers and the law firms associated with them in new york boston washington d c chicago and houston know that these were a pair of dummies did the leading news media which are controlled by this establishment know this was a pair of dummies of course they did thus therefore you have to say that george bush is not the issueâ heâ s the afterbirth george was someone who was selected with malice aforethought to become the president of the united states under the worst condition of world financial collapse in all modern historyâ the biggest financial collapse of all human history including pre history because they didnâ t have such big finances back then therefore this was done why would this crowd put a cheap imitation adolf hitler into the white house at this time because they wanted the effect of having this kind of vicious mad dog dummy in the white house at this time they did not wish to have a president who could think because he might start thinking and that might cause problems for them a fascist movement what is at stake at present is the attempt by an international oligarchyâ which is largely centered among the five thieves that is the four kingdoms controlled major kingdoms controlled by the british monarchy the united kingdom canada australia new zealand and the associate member of the british commonwealth the united statesâ to have the oligarchical powers of these combined powers establish a de facto world dictatorship by methods of terrorism by methods of intimidation by using the threat of what remains of military power in the world to try to intimidate the world into capitulating to this kind of dictatorship it was very much like hitler in the bunker where george bush went into the white house as hitler in the bunker from the beginning he didnâ t have to wait all those years to get in the bunker so what you face is an attempt to intimidate the world into submission to something that the world doesnâ t like out of pure fear and to understand what is going to happen in the united states all those fools that thought that maybe they could deal with bush that maybe bush was just a change for a different flavor from a clinton administration were fools and many parts of the world thought we can work with bush many people in europe said we can work with bush â oh we know rumsfeld we know cheney from the old days we can reach them we can influence them yes bush is crazy but weâ ll work together with these people we know theyâ ll come around theyâ ll help us deal with this situation donâ t worry itâ s going to be under control â itâ s not going to be under control bush is a perfect fascist we donâ t have a fascist regime yet in the united states but we have a fascist party in power within the republican party represented by a president whoâ s an integral part of that this man is a nietzschean personality and if youâ ve watched some of the things that heâ s done and his administration has done they do not consider the consequences of their actions what they have done as financial emergency actions were stupid absolutely stupid what they have done will make everything worse they will not control anything they will make nothing better they will control nothing theyâ re going to go from crisis to crisis as you see the case of this sharon phenomenon we are on the edge of what could become a nuclear war in the middle east this warâ sharon is deployed totally with the backing personally of president george bush the intention is to have a war in the middle east itâ s not a question of somebody might provoke the israelis into launching they donâ t need to be provoked they are already provoked to launch the war itâ s like hitler invading poland it was not something the poles did that provoked hitler into invading poland he intended to do it it was not something the soviet union did that provoked hitler into launching barbarossa he intended to do it when he wrote mein kampf and his bosses intended it should happen weâ re in the period where this nietzschean triumph of the will like an adolf hitler nuremberg rally is the characteristic the mental state of the president of the united states to the extent he has a mental state and is the mental state of his attorney general or the falwells or the robertsonsâ you know these religious fanatics who are not christians or anything else theyâ re just fanatics this is a fascist movement the theory of government in the united states as typified by the decision of the supreme court majority is fascist it is the mentality of the carl schmitt in germany whose influence on law designed the notverordnungen that made hitler a dictator in germany this is their mentality their mentality is that of hegel who was the first philosopher of fascism in modern europe who used the case of the napoleon model to write a theory of the state which was then copied by carl schmitt for schmittâ s doctrine now in the united states as a friend of ours now deceased professor von der heydte pointed out the danger of fascism from the types like bush and his father in the united states is worse than the danger of fascism from hitler in germany because in the case of germany the nazis were constrained by the powerful influence of a cultural restraint they did not dare attack the german culture openly and that imposed a limitation on hitlerâ s freedom for action in the end it didnâ t make much difference but it was different in the united states the dominant ideology is radical positivism which is the perfect ideal for fascism fascism in the united states would be worse than we have seen in any part of the world unless we stop it because there are no constraints there is no cultural constraint no limit and this group was put in to establish a roman empire of a new type a globalized empire you see what they did in peru even before bush was in there you see what theyâ re doing today and have done in the philippines you see what theyâ re doing in various parts of the world theyâ re toppling governments according to the law of schmitt we have a fascist government already in venezuela the chã vez government the chã vez government is based on the philosophy of the same carl schmitt whose design of law was used to bring hitler into power in germany and we have the chã vezes and people that are alike throughout ibero america among the followers of the influence of savigny and schmitt in law view full size white house eric draper inset gustav adolf schultze worst financial crisis in history so this is what we face we have the worst financial crisis in world history we have a crisis in which the ruling financial powers of this world are doomed thereâ s nothing that can save them thereâ s nothing that can save this systemâ itâ s finished itâ s over but nonetheless theyâ re determined that if they die everybody else will die first and therefore they will do what they can to enslave the world into meeting their conditions their financial and economic and other conditionalities and to overthrow every government that they donâ t like to manage the world by causing wars and threat of wars and incidents their policy is one of global crisis management including the deliberate provocation and launching of wars now as you may have observed most of the countries of the world including those in which many people were foolish enough to believe they could work with george bush or work with the new administration or that it wonâ t be so bad or that the collapse wonâ t actually come that somebody will control itâ they were fools and that illusion is essentially over you saw what happened at the united nations the repudiation of the united states on several issues in the human rights commission and several other things this past weekend thereâ s a revolt even among the traditional slaves of the united states and britain in continental europe against this danger they just donâ t quite know what to do about it thereâ s a sense of this in china thereâ s a sense of this in russia thereâ s a sense of this in other parts of the world that this is not an administration with which one can hope to live you cannot marry this administration and expect to survive this is the worst case of a bipolar personality without much sweetness in it that you can imagine itâ s not the kind of person to marry if you want to live the axe may come down at night instead of the loving so thatâ s the situation we face and thereâ s no way in which this is going to be worked out neatly what this is going to do is lead not only to an accelerated financial crisis for example during the past approximately one year the u s financial market in terms of indexes of market values has actually lost openly 5 trillion and has actually lost more than 10 trillion that is when the accounting is done it will be seen retrospectively that in the past approximate year the united states financial markets have lost over 10 trillion now to see what 10 trillion means is this the total gdp of the united states before this collapse came on was estimated at 11 trillion a year so the amount of collapse the financial collapse of the u s markets in the past year approximates the total annual gdp income of the united states the total gdp income of all nations of the world combined is estimated at 42 trillion which means that the collapse of the united states financial values in the past year approximates 25 of the total gdp of the entire world the amount of debt outstanding if you include the off balance sheet debt including derivatives debt is in excess of 400 trillionâ more than ten times the annual estimated gdp of the entire world these debts are based largely on leverage these are not simple debt theyâ re not debts at simple interest theyâ re debts based on value which depend upon a compounded gain in financial values the united states is bankrupt you look at the employment in the united states most people donâ t work any more especially people that are employed theyâ re employed in services which contribute essentially nothing to the economy theyâ re make work instead of cooking hamburger in your kitchen if you still eat one these days you go to a mcdonalds or someplace like that and you have somebody working at cheap slave labor processing that for you this is typical of everything in the united states the great majority of people are employed in professions which from a strict economic standpoint in terms of priorities are useless the number of people who actually produce anything of value is diminishing constantly what has happened is a number of things the social program since 1963 but especially since 1972 has been a social program of trying to buy off the population by creating service employment unskilled personal services financial services and so forth as a way of keeping the population reasonably unemployed in terms of income by increasing the number of jobs they work in order to get this income and reducing constantly the number of people who are actually producing wealth now most of the wealth of the united states in the recent period comes from several sources which are interesting first of all the united states has shipped its employment out of the united states into cheap labor markets around the world of which china is an example south americaâ mexico in particular so the united states no longer produces its consumer goods many of its other goods are no longer produced in the united states the industries which used to produce these categories of production have been largely shut down people kicked out of these employments have gone into services as gas station attendants or whatever just to give them something to keep them going theyâ ve been offered the chance to invest in markets which have been boosted with financial speculation with mutual funds in stock markets and other forms they put their pensions and their savings into those forms as long as the stock markets and other financial markets were inflating they thought their savings were increasing they were given the opportunity to borrow on credit with credit cards or other devices they were given the opportunity to take the equity they had in a house which was already mortgaged and to go to a second and third mortgage in order to pay their bills and to finance new purchases as part of their essential income and this comes in the order of 15 at 23 borrowing costs for this kind of thing people have been living on income they didnâ t earn the united states as a whole in terms of its income the current account deficit rate toward the end of last year was reaching levels as high as 600 billion annually that is the united states was spending from the world 600 billion more than it was earning and that was being leveraged on top of that through this speculation nations of the world have been relying on the u s market to dump their goodsâ china and other nations which are all going to suddenly take a depression theyâ re going to collapse because the imports into the united states have been collapsing and will continue to collapse at an accelerating rate which means that countries which have depended for a large part of their national income on the margin of exports to the united states are going to lose the greater part of that income at the same time the world has been investing in the united states both in direct investments and markets and into other forms of flows of capital into the united states for example one of the biggest sources of subsidy for the united states is japan japan loans money overnight at virtually zero percent interest the people borrow from japan at zero percent interest or relatively near that the yen they borrow they then use to buy dollars or euros or other currencies they then invest those other currencies chiefly in the u s market or the london market this amounts to trillions of dollars a year flowing into the united states in the form of financial inflows which is part of the leveraged effort to support the u s dollar and the u s financial markets the united states is bankrupt without going into other details i can tell you that every leading bank of the united states is hopelessly bankrupt the federal reserve system as a system is hopelessly bankrupt so youâ ve come to the point that to try to preserve this system you could no longer do it by management methods it can be done only with bayonets or similar devices and terrorism and that is what is happening view full size eirns stuart lewis for example as youâ ll note in another panel in this conference thereâ ll be a large reference to a fight around d c general hospital the effort to save it what is happening throughout the united states especially since 1997 is a shutting down of essential health care facilities such as hospitals whole categories of people are being triaged will no longer receive medical care while diseases infectious diseases are spreading around the world the death rates among vulnerable sections of the population those over 50 and so forth will increase those who are impoverished at higher rates so what we face here is a social crisis both within nations and among nations where the attempt of the bush administration to keep a system which is unsustainable together by dictatorial methods runs into headlong collision in the form of social crises with nations other nations with other parts of the world and inside the united states itself we have two major points of vulnerability in the united states and social crisis one is the energy crisis there is now scheduled at minimum about 120 to 150 increase in average energy costs for all u s families in the coming year there will be a global hyperinflation in energy costs under present conditions throughout the world including here in germany hyperinflation in energy prices is part of the package collapse of essential servicesâ health care other forms pensions these thingsâ are about to be looted and to be collapsed throughout the world at differential rates in different parts of the world the most vulnerable parts of the world will be the ones most looted where do we find a solution so therefore we come to a point of crisis what is the alternative to sitting back and either pretending this isnâ t happening or to simply complain about itâ s happening and protest wildly now humanity is different than animals animals under these conditions would simply go crazy but except for some of my opponents human beings are not animals human beings are cognitive and the characteristic of history is that when mankind uses his brain his mind and exchanges concepts with others which define an alternative to an impossible situation mankind will adopt an intention a governing intention of action to make some innovation in institutions to try to solve the problem therefore the most essential thing at this point is ideas ideas are the distinction between man and beast in any case the cognitive powers of mind are the distinction between man and beast and itâ s by addressing in times of crisis especially confronting mankind with the crisis encouraging it to face the reality that the impossible is about to descend upon them making it clear but thatâ s not enough you also have to provide a clear image of the feasible alternative what do we do instead view full size eirns stuart lewis once we have a population whose leadership organic leadership has a clear idea of what to do about the crisis then the fact that the majority of the human race has an interest in those ideas gives leaders who represent those ideas the ability to transform institutions especially institutions which are controlled by a tyrannical minority whose actions are contrary to the vital interests of the human species and therefore the most important concept at this point is not exactly a new concept but a fresh vision of an old one this is a concept which helga will address in her address tomorrow on the source of the idea of the modern nation state and the characteristic feature of the modern sovereign nation state for which there was a long struggle in europe and which came into being for the first time in the fifteenth century was the notion that there is no legitimate government except government which is efficiently committed to what is called the common good or the general welfare this is the principle on which the united states constitution is based the principle of the general welfare itâ s a concept which is reflected in the leading three paragraphs of the u s declaration of independence it is a concept for which man has fought it is the concept which his holiness pope john paul ii has affirmed in the past two weeks in a new statement on the anniversary of an old papal decree the concept of the general welfare that man is a special creature unlike the animals given a cognitive power a creative power and that man must be defended in principle because man is of this quality and there is no alternative to defending that kind of human nature it is the only basis of law on which we can be governed itâ s the only basis in law in concept by which you can lead this aching imperilled world out of the tragedy itâ s now embroiled in and lead it to a place of safety eurasian development and world recovery there are some practical considerations in this strategic ones and youâ ll see that the two focal points of this conference will turn out to be at the end as they are at the beginning the issue of eurasian recovery eurasian development as the pivot for world recovery including the role of russia as a very special part of any such recovery effort and the relationship of this eurasian commitment to the contrasting situation of africa in other words to understand the world as a whole in the simplest terms of reference look at the possibility of what we can do in eurasia and then look at the needs of africa in order to see humanity in its wholeness those who have the means to lift themselves up and those on whose behalf in the larger term they must act to lift them up too because the idea of the general welfare while itâ s a notion of government of each nation also must be a notion of the relationships among nations of the world we must find a community of principle in the notion of the general welfare to unite nations for a common good the common good is the general welfare of the nations of the people in each and of the community of nations as a group itâ s the only chance for this planet now to go to the question of the role of russia i addressed this in a seminar we had yesterday and i shall restate it again here germany like the rest of western europe and central europe is also bankrupt this is a condition which was installed immediately in 1989 through 1991 when the soviet system collapsedâ and was collapsed at that point since there was no credible adversary the anglo american powers led by margaret thatcher who was made prime minister out of the wreckage of a green grocerâ s daughter george bush a mental case the old george bush the young george bush came by his mental infirmities honestly itâ s only their money that they got dishonestly and franã ois mitterrand and these people set up a plan to prevent germany from surviving the reunification of germany and set up a plan to destroy eastern europe especially russia that was their plan and if you look at the history since 1989 1990 youâ ll see the result thatâ s exactly what happened it was intentional the plan was that they launched globalization to destroy the last vestige of the sovereign nation state on this planet through globalization to set up a modern financier oligarchical form of the roman empire this time on a world scale in which there would be one world government run out of london and washington in concert with canada australia and new zealand thatâ s what has been happening nato is a joke nobody takes it seriously nato is nothing but an appendage of the anglo american facility sometimes with french cooperation sometimes not there is no nato there is no sovereignty in europe a world empire is emerging with pagan roman characteristics and fascism to boot after all fascism is nothing but caesarism revived in the modern age that is the intention view full size erins maria schmitz under these conditions germany is being ruined and you see it with the chancellor or eichel every time they turn around theyâ re cutting more and more the situation is desperate the budget is unbalanced the french budget is unbalanced in italy theyâ re used to it itâ s always unbalanced so they put up with it better other countriesâ budgets are unbalanced theyâ re cutting and cutting but already theyâ re long below breakeven these nations cannot survive on their present budgets physically they are headed towards hell with no way out no exit in sight germany used to be the pivot of the european economy since they got rid of de gaulle in france and so forth and crushed italy most of western europe couldnâ t earn its own living the way it survived was through the margin contributed from germany a germany able to contribute to support the rest of the poor nations of europe they were all living on the german dole from germanyâ s high technology export capabilities and as long as those capabilities were maintained and they were up until about 1989 and the assassination of herrhausen then germany could sustain western continental europe but what was done to germany in the process of reunification the way the process was handled in the assimilation of the former east germany destroyed germany from within too and thus germany is at a point that it cannot survive and western europe cannot survive the way things are going so there is an obvious solution there is a great potential market under the proper conditions in asia in china in india other countries which represent the largest portion of the human population in a great area of particularly central and north asia which is one of the great frontiers of growth of all humanity an area of tundras and deserts and general underdevelopment through the mediation of russia which has the peculiarity historically of being a eurasian nation per se as a result of the aftermath of the mongol occupationâ through that mediation it is possible for europe to unite with russia and nations in asia to set up a long term system under which instead of consumer goods markets and investments for these countries you set up long term development of the productive powers of labor in these nations so youâ re talking about a generation or more that means a system of long term credit issued by those nations which are producing the greater part of the technology to the nations which need that supplement in order to get out of the mess theyâ re in this means a system of long term credit interest rates of the order of 1 per annum simple interest no compound interest long term agreements under which the great markets in south asia southeast asia east asia now come into a partnership with europe with russia with japan in order to create a great economic boom with some of the same features used to rebuild western europe in the immediate postwar period through the marshall plan and other plans a program for a generation of recovery a generation of progress a generation of development in order to make this work as has been understood for more than a century almost a century and a half the only way this could work was to develop a system of infrastructural development which would effectively link the atlantic ocean to the pacific ocean across eurasia this is not railroads this is not silk roads these are corridors of development which run a range of letâ s say up to 100 kilometers in width from the atlantic to the pacific going in various directions along these routes as we did in the united states with the transcontinental railroad the area on either side of the transportation axis becomes immediately in and of itself a sustainable area of economic development by that means you can branch out from the main corridors into subsidiary corridors of development and capture the area if we can make that kind of link one interesting kind of change occurs immediately how mankind developed for as long as we know mankindâ s economy has been dominated by the oceans contrary to all these theories that the british biblical archeologists tell you civilization did not come from england and march down the rivers and the seas it went the other way what we know from especially information on the internal characteristics of ancient astronomical calendars shows that they were predominantly calendars used by a trans oceanic maritime culture functioning over a long period of time when most of north eurasia was under a giant glacier for about 100 000 years during that period most of what later became civilization was running around the oceans from the time that these maritime cultures came back into eurasia following the melting of the glacier about 20 000 years ago when that began they began to move inland the first direction was to move along the great riverways inland to move along the coastways close to the seas and to maritime traffic if you look at the map of the world you find the characteristic of long development is the lack of the ability to utilize the inland areas the land locked areas of the world with the same degree of efficiency and productivity that was used in the coastal areas and chief riverways look at asia today in china you have the coastal areas which reflect this they are more highly developed relatively speaking and the inland is poorly developed the population has a poorer standard of living and poorer opportunities for development this extends then into central and north asia as a whole therefore if we conquer this area what happens take transportation alone people who donâ t think think that ocean freight is the cheapest way to move freight that is not true the cheapest way is across land but not by truck trucks running up and down the highway tell you that the economy is being dismantled it costs too much itâ s intrinsically bad railways are much better integrated transport systems featuring railways especially magnetic levitation systems are excellent magnetic levitation systems move passengers more rapidly but those same systems for moving freightâ that is really a wonder thatâ s where the payoff comes if you can move freight from rotterdam to tokyo at an average rate of 300 kilometers per hour without much stopping along the way and if for every 100 km of motion across that route you are generating the creation of wealth through production as a result of the existence of that corridor then the cost of moving freight from rotterdam to tokyo is less than zero what ocean freight can do that did you ever see a large supercargo ship producing wealth while travelling across the ocean and at what speed a turning point in technology therefore we have come to a turning point in technology where the development of the internal land mass of the world and the great typical frontier is central and north asia that is the greatest single opportunity before all mankind for development this requires some revolutionary changes in the way we think about things this means that we would be engaged in the greatest change in the environment in the history of mankind this single project say a 25 year or more development of central and north asia in this direction including the conquest of the tundra the arctic tundra is one of the great frontiers to be mastered and it can be done that would be a great change in the environment how are we going to decide what is good or bad about changing the environment what people think today about the environment is pretty stupid it doesnâ t make any sense people donâ t know what theyâ re talking about and when you see the kind of education they get itâ s no wonder they believe that nonsense especially those with physics degrees the great theory of the environment was established by a russian of ukrainian credentials vladimir vernadsky with his concept of geobiochemistry the problem is that what youâ re taught in most universities about science is nonsenseâ itâ s a damn lie to put it frankly what youâ re taught as basic physics is mostly a lie because as vernadsky demonstrated this in his own way and as others have shown there are actually three principles involved in manâ s physical relationship to the earth and the universe three categories one is what we call non living processes what most call physical processes the second which those in molecular biology refuse to understand is the principle of life you will never get life out of a non living process life is as pasteur insisted a principle unto itself a universal physical principle as vernadsky demonstrated with his biogeochemistry the oceans and the atmosphere were produced by living processes down several kilometers below the earthâ s surface most of the earth that we are in touch with as humanity was created was a by product of living processes with what vernadsky calls the â natural products of the biosphere â we can measure the power of the biosphere over the non living processes we can measure it living processes are superior to non living processes they are more powerful they are apparently weak but their long term effects are more powerful than the short term effects of non living processes the need for revolutionary discoveries there is a third thing which kant wonâ t let you knowâ thatâ s why they call him kant because he canâ t do anything the essential nature of man is that we are capable of making discoveries of universal physical principle discoveries we can validate in known experimental ways by applying these principles we increase our power in the universe in ways that can be measured physically per capita and per square kilometer we can measure this in terms of the demographic effect of this kind of action that is does the human species improve its life expectancy its power to exist in the universe as a result of this if it does that is good mankindâ s primary mastery of nature has occurred in terms of his mastery and development of the biosphere so actually the biosphere including what we call basic economic infrastructure such as waterways power systems transportation systems the development of good citiesâ these are natural products of cognition which are reflected as improvements in the biosphere the biosphere is weak it is stupid it does not know how to deal with the deserts it has or the tundras or other problems but we as human beings can come to our poor stupid slave the biosphere and say â we will educate you and we will make you stronger and better â so mankind intervenes in the biosphere to make it better the principle of discovery applied to the environment creates natural products of cognition in the biosphere which improves the biosphere which increases the potential for human life this is not a mysterious arbitrary area it is an area of science of scientific precision which means the job to do is not to ask whether it is good or bad to tamper with the environment itâ s very good to do so if you know what youâ re doing but you have to develop the science of water management the science of transportation the science of reforestation the science of how to change and control the atmosphere and the climate you canâ t make big mistakes they will live with you for a quarter of a century or more therefore you have to have competent groups of people determining how to do this but by changing the biosphere of central and north asia and changing the biosphere in the arid regions of china and so forth we will create the greatest boom for humanity on any part of this planet what we need is a mission oriented task force to undertake the policy planning for precisely this and it must be international the pivotal role of russia now the peculiar part of this is the case of russia russia has gone from communism to liberalism without passing â go â and certainly without getting 200 it got nothing it lost money on the deal the problem in russia is to define itselfâ once again intention this will work if russia adopts the intention of playing that role for itself in a eurasian development program that means leading russians must adopt such a perspective and the russian people must increasingly participate in that vision of the role of russia in changing the situation in eurasia and in russia itself under those conditions the role of russia as a pivot with other parts of eurasia is crucial how first of all there are conflicts of an historical and cultural nature along most of the nations of asia china and india for example china and japan korea with china and japan and so forth so that on a bilateral basis long term agreements among these nations are very difficult to manage however if you have a common mission with a common interest which involves a number of these nations together then you can bring them together in a system of cooperation this is the natural role in which russia can play a mediating part throughout eurasia this is what came up when primakov was prime minister on the triangular cooperation which we boosted very much and pushed for between china russia and india that is a viable idea it has to be given more legs to walk on and a mind to direct it in that sense in western europe where we could potentially revive the kind of high technology export potential which once existed here but western europe has to adopt a mission and central europe has to adopt a mission of participating in this development of eurasia as a group of sovereign nation states through instrumentalities which they create among themselves to facilitate this cooperation the object would be to bring the united states in to cooperate with that great venture and if you look at africa as we shall discuss here it has no chance it has been too looted unless it has help the help it requires is of the same nature the primary needs from the outside for africa are in the area of basic economic infrastructure particularly large scale extensible systems of infrastructure transportation links power grids water management the redistribution of water in africa could make a revolutionary difference africa needs assistance on this if africa is allowed to have the room to undertake its own development with that kind of assistance africa can develop this assistance must come from viable other parts of the world a prime case is eurasia if eurasia is developing prosperously then it will help africa but if the americas and eurasia are not developing there will be no help for africa and the penalty of what has been done to africa like an infectious disease will continue to destroy africa internally and otherwise therefore we should see this connection in this world eurasia is the great center of human population the conquest of the inner space of eurasia is a great focal point for a mission out of this process when we then turn to eurasian development to look to africa and see the misery there then we see a larger mission which exemplifies humanity as a whole that is our chance fdr fought for the general welfare principle in the united states we find as around the d c general fight which we have not won but which we are fighting as nobody thought we could or in the fight against deregulation of energy supplies we are finding a great response from within sections of the american population that have been disregarded and cast aside the lower 80 of family income brackets who have been out of politics essentially for much of the past quarter of a century or longer they are responding why because my friends and i are intervening with people in the democratic party all kinds of people to bring them together around the idea of establishing the general welfare as a general principle the reference to that is easy the general welfare principle as helga will indicate on sunday is an old principle in european civilization it is one of the characteristic benefits of european civilization to all of humanity the idea of the sovereign nation state as the alternative to empire that is the great contribution but in a recent period which is most comparable in immediate recollection to that of now in the great depression of the 1930s when stupidity similar to that which rules the united states today the stupidity of theodore roosevelt that fascist of woodrow wilson that ku klux klan racist the stupidity of coolidge who got himself into trouble every time he opened his mouth so he didnâ t talk at least not in public these people along with mellon destroyed the united states and destroyed a good part of the world then franklin roosevelt came in he had poliomyelitis he was crippled he fought against the crippling effects of polio during this period he restudied his own roots he was the descendant of a collaborator of alexander hamilton some centuries before he found again his roots in the american revolution and he brought forth as governor of new york and as candidate for president of the united states a conception which transformed that traditionally ultra racist party called the democratic party remember the democratic party was conceived as a racist treasonous party and remained so until roosevelt became president even though there were some decent people in it from time to time roosevelt changed that he changed that party from the party of racism and treason into a party committed to the promotion of the general welfare not that he was able to enforce with a sweep of the hand the general welfare but he fought to estï ½ablish the principle most important he fought to establish the principle in the minds of the american citizens see we are not emperors we can not with a wave of the hand declare a principle and then impose it by our will on people the way we convey a principle is as philosophers philosophers in action who convince people that that principle is the way in which they ought to live and act when a people are aroused to act for that principle then the great good comes no man is a god no man can decree by a wave of the hand and give the world something according to principle what a man can do an individual human being is to transmit ideas utilize ideas convey them to others the function of leadership is essentially that of a philosopher which few politicians seem to understand it is the philosopher who conveys and implants ideas in people ideas of principle like a scientist who conveys discoveries it is the implanting of those ideas in the social process the creation of political and other institutions around ideas which mobilize humanity to do a great work how we can win that is the lesson for today we are in the worst crisis of world history and the good side of it is there is no way you can cheat you either do it my way or youâ re doomed the other good side is that we can win but to win you have to think of philosophers in action not as agitators but as philosophers in action who take people who are living in a depraved mental state who are being selfishâ let me give you an example of the principle involved it may have occurred to you that we have each been born and it has occurred to most of you that all of us are going to die even george bush who may already be dead so when somebody talks about my self interest what is that if youâ re going to die what becomes of your self interest the minute you die your self interest in pleasure in gluttony in richesâ what happens to them they go your self interest is in having lived and having your life mean something to humanity you live for your self interest now most people are not capable of doing that not yet given the education system that is not surprising but when people are inspired to rise to that sense of their personal self interest that what they can do for mankind while they are alive is their self interest then they are capable of exerting leadership if they can do that they can arouse in people who all have this potential at least for a moment the ability to see that in themselves in the old times when people used to believe in having babies people would express that in a very simple way they would say â okay iâ m living iâ m sacrificing for our children and grandchildren â and children and grandchildren gave a way of focussing concretely on what your life meant and you would joyfully sacrifice for the sake of the future of these children and grandchildren you would vote and support actions by society soldiers were ready to die to save it not because they wanted to die but because they were ready to take the risk because they had a sense there was something more important than their mortal life itself itâ s what they do with it thatâ s important like a scientist how do you measure a scientist by what they contribute to humanity people whose names we know from thousands of years ago what was their self interest to be what they were great discoverers who benefitted all humanity after them great artists who uplifted all humanity after them a few of us have that developed commitment in former times more people had that kind of commitment which they expressed in terms of their obligations to improve society their family and so forth those values have more or less passed away during this decadent cultural period in which we have lived we have come to a time when people suddenly realize that â my money my money my money â is not the essence of humanity or life the essence of the ability to buy is not the essence of life it is being human that is the essence of life when people have taken away from them some of the false values to which they have clung too ardently sometimes they are forced to look and say â what is really valuable â sometimes for that reason it is the poor who are the best fighters for freedom because they have the least to lose and freedom means everything to them because they have nothing else except freedom so when we come to a time of great peril and depravity the secret is leadership the secret is the development and spread of ideas sound ideas which enable people to mobilize themselves about actions which will address the problem in such a moment when that occurs suddenly the majority of people are able to decide on how to run this planet and those few tyrants who dominate us become pitiful wrecks running into places of refuge or hiding or changing their identity thank you
imf ready to lend more to nigeria the managing director international monetary fund imf kristalina georgieva the international monetary fund imf has not foreclosed granting credit facilities to nigeria and other emerging economies within its membership it was learnt last night speaking during an online media parley in washington dc united states u s the imf said the facilities would come through its financial safety nets according to the imf the loans are to protect member countries from losing their financial security or derailing from long term financial goals it reiterated the importance of strengthening global financial safety net and ensuring that countries have access to support in the media parley transcript posted on its website imf called for actions to strengthen policy frameworks and reduce vulnerabilities in monetary policy fiscal policy and financial support for business we emphasise the importance of the global financial safety net and countries having access to that as appropriate including of course support from the imf which we stand ready to provide as needed by our membership it said a data from the debt management office dmo showed a rise in nigeria s total public debt from n32 92 trillion in 2020 to n39 56 trillion at the close of last year a breakdown of the debt statistics as at december 31 2020 showed that nigeria owes international development association ida 11 12 billion eurobonds 10 8 billion imf 3 53 billion and exim bank of china 3 26 billion among others the debt stock includes new borrowings by the federal government and sub nationals the borrowed funds are helping in financing the budget deficit capital projects and support economic recovery although nigeria s current debt to gross domestic product gdp 22 47 per cent is relatively low giving it room to borrow its inability to generate adequate revenue worsened its debt problem the debt to gross domestic product gdp ratio stood at 22 47 per cent compared to 21 61 per cent in 2020 at this level the ratio is within nigeria s self imposed limit of 40 per cent the world bank imf s recommended limit of 55 per cent for countries within nigeria s peer group and 70 per cent for ecowas countries nigeria s revenue to gdp ratio has remained low at nine per cent compared to countries such as ghana at 12 5 per cent kenya at 16 6 per cent angola at 20 9 per cent and south africa at 25 2 per cent the imf said the sharp rise in global oil prices represents important terms of trade shock with macro economic implications it will lead to higher inflation and current account deficit but the impact on the current account could potentially be partially offset by favourable movements in prices of commodities it added that evaluating the impact of monetary policy tightening by the federal government on emerging markets is more difficult now and should be done on a case by case basis given the considerable differentiation between countries investigation showed that many debts especially eurobonds contracts have non disclosure clauses and should be made more balanced to ensure transparency and credibility of the debt data the world bank and imf are working together to support implementation of the g20 common framework that requires greater transparency reconciling every country s debt with creditors
