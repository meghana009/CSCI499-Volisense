denver voters may soon choose whether to let the city take out a 400 million bond to fund numerous infrastructure projects as part of a long term covid 19 recovery plan the city announced the proposed general obligation go bond in april and the denver city council is set to begin voting on the proposal later this month if approved by council and the mayor voters will see the bond on the ballot in november the proposed bond is one of denver s many covid 19 relief efforts the department of finance says there is still 375 million left from the city s last general obligation bond elevate denver which passed in 2017 during the pandemic the city accelerated the distribution of elevate denver to issue 170 million to various projects 100 million more than originally planned for that period the city is also set to receive 308 million in federal relief funds from the american rescue plan in 2020 and 2021 and continues to spend the last of the 127 million denver received last year from the cares act this will be spent before the end of this year according to the department of finance because of this drastic influx in relief funding the proposal of another general obligation bond has raised questions among the general public and city officials alike about the need for funding and what it all means what are go bonds go bonds are a type of municipal bond that cities use to pay for projects the bonds are backed entirely by a city s creditworthiness and are paid back over decades using property taxes it is essentially a loan that the city takes out that is backed by property taxes said chief financial officer brendan hanlon we will ask voters for permission to incur debts we will go to a bank and lend money and then those funds will be paid back by way of property taxes denver has passed major citywide go bond programs every nine to 10 years to support rehabilitation projects or restore replace and expand capital assets go bonds require voter approval denver voters have ok d all but one of 11 bond packages sent to them since 1982 and the only one they rejected 325 million to fund a new justice center in 2001 was passed under a new package four years later the people of denver are really invested in investing in their community hanlon said they want a quality of life that they re proud of and the fact that we have to have the public vote on them means that we have to do all the leg work up front that due diligence that level of engagement means that we have far more support for the packages that we put on the ballot in recent decades denver s go bonds have ranged from 25 million for the auditorium theater in 2002 to 937 4 million for the elevate denver project in 2017 according to data from the department of finance the city passed go bonds in 1989 1990 1998 1999 2002 2003 2005 2007 and 2017 totaling just under 2 6 billion the three most recent bonds made up more than 70 of that total and are the three largest in denver s history at 378 million 549 7 million and 937 4 million respectively hanlon attributed the increasing size of go bonds to rising costs due to inflation and the challenges of a growing city however other city officials have criticized the city s willingness to borrow this extreme amount of money there seems to be a common perception that we must borrow money we hope we can pay back later to jumpstart the economy councilwoman candi cdebaca said after mayor michael hancock announced the proposed 2021 go bond a 400 million loan that you will be responsible for paying back long after he is no longer our mayor we just raised property taxes on all of you to generate revenues dollars we lost during the shutdown of 2020 it s just more of the same it will likely be a hodgepodge of favors and window dressing that will fail to address anything comprehensively in a visionary way in addition to concerns about paying back the bond others have questioned whether the city needs this funding at all the 2021 go bond package the proposed go bond called the 2021 rise denver go bond package would ask for approximately 400 million to bolster the city s investment in infrastructure for the next 10 years the bond would be a longer term addition to the immediate financial relief funding provided by the federal government elevate denver and other sources said julie smith with the department of finance the bond is intended to focus on infrastructure because the industry has historically supported denver s recovery from previous economic recessions by providing jobs and supporting multiple economic sectors smith said city data estimates that every 10 million spent on infrastructure results in 130 jobs 8 5 million in labor income and 20 million in economic output the infrastructure projects that would be funded by the bond come from a 4 billion list of capital improvement projects city officials are still working on narrowing the list to fit with the 400 million budget of the bond though there is not yet a set project list hanlon said the 400 million limit was chosen to stay within the current property tax levels to avoid a tax increase since go bonds are paid off by property taxes they can result in raised property taxes in the years or decades following their passage we started with a number because we wanted to make sure we understood what the affordability level of the project was and that we could actually issue the 400 million within the current tax rate hanlon said we could have gone higher but what we re trying to do is make sure we leave capacity for the next city council and mayoral administration during council meetings and press conferences several people have questioned the necessity of another go bond after denver s passed the 10 year 937 million elevate denver bond only four years ago elevate denver was the largest bond program in denver s history approved by voters in 2017 to enhance denver by improving the city s infrastructure including roads sidewalks parks recreation centers libraries cultural facilities safety facilities and public owned buildings to date approximately 562 million of the bond has been issued and 375 million is still available to be spent through 2027 according to city documents hanlon said though the 375 million hasn t been dedicated yet there are still several large construction and improvement projects under elevate denver that haven t been funded yet including the east colfax corridor bus rapid transit district 6 denver police station washington street reconstruction and 72nd and tower fire station featured local savings of the money already spent 33 13 has gone towards transportation and mobility systems 20 8 towards cultural facilities and 15 59 towards parks and recreation systems the rest has gone towards the denver health and hospital authority public safety facilities and the library system according to city documents also we have a spend down requirement that says when you draw down funds from a go bond you have to spend it within a three year period of time to meet irs tax guidelines hanlon said so we can t just issue all 937 because we d never be able to spend it within three years that s why you see that we still have 375 million regarding the 308 million denver is receiving from the american rescue plan hanlon said those funds are going to be focused on service restorations and business and community recovery while the proposed go bond would specifically be for infrastructure in addition the more relief funds that denver has the more federal money it can receive smith said if denver receives the american jobs plan from congress to fund qualifying projects the city must match 25 of the federal dollars to receive the funding which they could take from the go bond smith said the covid 19 pandemic s impact on the denver economy is the worst since the great depression the city government s revenue has declined by nearly 220 million which is equal to the full operating budgets of parks and recreation community planning and development denver public library trash collection department of public health and environment human rights and community partnerships and the office of climate action sustainability and resiliency combined our investment in recovery must take into consideration how far we have to go to recover in all areas smith said we are only beginning to see the first signs of recovery for our city what would the go bond be spent on working from the 4 billion project list a go bond executive committee has selected 134 projects totaling 1 7 billion as possible recipients of the proposed go bond said capitol budget manager emily snyder the committee comprised of eight community volunteers city council president stacie gilmore and city council pro tem jamie torres evaluated the projects based on equity city vision alignment economic impact safety accessibility resiliency readiness risk and financial planning snyder said the highest evaluated top tier projects total 585 370 000 and include the following improving or expanding the youth empowerment center westwood community center central library globeville library westwood library martinez park sun valley riverfront park and westwood recreation center rehabilitating the denver museum of nature and science constructing the national western center arena and historic 1909 building public market purchasing a homeless shelter on 48th avenue and various hotels motels for sheltering services citywide bike infrastructure sidewalk construction and pedestrian programs improving morrison road santa fe drive and santa fe street the go bond executive committee is now working with leaders in the city council to cut down and finalize the list of projects snyder said the final list will be submitted to the council for review before it can go to the ballot on thursday the city council budget committee met to discuss the current project list and several council members spoke out against the inclusion of the national western center arena according to city data construction of the arena would cost 170 million more than 40 of the 400 million go bond the arena was originally intended to be funded by a tourism tax which has taken a significant hit during the covid 19 pandemic officials said this volume of dollars going in one direction is troubling councilman paul kashmann said the projects suggested don t seem to be hitting all districts of the city of the current 21 top tier projects seven are in district 3 four are in district 9 one is in district 7 one is in district 8 one is in district 10 and seven are in multiple or unspecified districts even when accounting for the multi district projects no top tier projects are located in district 2 which is southwest denver councilman kevin flynn who represents district 2 pointed out the inequality in project distribution and criticized the list in general deferred maintenance is a waste of 20 year borrowing flynn said we ought to look at this as a way of helping establish new assets that continue to give back in the way that holly gymnasium and red rocks theater and other new deal investments are still being used 80 years later cdebaca called the project list obviously rushed and said the funding would be better off going towards things like housing during the department of finance s public outreach process they found that denver residents prioritized the investment in housing transportation and workforce when spending covid 19 relief funds the department announced last month next steps the go bond executive committee is scheduled to present its finalized project list to the city council finance and governance committee on july 27 on aug 3 the council committee will be presented with the official language of the proposed go bond package and its projects for a vote if the council committee passes the bond it will be sent to mayor hancock for approval on aug 10 and then to the full city council for two final votes on aug 16 and aug 23 before being added to the november ballot while the go bond makes its way through the city process hanlon urges voters to consider supporting the measure on the ballot this idea of investing in infrastructure to help our recovery is a proven tool hanlon said when we came out of the great recession we were the second fastest big city to come out and i think it had a lot to do with how we leaned in to allocate those funds and support our construction industry if the go bond is approved by voters in november the first debt issuance for the bond would be in the spring of 2022

phoenix ap former president donald trump issued three statements in two days falsely claiming that voting fraud and irregularities cost him arizona s electoral votes trump relied on comments made thursday by contractors hired by state senate republicans to oversee a partisan review of the 2020 vote count in maricopa county which includes metro phoenix the forensic audit as senate gop leaders are calling their review is overseen by cyber ninjas a small computer security firm with no election experience before trump began questioning the 2020 results its ceo doug logan spread false conspiracy theories about the election before he was hired to lead the arizona review logan and ben cotton a digital forensics analyst working on the audit described issues they say need further review trump has parroted them as evidence the election results are tainted county officials and elections experts say the claims are false and based on a misunderstanding of election materials which they say creates an appearance of irregularities where none exists trump laid out his claims most specifically in a statement friday night a look at the irregularities he alleges in that statement trump 168 000 fraudulent ballots printed on illegal paper unofficial ballots the facts all of that is false the ballots were not unofficial or printed on illegal paper and even logan never alleged they were fraudulent logan pointed to ballots with the printing slightly offset between the front and back he claimed this could cause votes to be counted for the wrong candidate if ink from one side bleeds through to another he said the alignment issues were mostly from polling place ballots which are printed onsite and said about 168 000 ballots were cast that way the overwhelming majority of arizona voters cast ballots by mail we are seeing a lot of very thin paper stock being used especially on election day logan added the allegation harkens back to the debunked sharpiegate conspiracy theory that arose in the days after the election election experts say bleed through doesn t affect the vote count because bubbles on one side of a ballot don t align with those on the other ballots that can t be read are flagged and duplicated by a bipartisan team arizona s election procedures manual says only that ballots must be printed with black ink on white paper of sufficient thickness to prevent the printing from being discernible on the reverse side the ballot maricopa county uses 80 pound votesecur paper from rolland which is among the papers approved by dominion voting systems which makes the county s tabulation equipment said fields moseley a county spokesman logan did not provide any evidence that alignment problems affected the vote count and said the issue needs more analysis ___ trump citing 74 000 mail in ballots received that were never mailed magically appearing ballots the facts no there were no magically appearing ballots he is alleging that the number of filled out ballots received in the mail by election officials exceeded the number of people who had asked earlier for mail in ballots by 74 000 but that s not at all what happened the claim mischaracterizes reports created for political parties to track who has voted early so they can target their get out the vote efforts one report tracks all requests that voters make for early ballots either by mail or in person up to 11 days before the election the other report tracks all ballots received through the day before the election that leaves a 10 day window during which people who vote in person but don t request a mail ballot would appear on one report but not the other ___ trump claiming 11 000 voters were added to the voter rolls after the election and still voted the facts there s nothing untoward about voters rolls growing after election day the rolls are simply updated to reflect people whose provisional ballots are added to the tally after election officials verify that they were eligible to vote the allegation that the updated tally was the result of electoral wrongdoing first came from logan this past week when he told state lawmakers of 11 326 people that did not show up on the nov 7 version of the voter rolls after votes were cast but then appeared on the dec 4 voter rolls maricopa county officials said logan is probably referring to provisional ballots which are cast by people who do not appear on the voter rolls or don t have the proper identification on election day they re only counted if the voter later shows he or she was eligible to vote to be eligible such voters must have registered before the deadline these go through a rigorous verification process to make sure that the provisional ballots cast are only counted if the voter is eligible to vote in the election maricopa county officials wrote on twitter this happens after election day only eligible voters are added to the voter rolls ___ trump alleging all the access logs to the machines were wiped and the election server was hacked during the election the facts that flies in the face of the evidence maricopa county s election server is not connected to the internet and independent auditors found no evidence the election server was hacked trump s hacking allegation refers to the unauthorized download of public data from the county s voter registration system that system which is connected to the internet and broadly accessible to political parties and election workers is not linked to the election management system the web of ballot counters computers and servers that tallies votes the election management system is air gapped or kept disconnected from the rest of the county s computer network and the wider internet two firms certified by the u s election assistance commission to test voting systems found maricopa county s machines were not connected to the internet and did not have malicious hardware or software installed ___ trump arizona shows fraud and voting irregularities many times more than would be needed to change the outcome of the election the facts not so the number of potential fraud cases is far smaller than president joe biden s margin of victory in arizona county election officials identified 182 cases where voting problems were clear enough that they referred them to investigators for further review according to an associated press investigation so far only four cases have led to charges including those identified in a separate state investigation no one has been convicted no person s vote was counted twice biden won arizona by 10 457 votes out of 3 4 million cast of the four cases that have resulted in criminal charges two involved democratic voters and two involved republicans ___ editor s note a look

when john mcafee was found dead in his cell last month reportedly due to suicide by hanging the internet was quick to doubt that mcafee died in his prison cell in spain not long after a court ruled he could be extradited back to the united states there s been another update though the man who founded the anti virus protection company and was once a millionaire died broke as reported by keith griffith with the daily mail advertisement the piece also points to mcafee s tweets in fact the pinned tweet to mcafee s account from june 16 claims i have nothing the us believes i have hidden crypto i wish i did but it has dissolved through the many hands of team mcafee your belief is not required and my remaining assets are all seized my friends evaporated through fear of association i have nothing yet i regret nothing john mcafee officialmcafee june 16 2021 such insight about mcafee s financial situation comes from an exclusive between griffith and mark eglinton the author of no domain the john mcafee tapes which comes out in december the book was initially supposed to be a collaboration but mcafee told eglinton he couldn t pay the agreed to fee which eglinton told griffith wasn t much thus eglinton believes mcafee was indeed penniless when he died i don t doubt that if he could have helped he would have eglinton did tell griffith though he also told griffith that the collaboration ended after mcafee insisted the publisher pay him in cryptocurrency but then wouldn t provide an address to be mailed a contract eglinton points to mcafee s spending on bizarre mansions as to how his 100 million from selling mcafee went so quickly eglinton strongly refuted prior reports claiming that mcafee lost his fortune on bad stock picks during the great recession we got a lot into where he spent his money over the years he said he had his money in very safe investments but he built houses absolutely bizarre properties the scottish author said some of them he never slept a night in the property mcafee owned at various points large mansions and compounds in belize texas colorado hawaii and tennessee among other locations he sold some of those properties at a tremendous loss as property values contracted in the great recession perhaps due to liquidity issues mcafee s compound in woodland park colorado for example included a 10 000 square foot main house that was fully furnished with antiques from around the world it was valued at more than 25 million but sold at auction for a mere 5 72 million to a chicago commodities trader in 2007 eglinton said mcafee told him the 100 million i got out of mcafee that goes very quickly there are other signs that mcafee could have committed suicide as landon reported earlier this month mcafee had a failed suicide attempt months before his death when mcafee s death was first revealed many were skeptical of the cause of death noting the similarities between mcafee and jeffrey epstein who knew mcafee there were also tweets from mcafee emphasizing that if he was found dead it would not be by his own hand advertisement i am content in here i have friends the food is good all is well know that if i hang myself a la

phoenix ap former president donald trump issued three statements in two days falsely claiming that voting fraud and irregularities cost him arizona s electoral votes trump relied on comments made thursday by contractors hired by state senate republicans to oversee a partisan review of the 2020 vote count in maricopa county which includes metro phoenix the forensic audit as senate gop leaders are calling their review is overseen by cyber ninjas a small computer security firm with no election experience before trump began questioning the 2020 results its ceo doug logan spread false conspiracy theories about the election before he was hired to lead the arizona review logan and ben cotton a digital forensics analyst working on the audit described issues they say need further review trump has parroted them as evidence the election results are tainted county officials and elections experts say the claims are false and based on a misunderstanding of election materials which they say creates an appearance of irregularities where none exists trump laid out his claims most specifically in a statement friday night a look at the irregularities he alleges in that statement trump 168 000 fraudulent ballots printed on illegal paper unofficial ballots the facts all of that is false the ballots were not unofficial or printed on illegal paper and even logan never alleged they were fraudulent logan pointed to ballots with the printing slightly offset between the front and back he claimed this could cause votes to be counted for the wrong candidate if ink from one side bleeds through to another he said the alignment issues were mostly from polling place ballots which are printed onsite and said about 168 000 ballots were cast that way the overwhelming majority of arizona voters cast ballots by mail we are seeing a lot of very thin paper stock being used especially on election day logan added the allegation harkens back to the debunked sharpiegate conspiracy theory that arose in the days after the election election experts say bleed through doesn t affect the vote count because bubbles on one side of a ballot don t align with those on the other ballots that can t be read are flagged and duplicated by a bipartisan team arizona s election procedures manual says only that ballots must be printed with black ink on white paper of sufficient thickness to prevent the printing from being discernible on the reverse side the ballot maricopa county uses 80 pound votesecur paper from rolland which is among the papers approved by dominion voting systems which makes the county s tabulation equipment said fields moseley a county spokesman logan did not provide any evidence that alignment problems affected the vote count and said the issue needs more analysis ___ trump citing 74 000 mail in ballots received that were never mailed magically appearing ballots the facts no there were no magically appearing ballots he is alleging that the number of filled out ballots received in the mail by election officials exceeded the number of people who had asked earlier for mail in ballots by 74 000 but that s not at all what happened the claim mischaracterizes reports created for political parties to track who has voted early so they can target their get out the vote efforts one report tracks all requests that voters make for early ballots either by mail or in person up to 11 days before the election the other report tracks all ballots received through the day before the election that leaves a 10 day window during which people who vote in person but don t request a mail ballot would appear on one report but not the other ___ trump claiming 11 000 voters were added to the voter rolls after the election and still voted the facts there s nothing untoward about voters rolls growing after election day the rolls are simply updated to reflect people whose provisional ballots are added to the tally after election officials verify that they were eligible to vote the allegation that the updated tally was the result of electoral wrongdoing first came from logan this past week when he told state lawmakers of 11 326 people that did not show up on the nov 7 version of the voter rolls after votes were cast but then appeared on the dec 4 voter rolls maricopa county officials said logan is probably referring to provisional ballots which are cast by people who do not appear on the voter rolls or don t have the proper identification on election day they re only counted if the voter later shows he or she was eligible to vote to be eligible such voters must have registered before the deadline these go through a rigorous verification process to make sure that the provisional ballots cast are only counted if the voter is eligible to vote in the election maricopa county officials wrote on twitter this happens after election day only eligible voters are added to the voter rolls ___ trump alleging all the access logs to the machines were wiped and the election server was hacked during the election the facts that flies in the face of the evidence maricopa county s election server is not connected to the internet and independent auditors found no evidence the election server was hacked trump s hacking allegation refers to the unauthorized download of public data from the county s voter registration system that system which is connected to the internet and broadly accessible to political parties and election workers is not linked to the election management system the web of ballot counters computers and servers that tallies votes the election management system is air gapped or kept disconnected from the rest of the county s computer network and the wider internet two firms certified by the u s election assistance commission to test voting systems found maricopa county s machines were not connected to the internet and did not have malicious hardware or software installed ___ trump arizona shows fraud and voting irregularities many times more than would be needed to change the outcome of the election the facts not so the number of potential fraud cases is far smaller than president joe biden s margin of victory in arizona county election officials identified 182 cases where voting problems were clear enough that they referred them to investigators for further review according to an associated press investigation so far only four cases have led to charges including those identified in a separate state investigation no one has been convicted no person s vote was counted twice

reduced supply and a glut of customers with money to burn means dealers can t meet demand for new cars while used prices are up too you ve almost certainly heard about the problems the shortage of computer chips has caused with vehicle production over the past year various production lines have had to be idled and some automakers are choosing to ship cars without certain electronic features such as start stop systems just to get things moving but as the new york times reports carmakers aren t the only ones struggling so are dealers and ultimately customers the reduced supply means dealers can t get their hands on enough new cars to satisfy demand from buyers who have money to spend thanks to the u s economic recovery and low interest rates buyers also have unusually high levels of savings because they were unable to spend as much money during the coronavirus pandemic as they might have in a normal year and many received stimulus checks and there s just as much turmoil going on in the used market we ve already written about u s dealers bringing in cars from canada but the nyt says they re also calling and emailing former customers to whom they sold cars a year or two earlier to see if they can buy them back to sell on it references government data suggesting some used car prices are up as much as 45 percent on this time in 2020 related ford may ship vehicles with missing chips to dealerships the industry has had strikes and material shortages before that have left us short of inventory but i ve never seen anything like this mark scarpelli the owner of two chevrolet dealerships near chicago told the nyt scarpelli said his dealerships normally have 600 to 700 cars in stock but currently have just 50 new cars that arrive in dealerships are often gone within hours the nyt s investigation found that despite the shortage of available cars the higher prices of those cars due to a shift in supply and demand means dealers aren t necessarily suffering financially it says new cars that would normally be available with discounts over the msrp are selling for list price and often more than that for in demand models and as for the time honored tradition of haggling over used cars we might not see that again until 2022
a vast portfolio of food and household brands has allowed the consumer goods giant unilever to navigate its way through the pandemic the maker of domestos bleach dove soap and cif cleaner benefited from a surge in demand for cleaning products in the initial stages of the health crisis its shares rose and unilever briefly became the most valuable company in the ftse 100 index last year and the company behind marmite colman s mustard and magnum ice cream benefited from the forced shift to eating out less and cooking at home which some analysts think could be a long term change unilever s chief executive alan jope believes that higher demand for soap and cleaning products is another trend that will persist as people stick to more frequent hand washing and improved hygiene at home with china and other economies around the world recovering from the pandemic consumers are spending more again when jope presents unilever s first half results on thursday he is expected to reveal underlying sales growth of 5 3 including 4 8 growth in the second quarter and an underlying operating profit of 4 8bn 4 1bn slightly below 5 1bn in 2020 sales growth will have slowed from 5 7 in the first quarter but the expected 4 8 would still be a decent number overall turnover is likely to be flat at 25 7bn due to currency effects maybe we have seen peak sanitiser already which could create a headwind for the home care division but growth trends in the first quarter were strong steve clayton hargreaves lansdown the dividend will be of particular interest to shareholders analysts are looking for 148p a share for 2021 which would make unilever the fifth biggest dividend payer in the ftse 100 in cash terms despite the upside unilever will have to contend with other challenges coming down the line not least higher costs from rising global food prices commodities freight and crude oil as well as what could be the world s first taxes on sugar and salt going into food production in the uk although the company notes that the uk is only 5 of its business the un world food price index which tracks monthly changes in a basket of major food types has roughly doubled since the start of the pandemic this will be felt most acutely in the developing world where consumers are more likely to cook from scratch analysts expect unilever to pass on food price inflation in most cases tapping into trends towards healthier and sustainable eating and living the firm plans to launch more plant based ice creams after the success of its vegan versions of magnum and ben jerry s in one of its new strategic priorities it laid out plans in february to expand its vegan food ranges into a 1bn a year plant based foods business in five to seven years time compared with 200m at present unilever also wants to grab a larger slice of the upmarket beauty and nutritional supplement markets another fast growing area and recently acquired paula s choice an american online skincare brand founded by paula begoun in 1995 known for its jargon free ingredient dictionary unilever will also give an update on its plans to sell the bulk of its tea business which has annual sales of 2bn steve clayton head of equity funds at hargreaves lansdown which holds unilever shares said we re seeing lots of companies beginning to highlight the strength of recovery being witnessed in many economies around the world will unilever be another to flag this maybe but the group s strong exposures to emerging markets could hold it back given nations like brazil and india have had pretty severe issues with the pandemic in recent months but the group has plenty of positives going for it too there seems to have been a sustained shift to preparing more meals at home in western nations and this can only help maybe we have seen peak sanitiser already which could create a headwind for the home care division but growth trends in the first quarter were strong and on balance we re hoping for a decent print from unilever when they report

fund manager chris ford admits that there may come a day when the fund he set up and runs is redundant though not for at least 20 or 30 years when ford and co manager tim day launched sanlam artificial intelligence in 2017 it was the only fund focusing solely on ai at that time most of us were just starting to see the impact in our lives of ai which uses machine learning to simulate human intelligence fast forward to today and the growing presence of ai in our everyday lives is apparent everywhere from healthcare to online shopping anyone who watches netflix or buys a holiday online will have interacted with it says ford fast forward again another 25 years and ford expects ai to have entered every corner of our lives at that point the fund may look like any other global equities fund because ai will have been adopted by all companies around the world he says however the question is how that process will play out and which companies will have the competitive advantage in his search for these winners ford looks for companies pushing the use of ai to its limit what he calls his quest for the pointy end of the spear to this end he invests in a portfolio of 35 to 40 companies based all around the globe some are household names such as microsoft and google s parent company alphabet others are less familiar such as japanese robotics company fanuc and us data storage firm western digital so far the strategy has paid off in the four years since its launch sanlam artificial intelligence has seen yearly growth of 34 13 38 and 31 per cent respectively ford says he is more proud of the consistency he has offered investors than of the levels of returns the fund has generated he believes some of the most exciting uses of ai are in healthcare one of the most extraordinary developments last year came from the ai system alphafold which was developed by alphabet s deepmind he says alphafold is attempting to understand how proteins fold in the body this will help us to make sense of how diseases come about and form in the body which will in turn enlighten us about how to treat or prevent them were this done by people in labs with pipettes it would take years ford explains but by using ai and machine learning thousands of proteins can be analysed at once speeding up the process the fund looks not just at the firms developing ai tools but also those that show willingness and innovation in the way they adopt existing ones ford believes that good use of ai is a strong marker of a company that is likely to succeed for a company to use ai well it tends to require an open minded management team a willingness to innovate and vision unitedhealth based in minnesota is a good example ford says the healthcare firm is using careful curation of its data to slash bureaucracy refine underwriting and improve health outcomes for customers as a result it is already worth 400billion and growing its market share us loan company upstart which uses algorithms to measure creditworthiness is another unsurprisingly ford and day use ai themselves to manage the fund they employ an ai programme to identify all of the companies in a particular sector and to pick out the ones most likely to succeed for example when they decided to invest in quantum computing they used ai to search for information about every company in this area all around the globe and in any language they then pinpoint the companies with strong balance sheets sanlam artificial intelligence fund has annual charges of 0 52 per cent and its stock market id code is bypf331
on eve of 500m float revolution beauty boss reveals i m taking on the giants like l oreal to build a british global beauty brand you may not yet have heard of revolution beauty and even less so its co founder and creative heart adam minto but if he has his way that will soon change tomorrow he launches the business he started eight years ago on the london stock exchange with a value billed at close to 500million and that is only the latest stage of his plan he says i genuinely think we are doing something very different i think we can build a global beauty business to challenge the big guys companies that have always been there and that normally acquire businesses like us selling in more than 100 countries already minto who is also chief executive says he s shrugged off approaches from l oreal revlon unilever and coty in an effort to stay independent every brand eventually sells out to those multinationals what revolution is trying to do for the consumer for the business for our team is to provide a positive view of the beauty industry and do what most companies don t get the chance to do i ve been making designing developing products for the big beauty brands all my life but i felt the industry had become elitist that is not meant to be controversial but the industry had a bad image only used models retouched even beautiful people and forced this version of beauty on to the consumer it was about perfection i felt the industry had got out of date and needed to change we use real people we ve been cruelty free from the start when incredibly the industry wasn t all those things that are quite natural for us body positivity and reality minto 51 set up his first business in 1989 with his dad peter he had been determined not to join his father s business in the beauty packaging industry so they set up a separate company together not very imaginatively called minto family he says he soon found himself supplying the likes of revlon and rimmel as well as pharmacy boots which was bringing high street prices to the industry it just blew up i was at the right place at the right time by 1999 when we sold the business i was making over 100 million lipsticks a year several incarnations later and a prior venture which just didn t work out minto met his current business partner tom allsworth now chairman and launched revolution i met someone who was really the best opposite to me with tom i m from a creative and brand background and he s from an operational background he s the ant to my dec as we say i knew the industry inside out i knew how to manufacture to scale production i believed digital was going to be the future which seems crazy to say looking back as it s very obvious now particularly after the pandemic but it wasn t obvious then even now over 90 per cent of the mass beauty industry is still sold through stores i don t think that will be the case in another seven years not content with growing the uk business first the pair have already mapped out global ambitions i created a lot of brands for other companies and i realised they had made mistakes concentrating on the uk and not going global until much later of course by then a competitor comes along or else the market moves on by the time you re ready it s the same with us brands there are very few global brands the pair have since gathered a team of industry veterans to help them grow and set about creating a global infrastructure following financial support in 2017 from a specialist beauty investment boutique tsg consumer revolution now sells in 45 countries in stores and through ecommerce in more than 100 countries the uk accounts for a third but america will be the biggest this year tomorrow allsworth and minto will sell 15 6million of shares each and both retain a 78 million stake just over 30 per cent of the business sales were 157 6million in the 14 months to the end of february they have built warehouse and logistics hubs in the uk us and australia and on the ground teams to manage opportunities within a handful of specific countries i wanted to build a digital first global brand i guess we wanted to build a mini l oreal or a mini estee lauder as a deliberate part of our strategy we went around the world to some very different locations poland and the czech republic for example totally different to italy or to turkey we did it mainly to build this global brand to make sure the product offering was also right for different tastes different skin tones and in some places price points and build an operational infrastructure to support that growth choice for the consumer was the starkest issue the difficulty getting a concealer and foundation that matches skin tone the price and quality disparity that you had to pay a premium price to get an amazing quality product minto says the business is now capable of becoming one of the top 20 beauty companies in the world all smiles adam minto says the business is now capable of becoming one of the top 20 beauty companies in the world he says revlon which he s already outselling in individual retail stores is the 20th largest beauty company with a revenue of 2 4 billion 1 7 billion but despite early success he points out that his exposure to those markets is still small remember we only have a narrow distribution at the moment only one retailer in each country but we believe we can grow a similar sized business over the next seven years to annual sales of billions yes that s what i believe is possible in that time he cites asos and boohoo as companies that flew on the stock market adding i believe the beauty market is going to go through the same type of change as the fashion market balanced between digital and bricks and mortar on the eve of his stock market debut he reflects on the journey he started on 32 years ago with my dad who passed away 19 years ago almost to the day he would be very proud he says people might think this is an overnight success eight years may not seem that long but i ve been in the industry for 32 years so its been a very long time to get here i imagine the stock market as a form of independence i m certainly not criticising anyone because they are amazing people but jo malone bobbi brown mac cosmetics amazing brands they had to sell out i have that privilege now we owe it to the team and the industry to not sell out not that they did anything wrong but i think we can provide a different point of view by staying independent
according to government statistics more than 60 per cent of adults in this country are overweight or obese and rising numbers of children are carrying too many pounds as well the economic cost of this is estimated at almost 30billion the psychological impact can be intense and even the environment is suffering from consumers enthusiasm for junk food small wonder then that last week s national food strategy a government commissioned review pulled no punches recommending the introduction of salt and sugar taxes and arguing that meat consumption should be cut by a third tasty with a 150 year heritage in sugar and syrup tate lyle may not seem the obvious candidate to benefit from growing fears about expanding waistlines for many in the food industry these proposals will strike alarm bells for tate lyle however the report will almost certainly prove welcome with a 150 year heritage in sugar and syrup tate lyle and its shares may not seem the obvious candidate to benefit from growing fears about expanding waistlines but the group sold off those legacy businesses in 2010 leaving two main divisions one focused on turning corn into sweeteners and starches the other on creating healthy ingredients for the food and drinks industry last week chief executive nick hampton went one stage further announcing the sale of 50 per cent of the corn processing subsidiary for 1 2billion so he can scale up the fast growing ingredients business american private equity firm kps is buying the corn division and will run it as a standalone business but tate lyle will benefit as and when the company grows and there is the prospect of particularly attractive returns if kps sells the new firm outright in the short term tate lyle shareholders will be handed a 500 million special dividend equivalent to around 1 a share and hampton will dedicate himself to developing more and more ingredients that replace sugar fat and salt with healthier alternatives splenda is probably the best known of these but the group works with some of the largest food and drink firms in the world so its products go into everything from iced tea to yogurt to tomato ketchup the business has already benefited from increasing concerns worldwide about obesity over the next few years those worries are expected to deepen so tate lyle s prospects in its new guise seem bright midas verdict midas recommended tate lyle in 2015 when the shares were 6 08 today the shares are 7 29 having fallen more than 10 per cent since hampton first hinted at his break up plans two months ago the decline seems unfair large investors have been complaining about the corn business for years now hampton has offloaded it in a clever deal which allows tate to retain an ongoing interest while driving growth within the trendy ingredients division existing shareholders should retain their stock new investors could even pick up some shares at current levels traded on main market ticker tate contact tateandlyle com or equiniti on 0371 384 2063 read this week s midas column on hydrogenone

business personality magnates are gods of the franchises they create and guardians of the world s their business empires inhabit it s a huge task they influence economies politics and cities and if they are very ambitious they create not just the laws of government but also the laws of nature however no magnate has been a god to as many vastly different worlds as bua boss abdul samad rabiu his worlds are flooded with the brilliant light of his imagination whether he s building on the past determining the present or strategising the future no one had ever imagined writes lanre alfred many have wondered how he came to amass such vast affluence and an enduring sway at the pinnacle of the business world it s mostly a function of perception he had an ingenious ability to discern the labyrinthine tracts of commerce and his persistence in asking why it would be recalled that millions saw the apple fall but it was only newton who asked why the late scientist while blessed with incredible genius also betrayed an amazing gift of perception he observed the little details that often counted but are habitually discounted in the flurry of things which led him to the achievement of great exploits and enviable rewards rabiu is no newton but he displays a towering sagacity and wonderful gift of scrutiny similar to that oft ascribed to the late scientific genius so adept is he at his vocation that he constantly discovers rare business opportunities often invisible to his peers simply put rabiu has acquired his reputation by good judgment fair dealing exactness and rectitude which jointly constitute the essence of his good fortune little wonder he has steadily evolved as africa s second biggest philanthropist with his bua foundation and the phenomenal abdul samad rabiu africa initiative the first being globacom chairman dr mike adenuga jnr rabiu s philanthropic initiatives were established to support sustainable development initiatives in health education and social

across different areas notably solid minerals mining manufacturing agriculture associated equipment power food processing and even in the business of associated equipment or infrastructure for the value chains of these sectors where french businesses have formerly been risk averse or outrightly unable to do business with africa s largest economy they can now be assured of a platform through which they can penetrate and mutually grow the market where nigerian companies had not seen french companies or the french market as a viable destination due to a lack of information they can now be

dancing on ice star and tv presenter zoe salmon tells me my money she earned more from one photo shoot than in a whole year as a lawyer tv presenter zoe salmon says the biggest money mistake she ever made was buying a grade ii listed apartment in west london the former miss northern ireland and blue peter presenter 41 told donna ferguson it cost her 60 000 a year in service charges plus thousands more in expensive renovations she is attempting to do hula hoops for 500 minutes this month as part of the duke of edinburgh awards do it 4 youth challenge what did your parents teach you about money to save wisely and to spend wisely i was really fortunate growing up my dad was the managing director of a large flooring firm in northern ireland and my mother was a stay at home mum to me and my three siblings we were comfortable and lived in a beautiful four bedroom detached house in bangor which is by the sea i didn t want for anything but i was never handed anything on a plate my parents were keen that i should appreciate the value of money and encouraged me to get a part time job at a young age have you ever struggled to make ends meet yes at university i was studying law which was very intense and i also worked part time in retail and as a model to pay my way i remember nearly falling asleep in lectures at times because i was working and studying so hard i felt under a lot of pressure to make ends meet but i left university without a lot of debt aside from my student loan have you ever been paid silly money yes shortly after i did dancing on ice in 2009 i did one or two jobs within the space of a week for which i got paid five figure sums for a few hours of work doing endorsements and a glamorous photo shoot that was more than my whole year s salary as a newly qualified lawyer i remember meeting my stylist hairdresser and makeup artist and thinking i barely need to do anything but smile it was just crazy the best year of your financial life it was probably 2010 when i took part in the dancing on ice tour which is actually more lucrative than the show i also presented so many tv shows for different channels that at one point in that year i was on every major network in the uk plus i did a hollywood movie with russell brand and had the lead role in a theatre production of cinderella most expensive thing you bought for fun my birkin handbag i got it in 2017 for a four figure sum it s black with gold hardware it was such a magical experience to buy something so exclusive and bespoke and i went for a classic timeless colour scheme that goes with everything although i bought it for fun i do see it as an investment it s already gone up in value substantially what is your biggest money mistake buying a two bedroom apartment in a grade ii listed building in west london for 300 000 in 2000 the building had beautiful art deco features a swimming pool and a tennis court and i absolutely loved living there but i spent a lot of money renovating the flat and i had to use certain contractors that were council approved to work on listed buildings as soon as i finished my renovations the managers of the building said it needed a lot of work by 2008 my service charge had more than doubled to 5 000 a month i managed to sell it for nearly 500 000 that year but if i had bought a similar apartment in the same area that wasn t grade ii listed i would have made much more money the best money decision you have made selling a buy to let penthouse apartment in belfast that i d bought in 2009 for 250 000 a decade later it still hadn t appreciated much in value so last year during the pandemic i cut my losses and sold it for around the same price for which i had bought it i reinvested the money in a four bedroom house in bangor which is proving a much better investment i haven t looked back do you save into a pension or invest in the stock market no i have two investment properties in bangor which i see as my pension nest egg i ve focused on paying off the mortgages on them instead of paying into a pension i prefer bricks and mortar because it s a physical asset that you can see maybe one day i will invest in the stock market but until recently i ve been more interested in becoming mortgage free now i ve achieved that i wouldn t rule it out in a spin zoe doing hoops for charity do you own any other property yes my family home is a four bedroom house in north county down my husband william who is a butcher designed and built it ten years ago we are currently building our dream home together which will have a sort of los angeles feel to it with lots of glass and a lovely view of the mourne mountains we re hoping to sell our current home and move in there in about a year what is the one luxury you treat yourself to a holiday at sandy lane a luxury resort in barbados twice a year it s just paradise we ll go for ten to 14 days at a time and it costs a five figure sum if you were chancellor what would you do i would force multinational companies to pay their fair share of taxes and use the extra money to abolish tuition fees and ensure it is free for people to study for a degree an apprenticeship or any other type of formal educational training i think the interest rates on student loans are too high and that education should be free for all do you donate money to charity yes ever since i was a child i ve donated money and time to charity at the moment i am supporting the duke of edinburgh awards and taking part in their do it 4 youth summer challenge the idea is that you complete a challenge in four weeks to raise money to help young people from tough backgrounds see www dofe org di4yteamni for more information everyone can do their own challenge but i m hula hooping every day for the month of july increasing the amount of activity i m doing each day by one minute by the end of july i will have done 500 minutes i m already exhausted but it s a lot of fun and a good workout what is your number one financial priority to always be debt free and have savings for a rainy day that way if i ever choose to buy myself another expensive asset whether that s a property or a handbag i ll be able to do so knowing i worked hard for it
rising prices for farmland across minnesota helped greg schuman and his siblings decide it was finally time to sell off 160 acres in chippewa county that his family owned for nearly a century the timing was right for us with land prices where they re at and where we re at in our lives said schuman who lives in nisswa and turns 60 this month the four siblings sold the farm between clara city and maynard to an investor for an amount schuman wouldn t reveal except to say that all of us were very happy with the outcome near record high corn and soybean prices over the last year are the biggest driver in a farmland value surge that if it continues could emerge as rural minnesota s version of the twin cities real estate boom right now everything is flashing green for farmland sales said michael swanson chief agricultural economist for wells fargo low interest rates coupled with land values that started to tick upward last year after more than five years of slumping or staying flat are creating a seller s market for farmland owners swanson said he thinks farmland values are likely to stay high the next few years given forecasters are expecting the same for commodity prices that s nothing but upside for rural minnesota he said for consumers farmland prices are among many factors contributing to rising food costs but swanson said that effect is spread widely the downside is felt by new farmers and those trying to get into the business it s totally analogous to the housing market said matthew fitzgerald a 29 year old organic grain farmer who works about 2 500 acres in the hutchinson area almost all of it rented if you re a beginning farmer who doesn t know people and you don t have a ton of cash you might not be perceived as a reliable buyer fitzgerald who s active in the central minnesota chapter of the national young farmers coalition followed his parents into organic farming which they took on as a new career later in life he said he d love to own more land someday i ll keep playing the lottery fitzgerald said the last big spike in farmland values in this part of the country was in 2013 and 2014 which came after two years of high crop prices and farm income land fetched prices exceeding 9 000 per tillable acre at that time said glen fladeboe who co owns fladeboe land a farmland real estate company with offices in minneapolis and willmar it later fell back to between 6 000 to 7 000 per acre he said and stayed in that range until last year that s when another spike in commodities along with large infusions of federal aid to farmers left many of them more flush with cash than they d been in years this is the strongest land market that we ve seen in a decade today fladeboe said in recent weeks he s seen per acre prices push back to 9 000 he said farmland most often comes up for sale in september and october creating a seasonal demand effect akin to the peaks in residential real estate that happen in summer dave bau who teaches agriculture business management at the university of minnesota s extension office in worthington said he thinks another reason some farmland sellers are particularly motivated right now is that they suspect the biden administration and congressional allies will move to raise taxes on land sales the democrats are in power and if taxes are going up next year then maybe this year is a good time to sell your land bau said farmland sellers like fladeboe and chuck wingert who s based in mankato said the majority of buyers are existing farmers often with a family link to the sellers or who own adjacent farmland but both have seen rising investor interest in farmland wingert said his sales have typically been about 65 farmers and 35 investors but said there s been a recent jump in the latter category it s investors who want to get their money out of the stock market because they see inflation coming wingert said adding that farmland has long been viewed as a stable low risk investment last january the land report a magazine about real estate identified microsoft founder bill gates and his estranged wife melinda gates as the largest private owners of farmland in the united states their holdings include farmland in wisconsin and iowa but not minnesota the magazine s analysis found the second largest farmland holdings nationwide belong to the offutt family who own the fargo headquartered potato growers r d offutt company schuman and his siblings sold their chippewa county farmland to a private investor through fladeboe land schuman said he had few details on the investor his grandparents bought the land he thinks sometime in the 1930s for decades they grew corn soybeans wheat sugar beets and at times other crops my brother and i worked it for a time in our 20s before we ventured out to do other things said schuman who works for a solar energy firm in st paul for the last 25 years he and his siblings rented the land to a farmer in the area but he s also close to retirement and wasn t in the market to buy it i would have loved to see a young farmer get that farm schuman said but through this process odds are someone there locally will get a chance to rent it and get their opportunity to farm

phoenix ap former president donald trump issued three statements in two days falsely claiming that voting fraud and irregularities cost him arizona s electoral votes trump relied on comments made thursday by contractors hired by state senate republicans to oversee a partisan review of the 2020 vote count in maricopa county which includes metro phoenix the œforensic audit ť as senate gop leaders are calling their review is overseen by cyber ninjas a small computer security firm with no election experience before trump began questioning the 2020 results its ceo doug logan spread false conspiracy theories about the election before he was hired to lead the arizona review logan and ben cotton a digital forensics analyst working on the audit described issues they say need further review trump has parroted them as evidence the election results are tainted county officials and elections experts say the claims are false and based on a misunderstanding of election materials which they say creates an appearance of irregularities where none exists trump laid out his claims most specifically in a statement friday night a look at the irregularities he alleges in that statement trump œ168 000 fraudulent ballots printed on illegal paper unofficial ballots ť the facts all of that is false the ballots were not unofficial or printed on illegal paper and even logan never alleged they were fraudulent logan pointed to ballots with the printing slightly offset between the front and back he claimed this could cause votes to be counted for the wrong candidate if ink from one side bleeds through to another he said the alignment issues were mostly from polling place ballots which are printed onsite and said about 168 000 ballots were cast that way the overwhelming majority of arizona voters cast ballots by mail œwe are seeing a lot of very thin paper stock being used especially on election day ť logan added the allegation harkens back to the debunked œsharpiegate ť conspiracy theory that arose in the days after the election election experts say bleed through doesn t affect the vote count because bubbles on one side of a ballot don t align with those on the other ballots that can t be read are flagged and duplicated by a bipartisan team arizona s election procedures manual says only that ballots œmust be printed with black ink on white paper of sufficient

that the number of filled out ballots received in the mail by election officials exceeded the number of people who had asked earlier for mail in ballots by 74 000 but that s not at all what happened the claim mischaracterizes reports created for political parties to track who has voted early so they can target their get out the vote efforts one report tracks all requests that voters make for early ballots either by mail or in person up to 11 days before the election the other report tracks all ballots received through the day before the election that leaves a 10 day window during which people who vote in person but don t request a mail ballot would appear on one report but not the other ___ trump claiming œ11 000 voters were added to the voter rolls after the election and still voted the facts there s nothing untoward about voters rolls growing after election day the rolls are simply updated to reflect people whose provisional ballots are added to the tally after election officials verify that they were eligible to vote the allegation that the updated tally was the result of electoral wrongdoing first came from logan this past week when he told state lawmakers of œ11 326 people that did not show up on the nov 7 version of the voter rolls after votes were cast but then appeared on the dec 4 voter rolls ť maricopa county officials said logan is probably referring to provisional ballots which are cast by people who do not appear on the voter rolls or don t have the proper identification on election day they re only counted if the voter later shows he or she was eligible to vote to be eligible such voters must have registered before the deadline œthese go through a rigorous verification process to make sure that the provisional ballots cast are only counted if the voter is eligible to vote in the election ť maricopa county officials wrote on twitter œthis happens after election day only eligible voters are added to the voter rolls ť ___ trump alleging œall the access logs to the machines were wiped and the election server was hacked during the election ť the facts that flies in the face of the evidence maricopa county s election server is not connected to the internet and independent auditors found no evidence the election server was hacked trump s hacking allegation refers to the unauthorized download of public data from the county s

finance ministers from the g7 could not resist hyperbole when they committed in early june to shake up the way multinationals are taxed in an ever more digital world rishi sunak who chaired the finance summit called their agreement truly historic and the reforms seismic but stock markets scarcely quaked in their boots even though the measures could potentially add around 150bn a year to global corporate tax revenues the plan which won support from 130 countries at the start of july has two parts one will introduce a new approach to taxing the world s largest and most profitable multinationals including america s tech titans such as facebook and google at least a fifth of profits above a basic 10 per cent margin will become subject to tax by the countries where they make their sales as part of the bargain states such as britain that have introduced digital services taxes will have to abolish them the second part of the plan is to set a global minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15 per cent if a multinational s subsidiaries are in places where rates are lower the parent company s tax authority can charge a top up levy to hit that minimum total rate one reason for the insouciance of investors may be scepticism about how much of the deal will survive the domestic legislation needed to turn intentions into practice implementation will in any event be a prolonged process moreover the reforms will make international corporate taxation even more complicated and complexity often helps the multinationals confound the taxman the deal also pulls its punches the genuine innovation is the plan for the world s biggest multinationals which breaches the convention that profits are taxed where companies are based and produce their goods rather than where they sell however the proposed change is on a modest scale such that one estimate from taxwatch is that the treasury would get less revenue under the new arrangement than from its digital services tax as for a global minimum tax of 15 per cent that is not much higher than ireland s vaunted low rate of 12 5 per cent but even with punchier proposals investors may remain unfazed companies might pay corporate tax in the first instance but ultimately it is individuals who pay taxes shareholders won t necessarily end up footing the bill businesses can respond by pushing up prices or lowering wages passing some or all of the new tax on to consumers and or workers studies of corporate tax in open economies suggest that a large chunk is ultimately borne by workers but for the big global companies such as america s tech giants that are targeted by the reforms it seems more likely that an increase in their tax bills will be passed through to consumers and to the extent that shareholders do lose out the deal provides compensations it offers a way out of the dispute between america and six countries that have introduced digital sales taxes which could otherwise end with the us triggering damaging retaliatory tariffs at least some of the extra revenue raised may boost public infrastructure and with it productivity growth most important the swiss cheese regime of international corporate tax brings market capitalism into disrepute and invites a political backlash the reforms offer a possible way to end the damaging race to the bottom

phoenix ap former president donald trump issued three statements in two days falsely claiming that voting fraud and irregularities cost him arizona s electoral votes trump relied on comments made thursday by contractors hired by state senate republicans to oversee a partisan review of the 2020 vote count in maricopa county which includes metro phoenix the forensic audit as senate gop leaders are calling their review is overseen by cyber ninjas a small computer security firm with no election experience before trump began questioning the 2020 results its ceo doug logan spread false conspiracy theories about the election before he was hired to lead the arizona review logan and ben cotton a digital forensics analyst working on the audit described issues they say need further review trump has parroted them as evidence the election results are tainted county officials and elections experts say the claims are false and based on a misunderstanding of election materials which they say creates an appearance of irregularities where none exists trump laid out his claims most specifically in a statement friday night a look at the irregularities he alleges in that statement trump 168 000 fraudulent ballots printed on illegal paper unofficial ballots the facts all of that is false the ballots were not unofficial or printed on illegal paper and even logan never alleged they were fraudulent logan pointed to ballots with the printing slightly offset between the front and back he claimed this could cause votes to be counted for the wrong candidate if ink from one side bleeds through to another he said the alignment issues were mostly from polling place ballots which are printed onsite and said about 168 000 ballots were cast that way the overwhelming majority of arizona voters cast ballots by mail we are seeing a lot of very thin paper stock being used especially on election day logan added the allegation harkens back to the debunked sharpiegate conspiracy theory that arose in the days after the election election experts say bleed through doesn t affect the vote count because bubbles on one side of a ballot don t align with those on the other ballots that can t be read are flagged and duplicated by a bipartisan team arizona s election procedures manual says only that ballots must be printed with black ink on white paper of sufficient thickness to prevent the printing from being discernible on the reverse side the ballot maricopa county uses 80 pound votesecur paper from rolland which is among the papers approved by dominion voting systems which makes the county s tabulation equipment said fields moseley a county spokesman logan did not provide any evidence that alignment problems affected the vote count and said the issue needs more analysis ___ trump citing 74 000 mail in ballots received that were never mailed magically appearing ballots the facts no there were no magically appearing ballots he is alleging that the number of filled out ballots received in the mail by election officials exceeded the number of people who had asked earlier for mail in ballots by 74 000 but that s not at all what happened the claim mischaracterizes reports created for political parties to track who has voted early so they can target their get out the vote efforts one report tracks all requests that voters make for early ballots either by mail or in person up to 11 days before the election the other report tracks all ballots received through the day before the election that leaves a 10 day window during which people who vote in person but don t request a mail ballot would appear on one report but not the other ___ trump claiming 11 000 voters were added to the voter rolls after the election and still voted the facts there s nothing untoward about voters rolls growing after election day the rolls are simply updated to reflect people whose provisional ballots are added to the tally after election officials verify that they were eligible to vote the allegation that the updated tally was the result of electoral wrongdoing first came from logan this past week when he told state lawmakers of 11 326 people that did not show up on the nov 7 version of the voter rolls after votes were cast but then appeared on the dec 4 voter rolls maricopa county officials said logan is probably referring to provisional ballots which are cast by people who do not appear on the voter rolls or don t have the proper identification on election day they re only counted if the voter later shows he or she was eligible to vote to be eligible such voters must have registered before the deadline these go through a rigorous verification process to make sure that the provisional ballots cast are only counted if the voter is eligible to vote in the election maricopa county officials wrote on twitter this happens after election day only eligible voters are added to the voter rolls ___ trump alleging all the access logs to the machines were wiped and the election server was hacked during the election the facts that flies in the face of the evidence maricopa county s election server is not connected to the internet and independent auditors found no evidence the election server was hacked trump s hacking allegation refers to the unauthorized download of public data from the county s voter registration system that system which is connected to the internet and broadly accessible to political parties and election workers is not linked to the election management system the web of ballot counters computers and servers that tallies votes the election management system is air gapped or kept disconnected from the rest of the county s computer network and the wider internet two firms certified by the u s election assistance commission to test voting systems found maricopa county s machines were not connected to the internet and did not have malicious hardware or software installed ___ trump arizona shows fraud and voting irregularities many times more than would be needed to change the outcome of the election the facts not so the number of potential fraud cases is far smaller than president joe biden s margin of victory in arizona county election officials identified 182 cases where voting problems were clear enough that they referred them to investigators for further review according to an associated press investigation so far only four cases have led to charges including those identified in a separate state investigation no one has been convicted no person s vote was counted twice biden won arizona by 10 457 votes out of 3 4 million cast of the four cases that have resulted in criminal charges two involved democratic voters and two involved republicans ___ editor s note a look at the veracity of claims by political figures ___ associated press writer ali swenson in seattle contributed to this report ___ find ap fact checks at follow apfactcheck on twitter

out systemic racism but a usa today analysis of previously undisclosed hiring records from dozens of top firms found that more than a year later executive roles remain overwhelmingly white and male

rooms have been hard won and companies can easily backtrack if advocates aren t vigilant says ursula burns the former ceo of xerox and the first black woman to lead a fortune 500 company she s been leading the charge to diversify the boards of major corporations the board level in many publicly traded companies is better than the c suite data and it s better than the employment levels burns told

she is not the holder of a university degree but annette jaundoo 60 manages family awareness consciousness togetherness fact a local non governmental organisation ngos that caters to the vulnerable population in corriverton donors were pushing me to do a masters degree in management and administration if i had done it i believe i would ve been a little selfish because i would have had to look after me the fact executive director said jaundoo has completed several on the job training programmes in administration and management run by the united states agency for international development usaid and other donor organisations she wondered if i had gone to university or teachers training college would i have had the ability to write up project proposals do financial management and swot analysis still be supportive of my staff and work from the heart most of my counterparts in similar organisations are university graduates jaundoo joined fact in 2003 and took over its management in 2006 from her sister sunita jaundoo frank who along with seven residents of corriverton founded the ngo in 2000 it was founded after jaundoo frank then president of the anglican youth group in corriverton represented the group at a ministry of health meeting to raise awareness on hiv aids with the motto inspiring and sustaining families it is the only known functioning social ngo in the border town they fund raised to carry out their activities went on television programmes met with other church and youth groups and any medium that was available to raise awareness jaundoo related with assistance from the national aids programme secretariat naps they engaged people living risky lives especially sex workers and the lesbian bisexual gay transgender and intersex lbgti communities in their awareness campaigns and shared condoms in bars and brothels according to jaundoo following a newspaper article in 2005 jaundoo frank was advised to apply to usaid for a grant to raise awareness on hiv aids in corriverton that year the ngo received 1 million and from 2005 to 2015 more funds in varying sums until the incidence of hiv aids started to decrease during that period funding was also received from the united nations children s fund united nations population fund united nations development programme undp food for the poor and other donors support groups fact has worked with people living with hiv the lgbti population orphans and vulnerable children ovc youths teen mothers men and boys on awareness through support groups and institutions like the skeldon hospital faith based groups schools and police among others with recent funding from the undp it has continued working and networking with support groups including caregivers to build their capacity to fight stigma and discrimination at present fact is awaiting approval of a programme from naps to train 10 trainers who will work with the vulnerable population including migrants and loggers apart from raising awareness fact expanded its hiv programme to testing and counselling referrals to treatment sites and care and support jaundoo said because of myths about how hiv is transmitted fact provided home based care to infected people whose families did not want to care for them however the number of people with hiv who fact worked with since its inception has decreased significantly jaundoo said some died some migrated and the viral loads of some have been suppressed and are not considered at risk they can take care of themselves and we use them as mentors to help others she added in 2010 or 2011 we had seven ovc who were infected and who came to us for support those children are youths who are now very active sexually most of them don t disclose their status and are having unprotected sex those are the people i worry about a lot when in 2015 the us president s emergency plan for aids relief ceased funding in all the regions except region four she said fact never stopped working we continued to work with a limited scope with support from naps until covid 19 struck our doors were always open because of our sustainability ventures we still do testing and counselling she continued we still have family counsellors and we work very closely with the ministry of human services so if there are issues we cannot handle we refer you and we walk you through the process training in recent years under jaundoo s leadership fact conducted capacity building workshops for some 2 000 young people in entrepreneurship and skills training with support from the ministry of education usaid unicef and other donors in early 2020 through the basic life and employability skills programme a ministry of education usaid funded project fact worked with unemployed youths including teenage mothers to equip them in a number of areas including carpentry masonry driving and basic computer skills from these programmes jaundoo said we were able to link them to the small business bureau the british and australian high commissioners to enable them to get funding to do their own businesses most obtained grant funding in the sum of 200 000 and 500 000 thirty two young men who completed this programme either joined the guyana defence force or the guyana police force one went to the guyana school of agriculture continued at the university of guyana and is now working with the ministry of agriculture formative years initially jaundoo was not interested in being part of fact because she had vowed to look after her children as they grew she is the mother of two her mother had eight children from three broken marriages who grew up with their grandmother because her mother had to work she had two other aunts who also had broken marriages and her grandmother also looked after their children three sets of cousins growing up together so we did community work for ourselves we had hand me downs and we shared she said her grandmother was a member of the seventh day adventist church whose house was always full on saturdays the extended family neighbours friends anybody who came to church could always come and get food we were taught at an early age to share to look out for each other and to treat people well when i eventually saw what my sister and fact were doing i felt compelled to be a part of it this is what my grandmother who died in 2012 would have wanted she said jaundoo was educated at eversham primary successfully wrote the common entrance and the preliminary certificate examinations but could not attend secondary school because of unaffordability on her mother and grandmother s part she wrote the college of preceptors examinations and got nine subjects i didn t work because one of my sisters who was away at law school left three children and i had to take care of them with my grandmother she related my aunt left another three with my grandmother and i had to help too eventually the children joined their parents i ran my mother s business after she started going to america every six months everyone in the family went except me and my brother sustainability ventures under jaundoo s leadership fact operates a kitchen a diner a conference hall a daycare and playschool and a beauty salon all sustainability projects which helped to fund among other things its children s activities prior to the covid 19 period for several years jaundoo led a back to school programme which helped to equip children with school supplies until the advent of covid 19 fact also held annual christmas parties for children as well as mother s day and father s day activities it also ran an after school programme catering for over 100 children who were given a meal and some provided with transportation to their homes with the onset of covid 19 jaundoo said fact provided 7 000 in groceries for 52 families whose children had attended the after school programme some families were also assisted with planting organic kitchen gardens we bought the plants and watering cans and shared to families she said we helped them to sell their produce our kitchen bought from them the kitchen the only sustainable project in operation now began in 2016 with a take away service and selling snacks from a glass case a usaid contractor working with ngos saw what was being done and asked what fact would do if given us 7 000 i pushed the kitchen door open and said we needed a new gas stove new fridge and cupboards needed repairing jaundoo said i showed her the fireside we were cooking on for the after school programme i told her if you can help us to renovate the kitchen we would prepare better meals for the children and do catering to sustain our activity fact received us 10 000 as grant funding to upgrade its kitchen after which it started catering for local businesses individuals banks schools and others at present it is catering for covid 19 frontline workers in corriverton from monday to friday it may look little but that is what has kept fact functioning if we hadn t that kitchen we would have been closed like other ngos it pays the cleaner it pays two persons in the kitchen two persons in the snackette and all our utility bills it pays the receptionist and the counsellor tester it gives all the staff lunch every day she said in 2019 following another workshop with caribbean ngos to build capacity fact received us 20 000 to extend its kitchen and takeaway service to include a diner where people could sit relax and enjoy a meal the diner opened in january 2020 but then the coronavirus came in relation to the playschool and daycare fact is paying half the rent for the space so as not to lose it fact was unable to pay the half month rent from january to july this year she revealed a sister who reached out to me covered the rent that s what happens when you pray and believe i don t ask god for money i ask him to open doors and he does it i count the blessings and thank him for what he has done for me and my fact family we had four people employed at the daycare and playschool two are doing online training provided by the government an active layman in her church jaundoo said i think this is what god wants me to do and i am an instrument to his cause in relation to the conference hall it is mostly free for us it is not about the money it is about networking and building relationships if we have an activity those same people would provide the human resources anyone can hold an activity for free if it benefits the community she said recalling a conversation with one of the usaid officials working with ngos to undertake sustainability projects jaundoo quoted the official as saying if fact was to be sustainable her staff had to have sustainability plans of their own at that time the government was giving out house lots of her 26 staff members 19 applied for house lots got them and built their own homes some got loans from the bank and ran their own sustainability projects like shops taxis crop and poultry farming drying fish and making food seasonings some no longer work with the organisation but they still volunteer she said fact now buys stock from its former members for its kitchen initially her husband who runs their family business was skeptical about her leading fact jaundoo said but he supported her idea of sustainability he quit his job at the bank and extended their business if we had not done that i could not have been working at fact without being paid she mused jaundoo is now looking forward to retirement we have people who can run it she said i would still be around maybe on the board of directors
the first world war was the first major war after the industrialisation of the western economies this revolutionised the way in which the war was fought with horrendous new weapons and new forms of transport although horse drawn transport was still used at the beginning of the war this was gradually replaced by motorised vehicles when britain declared war on germany in august 1914 british forces only had 47 lorries by the time the war ended the total ran to tens of thousands these vehicles needed to be maintained and repaired although many were just left to deteriorate on the battlefields of continental europe in 1917 with the end of the war still a distant prospect the army council decided that a centralised national vehicle repair depot should be established as soon as possible the criteria for a suitable site stated that it should be within 40 miles of london to the west of it to reduce air raid risk and that it should be close to a railway line the site eventually chosen was the cippenham court farm estate after months of wrangling the government finally approved the scheme on may 23 1918 work began on the site to form the slough motor repair depot in july 1918 this coincided with the major offensive launched on july 15 known as the second battle of the marne which was a desperate last attempt by germany to win the war the war ended only four months later much sooner than had seemed likely when the repair depot had opened in july also read inside the slough trading estate construction of the depot was allowed to continue so the government could repair the damaged war vehicles and get a higher price in return rather than selling them just for scrap value however the scheme became subject to heavy criticism in the national press as the proverbial white elephant demonstrations took place and the site became known locally as the dump a name which survived for several decades the site finally became operational in 1919 vehicles in need of repair began to arrive together with large quantities of spare parts by march of that year the project employed all the available local men the rest of the workforce which now totalled 3 400 were either accommodated in wooden huts on the site or commuted in by train at first these men would alight at burnham beeches station and walk down burnham lane to the site later in 1919 a branch line was constructed directly to an on site station in the depot by then the depot was fully operational with rows of large buildings for the storage of vehicles spare parts and workshops one building alone covered eight acres and could accommodate 15 000 vehicles the largest facility under one roof in the uk at that time the spare parts alone were said to value 15m a staggering 675m in modern day prices auctions to dispose of the stock had also commenced in its early years the slough trading estate was involved in the disposal of surplus warships for the admiralty one of the co founders of the company commander mcgrath had built up a close relationship with the government from his service for winston churchill in theww1 tank programme mcgrath negotiated the contract for the sale of the warships a total of around thirty vessels including battleships cruisers and destroyers which contained strict rules regarding their disposal the purchase price was agreed at 39 shillings per ton with a nominal contract value of 351 000 slough trading estate had a buyer for the ships which most likely came via the government in the form of a german shipbreaker based in berlin the price agreed was 40 shillings and 6d per ton which was predicted to give the company a profit of 40 000 there was no report of the deal in the newspapers of the time which suggests that the arrangement of the uk government selling old warships directly to their wartime enemy would have been regarded as a huge embarrassment to avoid the necessity of german tugs turning up to british naval ports to take away the old warships records suggest the admiralty agreed to deliver the vessels itself also read 11 things you ll only know if you grew up in slough by the beginning of 1921 business at the slough site was well underway in february the pall mall gazette sent a reporter to take a look at what was happening there he found it has been transformed from a wilderness of sheds and broken down motor vehicles into imposing and well ordered engineering works there are gigantic motor workshops one of which covers eight acres of ground and in addition chocolate and safety razor factories whilst an enormous store has been let off as a wool dump valued at several hundred thousand pounds one shop is packed with ricardo tank engines out of a complete tank the company have constructed for their own use at present a very efficient locomotive of 250 h p another instance of the company s versatility is the 30 seater charabanc which they are building upon a well known chassis at a price of 950 an official of the company told our representative that he believed no other in the wide world contained such a comprehensive stock of the component parts of very nearly every make of car on the market auction sales take place at slough twice a week but buyers flock in daily at this time stc advertised in the times almost continuously an example being from march 1922 stating rentals of from 7d a square foot yearly and the advantage of low rates for new factories having exceptionally large uninterrupted floor space and the facilities for obtaining power and all the other services for which the company s property is well known the times claimed the firm informs us that two lettings have been affected as a direct result of this publicity the channell chemical company who manufacture in america the o cedar mops and polishes pedigree stock sales company has acquired commodious buildings for the sale of pedigree livestock and friesian cattle which is being imported from south africa stc issued a leaflet in november 1924 which listed a total of 36 companies which had leased premises these included barclays bank crane packing and zwicky the number had nearly doubled to 65 in april 1927 and now included other major household names such as gillette johnson johnson black decker and citroen by may 1925 the original task of repairing and selling theww1 vehicles had been completed and the activities of stc had changed to become an estate management company so on august 7 1925 royal assent was given to the slough trading company act 1925 which authorised the company to build roads lay water mains steam pipes electricity cables and drains the act was the company s green light to go ahead with large scale development in june 1926 it was decided to change the name of the company to slough estates ltd as this more accurately described its activities the annual report presented at the agm for the year 1925 stated that in spite of having one of the most up to date power houses in the country your directors are having to install another 15 000 worth of additional turbines and plant at that time the gross rent roll was over 50 000 pa mostly on long term leases the estate had 11 miles of railway track and five miles of roads the company had erected 82 brick built cottages 52 timber built bungalows for housing its employees and was to erect a further large number of houses the dump was set to become the largest industrial estate in europe under single company ownership this piece first appeared in a centenary feature for segro in may 2020 with special thanks

the ability to purchase goods and services over the internet has permanently changed how countless industries conduct business especially after the disruption caused by the covid 19 pandemic online marketplaces remove much of the stress associated with in person purchases of expensive items such as automobiles there are many benefits to purchasing a car online in addition to reducing stress and drive time communicating with a seller for an online purchase is often through email which provides an opportunity to thoroughly review the terms of purchase this allows the buyer to make a decision on their own time even if it is after the regular business hours for the dealership communicating with an automobile dealer remotely also detaches the buyer from the purchase reducing the emotion involved in the decision making process however interacting with an online marketplace does come with inherent risks especially when dealing with a private seller bbb scam tracker receives multiple reports of misrepresentative or fraudulent car purchasing scams every year with often disastrous results for the victim after contacting a seller for a classic car online one texas resident reported that the seller was on an oil rig in the gulf but said i could buy the car through a shipping company it seemed the car was being stored in washington state and all i had to do is send 12 000 to them the car was priced way under market value which was the first red flag there was also no phone number associated with the shipping company when i asked for the vin they stated it was illegal to disclose that information when i searched for the business on google i couldn t find a building at the address they provided and i walked away from the deal if you are considering buying a car online bbb recommends the following tips to help you avoid getting scammed and get the best deal possible set a budget before you set out to find the perfect car it is important to establish a budget you will also want to factor in monthly expenses that come with owning a vehicle including insurance payments fuel parking and routine maintenance and repairs a clearly defined budget will make choosing a vehicle negotiating with a dealer and getting a loan much easier do thorough research once you have narrowed your search compare models you are interested in keeping a close eye on safety ratings owner reviews and warranties visit manufacturer websites to see detailed images of each car and research mpg statistics interior options cargo space towing capacity and more the additional time you spend on these initial steps the more comfortable you will feel when making a purchase shop for a deal these may include cash back deals rebates low interest financing options or incentives for recent graduates military veterans uber and lyft drivers or first responders in addition many dealers are willing to make price cuts on previous year models or any model that did not sell as well as expected purchasing one of these surplus vehicles can mean extra incentives from the dealer speak with internet sales managers when you find a car you are interested in it is time to get in touch with an internet sales manager during your initial conversations focus on what car you want whether they have it stock or can get it and how much they will sell it for if you are considering purchasing a certified pre owned vehicle now is the time to ask for a copy of the vehicle history report test drive the vehicle you should always take a test drive before you sign the final paperwork there is no substitute for seeing a car in person looking under the hood sitting in the driver s seat and making sure the engine runs smoothly to do so you may need to travel to the dealer s place of business some dealers offer the ability to test drive upon delivery and if anything isn t as expected you may cancel the sale take the route that works best for you but never skip the test drive complete the sale at the dealer or upon delivery it is still usually necessary to sign the final paperwork in person if you would rather avoid visiting the dealership ask about delivery some dealers will drop off the car at your home or place of business and allow you to sign upon delivery avoid online car sales scams there are plenty of pros to buying a car online but caution is needed as well anytime you shop online and especially when making an expensive purchase like a car you should keep the following tips in mind watch out for too good to be true deals they are most likely a scam scammers often steal consumers personal information and money by offering them high value goods at highly discounted prices never wire funds or complete bank to bank transactions scammers love this kind of transaction because there is no way to get your money back once completed instead make legitimate purchases by check or credit card contact the seller by phone at some point during your negotiations speak with the sales manager on the phone if they are unusually vague about specific details of the sale or cannot confirm their location or the vehicle location it s most likely a scam see the car first never buy a car without making an in person inspection and taking a test drive first don t give in to pressure scammers often try to pressure you to give up your personal information or make a down payment before you have time to think about the purchase take your time and consider a deal over before agreeing to anything don t trust a seller or buyer who says that ebay paypal craigslist or another online marketplace guarantee the transaction these sites explicitly explain they cannot guarantee that people using their services are legitimate to learn more see the bbb tips on buying a new car and buying a used car you can also lookup car dealerships at bbb org to check their business rating and read customer reviews like this like loading related
big news from the united states inflation has hit 5 4 per cent an astonishing level as the next graph shows american consumer prices are rising at the fastest rate in over a decade used cars and energy are a major cause of the lift inflation rates in the us are at a record high for recent years related terrifying prediction for mortgage payers some of this is temporary due to the fact this time last year prices were low but economists believe some of it could be here to stay america is often just ahead of australia and we could soon be facing higher inflation too the low interest rates that have helped lift australia s economy out of the pandemic recession are like dry tinder for inflation and the record government spending just pours fuel on the fire inflation is caused by too much money chasing too few goods when people can borrow freely the amount of money chasing those goods goes up and companies can raise prices the house price connection when we talk about inflation we always have to talk about interest rates the two go together the rba watches inflation and tries to control it by changing interest rates when they raise rates that means they are trying to push inflation down by making it more expensive to borrow money when they cut rates they are trying to lift inflation a bit by making it cheaper to borrow they try to keep inflation in a narrow band between 2 per cent and 3 per cent a year recently mostly successfully as the next chart shows related no idea sign aussie economy is doomed we ve got used to low inflation in recent years related why interest rates may have to rise sooner and when we talk about interest rates we have to talk about house prices aussie house prices have recently gone into the stratosphere that s because you can borrow a million dollars or two at 2 per cent interest but what happens to the record 1 9 trillion in housing debt if rates start to rise house prices and debt are through the roof in australia australia s interest rate policy works in several ways when rates are low it unleashes four main effects 1 mortgage repayments fall leaving people with more disposable income 2 the australian dollar falls making life easier for our exporters and making imports more expensive 3 it is cheaper to borrow encouraging people and companies to go into debt to spend money 4 it lifts house prices which makes aussies feel wealthier all of these effects encourage spending which is why we use interest rate policies to try to make the economy stronger lower interest rates give us more economic growth and lower unemployment we need all the help we can get right now as much of the country is deep in lockdown but all the spending caused by low interest rates can also lead to inflation and interest rate rises tend to follow hot on the heels of inflation the rba has said interest rates won t rise until 2023 or 2024 but new zealand is getting ready to raise interest rates this year following a huge lift in house prices in that country if inflation in australia rises the rba will come under pressure to do the same it will be a wobbly time for asset prices after all the current record highs in the stock market also owe their existence to loose interest rates and trust me we won t like it if prices are rising at 5 4 per cent a year aussies like to complain about inflation when one product goes up by 5 per cent e g electricity even if other things are falling in price at the same time clothes computers and tvs are good examples if average inflation is 5 per cent it will mean some things are rising at 1 per cent and other things are going up at 9 per cent that will feel really bad the american experience is a warning for us we are enjoying the economic upside of our spending spree now but we must be wary of what follows jason murphy is an economist jasemurphy he is the author of the book incentivology

experts have urged investors to buy gold to protect their portfolios against a surge in inflation as the reopening of economies around the world unleashes pent up demand investment banking giant goldman sachs has advised clients to snap up the precious metal viewed as a bulwark against rising prices while fund managers said investors needed an insurance policy for their portfolios inflation reached a 13 year high in america the us department of labor reported last week climbing to 5 4pc in june and shocking economists who had expected the pace of price rises to slow in britain the consumer prices index measure of inflation hit 2 5pc in june rising further above the bank of england s 2pc target gold trades at around 1 800 1 300 an ounce but mikhail sprogis of goldman sachs said it should be worth at least 2 000 today and more if central banks such as america s federal reserve failed to react to a continued surge in inflation it has the potential to rally significantly in the event that the global recovery is hampered or inflation picks up strongly and the fed underreacts he said in this scenario gold prices should benefit in the same way as they have done during prior periods of excessive inflation gold is seen as a store of value when inflation rises in contrast to currencies which lose their value in real terms john chatfeild roberts of jupiter the investment firm said if there is sustained inflation gold will hold its value but gold has done well over the past 20 years even when there has been no inflation it also goes up when other investments go down that s why it is still important to own it to protect a portfolio despite the rise in inflation this year gold has so far performed poorly in 2021 it has fallen by 3 5pc in value while british and global stock markets have delivered double digit returns however catherine doyle of newton investment management said it should still form a central part of investors portfolios it s a currency that cannot be manipulated by central banks with limited supply and good inflation hedging properties she said gregory perdon of arbuthnot latham the wealth manager said the gold price had suffered this year because investors had been selling bonds sending their yields which move in the opposite direction to prices higher the key to the gold price over short periods is the yield on 10 year american government bonds he said when it rises as has happened this year investors sell gold mr perdon cautioned that he expected bonds to continue falling in value when central banks started to withdraw bond buying stimulus efforts launched to limit the economic damage caused by the pandemic the cryptocurrency bitcoin has also sucked up some of the demand for gold this year particularly among diy investors according to ms doyle who dismissed its credentials as an alternative to the precious metal bitcoin has no intrinsic value and regulators could clamp down on it she said even if cryptocurrencies survive it behaves more like a risky stock than a defensive investment so we would not buy it as a portfolio stabiliser like gold mr sprogis agreed we think that cryptocurrencies are a long way off becoming a defensive long term store of value he said ms doyle downplayed the risk of inflation continuing to surge over the next 12 months however we don t expect there to be a long inflationary period because there are powerful deflationary forces at play such as an ageing population and high debt burdens she said the simplest way to invest in gold is to buy a fund rather than the metal directly peter sleep of seven investment management recommended the 13 6bn invesco physical gold etc which costs 0 15pc a year and is backed by real gold blackrock gold general is another option the 1 3bn fund invests in shares in gold related companies which tend to be more volatile than the price of the precious metal itself it costs 1 18pc a year similarly the 720m ruffer gold fund invests in gold mining companies and charges a fee of 1 25pc per year

everyone has a favorite sandwich often prepared to an exacting degree of specification turkey or ham grilled or toasted mayo or mustard white or whole wheat as food historians we want to share how the sandwiches we eat or used to eat do more than fill us up during our lunch breaks in their stories are themes of immigration and globalization of class and gender and of resourcefulness and creativity the tuna salad sandwich originated from an impulse to conserve only to become a symbol of excess in the 19th century before the era of supermarkets and cheap groceries most americans avoided wasting food scraps of chicken ham or fish from supper would be mixed with mayonnaise and served on lettuce for lunch leftovers of celery pickles and olives served as supper relishes would also be folded into the mix the versions of these salads that incorporated fish tended to use salmon whitefish or trout most americans didn t cook or even know of tuna around the end of the 19th century middle class women began to spend more time in public patronizing department stores lectures and museums since social conventions kept these women out of the saloons where men ate lunch restaurants opened up to cater to this new clientele they offered women exactly the kind of foods they had served each other at home salads while salads made at home often were composed of leftovers those at lunch restaurants were made from scratch fish and shellfish salads were typical fare when further social and economic changes brought women into the public as office and department store workers they found fish salads waiting for them at the affordable lunch counters patronized by busy urban workers unlike the ladies lunch the office lunch hour had time limits so lunch counters came up with the idea of offering the salads between two pieces of bread which sped up table turnover and encouraged patrons to get lunch to go when canned tuna was introduced in the early 20th century lunch counters and home cooks could skip the step of cooking a fish and go straight to the salad but there was a downside the immense popularity of canned tuna led to the growth of a global industry that has severely depleted stocks and led to the unintended slaughter of millions of dolphins a clever way to use dinner scraps has become a global crisis of conscience and capitalism gonna get a big dish of beef chow mein warren zevon sings in his 1978 hit werewolves of london a nod to the popular chinese stir fried noodle dish during that same decade alika and the happy samoans the house band for a chinese restaurant in fall river mass also paid tribute to chow mein with a song titled chow mein sandwich the chow mein sandwich is the quintessential east meets west food largely associated with new england s chinese restaurants specifically those of fall river a city crowded with textile mills near the rhode island border the sandwich became popular in the 1920s because it was filling and cheap workers munched on them in factory canteens while their kids ate them for lunch in the parish schools especially on meatless fridays it would go on to be available at some five and dime lunch counters like kresge s and woolworth and even at nathan s in coney island it s exactly what it sounds like a sandwich filled with chow mein deep fried flat noodles topped with a ladle of brown gravy onions celery and bean sprouts if you want to make your own authentic sandwich at home use hoo mee chow mein mix still made in fall river it can be served in a bun à la sloppy joe or between sliced white bread much like a hot turkey sandwich with gravy the classic meal includes the sandwich french fries and orange soda for those who grew up in the fall river area the chow mein sandwich is a reminder of home just ask famous chef and fall river native emeril lagasse who came up with his own fall river chow mein recipe and at one time fall river expats living in los angeles would hold a fall river day on the menu chow mein sandwiches unlike many american food trends of the 1890s such as the waldorf salad and chafing dishes the club sandwich has endured immune to obsolescence the sandwich originated in the country s stuffy gentlemen s clubs which are known to this day for a conservatism that includes loyalty to outdated cuisine the wilmington club in delaware continues to serve terrapin while the philadelphia club s specialties include veal and ham pie so the club sandwich s spread to the rest of the population along with its lasting popularity is a testament to its inventiveness and appeal a two layer affair the club sandwich calls for three pieces of toasted bread spread with mayonnaise and filled with chicken or turkey bacon lettuce and tomato usually the sandwich is cut into two triangles and held together with a toothpick stuck in each half some believe it should be eaten with a fork and knife and its blend of elegance and blandness make the club sandwich a permanent feature of country club and city club cuisine as far back as 1889 there are references to a union club sandwich of turkey or ham on toast the saratoga club house offered a club sandwich on its menu beginning in 1894 until the 1920s sandwiches were identified with ladies lunch places the first club sandwich recipe comes from an 1899 book of salads sandwiches and chafing dish dainties and its most famous proponent was wallis simpson the american woman whom edward viii abdicated the throne of great britain to marry nonetheless an 1889 article from the new york sun titled an appetizing sandwich a dainty treat that has made a new york chef popular describes the union club sandwich as appropriate for a post theater supper or something light to be eaten before a nightcap this was one type of sandwich that men could indulge in the article seemed to be saying as long as it wasn t eaten for lunch while the peanut butter and jelly sandwich eventually became a staple of elementary school cafeterias it has upper crust origins in the late 19th century at elegant ladies luncheons a popular snack included small crustless tea sandwiches with butter and cucumber cold cuts or cheese around this time health food advocates like john harvey kellogg started promoting peanut products as a replacement for animal based foods butter included for a vegetarian option at these luncheons peanut butter replaced regular butter one of the earliest known recipes that suggested including jelly with peanut butter appeared in a 1901 issue of the boston cooking school magazine for variety author julia davis chandler wrote some day try making little sandwiches or bread fingers of three very thin layers of bread and two of filling one of peanut paste whatever brand you prefer and currant or crabapple jelly for the other the combination is delicious and so far as i know original the sandwich moved from garden parties to lunchboxes in the 1920s when peanut butter started to be mass produced with hydrogenated vegetable oil and sugar marketers of the skippy brand targeted children as a potential new audience and thus the association with school lunches was forged the classic version of the sandwich is made with soft sliced white bread creamy or chunky peanut butter and jelly outside of the united states the peanut butter and jelly sandwich is rare much of the world views the combination as repulsive these days many try to avoid white bread and hydrogenated fats nonetheless the sandwich has a nostalgic appeal for many americans and recipes for high end versions with freshly ground peanuts artisanal bread or unusual jams circulate on the internet the scotch woodcock is probably not scottish it s arguably not even a sandwich a favorite of oxford students and members of parliament until the mid 20th century the dish is generally prepared by layering anchovy paste and eggs on toast like its cheesier cousin the welsh rabbit better known as rarebit its name is fanciful perhaps there was something about the name if not the ingredients that sparked the imagination of miss frances lusk of jackson miss inspired to add a little british sophistication to her entertaining she crafted her own version of the scotch woodcock for a 1911 united daughters of the confederacy fundraising cookbook miss lusk s woodcock sandwich mixed strained tomatoes and melted cheese added raw eggs and slathered the paste between layers of bread or biscuits as food historian bee wilson argues in her history of the sandwich american sandwiches distinguished themselves from their british counterparts by the scale of their ambition imitating the rising skylines of american cities many were towering affairs that celebrated abundance but those sandwiches were the sandwiches of urban lunchrooms and later diners in the homes of southern clubwomen the sandwich was a way to marry british sophistication to american creativity the united daughters of the confederacy cookbook included sweetbread sandwiches made by heating canned offal animal trimmings and slathering the mashed mixture between two pieces of toast there s also a green pepper sandwich crafted from very thin slices of bread and very thin slices of green pepper such creative combinations weren t limited to the elites of mississippi s capital city in the plantation homes of the mississippi delta members of the coahoma woman s club served sandwiches of english walnuts black walnuts and stuffed olives ground into a colorful paste they also assembled friendship sandwiches from grated cucumbers onions celery and green peppers mixed with cottage cheese and mayonnaise meanwhile the industrial elite of laurel miss served mashed bacon and egg sandwiches and creamed sardine sandwiches not all of these amalgamations were capped by a slice of bread so purists might balk at calling them sandwiches but these ladies did and they proudly tied up their original creations with ribbons paul freedman is

for 21 years the software company kaseya labored in relative obscurity at least until cybercriminals exploited it in early july for a massive ransomware attack that snarled businesses around the world and escalated u s russia diplomatic tensions but it turns out that the recent hack wasn t the first major cybersecurity problem to hit the miami based company and its core product which it teams use to remotely monitor and administer workplace computer systems and other devices it feels a little like deja vu said allie mellen a security analyst at forrester research in 2018 for instance hackers managed to infiltrate kaseya s tool in 2018 to run a cryptojacking operation which channels the power of afflicted computers to mine cryptocurrency often without its victims noticing it was a less harmful breach than the recent ransomware attack which was impossible to miss since it crippled affected systems until their owners paid up but it similarly relied on kaseya s virtual system administrator product or vsa as a vehicle to get access to the companies that rely on it a 2019 ransomware attack also rode into computers through another company s add on software component to the kaseya vsa causing more limited damage than the recent attack some experts have tied that earlier assault to some of the same hackers who later formed revil the russian language syndicate blamed for the latest attack and in 2014 kaseya s own founders sued the company in a dispute over responsibility for a vsa security flaw that allowed hackers to launch a separate cryptocurrency scheme the court case does not appear to have been previously reported outside of a brief 2015 mention in a technical blog post at the time the founders denied responsibility for the vulnerability calling the company s charges against them a bogus assertion coding vulnerabilities nearly all of kaseya s security problems have as their root cause well understood coding vulnerabilities that should have been addressed earlier said cybersecurity expert katie moussouris the founder and chief executive officer of luta security kaseya needs to shape up as does the entire software industry she said this is a failure to incorporate the lessons the bugs were teaching you kaseya like a lot of companies is failing to learn those lessons many of the attacks relied at least in part on what s known as a sql injection a technique hackers use to inject malicious code into web queries it s an old technique that mellen said has been considered a solved problem in the cybersecurity world for a decade it points to a chronic product security issue in kaseya s software that remains unaddressed seven years later she said when organizations choose to brush over security challenges the incidents continue and as in this case get worse kaseya has noted that it has long been a target because many of its direct customers are managed services providers that host it infrastructure for hundreds if not thousands of other businesses in the business we re in and the number of endpoints we manage around the world as you might expect we take security extremely seriously ronan kirby president of the company s european operations said at a belgian cybersecurity conference recently you attack a company you get into the company you attack a service provider you get into all their customers you get into kaseya that s a very different proposition so obviously we re an attractive target declined to answer kaseya declined to answer questions from the associated press about the previous hacks or the legal dispute involving its founders mark sutherland and paul wong co founded kaseya in california in 2000 they had previously worked together on a project protecting the email accounts of u s intelligence workers at the national security agency according to an account on the company s website but more than a year after selling kaseya in june 2013 court records show that sutherland wong and two other former top executives sued the company to recoup 5 5 million in stock buybacks they said they were unfairly denied at the heart of the dispute was an attack by hackers who used kaseya s vsa as a conduit to deploy litecoin mining malware which secretly hijacks a victim computer s power to make money for the hacker by processing new cryptocurrency payments kaseya publicly disclosed the attacks in a march 2014 notice to customers privately it was blaming the company s previous leadership for not warning about serious vulnerabilities in kaseya s software it sought to deprive them of the final 5 5 million of the acquisition price to compensate for the loss of business and damaged reputation the founders in turn blamed the new leadership for scaling back on coding expertise and eliminating a hotfix system for rapidly fixing bugs according to the lawsuit from sutherland wong former ceo gerald blackie and former chief operating officer timothy mcmullen injection technique they also argued that the sql injection technique used by the hackers was highly common and inherent in any computer code that uses the sql programming language ensuring that each and every piece of database access code is immune to sql injection is essentially impossible said their lawsuit mellen and moussouris both rejected that assertion that is a bold statement and provably false moussouris said it highlights the fact they lacked the security knowledge and sophistication to protect their users none of the plaintiffs or their lawyers responded to requests for comment they agreed to dismiss the case in december 2013 just a month after they filed it it s not clear how it was settled kaseya is privately held linkedin profiles for sutherland and wong list them as retired with sutherland also growing wine grapes blackie went on to become ceo of another miami based provider of remote control software pilixo where he was joined by mcmullen pilixo didn t return a request for comment new vulnerabilities affecting kaseya s vsa including the one exploited by the revil ransomware gang were discovered this year by a dutch cybersecurity research group that says it confidentially warned kaseya in early april in the wrong hands these vulnerabilities could lead to the compromise of large numbers of computers managed by kaseya vsa the dutch institute for vulnerability disclosure said in a blog post last week explaining the timeline of its actions some of those kaseya fixed by may including another sql injection flaw but the dutch group said others were still unpatched when ransomware started hitting hundreds of businesses in early july kaseya has said up to 1 500 businesses have been compromised as a result of the attack kaseya on sunday rolled out patches to the vulnerabilities used in the revil attack moussouris said there s a pattern of ransomware syndicates going after easily detectable software flaws it s collective technical debt around the world and the ransomware gangs are technical debt collectors she said they re coming after organizations like kaseya and others that haven t invested in better security
these fast paced companies could generate life altering returns for long term investors there are a lot of ways for folks to grow their wealth for instance they could squirrel their money away under the mattress or buy real estate but when compared to other investment vehicles the stock market is the king of the mountain since 1980 the benchmark s p 500 has delivered an average annual return including dividends of better than 11 however investors don t have to settle for market matching returns buyers of the following five innovative growth stocks have the opportunity to potentially quadruple their initial investment by the end of the decade that means if you put 250 000 to work in these growth stocks right now you could be sitting on 1 million or more by 2030 salesforce some of you might be confused as to why a megacap stock has made a list of companies that could quadruple by 2030 make no mistake about it cloud based customer relationship management crm software provider salesforce com crm 0 91 is a sustainably high growth company that could see its sales multiple expand as crm becomes a global tool used to strengthen businesses in simple terms crm is software businesses use to handle service issues marketing campaigns and customer client analytics on a real time basis it s a no brainer solution for consumer facing retail operations but is becoming more widely used by the financial healthcare and industrial sectors crm is expected to be a double digit percentage growth opportunity through at least mid decade if not well beyond as for salesforce its ceo marc benioff is touting at least 50 billion in annual sales by fiscal 2026 the company generated 21 3 billion in full year sales in fiscal 2021 for context salesforce is expected to achieve this jaw dropping growth on the heels of numerous earning accretive acquisitions as well as its world leading crm share of 19 8 according to market intelligence firm idc in the first half of 2020 the company s four closest competitors don t even add up to salesforce s current market share in other words salesforce has a virtually insurmountable competitive edge that could make shareholders rich cresco labs if you re after some serious green investing in cannabis could be a smart move even though we ve watched u s marijuana stocks ebb and flow before the industry is finally maturing and winners like u s multistate operator mso cresco labs crlbf 5 24 are standing out from the crowd cresco like other msos has a rapidly growing retail presence in a number of existing or potential billion dollar markets such as illinois ohio and florida what s noteworthy about cresco s expansion approach is that it s chosen a number of markets that dole out retail licenses on a limited basis in short the company has ensured that it ll be able to secure a healthy chunk of market share in the states it s operating in however the real lure for cresco is the company s industry leading wholesale operations acquiring origin house in early 2020 gave cresco access to a highly lucrative cannabis distribution license in california this is allowing the company to place third party and proprietary pot products into more than 575 dispensaries throughout the golden state the largest pot market in the world wholesale should make cresco one of the fastest growing pot stocks of the 2020s pubmatic don t forget about small cap stocks when investing for the future they may not offer the same level of safety as large cap or megacap stocks but their growth potential is often unrivaled leading to the opportunity for big gains this is why ad tech up and comer pubmatic pubm 3 09 can make investors millionaires pubmatic is what s known as a sell side platform programmatic ad company this simply means it helps publishers sell their display space to advertisers the company s cloud based platform puts publishers in charge of factors like setting a minimum price floor for displaying an ad and it relies on machine learning to optimize ads for the user so publishers and advertisers hopefully get the best bang for their buck clearly programmatic advertising is working publishers that have been with pubmatic at least a year spent 30 more during the first quarter than they did in 2020 the company is especially excited about its prospects in mobile digital video and connected tv over the top ad spend with double digit annual growth forecast through 2024 we re still in the early innings for ad tech and there s a good chance pubmatic will become a long term winner the original bark company another growth story that never ceases to amaze is the amount of money spent on companion animals this year alone the american pet products association expects americans to shell out almost 110 billion on their furry family members that s a massive opportunity for the likes of the original bark company bark 1 67 which you might know better as barkbox last year during the worst economic downturn in decades bark s subscriber count jumped 91 to 1 2 million although you can find its products in more than 23 000 retail stores bark s online subscription model helps to lower overhead costs which has in turn pushed its gross margin to around 60 on a consistent basis assuming bark can triple its sales by mid decade this juicy margin should result in a lot of operating cash flow furthermore barkbox is using innovation and its tech driven operating model to its advantage in addition to its core offering which sends toys and treats to dog owners each month the company introduced bark eats and bark home last year the latter retails everyday items such as collars and beds while the former works with dog owners to develop a unique dry food diet that s delivered the potential for add on sales as bark innovates gives this company a really good chance to outperform amazon have i mentioned that megacap stocks can still make investors a fortune amazon amzn 0 15 might be one of the largest publicly traded companies by market cap on the planet but its insanely high cash flow growth potential and historic premium relative to cash flow might allow its valuation to quadruple by 2030 one piece of the puzzle is the company s ongoing dominance of the online retail space this year emarketer expects amazon will see 0 40 of every 1 spent online in the u s route through its seller marketplace that more than quintuples the share of the next closest competitor and it s helped amazon sign up more than 200 million people to a prime membership these memberships pad amazon s pockets and give its razor thin retail margins some wiggle room even more important is the growth we re witnessing from cloud infrastructure segment amazon web services aws aws is the world s leading cloud infrastructure provider with sales growth registering 30 last year despite accounting for about an eighth of total sales aws regularly generates a majority of amazon s operating income for the past 11 years amazon has been valued at between 23 and 37 times its operating cash flow it if it were to maintain this range it should have no trouble turning a 250 000 investment into 1 million by 2030

usipa hits back against cnn s report on biomass industry the us industrial pellet association usipa said it is deeply disappointed by cnn s portrayal of the biomass industry its criticism follows a report by cnn that allegedly portrayed the scientific community as being in uniform opposition to biomass citing a number of critical academics however it excluded assessments by the un intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in a statement usipa said we are deeply disappointed by cnn s portrayal of the biomass industry which plays a crucial role in the fight against climate change by keeping millions of tons of fossil fuels in the ground while contributing to the broader sustainable forest economy all mainstream analyses show that sustainable bioenergy is one of many technologies that are essential to meet net zero goals and keep global temperature rise below 1 5oc however solving the climate crisis will require more than rapid and far reaching transitions to decarbonise the global economy above all it requires unprecedented levels of cooperation that can only be achieved through honest debate that is guided by science and respects the communities and people climate policy is meant to help usipa highlighted that the space for open dialogue surrounding biomass is hindered by one sided climate reporting that lacks objectivity and omits key facts the organisation said cnn spoke with a lead author for the ipcc s sixth assessment report for agriculture and forestry but chose not to include comments from them in the report the ipcc s assessment was recently affirmed in a report from the international energy agency which designates bioenergy as one of the seven pillars of decarbonisation alongside hydrogen electrification and energy efficiency the iea predicts that by 2050 bioenergy will account for 5 of total electricity generation cnn presents biomass as a dominant game changing industry wiping out forests and forest ecosystems across north carolina and the entire us southeast said usipa the data however shows the complete opposite the us department of agriculture monitors changes in america s forests through its highly sophisticated forest inventory and analysis programme that includes more than 300 000 ground pilot stations assessed each year the usda data shows that forest area in eastern north carolina increased by more than 87 000 acres between 2010 and 2018 overall forested area across the us southeast has remained stable over the past 70 years while forest carbon stocks have more than doubled usipa highlighted that strict sustainability criteria ensures that the eu only sources biomass that makes a positive contribution to the climate and healthy forest ecosystems the biomass industry is committed to ensuring our operations have a positive economic and environmental impact in local communities said usipa our production facilities comply and in many cases exceed all state and federal regulations the industry has also invested more than 2 billion 2 34 billion across the us southeast over the past decade and provides more than 5 000 direct jobs we are proud to support rural communities that are in critical need of economic investment and meaningful employment opportunities

texas instruments and two other tech stocks offer an attractive balance of growth value and income tech stocks that pay dividends are often overlooked by the market after all tech companies usually start paying dividends when they run out of room to expand and tech investors often favor growth over stability income seeking investors might also flock toward higher yields in other sectors such as energy pharmaceutical and real estate yet there are still plenty of dividend paying tech stocks which provide a good balance of growth value and income here are three stocks which check all three boxes texas instruments txn 2 62 cisco systems csco 1 60 and skyworks solutions swks 3 86 1 texas instruments texas instruments ti manufactures analog and embedded chips for a wide range of industries these chips already cost less to manufacture than higher end chips and ti s transition from 200mm to 300mm wafers over the past few years further reduced its production costs by up to 40 its business model enabled ti to grow its free cash flow at an average rate of 12 annually between 2004 and 2020 instead of hoarding that cash ti returned most of it to shareholders via dividends and buybacks it raised its dividend annually for 17 straight years at a compound annual growth rate cagr of 26 and reduced its share count by 46 during the same period it currently pays a forward dividend yield of 2 1 over the past ten years ti s stocks generated a total return of more than 700 which crushed the s p 500 s total return of about 300 we shouldn t evaluate ti based on its past performance alone but its future still seems bright its revenue rose less than 1 last year as the pandemic disrupted its auto and industrial markets but its net income still improved 12 as it expanded its gross margins and reduced its operating costs analysts expect ti s revenue and earnings to grow 21 and 28 respectively as the pandemic passes its stock still looks reasonably valued at 24 times forward earnings 2 cisco systems cisco the world s largest manufacturer of network routers and switches suffered a major slowdown over the past two years the escalating trade war choked off its business in china it sold less hardware to enterprise and data center customers and the pandemic exacerbated that pain in fiscal 2020 which ended last july cisco s revenue fell 5 as its adjusted earnings per share eps boosted by buybacks rose 4 in the first nine months of fiscal 2021 its revenue and adjusted eps both dipped 1 year over year analysts expect its revenue to grow less than 1 this year and its earnings to stay nearly flat those growth rates seem anemic but cisco is a cyclical stock and it s primed to grow again in fiscal 2022 as the pandemic recedes and its customers resume their network upgrades its higher growth security business should also continue to expand amid escalating cyber attacks worldwide that s why analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to improved 5 and 6 respectively next year as that turnaround happens cisco will continue to reward its investors with consistent dividends and buybacks it raised its dividend annually for nearly a decade it currently pays a forward yield of 2 7 and it spent just 44 of its free cash flow on its dividends over the past 12 months it also reduced its outstanding shares by 22 over the past ten years cisco generated a total return of more than 370 during that decade but it still looks cheap at 16 times forward earnings 3 skyworks solutions skyworks is often recognized as an apple aapl 1 11 supplier since it generated over half of its revenues from the iphone maker last year but skyworks also manufactures wireless and radio frequency chips for a wide range of other industries and every generational leap in cellular technology like the jump from 4g to 5g requires more of its chips skyworks ability to sell more chips in new phones connected vehicles smart home devices and other internet of things iot gadgets make it a compelling long term investment in an increasingly connected world that s why it generated a whopping total return of nearly 850 over the past decade looking ahead skyworks is diversifying away from apple by developing new chips and making big acquisitions including its planned purchase of silicon laboratories slab 4 35 infrastructure and automotive unit skyworks revenue and earnings both dipped 1 in 2020 as the pandemic disrupted the smartphone and auto markets it was also forced to abandon huawei one of its top customers amid tighter trade restrictions but this year analysts expect its revenue and earnings to jump 49 and 68 respectively as the pandemic passes sales of 5g phones surge the auto market recovers and silicon laboratories former unit is integrated into the company that growth should cool off next year but the stock still trades at just 18 times forward earnings and it pays a forward yield of 1 1 it raised that payout for seven straight years and it spent just 28 of its free cash flow on those payments over the past 12 months which gives it plenty of room for future hikes

cape canaveral fla ap when blue origin launches people into space for the first time founder jeff bezos will be on board no test pilots or flight engineers for tuesday s debut flight from west texas just bezos his brother an 82 year old aviation pioneer and a teenage tourist the capsule is entirely automated unlike richard branson s virgin galactic rocket plane that required two pilots to get him to space and back a week ago branson s advice just sit back relax look out of the window just absorb the view outside he said on cbs the late show with stephen colbert differences in quirks and rockets aside the billionaire rivals are gearing up to launch just about anybody willing to shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars for a brief up and down space hop a brief look at what awaits bezos and his passengers bezos on board bezos created blue origin in 2000 a move that he said prompted his high school girlfriend to observe jeff started amazon just to get enough money to do blue origin and i can t prove her wrong he has said he finances the rocket company by selling 1 billion in amazon stock a year bezos caught the space bug at age 5 while watching neil armstrong and buzz aldrin s moon landing on july 20 1969 he chose the 52nd anniversary for his own launch enamored by space history bezos named his new shepard rocket after alan shepard the first american in space and his bigger still in development new glenn rocket after john glenn the first american in orbit the 57 year old bezos who also owns the washington post stepped down as amazon s ceo earlier this month and last week donated 200 million to the smithsonian institution to renovate its national air and space museum and launch an education center to see the earth from space it changes you it changes your relationship with this planet with humanity he said it s a thing i ve wanted to do all my life who else is flying bezos personally invited two of his fellow passengers his 50 year old brother mark an investor and volunteer firefighter and female aviation pioneer wally funk joining them will be oliver daemen a last minute fill in for the winner of a 28 million charity auction who had a scheduling conflict at age 82 funk will become the oldest person in space she was among 13 female pilots the so called mercury 13 who took the same tests in the early 1960s as nasa s mercury 7 astronauts but were barred because of their gender finally funk exclaimed when offered a seat alongside bezos as for the dutch daemen who at 18 will become the youngest person in space his financier father bid on the capsule seat in june but dropped out when the price soared blue origin came calling just over a week ago after the unidentified auction winner switched to a later flight the teenage space fanatic who starts college this fall is blue origin s first paying customer no word on what his ticket cost rocket and capsule while bezos won t be the first boss to ride to space on his own rocket he can lay claim to strapping in for his company s first human launch he s also aiming higher with an anticipated altitude of about 66 miles 106 kilometers versus branson s 53 5 miles 86 kilometers blue origin s 60 foot 18 meter new shepard rocket will accelerate toward space at three times the speed of sound or mach 3 before separating from the capsule and returning for an upright landing the passengers will experience three to four minutes of weightlessness before their capsule parachutes onto the desert just 10 minutes after liftoff that s five minutes less than alan shepard s 1961 mercury flight blue origin though offers the biggest windows ever built for a spacecraft bezos purchased the desolate parched land for launching and landing rockets the closest town is van horn population 1 832 track record blue origin has completed 15 test flights to space since 2015 carrying up experiments children s postcards and mannequin skywalker the company s passenger stand in except for the booster crash landing on the first trip all the demos were successful one rocket ended up flying seven times and another five the capsules also were recycled blue origin deliberately aborted a couple flights after liftoff to test the emergency escape system on the capsule the pace seemed slow compared with the competition and many wondered why blue origin its motto gradatim ferociter or step by step ferociously was taking so long to launch people based in kent washington the company kept fairly mum on its launch plans bezos finally announced it s time following the last test flight in april a dress rehearsal that saw mock passengers briefly climb aboard before liftoff the rocket and capsule that will be used tuesday have flown twice before what s next blue origin is expected to open ticket sales soon after bezos flies and has already lined up some of the other auction bidders the company hasn t disclosed the cost of a ride the fourth seat on the upcoming flight was auctioned off for 28 million

this stock has been on a tear over the past 12 months ever since the vaccines were approved back in november of last year tons of stocks considered reopening plays have soared in value one of these companies is revolve group rvlv 8 53 an online fashion retailer that focuses on selling dresses and other apparel for social events the stock is up a whopping 320 in the last 12 months and 114 year to date significantly outpacing the broad market indexes with shares near all time highs should investors be cashing out what is revolve group revolve group is an online retailer focused on serving millennial and gen z women it calls itself a premium lifestyle brand which means it sells expensive apparel dresses footwear and beauty products with a focus on items meant for social occasions the strategy it has used to consistently grow sales outside of 2020 is to partner with thousands of global fashion influencers to market its products in the past revolve group has spent millions of dollars at major events like coachella the annual music festival in california it also has close to five million followers on instagram which it also leverages as part of its marketing operation revolve mostly employs a direct to consumer dtc strategy selling the majority of its products on its two websites revolve com and fwrd com recent results as you might expect a company that sells clothing for social occasions struggled in 2020 revenue was down 3 last year to 581 million however net income actually grew 59 to 57 million for the full year with all the cost savings management implemented revolve was able to pivot to virtual marketing events which helped reduce expenses and started selling more casual outfits during the covid 19 lockdowns in the first quarter revenue grew 22 to 179 million in conjunction with broad vaccination efforts across the united states revolve s biggest market what s more gross margin expanded to 54 0 year over year from 48 6 and free cash flow hit a record 32 million for the period management didn t provide guidance for the full year but if this 22 growth continues 2021 sales will hit 709 million valuation is creeping up with the stock up over 300 in the past 12 months revolve s valuation has gotten much more expensive it currently has a market cap of 4 8 billion giving it a price to sales ratio p s of 7 8 based on its trailing 12 month revenue and a trailing price to free cash flow p fcf multiple of 49 both of these metrics are high considering revolve group s margin structure and the industry it operates in however revenue and free cash flow have been depressed for most of the last year so those numbers could come down quickly in 2021 and beyond if the company can keep up its first quarter momentum time to sell shareholders of revolve group have a tough dilemma with the stock up so much and to be honest i don t think anyone can give a good answer on whether this is a buy or sell at these prices typically if the only reason you have to sell a stock is that the valuation is higher than you d like the best thing to do is to just hold onto your shares this could be especially true in this case since revolve group looks primed for strong growth over the next few quarters with the return of social events selling after a 300 gain might feel like the right thing to do but if the business continues to expand the best move is to sit patiently and hold

does recreational use marijuana legalization at the federal level even matter when so many states are jumping on board the train it s been said a hundred times the legal cannabis industry in the u s is here to stay among all the mom and pop shops and the multi state operators msos there are three companies that have been busy establishing large footprints across the country in anticipation of massive gains one day cresco labs crlbf 5 24 curaleaf holdings curlf 2 79 and green thumb industries gtbif 3 22 all hold licenses in multiple states as vertically integrated operators covering all aspects of the business from cultivation operations to the retail chains that sell their cannabis products all three also generated record revenues during 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 and are largely focused on limited license states such as virginia florida and pennsylvania which reduces the competitive threats to their business in their key markets and all are worth investors serious consideration ramping up operations when it comes to the size of a company bigger doesn t always mean better for investors cresco is the smallest of the three it has operations in 10 states in seven of which it has retail dispensaries and employs 2 300 people its heaviest retail presence is in illinois 10 dispensaries where it s headquartered it recently opened its fourth location in pennsylvania a medical only retail store and beyond its 33 company owned dispensaries cresco has wholesale distribution agreements that get its 350 products into more than 700 other storefronts nationwide massachusetts based curaleaf is on the opposite end of the size spectrum it has 4 600 employees and operations in 23 states with retail dispensaries in 17 in its no 1 retail market florida its 37 retail locations exceed cresco s u s total the company s 107 total dispensaries are spread coast to coast across the u s green thumb falls in the middle size wise headquartered in illinois like cresco the company has multiple dispensaries in its home state as well as in curaleaf s home state of massachusetts it has operations across 13 markets in all with 32 dispensaries and licenses for 110 retail locations and currently employs 2 700 the largest piece of green thumb s retail store footprint is its rise chain which has locations primarily in pennsylvania and illinois green thumb also recently acquired dharma pharmaceuticals in virginia which brought with it a vertically integrated license a production facility and an operating dispensary it also holds the rights to open five additional dispensaries in virginia which has become a very competitive market medical cannabis veteran columbia care also made an acquisition there this year that gave it one of only five licenses for vertically integrated operations in the state growing revenue whether the legal cannabis market s growth was accelerated by the impact of the covid 19 pandemic wider availability of cannabis products or a combination of the two sales in the u s shot skyward in 2020 and continue to do so curaleaf brought in annual revenues of 626 million up 184 compared with 2019 this was fueled by 75 growth in its number of retail cultivation and processing sites as well as 75 growth in the number of states in which it operates it followed that up with revenue of 260 million in 2021 s first quarter boosting its gross profit margin by 6 year over year green thumb s revenue grew by 157 to 556 million in 2020 and the company followed that up with q1 2021 revenue of 194 million up 89 5 year over year that result also gave it its third consecutive quarter of positive net income 0 05 per share cresco had the biggest percentage jump for 2020 up 271 to 476 million and set another quarterly record of 178 million in q1 2021 an increase of 168 year over year according to management s guidance outlook the company will hit total revenue of 1 billion in 2021 notably all three of these companies are equipped with the cash necessary to continue their torrid growth well beyond 2021 as consolidation continues to shape this evolving market an analyst opinion in early july jefferies analyst owen bennett initiated coverage on these three stocks giving each of them buy ratings and optimistic price targets based on those targets cresco offers the most potential for investors it s currently trading at about 11 so if it reaches bennett s target price of over 28 it would result in a 155 gain curaleaf s stock price hovering around 14 offers an 84 upside based on bennett s price target of 25 50 and green thumb currently offers a 71 potential gain based on its current price of 32 and a target of 55 the takeaway if you re looking specifically for a company that has shown it can post net profits green thumb might be your best option from among these three but there are compelling arguments to add all of them to your portfolio as the industry expands and the pressure grows for marijuana legalization at the federal level in the u s keep in mind that those recent revenue growth rates were achieved even in an environment where cannabis has not been federally legalized imagine what these businesses might do with that headwind removed

beijing july 16 the cyberspace administration of china cac said on friday that officials from at least seven departments sent on site teams to conduct a cybersecurity review of ride hailing giant didi global inc the regulators include the cac ministry of public security ministry of state security ministry of transport ministry of natural resources state taxation administration and state administration for market regulation according to the statement cac did not offer more details in its statement but the involvement of several government agencies shows the heavier regulatory pressure on the nine year old company china is in the process of revamping its policy towards privacy and data security it is drafting a personal information protection law which calls for tech platforms to impose stricter measures to ensure secure storage of user data advertisement in september china is set to implement its data security law which requires companies that process critical data to conduct risk assessments and submit reports it also calls on organisations that process data affecting china s national security to submit to annual reviews cac launched the data related cybersecurity investigation into didi just two days after it raised us 4 4 billion rm18 5 billion from its new york initial public offering citing the need to protect national security and the public interest regulators also ordered didi to remove its apps in china which didi said might hurt its revenue didi which currently has a market capitalisation of us 60 billion did not immediately respond to a request for comment on cac s new statement it earlier said it stores all china user and road data in china reuters advertisement
u s politicians from both congressional parties are worried that china is overtaking america as the global leader in science and technology in a rare display of bipartisanship the normally gridlocked senate passed a bill in early june to spend close to 250 billion in the next decade to promote cutting edge research but lawmakers may be fretting unnecessarily because the chinese government seems to be doing everything possible to lose its tech race with america the latest example of china s penchant for self harm is the sudden and arbitrary regulatory action taken by the cyberspace administration of china cac against didi chuxing a ride hailing company that recently raised 4 4 billion in an ipo on the new york stock exchange on july 2 just two days after didi s successful offering which valued the firm at more than 70 billion the cac a department of the ruling communist party of china cpc masquerading as a state agency announced a data security review of the company two days later the cac abruptly ordered the removal of didi from app stores a move that wiped out nearly a quarter of the firm s market value
gevo stock down 20 in july time to buy gevo stock please note that we are not authorised to provide any investment advice the content on this page is for information purposes only gevo shares are down 20 so far in july following a strong single day uptick that took place on 7 june after the company announced that its stock will be added to the russell 3000 index by the end of the month despite the short term bullish sentiment that this announcement seems to have instilled the stock peaked two days after at 9 64 and has produced a 20 loss for investors since then currently trading at 5 8 per share while getting dangerously close to a long dated support area could this be an opportunity to buy gevo at a relatively low price or is the stock doomed to break this support area in the following sessions the following article takes a closer look at gevo s fundamentals to possibly answer those questions gevo stock technical analysis the latest price action seen by gevo shows that the stock has rebounded off the 5 6 level at least two times in the past with one bear trap taking place after an unsuccessful break of this threshold back in mid may trading volumes during these three instances have been above the 10 day average which emphasizes the importance of this price point for market participants as of this morning this support line appears to be holding the selling pressure but volumes are not yet as strong as they were back on these past occasions if a break takes place chances are that the selling pressure for gevo could accelerate to a point that the stock might be prompted to retest its mid may lows of 4 6 per share on the other hand if a rebound takes place in the following sessions accompanied by elevated trading volumes the odds will be in favor of a bullish short term outlook for the stock with a plausible short term target set at 9 per share based on gevo s upper trend line 67 of all retail investor accounts lose money when trading cfds with this provider gevo stock fundamental analysis gevo sales are expected to drop this year to 1 4 million as a result of the shut down of one of its primary production facilities located in minnesota the company has informed investors that the site might remain idle until at least the second semester of 2021 which has resulted in a sustained drop in the stock price amid uncertainties related to the firm s ability to withstand this operational setback gevo s strategic approach at the moment is to focus on developing liquid hydrocarbons which are considered to be suitable replacements for fossil fuels for planes and vehicles to achieve this the company has pivoted toward developing their so called net zero facilities aiming to build a first production site on lake preston san diego the firm has stated that it already has 100 of the equity investment needed for developing the project while it also told investors that citigroup has agreed to provide the external financing needed for developing the project the engineering phase of the project is expected to be completed by the end of this year while the financing required to fully develop the net zero 1 project is expected to come in during the first half of 2022 based on these developments it could be years before gevo once again generates the kind of revenues seen in the previous years when the company produced around 20 to 30 million in top line results meanwhile the management s ability to complete these ambitious projects is perhaps the most crucial variable that will drive the value of gevo up or down in the following months and it could be expected that the stock will remain fairly volatile for as long as this uncertainty remains by the end of the first quarter of 2021 gevo had 525 million in cash that will probably be used to finance the net zero project and no debt meanwhile the firm tangible book value by the end of this period excluding cash was around 70 million interestingly an announcement from the firm back in august 2020 showed that gevo s intangible assets were valued at approximately 412 million as per an assessment from a firm called peak value ip llc if we take for granted that this valuation of gevo s intangible assets is accurate which is already a gamble the firm would still be valued at 2 4 times its book value for a company that still has a lot to prove buying the stock at its current levels would involve a sizable downside risk and could only be justified if one has an overly optimistic attitude towards the management s ability to deliver on its promises based on the material evidence gevo stock seems heavily overvalued and the outlook is bearish unless there is a sudden change in the firm s current situation buy stocks at cedarfx the world s 1 trading platform
you may not pay 300 000 to go into space but lots of people will virgin galactic spce 5 98 stock has gotten hammered this week as investors are selling following the company s latest successful flight into space even richard branson flying on the latest mission wasn t enough to get investors excited about the shares but there are some positives to take from a bad week for this growth stock while some observers may be underplaying the excitement of a few minutes in weightlessness in space there may be more willing buyers of tickets than currently assumed ubs estimates that virgin galactic will be raising ticket prices from 250 000 apiece to between 300 000 and 400 000 and thousands of buyers could line up here s a look at how big the potential market for these tickets could be a new adventure for the rich the ticket price of 300 000 may seem crazy to you and i but there are lots of people for which that s a drop in the bucket and they re already spending tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars flying around on private jets the u s alone has 614 billionaires according to forbes there are 20 600 people in the u s with a net worth over 100 million ceo world reports there are 13 392 private jets owned by individuals in north america according to statista in california alone there are 212 270 chartered flights per year private jet flights range in cost but a flight on a mid size jet can easily cost over 20 000 and the cost per flying hour for a large jet can be 78 000 according to travel magazine afar in other words a cross country flight can cost about as much as a ticket to space with virgin galactic i point these numbers out because we already know that wealthy people spend a lot of money each year on travel and a 300 000 ticket to spend a few minutes in space isn t going to break the bank especially when it s a comparable number to a private flight across the country to put the cost of a 300 000 ticket into perspective for someone with a 100 million net worth the ticket would cost at most 0 3 of their net worth for comparison someone with a net worth of 83 333 would spend about the same percentage of their wealth spending 250 to go skydiving what s amazing is that virgin galactic s early reservations weren t limited to these ultra high net worth individuals seventy percent of pre orders were from people with a net worth under 20 million so the company s target market could be about 2 million people with a net worth over 10 million a 300 000 ticket for most of us is an insane amount of money but for the wealthy it s a drop in the bucket and for a once in a lifetime experience it could be worth it even for regular rich people cost increases may be short lived in its presentation to investors in 2019 virgin galactic s management implied that it will eventually lower ticket prices dramatically in discussions about the total addressable market it pointed out that about 50 000 people have a net worth over 50 million and could reasonably afford a 500 000 ticket price while 1 78 million people had a net worth of over 10 million and could pay 100 000 for a ticket but management also pointed out that 5 07 million people had a net worth over 5 million and could pay for a 50 000 ticket this wasn t a projection of future ticket prices but as flights increase in volume and the high capital cost of a spaceport and spacecraft can be spread over more flights it s possible ticket costs come down dramatically if ticket prices go up in the short term it could be an indication that there s more than enough demand at a higher price for limited supply but don t be surprised if costs eventually come down and tickets become accessible to millions of people around the world opening up a new thrill ride a few minutes in a weightless environment may seem like an unnecessary and wasteful experience to some but for wealthy thrill seekers it may be worth the price of admission there s no shortage of yachts and private jets around the world and they don t even provide the unique thrill of being in space according to virgin galactic fewer than 600 people have ever been to space so it s an experience a limited number of people have ever had virgin galactic could eventually put more than 600 people in space every year and by the look of it there s a large number of people who may be willing to pay 300 000 for the privilege of taking that exclusive flight
and it s on sale right now every year it seems like the cost of healthcare just goes up even as standards of care get better it often comes with more cost to the patient but every once in a while there s a disruptive technology that turns that equation on its head dermtech dmtk 2 26 is one of those companies it s providing a better solution with lower costs and less physical pain for the patient on a fool live episode recorded on june 24 fool contributor brian feroldi takes viewers through the business of this skin cancer testing specialist and why it could be a massive winner for investors 10 stocks we like better than dermtech inc when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and dermtech inc wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 brian feroldi i m going to talk about like brian one that i ve talked about in the show before but it s down big and that would be dermtech for those aren t familiar with dermtech i will give you a quick overview on it ticker symbol here is dmtk this is a 1 3 billion company and it s visited some interesting prices since it came public in 2019 it did nothing for a year and then it went up sixfold in a matter of just a few months and since then it crashed back down to like 30 and it s currently at about 45 bucks so that s down about 44 from its peak also up significantly from its ipo so could be down big or up big depending on your starting point but what does this company do dermtech is focused on dermatology specifically finding non invasive ways to diagnose skin cancer earlier skin cancer it turns out is a really big problem more people are diagnosed with skin cancer than all other cancers combined one out of every five americans will develop skin cancer in their life by age 70 more than 50 million people are at risk of developing skin cancer and have some sort of skin damage to them that s 50 million americans you zoom out to include the rest of the world and the numbers just grow from there it s a very deadly disease hundreds of thousands of people are diagnosed and die annually from it given the numbers treating skin cancer is hugely expensive billions of dollars a year in direct costs and the numbers are higher when you go to indirect costs why is this such a problem one of the reasons it s such a problem is the current methods that we used to diagnose skin cancer this is the latest and greatest before dermtech came along dermatologists would look at your skin or a physician would look at your skin if they were worried about it they would cut out a piece of it take a biopsy of it and then they will send it off to a histopathology lab that would look at it and determine if you had cancer this is subjective the accuracy rates were low and for the patients that s an invasive proposition i ve had this done to me personally and i now have a scar on my back for the rest of my life because of this for every 25 times that biopsy is done one melanoma is found so the accuracy of these things are not very high but if your doctor says to you i suggest we get this a biopsy what are you going to do they think you might have skin cancer diagnosing skin cancer early is critical if skin cancer is diagnosed when it s at the local stage the five year survival rate is 99 when it s at a distant stage the survival rate falls to 27 so the earlier we can diagnose skin cancer the better dermtech is following a pathway that s been produced by several other companies that have been successful where they re disrupting the standard of care by using genomic testing here is dermtech s flagship product it s a little band aid like clear sticker that you put onto a lesion that you might be worried about you circle around it and then you send that patch off to one of dermtech s labs and within 72 hours the physician gets a report back that is highly accurate and it tells you if you have skin cancer or not it s very simple and importantly it s actually looking at the dna makeup of the skin cells to determine that the advantages are it s super easy to do it s higher accuracy and for the patient there s no cutting so a lot of wins for patients and providers this is a little bit about how the science about how it works there are some potential big time cost savings to this because every time you can find skin cancer earlier not only can you treat it and save lives but there s also big time cost savings down the road this technology seems to really work and it makes financial sense and makes sense for the patient and makes sense for providers now dermtech is very early on in the commercialization process of this they basically hired a sales team last year and they deploy them obviously launching a medical device into covid ain t easy when you physically can t go to visit doctors to get them on board after they ve been pretty innovative with their inside sales team they ve been investing into search and display to build up awareness that way and they currently have about 40 reps throughout the country they are right now targeting dermatologists longer term the company does see potential for them to actually target primary care physicians too because they think the technology is that easy to use testing volume has gone up pretty considerably over the years not bad given again the covid headwind and as they re adding more sales reps and they just got the 40 as of two quarters ago so they are still ramping their productivity and this is some of the things that they re doing online to increase engagement and so far the early signs are pretty successful another angle that this company is pretty serious about is telemedicine this technology is so easy to use you put a sticker on you circle the lesion and you send it off in the mail to the lab that they think that they can use this plus telemedicine if you are a big believer in telemedicine is going to continue to grow this kind of diagnostic technology can be used at home that s a really big long term potential for this company right now this technology is only approved for melanoma they just launched a more advanced product called plaplus which is even higher accuracy so that s in the commercial stage they have few products in development to kind of expand into other types of skin cancer that includes uv damage skin cancer risk assessment and basal and squamous cell cancer so the pipeline here is getting bigger what s the potential pie worth in the u s company pegs it s opportunity at about 10 billion also if it gets all of those approvals the numbers grow from there there is big in international markets too look at the most recent quarterly results i realize this is a busy slide but billable sample volumes were up 62 that s revenue from the stickers that was up 175 just to 2 2 million so it s still a small number but good to see that s growing at pretty high growth rate the average selling price of the product increased 71 year over year to 234 there s likely potential upside for that number too as reimbursement start to kick in and the gross margin on it just turned positive that s pretty good given that there s only 2 2 million in sales on the product the rest of the company s financials are not impressive it s losing money the gross margin it just turned positive so there s nowhere close to being enough to offset the rest of the business however in the long term management thinks that the gross margin on this product could be 70 plus so that would be good to get when they get the scale they did end the quarter with about 258 million in cash that should fund them for several years and they announce some big time progress with payers including several blue cross blue shield plans geisinger health etc this is a ceo his name is john dobak he is not the founder but he s invested successfully in lots of life sciences companies i did an interview with them on fool live it is in the archives if you are interested in seeing that for what it s worth he owns about 2 of shares outstanding so again not the founder but that s not an insignificant stake in the business to give you a sense of what it s expecting the company s going to do about 13 million in sales this year it s going to double to 26 million next year given that the market cap was 1 3 billion that puts the price to sales ratio at about 100x current sales that s pricey keep that in mind overall i think that there s a lot to like about this company technology is very innovative the platform is de risked it s already through the fda approval profit is already being reimbursed the growth potential of this product for the long term is huge the margins should be good the technology just makes sense to me as an outsider and there s lots of room for label expansion claims to say nothing of international expansion what i don t like about this company is that it s losing money and it will continue to do so for a long time dermatologists might be hesitant to recommend this product because they themselves will lose out on revenue from doing the biopsy the ceo told me that was about an 80 fee that they receive for doing that there is a bit of dermatologists being willing to accept lower revenue to go with this procedure but they also could use it a lot more than they could do the biopsy so that might be an offsetting factor there and the high valuation is something to consider if you are looking forward a swing for the fences type of investment could this be a 10 billion company someday in my opinion i think they definitely have that potential so you could talk about 10 plus bagger returns from here if it works out but hang onto your hat if you invest it s going to be a bumpy ride so that s dermtech dmtk
texas instruments and two other tech stocks offer an attractive balance of growth value and income tech stocks that pay dividends are often overlooked by the market after all tech companies usually start paying dividends when they run out of room to expand and tech investors often favor growth over stability income seeking investors might also flock toward higher yields in other sectors such as energy pharmaceutical and real estate yet there are still plenty of dividend paying tech stocks which provide a good balance of growth value and income here are three stocks which check all three boxes texas instruments txn 2 62 cisco systems csco 1 60 and skyworks solutions swks 3 86 1 texas instruments texas instruments ti manufactures analog and embedded chips for a wide range of industries these chips already cost less to manufacture than higher end chips and ti s transition from 200mm to 300mm wafers over the past few years further reduced its production costs by up to 40 its business model enabled ti to grow its free cash flow at an average rate of 12 annually between 2004 and 2020 instead of hoarding that cash ti returned most of it to shareholders via dividends and buybacks it raised its dividend annually for 17 straight years at a compound annual growth rate cagr of 26 and reduced its share count by 46 during the same period it currently pays a forward dividend yield of 2 1 over the past ten years ti s stocks generated a total return of more than 700 which crushed the s p 500 s total return of about 300 we shouldn t evaluate ti based on its past performance alone but its future still seems bright its revenue rose less than 1 last year as the pandemic disrupted its auto and industrial markets but its net income still improved 12 as it expanded its gross margins and reduced its operating costs analysts expect ti s revenue and earnings to grow 21 and 28 respectively as the pandemic passes its stock still looks reasonably valued at 24 times forward earnings 2 cisco systems cisco the world s largest manufacturer of network routers and switches suffered a major slowdown over the past two years the escalating trade war choked off its business in china it sold less hardware to enterprise and data center customers and the pandemic exacerbated that pain in fiscal 2020 which ended last july cisco s revenue fell 5 as its adjusted earnings per share eps boosted by buybacks rose 4 in the first nine months of fiscal 2021 its revenue and adjusted eps both dipped 1 year over year analysts expect its revenue to grow less than 1 this year and its earnings to stay nearly flat those growth rates seem anemic but cisco is a cyclical stock and it s primed to grow again in fiscal 2022 as the pandemic recedes and its customers resume their network upgrades its higher growth security business should also continue to expand amid escalating cyber attacks worldwide that s why analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to improved 5 and 6 respectively next year as that turnaround happens cisco will continue to reward its investors with consistent dividends and buybacks it raised its dividend annually for nearly a decade it currently pays a forward yield of 2 7 and it spent just 44 of its free cash flow on its dividends over the past 12 months it also reduced its outstanding shares by 22 over the past ten years cisco generated a total return of more than 370 during that decade but it still looks cheap at 16 times forward earnings 3 skyworks solutions skyworks is often recognized as an apple aapl 1 11 supplier since it generated over half of its revenues from the iphone maker last year but skyworks also manufactures wireless and radio frequency chips for a wide range of other industries and every generational leap in cellular technology like the jump from 4g to 5g requires more of its chips skyworks ability to sell more chips in new phones connected vehicles smart home devices and other internet of things iot gadgets make it a compelling long term investment in an increasingly connected world that s why it generated a whopping total return of nearly 850 over the past decade looking ahead skyworks is diversifying away from apple by developing new chips and making big acquisitions including its planned purchase of silicon laboratories slab 4 35 infrastructure and automotive unit skyworks revenue and earnings both dipped 1 in 2020 as the pandemic disrupted the smartphone and auto markets it was also forced to abandon huawei one of its top customers amid tighter trade restrictions but this year analysts expect its revenue and earnings to jump 49 and 68 respectively as the pandemic passes sales of 5g phones surge the auto market recovers and silicon laboratories former unit is integrated into the company that growth should cool off next year but the stock still trades at just 18 times forward earnings and it pays a forward yield of 1 1 it raised that payout for seven straight years and it spent just 28 of its free cash flow on those payments over the past 12 months which gives it plenty of room for future hikes
this logistics specialist allows investors to ride the e commerce wave without having to pick winners among retailers xpo logistics xpo 1 28 has set the date for its long awaited split announcing gxo logistics will begin trading on august 2 the split is a huge moment in the history of one of the transportation sector s top performing stocks this century and it should create some intriguing opportunities although investors don t often focus on logistics when it comes to e commerce i believe gxo is one of the best ways to invest in the expected growth of online and omnichannel shopping here s why investors should be paying close attention as gxo splits off from xpo meet gxo logistics gxo is a provider of contract logistics running warehouses and managing deliveries and returns for retailers e commerce merchants and other large companies gxo has set itself up as the answer to one of the biggest challenges retailers face when competing with amazon com few companies have the scale to match amazon s shipping and warehousing heft on their own but combined under the management of gxo merchants can get the sort of economies of scale that amazon uses to its advantage gxo in short is the behind the scenes machinery that makes e commerce work the stock allows investors to benefit from the expected continued growth in e commerce without having to pick winners and losers among individual retail stocks the company has other huge tailwinds at its back gxo should benefit from a pre pandemic trend toward large companies outsourcing their logistics operation that has only gained urgency due to covid and from the efficiencies that come through warehouse automation xpo had been spending 500 million annually on tech prior to the split and much of that has gone into automation gxo operates from 885 locations primarily in north america and europe and counts blue chip companies including apple nike walt disney nestle pepsico and whirlpool among its customers its twenty largest customers have been doing business with the new gxo for an average of 15 years and no one customer accounts for more than 4 of total revenue company officials expect to generate 17 adjusted ebitda growth and 10 revenue growth through 2022 today about 40 of its revenue comes from pure play e commerce and omnichannel retailers and the company said it has a 2 billion pipeline of new potential business on the horizon gxo is one of the largest pure play contract logistics companies operating worldwide but it still has a lot of growth potential the company generated 6 6 billion in revenue in the last twelve months a small piece of a 130 billion addressable market of outsourced logistics add in house logistics some of which is likely to be outsourced in the years to come and the entire north american and european potential market is more than 430 billion the trucking business is ready to hit the fast lane terms of the split call for xpo holders as of july 23 to receive one share of gxo stock for every share they own the remaining xpo while not as sexy as the e commerce focused business also has the potential to outperform the new xpo will be comprised of the current company s transportation segment which generated more than 10 billion in revenue over the past twelve months it ranks as the third largest provider of less than truckload ltl services in north america the complicated business of operating trucks for multiple customers instead of filling a truck with goods from one customer it is also the largest truck brokerage in north america and a top provider of last mile logistics and has a large european operation as well part of the rationale behind the split was to reshuffle debt and leave this trucking business with an investment grade rating and a lot of flexibility xpo was built on acquisitions growing revenue by 17 000 during a 10 year period ending in 2015 and propelling the stock into one of the market s best performers over the last fifteen years post split the remaining xpo will have the flexibility and the balance sheet to once again look at both organic and inorganic expansion opportunities two stocks with great potential i ve long been a fan of xpo impressed by the work of rollup specialist brad jacobs as he first assembled and then managed this transportation behemoth but the market hasn t been nearly as enthused of late with xpo shares trailing the s p 500 by more than 10 percentage points over the last three years the split is designed to rekindle wall street s interest in xpo and remove the so called conglomerate discount by giving investors two more focused pure play companies to consider xpo today trades at an enterprise value about 11 times expected ebitda the hope is that post split the trucking business can command a valuation similar to rival old dominion freight line s 19 times forward ebitda multiple and gxo will trade at a multiple closer to the 17x that european pure play contract logistics businesses have sold for or at least c h robinson worldwide s 13x valuation jacobs is hanging around intending to remain as ceo of xpo while taking the added title of chairman of gxo s board this is still a founder owned business with jacobs owning about 13 of xpo shares xpo s stock hasn t performed of late but this is still an impressive collection of assets with clear growth trajectories it is unlikely either of these stocks have a run that matches xpo s growth over the last decade but both of these businesses are set up well to be outperformers for years to come current xpo shareholders should continue on for a ride and as of august new investors will have both an e commerce specialist and a trucker to consider
these companies are making big moves in their respective markets and investors should take notice ever since the beginning of 2021 it seems like investors haven t been exactly sure what to do with tech stocks many of the big winners in 2020 have given up portions of their gains as investors have looked to other areas of the economy for growth but dismissing technology stocks altogether right now could be a huge mistake there are plenty of companies that are tapping into massive markets and building out their leads in niche spaces we asked three motley fool contributors for stocks they think could see explosive growth over the next few years and they came back with square sq 1 84 nvidia nvda 1 97 and the trade desk ttd 0 46 here s why two thriving ecosystems are driving this explosion brian withers square square has come a long way since it started by helping sellers collect in person credit card payments with its plug in device for mobile phones today the company has two thriving ecosystems that drive its growth the seller segment has become a rich suite of 30 connected applications and services but its budding cash app business is no slouch either the cash app enables person to person payments banking like services and the ability to buy or sell stocks and bitcoin crypto btc both of these ecosystems are flourishing today below is a table of recent results showing its tremendous year over year growth the cash app business surpassed the seller segment in overall gross profit dollars for the first time in its history it s not surprising given that this segment has reported triple digit percentage growth for the last five quarters the seller segment saw some headwinds during the pandemic as brick and mortar sellers saw decreased traffic and had to quickly create omnichannel operations but as the economy opens back up these sellers should see increased traffic and hopefully increased sales metric q1 fy2020 q4 fy2020 q1 fy2021 change qoq change yoy seller gross profit 356 million 427 million 468 million 10 32 cash app gross profit 183 million 377 million 495 million 31 171 overall gross profit 539 million 804 million 964 million 20 79 the company has continually improved its platform for sellers recently it launched square messages a service that makes it easy for sellers to communicate with their customers additionally it s been instrumental in facilitating the paycheck protection program for over 500 million in loans to 57 000 small businesses some small businesses may not survive the pandemic but square is seeing its mid market sellers thrive those with more than 500 000 in annual sales grew at a 43 year over year rate in the most recent quarter twice as fast as smaller sellers square is set up to be there for its sellers as they start to see the benefits as more consumers get out of the house for investors this stock has been explosive almost doubling in the past year but its run is far from over get on board this winning growth company with a few shares today and your future self will thank you so many ways to win danny vena nvidia there s no question nvidia has been one of strongest performers of the past decade the stock has gained more than 5 300 over the past 10 years and those returns aren t confined to some distant and dusty past nvidia has gained more than 85 over the past 12 months alone given those explosive returns it might be easy to assume that the best gains are already behind it but the best may still be yet to come for nvidia the company is best known for its industry leading gaming chips its graphics processing units gpus are the top choice of hardcore gamers everywhere with an 81 share of the discrete desktop market this led to an all time revenue record in the first quarter of 2 76 billion for the gaming segment up 106 year over year that alone is reason enough to buy the stock but that s just the beginning of nvidia s opportunity the proliferation and accelerating adoption of cloud computing represents another growth area for the company nvidia is the leading provider of gpus for artificial intelligence ai and data centers and its processors are the industry standard for each of the largest cloud providers including amazon web services alphabet s google cloud and microsoft s azure just to name a few its industry leading position has led to dramatic results in its data center segment which also delivered record growth in the first quarter revenue of 2 05 billion surged 79 compared to the prior year quarter given the ongoing secular trends of gaming cloud computing and ai nvidia has a number of ways to win the company also has its pulse on a number of other trends any one of which could be a future growth driver nvidia has a rising opportunity in the area of professional visualization delivering new capabilities to engineers graphic artists and designers nvidia has also developed a state of the art self driving system and has partnered with some of the leading automakers to embrace the potential of autonomous driving there are additional growth opportunities in robotics genomics and computational biology all of which harness the power of nvidia s gpus given the company s history of explosive growth and the potential for even further gains nvidia provides investors with a compelling opportunity that reaches far into the future advertising is alive and well chris neiger the trade desk the trade desk s platform allows companies to easily buy ads to put on the internet mobile devices and even connected tvs as you might imagine all of these ad markets are growing very quickly and they re part of a larger digital ad market that will be worth 278 billion by 2024 one of the company s biggest opportunities over the next few years could be advertisements on connected tvs research company emarketer estimates 60 of u s advertisers plan to shift ad dollars away from traditional linear tv to connected tvs and over the top streaming services this year some investors have been concerned by the state of the online advertising business as google is making plans to move away from using online trackers called cookies for online ads but the trade desk has been planning for this shift and has built an anonymized identifier called unified id 2 0 that gives consumers more control over how their data is shared while still allowing companies to display ads based on user preferences a growing list of companies including snowflake nielsen oracle and washington post are beginning to accept unified id 2 0 making the trade desks innovation a likely success the trade desk has already been a massive success for investors with its share price exploding 670 over the past three years and the company s strong position in the digital ad space along with the growing acceptance of its cookie alternative should help propel this company further in the coming years

different reasons and in the context of a different market environment for example let s compare the last two major stock market crashes the pandemic driven crash of 2020 and the crash stemming from the 2008 financial crisis the factors shaping market behavior were widely different in these two instances the stock market languished for years following the financial crisis and it wasn t until 2013 that the s p 500 index climbed above its early 2008 level if you assumed that a similar progression would play out after last year s crash you would have missed out on the market s rapid recovery the s p 500 is now up roughly 35 since the start of 2020 growth dependent tech stocks often get hit hard when the market turns bearish and investors usually flock to safer looking alternatives that pay dividends and trade at low earnings and sales multiples however pandemic conditions actually created powerful tailwinds for many tech focused companies these seemingly risky stocks not only went on to recover faster than even high quality value names but many enjoyed a period of record growth and went on to set new valuation highs the past can teach us a lot about factors that influence the market and how things might play out but don t expect that following yesterday s playbook will necessarily put you on track to strong performance tomorrow sector wide crashes happen all the time daniel foelber the definition of a market correction is simple enough technically speaking it s when the stock market falls by 10 or more from its peak with a bear market being an extended period of a greater than 20 decline from the peak similarly a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative gdp growth stock market crashes and recessions affect different sectors in different ways after the march 2020 stock market crash the s p 500 proceeded to rebound and finish the year up 16 with tech consumer discretionary and renewables stocks doing even better however the energy sector suffered a brutal 37 decline in 2020 meaning it stayed in bear market territory while most of the market was roaring back to life this year the script has flipped oil and gas stocks are crushing the broader markets but renewable energy stocks are selling off the average stock in the invesco solar etf tan 3 40 is down 20 year to date and just last week many small cap tech stocks suffered 10 or even 20 or higher declines the same dichotomies persist during recessions over 22 million americans lost their jobs in the first four months of 2020 in april 2020 which was the month many consider to be the peak of the covid 19 pandemic the unemployment rate reached 14 8 and while the mass exodus out of the office affected much of the country folks who were already working remotely saw little change investors can glean lessons from the volatility of different market sectors as well as the anatomy of the covid 19 recession for small cap tech investors last week s sell off can feel like the market is crashing before their eyes by contrast many oil and gas investors are just recently feeling like they are out of a bear market crashes are relative and can happen without warning therefore it s best to keep a diversified portfolio that can handle changes in sentiment as sectors ping pong between in favor and out of favor commit now to being a smart buyer then james brumley it s easy to forget it while stocks are plummeting but any pullback is a buying opportunity the bigger the better the market s never not recovered from a correction or bear market of course you still have to stick with names that are actually poised to recover and steer clear of the stocks that were lucky enough to temporarily catch a tailwind a ticker like amc entertainment holdings amc 4 71 comes to mind its short squeeze was ultimately born out of shutdowns prompted by advent of covid 19 or more specifically the recovery of the movie business following the easing of the pandemic it made for great bullish rhetoric the thing is the company s now overvalued by any measure you can think of using any of the company s pre coronavirus results a marketwide stumble could set it on a crash course look for a quality name like nvidia nvda 1 97 instead i love the fact that its data center business is now eclipsing its gaming and crypto mining revenue as the former is a much more sustainable sort of business i m too cheap to step in at 44 times next year s projected earnings a move back to the 500 where it leveled off for several months late last year and early this year however is not only plausible but would leave nvidia shares at a very attractive projected p e around 30 just for the record though i d settle for a pullback of half that size your job is simply building a cash stash making a watch list and establishing an entry plan now waiting for a pullback to start before doing these things means you re making decisions under pressure which is anything but ideal
this stock has been on a tear over the past 12 months ever since the vaccines were approved back in november of last year tons of stocks considered reopening plays have soared in value one of these companies is revolve group rvlv 8 53 an online fashion retailer that focuses on selling dresses and other apparel for social events the stock is up a whopping 320 in the last 12 months and 114 year to date significantly outpacing the broad market indexes with shares near all time highs should investors be cashing out what is revolve group revolve group is an online retailer focused on serving millennial and gen z women it calls itself a premium lifestyle brand which means it sells expensive apparel dresses footwear and beauty products with a focus on items meant for social occasions the strategy it has used to consistently grow sales outside of 2020 is to partner with thousands of global fashion influencers to market its products in the past revolve group has spent millions of dollars at major events like coachella the annual music festival in california it also has close to five million followers on instagram which it also leverages as part of its marketing operation revolve mostly employs a direct to consumer dtc strategy selling the majority of its products on its two websites revolve com and fwrd com recent results as you might expect a company that sells clothing for social occasions struggled in 2020 revenue was down 3 last year to 581 million however net income actually grew 59 to 57 million for the full year with all the cost savings management implemented revolve was able to pivot to virtual marketing events which helped reduce expenses and started selling more casual outfits during the covid 19 lockdowns in the first quarter revenue grew 22 to 179 million in conjunction with broad vaccination efforts across the united states revolve s biggest market what s more gross margin expanded to 54 0 year over year from 48 6 and free cash flow hit a record 32 million for the period management didn t provide guidance for the full year but if this 22 growth continues 2021 sales will hit 709 million valuation is creeping up with the stock up over 300 in the past 12 months revolve s valuation has gotten much more expensive it currently has a market cap of 4 8 billion giving it a price to sales ratio p s of 7 8 based on its trailing 12 month revenue and a trailing price to free cash flow p fcf multiple of 49 both of these metrics are high considering revolve group s margin structure and the industry it operates in however revenue and free cash flow have been depressed for most of the last year so those numbers could come down quickly in 2021 and beyond if the company can keep up its first quarter momentum time to sell shareholders of revolve group have a tough dilemma with the stock up so much and to be honest i don t think anyone can give a good answer on whether this is a buy or sell at these prices typically if the only reason you have to sell a stock is that the valuation is higher than you d like the best thing to do is to just hold onto your shares this could be especially true in this case since revolve group looks primed for strong growth over the next few quarters with the return of social events selling after a 300 gain might feel like the right thing to do but if the business continues to expand the best move is to sit patiently and hold
it s the most likely winner benefiting from the most likely reason that an imminent crash might occur you might not have heard of harry dent jr he s an american author economist and investment firm founder who correctly predicted the japanese economic downturn in 1989 he also forecast the dot com bubble s collapse dent now believes that the stock market will crash within the next three months with a good chance that it could happen before the end of july and he doesn t think it will be a minor downturn he recently stated in an interview with financial publication thinkadvisor that this will be the biggest crash of our lifetime there s no way to know if dent s pessimistic outlook is warranted at this point however even if he s right i don t think that every stock will plunge there s at least one stock that should soar if the stock market crashes this summer most likely culprit behind a crash dent thinks that the housing price bubble will pop and serve as the initial cause of a near term stock market crash i don t find that argument all that convincing interest rates remain near historic lows the inventory of homes for sale is still well below the demand mortgage capital provider freddie mac expects the housing market to remain strong throughout this year if a market crash is on the way within the next few months as dent predicts my take is that there s a much more likely culprit the rise of coronavirus variants this shouldn t be surprising considering that the coronavirus caused the most recent stock market crash a little over a year ago we re already seeing covid 19 cases rise throughout the world in large part because of the spread of the delta variant first identified in india just last week several countries in europe issued new travel restrictions as a result of concerns about this coronavirus variant one of the key drivers for the tremendous recovery for stocks after the sell off in early 2020 was the expectation that the economic effect of the pandemic would be short lived many investors have been banking on a widespread economic reopening there s a possibility that new variants could dash those hopes and set the stage for another market meltdown the biggest beneficiary my view is that vaccine stocks would likely take off if coronavirus variants cause a market crash within the next few months after all vaccines would be the best chance of beating the variants i also believe that biontech bntx 1 55 would be the biggest winner in the group why biontech for one thing it s by far the smallest of the companies that currently have vaccines on the market catalysts usually generate bigger swings in stocks with smaller market caps than they do with those with larger market caps i think that it s important that biontech and its partner pfizer pfe 1 72 are already working on strategies to address the rise of the delta variant the two companies believe that a third dose of their covid 19 vaccine could provide more protection against this coronavirus strain they also plan to begin clinical testing in august of a modified version of the vaccine that specifically targets the delta variant there s also the matter of valuation biontech is the cheapest of the leading vaccine stocks right now based on forward earnings multiples the biotech s shares trade at only 6 3 times expected earnings i wouldn t expect that low valuation to last very long if fears about coronavirus variants increase so much that there s a huge market downturn a dent in the doomsaying now for a critical disclaimer i don t think dent s prediction of an imminent stock market crash will come true it s not that there s no chance that he could be right my view is just that it s unlikely that he will be i ve already discussed why i don t agree with his take that the housing market bubble will precipitate a crash is on point and while i do believe that the rise of coronavirus variants would be the most likely cause of a near term market plunge i nonetheless don t expect it to happen it s important to understand that the currently available covid 19 vaccines are still highly effective at preventing severe disease even against the delta variant the main problem as i see it with the rise in covid 19 cases is that too few people have been fully vaccinated however enough individuals have been fully vaccinated that i don t expect a return of the lockdowns we saw last year also with all due respect to harry dent he s been wrong quite a bit in the past as a case in point he published a book titled the great depression ahead in early 2009 in this book he predicted a major economic depression that could last for a decade or more history didn t treat that prediction kindly
does recreational use marijuana legalization at the federal level even matter when so many states are jumping on board the train it s been said a hundred times the legal cannabis industry in the u s is here to stay among all the mom and pop shops and the multi state operators msos there are three companies that have been busy establishing large footprints across the country in anticipation of massive gains one day cresco labs crlbf 5 24 curaleaf holdings curlf 2 79 and green thumb industries gtbif 3 22 all hold licenses in multiple states as vertically integrated operators covering all aspects of the business from cultivation operations to the retail chains that sell their cannabis products all three also generated record revenues during 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 and are largely focused on limited license states such as virginia florida and pennsylvania which reduces the competitive threats to their business in their key markets and all are worth investors serious consideration ramping up operations when it comes to the size of a company bigger doesn t always mean better for investors cresco is the smallest of the three it has operations in 10 states in seven of which it has retail dispensaries and employs 2 300 people its heaviest retail presence is in illinois 10 dispensaries where it s headquartered it recently opened its fourth location in pennsylvania a medical only retail store and beyond its 33 company owned dispensaries cresco has wholesale distribution agreements that get its 350 products into more than 700 other storefronts nationwide massachusetts based curaleaf is on the opposite end of the size spectrum it has 4 600 employees and operations in 23 states with retail dispensaries in 17 in its no 1 retail market florida its 37 retail locations exceed cresco s u s total the company s 107 total dispensaries are spread coast to coast across the u s green thumb falls in the middle size wise headquartered in illinois like cresco the company has multiple dispensaries in its home state as well as in curaleaf s home state of massachusetts it has operations across 13 markets in all with 32 dispensaries and licenses for 110 retail locations and currently employs 2 700 the largest piece of green thumb s retail store footprint is its rise chain which has locations primarily in pennsylvania and illinois green thumb also recently acquired dharma pharmaceuticals in virginia which brought with it a vertically integrated license a production facility and an operating dispensary it also holds the rights to open five additional dispensaries in virginia which has become a very competitive market medical cannabis veteran columbia care also made an acquisition there this year that gave it one of only five licenses for vertically integrated operations in the state growing revenue whether the legal cannabis market s growth was accelerated by the impact of the covid 19 pandemic wider availability of cannabis products or a combination of the two sales in the u s shot skyward in 2020 and continue to do so curaleaf brought in annual revenues of 626 million up 184 compared with 2019 this was fueled by 75 growth in its number of retail cultivation and processing sites as well as 75 growth in the number of states in which it operates it followed that up with revenue of 260 million in 2021 s first quarter boosting its gross profit margin by 6 year over year green thumb s revenue grew by 157 to 556 million in 2020 and the company followed that up with q1 2021 revenue of 194 million up 89 5 year over year that result also gave it its third consecutive quarter of positive net income 0 05 per share cresco had the biggest percentage jump for 2020 up 271 to 476 million and set another quarterly record of 178 million in q1 2021 an increase of 168 year over year according to management s guidance outlook the company will hit total revenue of 1 billion in 2021 notably all three of these companies are equipped with the cash necessary to continue their torrid growth well beyond 2021 as consolidation continues to shape this evolving market an analyst opinion in early july jefferies analyst owen bennett initiated coverage on these three stocks giving each of them buy ratings and optimistic price targets based on those targets cresco offers the most potential for investors it s currently trading at about 11 so if it reaches bennett s target price of over 28 it would result in a 155 gain curaleaf s stock price hovering around 14 offers an 84 upside based on bennett s price target of 25 50 and green thumb currently offers a 71 potential gain based on its current price of 32 and a target of 55 the takeaway if you re looking specifically for a company that has shown it can post net profits green thumb might be your best option from among these three but there are compelling arguments to add all of them to your portfolio as the industry expands and the pressure grows for marijuana legalization at the federal level in the u s keep in mind that those recent revenue growth rates were achieved even in an environment where cannabis has not been federally legalized imagine what these businesses might do with that headwind removed
