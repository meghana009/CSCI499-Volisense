paola subacchi as the international monetary fund and the world bank prepare for their annual meeting next week all eyes are on evergrande china s second largest property developer which apparently cannot repay about 300 billion it currently owes to banks bondholders employees and suppliers with the property giant teetering on the edge of bankruptcy the world is being forced to contemplate a scenario it had never seriously considered a made in china financial crisis observers have been quick to draw parallels between the evergrande debacle and past crises some compare it to the 2008 crash of the us investment bank lehman brothers which triggered a massive banking and financial crisis others recall the near collapse of the hedge fund long term capital management in 1998 which was staved off only by a bailout from the us federal reserve to protect financial markets still others invoke the collapse of japan s real estate bubble in the 1990s in all of these cases the combination of excessive leverage and overvalued assets triggered instability but none really offers much insight into the situation at evergrande owing to the peculiarities of china s banking and financial system which is driven by policy not markets whereas a country like the united states may provide a bailout when financial collapse seems imminent china intervenes in capital markets regularly and tolerates few risks to financial stability china s monetary authorities are thus well versed in managing the financial troubles of domestic firms shielding the distressed ones from contagion ensuring low borrowing costs and providing selective bailouts in engineering such rescues the chinese authorities are unlikely to agonize over the question of whether a firm really is too big to fail china would much rather risk moral hazard than jeopardize financial stability given this it is probably safe to assume that china will intervene to manage evergrande s collapse but the episode will nonetheless leave two major scars on china s economy first as foreign investors will not be sheltered confidence will take a bit hit especially in china s offshore credit market which is particularly exposed to evergrande risks yields on china s junk dollar bonds have jumped to approximately 15 percent their highest level in about a decade since its establishment in 2010 the offshore market has been central to china s strategy for making the renminbi a liquid and freely usable international currency because it enables the circumvention of domestic capital controls but foreign investors have been extremely cautious about trading renminbi denominated assets in this market the evergrande saga will reinforce their misgivings at least for now forcing china to rethink its renminbi strategy the second scar will be on china s real economy the real estate sector accounts for nearly 30 percent of china s gdp compared with 19 percent in the us and real estate value added contributes about 6 5 percent to china s gdp if indirect contributions such as fixed asset investment are considered the sector s contribution to chinese growth is even larger the evergrande implosion could therefore have serious consequences for jobs and growth if it triggers a drop in stock and real estate prices housing comprises 78 percent of chinese assets compared to 35 percent for the us consumer confidence and thus consumption may also take a hit the question is whether china will be able to contain the evergrande crisis and prevent its consequences from spilling over to global financial markets so far the expectation seems to be that china will succeed in ring fencing the problem even if evergrande collapses the logic goes china s banking and financial system is robust and resilient enough to withstand it furthermore the policy response to any instability would most likely be effective matching in speed and scale the fed s move in 2008 to backstop the us banking system several policy tools including monetary and fiscal easing are available but there is no guarantee that the policy response will not lag behind events with political considerations potentially impeding action in that case the rest of the world would feel the effects since the 2008 global financial crisis china s financial system has expanded to become one of the world s largest with financial assets amounting to nearly 470 percent of gdp and it has become more integrated with the rest of the world through investment flows and direct lending but while the chinese financial system is now systemically important it is not clear that the international financial safety net provided by multilateral financial institutions notably the imf has expanded adequately to accommodate this that safety net is currently estimated to amount to about 2 7 trillion based on immediately available financial resources not including pre committed resources this is less than china s foreign exchange reserves currently around 3 2 trillion would this be enough to stave off disaster in the event of a made in china systemic crisis would the us the imf s main shareholder even agree to the fund extending adequate assistance and resources to backstop such a crisis fortunately this scenario still seems unlikely but it should not be dismissed out of hand after all how many low probability events have come to pass over the last two decades at the very least the evergrande crisis should shake us from our complacency regarding global financial risks we need to be building resilience not politicizing the multilateral financial architecture and if a systemic financial crisis does hit china we need to know who will step in to rescue the rest of the world and how paola subacchi professor of international economics at the university of

investors were mulling the effect of a new sticker that will appear on the company s products what happened charlotte s web cwbhf 0 35 is going organic and investors were on the fence about it after the cannabidiol cbd products specialist announced that it had achieved organic certification for one of its facilities its shares went on a bit of a roller coaster ride across the day finally closing 1 lower in price so what the u s department of agriculture issues the certification charlotte s web earned this for its corporate farm and a research development and manufacturing facility it operates in colorado with the certification the company will be able to place the usda organic seal on several of its product lines the certification means that charlotte s web has satisfied a set of usda standards for the production of its goods basically in the department s words this means they must be produced using agricultural production practices that foster resource cycling promote ecological balance maintain and improve soil and water quality minimize the use of synthetic materials and conserve biodiversity charlotte s web said that the products that will carry the usda organic label conform to both the government agency s standards and its own it added that these goods are made without utilizing genetically modified organisms synthetic pesticides and herbicides now what most companies in the cannabis or cannabis adjacent industry struggle with growth and profitability so even the lightest touch of good news can send one of their stocks northward that seems to be the dynamic behind the brief bull rush into charlotte s web shares on tuesday but perhaps at the end of the day investors realized that this doesn t change the company s world too much cbd adherents are going to gravitate toward their favorite products whether they re organic or not and those goods aren t going to suddenly find a new audience simply because of that usda sticker
even with a recent rebound the brazilian fintech stock is down 35 year to date what happened shares of pagseguro digital pags 0 23 jumped on tuesday following the release of preliminary third quarter results the brazilian fintech stock closed the daily session up roughly 14 2 pagseguro expects that it will have notched total payment volume of 125 billion brazilian reals approximately 22 59 billion in the third quarter representing growth of roughly 85 year over year the company also estimates that it had 12 2 million active users at the end of q3 up 1 million users sequentially so what pagseguro stock has been under pressure due to macroeconomic challenges in brazil and a series of regulatory changes that could narrow some of the company s growth opportunities prior to tuesday s jump the company s share price was down roughly 17 across october s trading brazil s central bank announced on oct 8 that it was considering new regulations that would cap prepaid card transaction fees at 0 5 according to citigroup analyst gabriel gusan the potential change could result in pagseguro s annual revenue being lowered by roughly 4 in addition to the stronger than expected active user growth outlined in the preliminary q3 report pagseguro stock may have also gotten a boost from some favorable analyst coverage goldman sachs analyst tito labarta published a note on pagseguro today that maintained a buy rating on the stock and a one year price target of 64 per share based on a conversation with pagseguro management labarta estimates that the proposed prepaid card transaction cap would result in the company s revenue being lowered by 3 and its pre tax earnings being lowered by approximately 13 while certainly less than ideal these potential negative impacts were not as bad as initially feared now what pagseguro will publish its official third quarter results after the market closes on nov 11 coming on the heels of its recent preliminary reporting there probably won t be any big surprises about performance in the period there s a promising long term growth outlook for fintech services in brazil and other latin american markets and pagseguro is a leader in its corner of the market the stock could have big upside at current prices but investors should proceed with the understanding that regulatory and macroeconomic developments could create more pricing volatility in the near term

there are no words in any language that can describe what the nazis did to 6million jews and what revenge and on whatever scale is appropriate the sweet revenge of felix zandman i originally penned a version of this story in 2011 it is about felix zandman who had victorious sweet revenge over the nazis who wanted him dead at the age of 14 year old just because he was a jew this is the story of felix zandman an out of the box thinker felix s idea of the resistor the electronic component that regulates current and voltage which he scribbled on a napkin during lunch break and his other scientific breakthroughs and inventions is one of the most shining testaments to human spirit and the jewish fortitude as it happened on october 10 2021 i came across the 2005 one hour long documentary the final victory the story of felix zandman by haim hecht vishay company felix sandman an engineer who founded the vishay company that manufactures electronic components is world war ii miraculous surviving case i therefore decided to revive my 10 year old story this article is based on the life story of felix zandman ph d the founder and chief technology officer of vishay intertechnology one of the world s largest providers of electronic components felix zandman survived the atrocities of the holocaust hidden for 17 months with his uncle and three other jews in a pit under the bed of his family s polish housekeeper after the war he became a brilliant scientist an inventor and a successful entrepreneur his contribution to the betterment of the world is based on his grandmother s teaching giving is mandatory it remains with you during your life and after i always think how many other jewish geniuses were shot dead or sent to the nazi gas chambers can one imagine how many bright youngsters just like felix were among the 2million jewish kids the nazis murdered felix zandman story felix zandman was born in 1928 in grodno belarus then eastern poland during wwii in october 1941 at the age of 14 he arrived at the grodno ghetto with his parents sisters grandparents and many other relatives all were forced to move to live in grodno ghetto which was liquidated at the end of 1942 and most of the jews who were ingathered there were sent to their death in the nazi concentration death camps felix survived the holocaust thanks to jan and anna puchalski a righteous of nations polish family who hid him in a 170 cm long 150 cm wide and only 120 cm high a grave size hole dugout felix shared this hideaway with three other jewish refugees one of them was his uncle sender freydowicz who taught him trigonometry advanced mathematics and physics in the long months of darkness they had spent hiding in their hideaway hole the advancing soviet army liberated them in july 1944 for a short period of time felix remained in poland only to realize that poland had become nothing but a large jewish graveyard in the summer of 1946 felix was able to legally immigrate to france his uncle s teaching did not go to waste from 1946 to 1949 felix studied physics and engineering at the university of nancy france in parallel he was enrolled in a grande cole of engineering ensem ecole nationale supérieure d electricité et de mécanque he continued his studies to receive his ph d for physics on the subject of photoelasticity at the sorbonne university in 1962 felix zandman was awarded the edward longstreth medal eventually felix zandman immigrated to the united states in 1956 for the first time in the u s felix presented his self developed instruments methods he was able to establish important contacts with leading professors and well known users of this specific field eventually he gained employment with tatnall measuring systems company based in philadelphia as the director of basic research felix developed a temperature resistant electrical resistor his employer however had no interest in marketing felix s invention in fact no one showed interest felix zandman was left with one option to market his invention all by himself with his 4 000 savings and some financial help from his cousin alfred p slaner felix put the potential of his invention to work in 1962 he founded vishay intertechnology inc the company has developed into a fortune 1000 company with many subsidiaries employing over 22 000 employees worldwide to include a large plant in the town of dimona israel vishay intertechnology nyse vsh is a publicly traded company with a market capitalization of over 2 5 billion dollars felix zandman could account for an impressive financial victory walther rathenau and aeg telefunken story curve prior to nazi germany aeg telefunken german company was owned by walther rathenau a german jew an industrialist politician writer and statesman who served as the foreign minister of germany during the weimar republic on june 24 1922 two months after the signing the 1922 treaty of rapallo between the german republic and soviet russia rathenau was assassinated in a plot led by erwin kern and hermann fischer two ultra nationalist german army officers on that morning rathenau was driving from his house to wilhelmstrabe as he did daily and predictably during the trip his car was passed by another in which four armed men were sitting they simultaneously shot at the minister with machine guns and threw a hand grenade into his car before quickly driving away when hitler came to power he decreed to seize all jewish businesses in germany and walther rathenau s family was forced to walk away from aeg telefunken during the war telefunken served as the wehrmacht s communication corps after the war telefunken the enterprise founded and owned by the jew rathenau which the nazis seized and made their trademark brand became the splendor pride of the german electronic industry in the autumn of 1985 daimler benz corporation took over telefunken ten years later because of financial and management difficulties the daimler benz consortium s management announced to the german government that telefunken is up for sale and there is a danger that thousands of its employees will find themselves jobless when felix zandman the holocaust surviving jew the owner of vishay industries heard that telefunken is up for sale a component in his heart reacted no doubt telefunken were nazis they worked for hitler and it was a company that was involved with the wehrmacht s activities felix knew that if he bought this company he could declare moral victory a jew whom the nazis wanted to kill acquires a german pride company felix negotiated the purchase of telefunken during which the german government and the daimler benz corporation did all they could so that the american industrialist would save their telefunken when felix left his hotel to go sign the sale and purchase agreement of telefunken with daimler benz management he took along with him hidden in his pocket a yarmulke the traditional jewish skullcap what he had in mind was that at the appropriate moment he will bless the transaction in hebrew and so he did he signed the agreement and then he took the skullcap out of his pocket and put it on his head and then said the common hebrew blessing for thanks blessed are you the lord our god who has kept us alive and got us to this time and a sweet taste of victory overwhelmed felix zandman a sense of victory without revenge that a jew could turn history around in such a short time to do what he has just done own a business in germany that seized and removed all jewish business ownership at the beginning of nazi germany officially known as the german reich from 1933 until 1943 in place of former nazi telefunken the vishay industries owned by a jew is located in itzehoe north germany and at the entrance to the vishay building waves with pride the blue and white with the star of david in its center the flag of the jewish state israel as he walks the corridors of his vishay industries in germany his heart is jumping for joy of pride and tears wet his eyes six million holocaust victims are cheerfully smiling from above at felix zandman once again a jew has a factory on german soil and germans are working for a jew israel aspect there is no question that the inventions of resistance of photo stress are most important they help the industry more important though they help the security of israel as felix said for me my feelings that is the most important thing that could have been done in my life felix zandman s contribution to the development of the israeli tank merkava made this tank rank the best in the world felix zandman always felt guilty for managing to flee the nazis and survive but maybe god had a plan for him he wanted him to stay alive to help humanity and especially israel after all the most important product of israel and the jewish people is the product of miracles felix zandman was born on may 7 1928 and on june 4 2011 he passed away however always remember the angel of death is a nobody you give some nobody a gun and with the strength of a government behind him he turns to be the angel of death you take away the gun as well as the government s supportive power and he becomes a nobody again sooner or later what goes around comes around

10 stocks stock advisor returns as of september 17 2021 this video was recorded on sept 30 2021 chris hill it s thursday september 30th welcome to market foolery if la grande you would like someone to wake you up when september ends good news the end is finally here i m chris hill with me today first time in a while matt argersinger thanks for being here matt argersinger happy to be here chris thanks chris hill this has not been a good month and we re going to talk about that matt argersinger i love you have me back on when there s bad news in the market i m grateful for that chris hill that s not why i have you on i wanted to talk about home prices and that s what we re going to talk about first because i ve talked to you a couple of times over the summer on motley fool money the first time was early may and i remember we recorded the interview earlier in the week a couple of days before the show then over the next couple of days when i told people i had interviewed you everybody had the same question which was essentially what does matt think about home prices home prices are crazy what did he say about that in some cases it was people that we work with who were looking to buy a home and the market they re in is crazy and they re like should i hold off for a few months i told everyone that i d asked you that question and you basically said no this isn t cooling off anytime soon the other day we got the latest data that you were right home prices in july up nearly 20 percent on an annual basis and this really shows no sign of cooling off there are a couple of things i want to get to but i guess my first question is when the data came out i m assuming you were not surprised did anything stand out to you in terms of what we re seeing right now in terms of the latest data we have on home prices matt argersinger well i think i was a bit surprised i ve been expecting the whole market to stay strong as we ve talked about but the sheer size of the increases have been pretty impressive twenty percent july that s coming off of almost 19 percent increase in june july by the way was the fourth consecutive month of record price appreciation if you click further into the details some of the markets in there are just incredible look at phoenix home prices there are up 32 percent year over year san diego up 28 percent seattle up 25 percent these are extraordinary moves now you have to look back and say well we are year over year from 2020 the spring summer portion of 2020 that was little bit depressed with what was going on with covid 19 and then of course the whole market just really boomed in the fall of last year and we really haven t stopped since we re getting some nice year over year comparisons there but while this makes you happy as a homeowner because you re seeing the equity in your home can continue to rise that s got to be a great feeling if you re looking to buying a house or gosh you are a first time home buyer which i feel really bad for this market it s got to be scary to see these increases especially in a lot of the markets where people are willing to buy a home like a lot of hot markets that we ve talked about chris hill one of the things we re going to talk about in a little bit is the global supply chain challenges that are going on affecting so many different industries to what extent is it hitting the home building industry matt argersinger yes that s a great question it s certainly hitting it you ve seen last year where there was lumber prices those have come down a little bit but iron ore prices cement prices labor prices all higher and haven t really come down at all that s affecting home builders you ve seen a lot of home builders pull back from the market not build as many homes as they re planning waiting for those costs to come down before they make commitments to home buyers it s absolutely having an effect it s affecting developers of multi family so big apartment buildings it is playing a big role in housing and we talked about supply in the housing market now the good news is i was looking at fed data this morning and the supply of homes is finally rising we ve talked about this acute supply shortage in a lot of markets where homes are selling in less than a week and there was just such a low inventory of homes well thankfully the supply of homes is coming back to the point now where there s actually almost a six month supply of homes as of august and that s close to where we are historically i do think if you re looking to buy a house or you re a first time home buyer the situation is going to start leveling out that doesn t mean the prices are going to be coming down necessarily to make homes more affordable but i do think the situation is plateauing a little bit demand is still there but at least the supply is coming up to meet that a little bit then if the supply chain issues which we re going to talk about more but if those get resolved a little bit going into 2022 for home builders and the development companies then we should finally see a little bit of a break in the price what is interesting though chris is that we talked about the home buying and home selling but some of the numbers on the rental side are just as crazy whether you re talking multi family or single family rentals rents are up double digit year over year in a lot of places invitation homes is a reit it s the leading single family rental company that i follow up pretty closely on new leases that they signed in the second quarter renters were paying 24 percent higher rents in phoenix 22 percent higher rents in vegas 16 percent higher rent in atlanta not only are you getting sticker shock as a home buyer you re getting sticker shock as a renter we can only hope that hopefully these supply demand imbalance across the whole market gets settled over here pretty soon chris hill we re going to move onto the stock of the day which is bed bath beyond unfortunately it is the stock of the day because shares are falling more than 25 percent this morning the company s management said traffic in august was much lower than expected second quarter results are not going to be good and bed bath beyond s ceo mark tritton said the supply chain problems have been pervasive we ve heard all about the semiconductor chip shortage how that s affecting so many different industries i guess i didn t think of bed bath beyond not that i thought that they would be impervious to supply chain problems but holy cow this is quite a hit they re taking matt argersinger big time hit and i think you and i will both agree that bed bath beyond has a lot of longer term issues that are well known it s a symptom of a larger problem we have too much brick and mortar retail in the us there has been a major shift to e commerce that s been going on for decades at this point and it was accelerated big time by covid 19 but i think in the short term you have a situation where retail traffic was actually bouncing back finally in late spring early summer vaccines had come out people were getting a little more confident of going out and shopping we actually had record retail sales if you remember back in the spring and in fact traffic to shopping malls was almost back to pre covid levels by the summer i think the major problem before we go to the supply chain issue that we have is delta variant issue not only what that s done to retail traffic over the past few months but what s it s actually doing to office traffic as well because i think it s important to remember that if people aren t going to the office or commuting to work or taking kids to school they re also not eating lunch at restaurants or shopping in stores on the way to and from work i think the delta variant has also slowed the velocity of the us economy down quite a bit and i think that s also contributing to lower sales but then yeah let s get to the supply chain issue i think the demand is certainly there on the consumer side but we still have factories that are operating at lower capacity we have labor shortages we have shipping bottlenecks this was remarkable to me i spoke with a woman who owns a small toy shop here in middleburg virginia where we live this was back in july and she was panicked at the time because she was fairly certain that all of our christmas orders she was making for her store were not going to make it in time that is back in july the data i m seeing suggests that the supply chain issue has not been resolved you have a big problem again it s like demand and supply it s like what we ve been talking about for the whole show here i feel like the retail demand is back at least in the short term but the supply issue remains a big problem chris hill seeing here i was thinking that this was going to be a good holiday season for local businesses because people were going to be doing more local shopping just cause the larger chains were the ones that were going to suffer more from supply chain issues matt argersinger yeah but if anything i think the big chains can monopolize the supply chain in a way that hurts the mom and pop stores as well we often think that yeah the local mom and pop store maybe it s locally supplied maybe they do their own manufacturing most of the time it s not the case there are dealing with the same supply chain issues and in most cases they re paying higher cost to do it than some of the bigger chains they re getting hit just as hard unfortunately chris hill i mentioned earlier it hasn t been a great month for the stock market i think the nasdaq has and the s p 500 will both finish down maybe four percent for the month which on the surface isn t horrible but we ve had a couple of exciting days this month let s just put it that way i was looking at your twitter feed and wanted to ask you about something that you tweeted monday september 20th about an hour before the market closed you tweeted this is starting to get fun what did you mean by that because i ll just for context the s p 500 fell nearly two percent just on that monday what was your mindset when you re like ok this is starting to get fun matt argersinger i didn t mean for my tweet to come across this flipping because i know market volatility it s often not fun especially with a lot of the stocks you want to taking big hits a lot of mine certainly have over the past month and i think a lot of work in crush that day so i was feeling pain too but if i m perfectly honest i like the stock market has been boring for the past several months this is just how i personally approach to the stock market i tend to buy a bunch of stocks at once several times a year i ve been waiting for there to be some volatility just a quick example a one company that s been on my watch list for a while is a company called sun communities the ticker s sui and they are the leader in manufactured home and rv communities it s a great business awesome track record and a stock has just been on an absolute tear i just think the trend toward if you look the need for affordable housing in the country and they are a leader in manufactured homes in rv communities they are right in that zone but the stock recently hit 210 i ve been watching it but with the recent volatility i see the stock price down below 190 not a huge price break but that s something that starts to look interesting that s my approach i tend to get and this is the motley fool ingrained me for many years as i tend to get little giddy when i see the market being very volatile i see stocks that i m following even stocks that i own already when i see them coming down and i want to add to them that starts to get a little fun for me when i see that september was a little bit of rough month but i think it s something we haven t seen a lot of at least since last spring volatility is a friend as we talked about often and especially if you ve got a bunch of high quality companies on your radar that you ve been wanting to buy or add to seeing them come down on prices is usually a fun thing it should be chris hill it should be and i was thinking about this earlier for the overwhelming majority of my investing life that was not my mentality or i should say embracing volatility as an opportunity that was not my mindset i was much more of the approach of like this is not a good day looking at my portfolio and seeing already as opposed to looking at the stocks on my watch list and seeing this is now 10 percent lower than it was a month ago i can buy it now with a 10 percent discount all of which to say for newer investors or even more experienced investors who are still shaken by days like we had on september 20th hanging in there because there is going to come a point where your mindset is going to shift slightly and you are going to see days like this it took me a long time to get there but matt argersinger it took me a long time as well and i think one thing that took me even longer is the idea that it s ok to buy a stock at a much much higher price than when you first bought it i own a bunch of companies that i ve added too many times over the years even though i might have bought the stock at 20 a share if it s a 200 share price and it drops a little bit i m looking to add to it i still feel good about that even though it s so much more than what i paid originally and that s the idea of investing in a great company overtime you re buying it hopefully many times as it goes up in value can you take advantage of days like september 20th when you might get a price break on it i think we need to be long term accumulator leaders of stock of good companies that s what makes us foolish now there are times of course when we need to self we need the cash down the road or things like that but i love the stock market as you do i know i look at it as there always opportunities and even more so when there is volatility chris hill matt argersinger great talking to you thanks for being here matt argersinger thank you chris chris hill as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk

three months ago the media giant fell short of expectations this time around it cleared the hurdles with ease when you think about 2021 success stories one of them would seem to be walt disney dis 0 03 it s the studio behind this year s two highest grossing films at the domestic box office disneyland in california reopened in the spring and the company resumed its cruise ship sailings over the summer revenue soared a better than expected 45 in its latest quarter its headiest year over year surge in ages although admittedly the performance follows depressed results a year earlier disney is back in business but the same can t be said about its stock chart after climbing 26 last year when it wasn t exactly running on all cylinders the stock finds itself trading 4 lower in 2021 through monday s close it doesn t seem fair so let s break down why wall street isn t exactly doing the mickey mouse march these days grate expectations sizing up this year s seemingly inexplicable slide has to begin with assessing last year s inexplicable ascent disney was hit hard by the pandemic posting double digit declines in year over year revenue for four consecutive quarters before its springtime bounce this year with its theme parks either closed or operating at limited capacity and no theatrical outlet for its big budget films it s easy to see why last year was rough for the house of mouse however disney proved to be a silver bullet in the pandemic launched near the end of 2019 the premium streaming service catapulted into homes worldwide through 2020 there are now 116 million paid subscribers worldwide despite its making up a small part of the revenue mix at disney the success of the new service gave growth investors a reason to see the media giant as a promising streaming service stock for which wider valuation multiples were acceptable disney hasn t been a driver in the 2021 calendar year subscriber growth has slowed and average revenue per user has contracted as it is rolled out in new countries where monthly subscription rates are lower the move has shifted the attention back to disney as a blue chip media mogul and that isn t as easy a sell as one might think in this climate income investors who bailed on disney when it suspended its payout in the early stages of the covid 19 crisis aren t coming back because the payouts aren t coming back disney doesn t seem to be in a hurry to return money to its shareholders through cash distributions especially when that money can be put to better use building out its streaming content upgrading its theme parks and expanding its fleet of cruise ships as popular as disney is disney doesn t expect it to turn a profit until fiscal 2024 its broadcasting and media networks arm which held up reasonably well last year when folks spent more time watching tv at home still faces a problematic future of cord cutters as consumers cancel their cable and satellite tv services if this sounds bleak let s end with a fairy tale finish worthy of a disney animated classic disney stunned investors when its theme parks segment returned to profitability in its latest quarter and the future is even brighter with new monetization initiatives that will drive per capita spending higher in the year ahead disney is already winning again at the local multiplex but it s been holding back on some of its biggest releases which will be blockbusters in the coming quarters fiscal 2022 which began less than two weeks ago is going to be strong for disney the stock may not reflect that right now but since it s just a good trading day or two away from turning 2021 positive it wouldn t be a surprise if disney moves higher this calendar year by the time we re done disney may be down but it s certainly not out

extracted from the annual reports and accounts of the various companies published in 2020 irrespective of whether a company s year end is march june september december or any other month in 2020 echebiri said accounts of publicly held companies are more believable because they are usually subjected to regulatory scrutiny and approval he explained that his group had no doubt that there are many private companies that would easily count among the top 100 companies in the country given their huge balance sheet size the sizeable revenue they post yearly and the mouth watering profits they declare

raises the curtain on the private lives immense tragedies dozens of affairs suicides and enormous glamour of the storied and scandalous dynasty it s like the crown on steroids he said cooper is the son of socialite gloria vanderbilt and the great great great grandson of cornelius vanderbilt cornelius vanderbilt amassed 100m 2 6b in today s money fortune from his vast railroad and shipping holdings and was considered the richest man in the world by the time he died in 1877 vanderbilt descendants squandered their inheritance on building opulent palaces around the country the biltmore to this day remains the largest private residence in america at 175 000 square feet the breakers in newport is considered to be the crown jewel of gilded age mansions it cost 11million to build in 1885 310m in today s money and remains a temple of vanderbilt wealth and excess growing up cooper says he never knew much about his family history as a kid my mom didn t really talk about her childhood it was very painful for her gloria vanderbilt s father reginald vanderbilt was a gambler drinker and womanizer who squandered his inheritance he died when gloria was just 15 months old gloria s mother frittered away her inheritance while gallivanting across europe leaving little gloria in the care of her governess cnn journalist anderson cooper explores his vanderbilt family history in a new book that details the epic rise and fall of the american dynasty in a new book titled vanderbilt the rise and fall of an american dynasty cnn anchor anderson cooper turns a journalistic eye on his own family by raising the velvet curtain on the private lives immense tragedies and enormous glamour of the storied and scandalous american dynasty anderson cooper is the great great great grandson of cornelius vanderbilt a poor farmer from staten island who became the richest self made man in america with a pathological obsession for money the magnate s vast shipping and railroad empire launched his family and multiple generations into stratospheric wealth cementing their position as american royalty with the titles and the palaces to prove it he writes by the time he died in 1877 cornelius had amassed a 100 million fortune roughly 2 6 billion in today s money and more than the entire us treasury at the time but within a few generations the money was all but gone depleted by heirs who only knew how to live well marry well and spend lavishly this is the story of the greatest american fortune ever squandered writes cooper the story of the extraordinary rise and epic fall of the vanderbilt dynasty it s like the crown on steroids he told cnn in a later interview anderson cooper 54 is the great great great grandson of cornelius vanderbilt the railroad and shipping tycoon who was once the richest man in the world cooper s interest in his family history was piqued when he began sorting through his late mother gloria vanderbilt s boxes i was not really aware at all he says of his family history cornelius commodore vanderbilt was an upstart from staten island who quit school at the age of 11 began working in his father s ferry business born into hardscrabble rural obscurity vanderbilt turned his small scale ferry business into a massive transportation empire he had a mania for making money said cooper by the time he died in 1877 cornelius had amassed 100 million 2 6b in today s money more than the entire us treasury at the time g cornelius vanderbilt the first tycoon anderson cooper s earliest ancestor was an undistinguished indentured farmer named jan aertsen who arrived in the dutch colony of new amsterdam modern day new york city during the 1650s aertsen was from the village of bilt in the utrecht region of holland and his name was recorded van der bilt or from the bilt which evolved later to vanderbilt the family fortune wasn t made until the nineteenth century when cornelius commodore vanderbilt an upstart from staten island who quit school at the age of 11 began working in his father s ferry business he was born into poverty in 1794 and known as a headstrong stubborn and manipulative child who was willing to risk almost anything to make money when he was 15 cornelius used a 100 loan from his mother to buy his own boat for piloting passengers through the rough currents between staten island and manhattan within six months he had run his own father out of the ferry business the wharves were the crucible in which cornelius vanderbilt s acquisitive hunger was forged wrote cooper he drank and whored and didn t stand down from a fight cornelius married his first cousin sophia johnson vanderbilt when he was 19 years old and together they had 13 children 12 of which would survive into adulthood he expanded into steamboats and made a fortune in shipping by monopolizing the waterways around new york during the 1830s then he shifted attention to trains when he bought up local railroads and merged them into a vast transportation network that stretched across the united states his rise was dizzying said cooper of his great great great grandfather he possessed a genius and a mania for making money but his obsession with material wealth would border on pathological and the pathology born of that wealth would go on to infect each successive generation in different ways despite his enormous wealth money did not buy cornelius respectability among the old guard in washington square park the knickerbockers schermerhorns and lorillards found the tobacco chewing philandering profanity prone illiterate as vulgar money was his sole concern making it spending it and making more new york society could ignore him but in the end they couldn t ignore his money no one could wrote cooper in his book he was a notoriously terrible family man he disregarded his nine daughters because they wouldn t be able to carry on the vanderbilt name and had always wanted more than three sons in 1846 he committed his long suffering wife to an insane asylum by claiming that she was unstable during her change of life in truth he was having an affair with his children s governess and wanted to enjoy her company freely a month after sophia s death cornelius carried out a complex and absurd relationship with two clairvoyant sisters that would last several years they were famous for their beauty and magnetic healing powers and cornelius took particular interest in the nubile 22 year old sister named tennessee claflin by then he had already developed a serious interest in spiritualism and began attending regular seances when cornelius vanderbilt died on january 4 1877 he left his entire fortune estimated to be 100 million to his eldest son william billy henry vanderbilt on his deathbed cornelius gave william one last haunting instruction keep the money together nobody could have expected then how far the vanderbilt would collapse under its only pathology for greed vanderbilt s controversial decision to disinherit his nine daughters and other living son cornelius cornie jeremiah set the stage for one of the most salacious trials in the century the backstabbing family drama resulted in a court case that played itself out in tawdry headlines that exposed the sordid happenings behind the curtains at 10 washington place cornie was a perpetual disappointment from the moment he was born he suffered from epilepsy which the commodore took to be a sign of weakness from a young age as an adult cornie proved to be just as much of a embarrassment when he didn t share his father s hunger for moneymaking nor his talent for it always in financial straits cornie repeatedly leaned on his famous last name to procure loans which he squandered on his fondness for drinking gambling and prostitutes the commodore had him institutionalized twice for weakness of character at the same asylum he had also committed his wife years before the jilted siblings charged their brother william billy henry vanderbilt with fraud claiming that he wrongly influenced their ailing father to his own advantage one shocking eyewitness testimony claimed that william paid a phony clairvoyant to evoke his deceased mother during a trance session with the commodore on his deathbed and declare that he should be the sole inheritor of the estate another stunning allegation against william claimed that he attempted to soil cornie s reputation by having him impersonated by a depraved lookalike and followed by detectives that reported his debauched habits at brothels to the commodore meanwhile cornie s vices and multiple stints in debtor s jail were laid bare for the public to see and feast upon in the end william vanderbilt settled with his wayward brother for a pittance sum of 1 million but the trial had all but broken cornie in april 1882 cornelius jeremiah vanderbilt took his own life at the glenham hotel on fifth avenue with his male companion sat in the room next door it was almost as though the vanderbilt fortune itself was cornie s affliction the access to it the lack of access to it the assumption of it the theft of it his father s affection for it writes cooper the money a contagion he says preying upon cornie s body and on his mind cornelius left his entire fortune to his eldest son willian henry vanderbilt above effectively disinheriting his ten other children the controversial will led to a sensational trial that aired all the vanderbilt s dirty laundry william henry was accused by his siblings of fraud and claimed that he wrongly manipulated their ailing father on his deathbed as a result of the trial william henry s younger brother cornelius jeremiah committed suicide as inheritor of cornelius 100 million estate william henry vanderbilt assumed control of his father s shipping and railroad interests he was the only family member to double the vanderbilt fortune with his vast transportation monopoly by the time he died in 1885 william amassed a staggering 200 million 5 4 billion today by 1873 vanderbilt had taken control of what was then known as the harlem railroad and merged it with the hudson river and new york central railroad companies this led him to commission a new station that would unite all three railroads under one roof the grand central depot which would later be finished by his son is the iconic grand central terminal of today today grand central terminal is one of the ten most visited attractions in the world the vanderbilt siege on new york society william henry would go on to double the vanderbilt fortune the only descendant to add to the wealth they d been handed by the time he died in 1885 william amassed a staggering fortune of 200 million the rough equivalent 5 4 billion today though cooper says he also initiated its fall by inaugurating the vanderbilt siege on the gilded gates of new york society that ushered in the truly astonishing excess for which the vanderbilts would become famous starting in the 1870s william henry vanderbilt leveraged his enormous wealth to land himself and his children on new york s social map but first he had to go through the grand dame of polite society who kept him at arm s length society in the gilded age was itself still a new invention presided over primarily by caroline astor as its reigning queen and self appointed gate keeper third generation vanderbilts were keen to join astor s renown four hundred new york s most exclusive and illustrious social circle that was nicknamed after the maximum number of people she could fit in her ballroom invitations were limited to only the most elite eventually the four hundred list was published in the form of a blue book which persists today as the social register caroline astor recognized early on the importance of money in a country without landed aristocracy she wielded her social influence as a kingmaker and arbiter of taste with liveried servants french art french chefs and imported china the vanderbilts had the money but they didn t have the politesse william willie kissam vanderbilt was a known party boy who indulged in the finer pleasures that wealth afforded him yachting horse breeding and a palatialhunting lodge on long island his primary purpose in life cooper says was to consume he had no professional ambition before he died in 1920 he told the new york times my life was never destined to be quite happy inherited wealth is a real handicap to happiness it is as certain a death to ambition as cocaine is to morality willie vanderbilt s wife alva was the spoiled daughter of a rich kentucky cotton family who moved into a fifth avenue mansion just before the civil war her family s fortune evaporated in the postbellum stock market leaving the homely 17 year old with nothing but her boundless ambition to secure a position in new york city s most illustrious social circles using her enormous resources alva would buy prestige and respectibility among america s old money families cornelius ii was the commodore s favorite grandson unlike his playboy brother cornelius ii was given to the serious business side of vanderbilt life the same year his father william henry died cornelius ii assumed control of the family s business interests alice vanderbilt was in constant competition with her upstate sister in law alva the two vanderbilt wives reveled in her husband s wealth wasting no time throwing it into the creation of enormous palaces on fifth avenue and in newport alice became known as alice of the breakers the socialite was said to be so snobbish

churchill consuelo said her wedding was the worst day of her life the unhappy marriage was arranged through her socially ambitious mother alva who had long hoped to secure an aristocratic match for her daughter the social war between the houses of vanderbilt and astor played out in opulent mansions and lavish parties hosted at delmonicos downtown an important venue for the newly minted blue bloods of the gilded age one such fete in 1883 hosted by the commodore s grandson william willie kissam vanderbilt and his wife alva would change the entire face and trajectory of new york society in one evening alva was brilliant but utterly ruthless in her quest to challenge caroline astor s iron rule over new york society she was the spoiled daughter of a rich kentucky cotton family who moved into a fifth avenue mansion with slaves in tow just before the civil war her family s fortune evaporated in the postbellum stock market leaving the homely 17 year old with nothing but her unrelenting ambition her task was clear get married and make sure he was rich her husband willie vanderbilt was a known party boy who indulged in the finer pleasures that wealth afforded him his primary purpose in life cooper says was to consume before he died in 1920 he told the new york times my life was never destined to be quite happy inherited wealth is a real handicap to happiness it is as certain a death to ambition as cocaine is to morality she and willie were married in april 1875 and two years later alva had a daughter named consuelo who would later go on to captivate the public with her marriage to the 9th duke of marlborough a first cousin of winston churchill with willie s wealth alva would lay siege to the cloistered world of new york society her opening gambit was a grandiose

wig the goddess diana daniel boone alva received her guests dressed as a venetian princess most notable was the string of pearls that belonged to catherine the great wrapped around her waist alva s rival for reigning vanderbilt hostess was her sister in law alice who came costumed as an electric light bulb during a time when all homes were still lit by gas lamps and candles the ensemble was renown for its cutting edge technology using hidden batteries in the folds of her dress to lit a bulb when alice held it in her hand like the statue of liberty wittingly or not said cooper in the book the vanderbilts paid homage to the past while single mindedly lighting the path of the future of society her torch and tiara preceded the statue of liberty by three years the arrival of the vanderbilts was complete the vanderbilt palaces by the 1870s the beating heart of new york city society that was once washington square park had decamped uptown fifth avenue became the new vanguard for the same social elites that previously previously shunned the the commodore downtown the subsequent generations just went on this spending spree to break into society by building these enormous palaces all which were built and torn down within a span of 60 years anderson cooper 54 told cnn the commodore s son william henry vanderbilt was the first in the family to build a sumptuous mansion on millionaire s row the famed triple palace was made up of three sprawling houses connected by interiors so lavish it took between 700 workmen to complete the mansion was later inherited by his grandson who auctioned off the outdated priceless nineteenth century furniture in 1942 to warner brothers and other movie studios that used the pieces as set decorations for period films william henry doubled the family s wealth and built their first mansion on fifth avenue it was called the triple palace and was comprised of three grand and sprawling connected houses with interiors so ornate it took between 700 workmen to complete the mansion was later inherited by his grandson who auctioned off the outdated priceless nineteenth century furniture in 1942 to warner brothers studios and the home was demolished in 1945 the opulent homes continued with william henry s son cornelius vanderbilt ii who built a sumptuous palace on the corner of 58th street and fifth avenue in 1883 the mansion had over 100 rooms and covered an entire city block his wife alice lived in the house alone with only the thirty seven servants needed to keep it running after cornelius ii s death in 1899 the home was demolished in 1926 to make way for the bergdorf goodman flagship store but it still holds the record for the largest private residence ever built in new york city next to the triple palace stood william willie kissam and alva s petit chateau at 660 fifth avenue determined to upstage her sister in law alice alva designed her grandiose mansion after the gothic castles she saw during her childhood in france upon its completion in 1883 alva hosted a masquerade ball with 1 200 guests as a housewarming party the house was razed in 1927 in its place today stands a 41 story office building that was owned by jared kushner until 2018 in 1895 cornelius ii and alice spent 7 million 220 million today s money building the breakers in newport rhode island in its 77 years of existence the breakers saw the equivalent of nearly 218 million evaporate into thin air though small in comparison to their gargantuan nyc home the sprawling summer retreat is three times as big as the white house and made up of 70 rooms with sumptuous interiors the breakers is the grandest and most opulent of newport s gilded age mansions and it remains the most popular tourist attraction in the state of rhode island using the inheritance from his father william henry s youngest child george built a colossal 175 000 square foot retreat in asheville north carolina the biltmore remains america s largest home to this day with 250 rooms 35 bedrooms and 43 bathrooms the french renaissance chateau and its 8 000 acre property is still family owned and operated by george s relatives alva vanderbilt endeavored to build a summer cottage as she called it that would outshine caroline astor s newport mansion with 500 000 square feet of imported italian marble the home would come to be known as the marble house completed in 1888 the mock petit trianon cost 11 million to build which equals an estimated 310million in today s money unlike the commodore who despised ostentation his grandchildren and subsequent generations went on a spending spree in an effort to break into society by building opulent homes all which were built and torn down within a span of 60 years said anderson cooper the above home in hyde park new york was owned by cornelius vanderbilt s grandson frederick william vanderbilt the opulent homes continued with william henry vanderbilt s son cornelius vanderbilt ii who succeeded his father as president and chairman of the new york central railroad his behemoth construction of 1 west 58th street featured over 100 rooms and filled an entire city block after his death in 1899 alice lived in the house alone with the thirty seven servants needed to keep it running it was demolished in 1926 to make way for the bergdorf goodman flagship store but the home still holds the record for the largest private residence ever built in new york city cornelius ii and alice had also commissioned a lavish summer retreat the breakers in 1895 it is known today as one of the greatest representations of the gilded age but at the time the resplendent newport mansion was just a small summer cottage in comparison to the new york city palace on 58th street the sheer size of the breakers is hard to contemplate writes cooper the sprawling summer home is made up of 70 rooms and is three times as big as the white house the morning room walls are paneled in platinum the first corridor is built on a scale more suited to grand city hotel lobbies than to a weekend getaway house the great hall displays sculptural personifications of art science and industry with a painted trompe l oeil ceiling the music room features a dazzling gilded ceiling while the dining room is designed to seat thirty four guests cooper says there is something uniquely american about this faux palace with its décor and fixtures ripped out of the ancient homes of european royalty he likens it to versailles the breakers was the center of attention the center of fame but unlike its french counterpart the breakers was the center of envy without being a center of power next door to the triple palace stood william willie kissam and alva s petit chateau at 660 fifth avenue determined to upstage her sister in law down the street alva designed her grandiose mansion after the gothic castles she saw during her childhood in france the palatial residence made of limestone featured pointed turrets out of a fairy tale castle the vanderbilts must have homes which represent originality art and beauty said alva boasting about the petit chateau she said my house was the death of brown stone fronts a developer bought the house in 1926 and bulldozed it within a year in its place today stands a 41 story office building that was owned by jared kushner until 2018 still in the grips of a

the home would come to be known as the marble house completed in 1888 the mock petit trianon cost 11 million to build 310million in today s money perhaps the greatest temple to vanderbilt ambition and excess is the biltmore estate in asheville north carolina using the inheritance from his father the commodore s youngest grandchild george built a colossal 175 000 square foot retreat in the blue ridge mountains the biltmore remains america s largest home to this day with 250 rooms 35 bedrooms and 43 bathrooms the french renaissance chateau and its 8 000 acre property is still family owned and

s inheritance was spread thin among the many descendants meanwhile the railroad empire built by cornelius was changing and the family s role would continue to dwindle until the 1970s when it would go bust reggie was the profligate son of cornelius ii and alice vanderbilt scandal defined gloria s early life her father was a philandering drinker and gambler who frittered away his 7 3 million inheritance and died when gloria was just 15 months old he made the news not for what he built but rather what he spent he had a daughter named cathleen from his first marriage which ended in divorce in 1920 by then he had taken an interest young cathleen s teenage friend from the debutante circuit her name was gloria morgan and they were married three years later reggie vanderbilt was 24 years

gloria in the care of nannies while she traveled the world gloria s father reggie vanderbilt was a philandering alcoholic who squandered away his 7 3 million inheritance he died of cirrhosis when gloria was just 15 months old the night before announcing their engagement reggie hosted a costume ball for cathleen at which gloria morgan appeared as marie antoinette cathleen resented their nuptials and didn t meet her baby half sister until little gloria was a 15 year old teenager cathleen wasn t the only person who disagreed with the may december romance his mother alice always a walking contradiction with her extravagant consumption and her puritanical comportment worried that gloria morgan had been around her fears were assuaged when gloria agreed to be examined by alice s physician who attested to her intact virginity on february 20 1924 gloria morgan gave birth to gloria laura morgan vanderbilt it is fantastic how vanderbilt she looks beamed reggie see the corners of her eyes how they turn up he would be dead within months from cirrhosis of the liver cooper writes reggie hemorrhaged blood so explosively out of his mouth at the moment of his death that when his wife arrived two minutes too late to see him alice wouldn t let her in the room it was painted with reggie s blood he was flat broke by the time he died and owed money all over town to lenders who had been all too willing to give him credit because of his famous name in an age when a newspaper cost pennies he owed 269 to his local newsstand 4 000 to b altman booksellers 712 to a laundress 9 000 to tiffany and company and thousands in back taxes at the age of 20 gloria morgan was a widow and single mother she was legally and emotionally still a minor to cover his debts gloria was forced to auction their plush new york city town house his sandy point farm all his horses all the cars the furniture linens and even a stuffed elephant belonging to the baby the only value left in his estate was the 5 million trust fund that cornelius ii reggie s father had established for the benefit of reggie s children that sum would be split between little gloria and her half sister cathleen gloria morgan filed a petition to be awarded an allowance from her daughter s trust these expenses amounted to 4 160 per month about 60 000 today the included 925 for servants plus an additional 250 for the servants food baby gloria was now the piggy bank for her entire household and she couldn t even talk leaving little gloria in the care of her governess gloria morgan spirited away to europe and stayed up all hours of the night attending soigne dinner parties nightclubs and glamorous cocktail events pilfering her daughter s 2 5 million inheritance to fund her extravagant lifestyle according to the book gloria s twin sister thelma became the fast friend and favorite dancing partner of edward the prince of wales his circle of friends known as the palace set were a cast of fast living decadent aristocrats thelma is also credited with or blamed for introducing the prince to wallis simpson after asking her to take care of him while she was away my mom would see her as this very glamorous figure disappearing down the hallway cooper says it sounds very elegant now on the outside but she s an 8 year old child being moved from hotel rooms and her mother s going out to parties every night and having all sorts of people through the house it really was not a stable upbringing in 1934 10 year old gloria became the center of a sensational custody lawsuit that was heard and reported around the world it was dubbed the trial of the century gloria s paternal aunt gertrude vanderbilt whitney founder of the whitney museum disagreed with morgan s carefree gallivanting lifestyle and conspired with little gloria s beloved nanny and maternal grandmother to prove that morgan was an unfit mother she sued for custody of little gloria citing neglect and immoral influence of her mother as cause salacious details from behind the curtain of america s richest family captivated the poverty stricken public during the great depression newspapers dubbed gloria the poor little rich girl cooper 54 who grew up not knowing much about his family history told people in some ways i wanted this to be a letter to my son gloria morgan s french maid testified that she saw mrs vanderbilt was in bed reading a paper and there was lady milford haven beside the bed with her arm around mrs vanderbilt s neck and kissing her just like a lover lady milford haven was the daughter of a russian grand duke and was married to a mountbatten cousin to the king of england the nanny testified that she found graphic pornography books flogging and nuns and naked men with women s tongues left out where the child could easily see them gossip columnists decried that morgan was a cocktail crazed dancing mother a devotee of sex erotica and the mistress of a german prince meanwhile the defense argued that gertrude vanderbilt whitney s work as a celebrated sculptor featured nudes it s true that aunt gertrude wasn t so virtuous either she had two lives one as a respectable pearl laden grand dame of society and the other as a bohemian downtown artist who took whatever lovers she wanted men or women writes cooper custody was eventually awarded to gertrude whitney but gloria was left traumatized and even more isolated from the event the new york journal american composed the ditty rockabye baby up on a writ monday to friday mother s unfit as the week ends she rises in virtue saturdays sundays mother won t hurt you as an adult vanderbilt would have a string of epic romances with some of the 20th century s most celebrated men howard hughes frank sinatra errol flynn and marlon brando

to protect her my mom had a very fractured relationship with the family she was born into said cooper to cnn she never really connected to any of them so she never told me stories about her childhood growing up she never really spoke about it like her ancestors gloria spent lavishly almost heedlessly on anything that might bring pleasure on houses and furnishings gifts for friends charities and fine clothes i think of my mother as the last vanderbilt writes cooper she was the last living vanderbilt who d slept at the breakers when it was still a private home owned by her grandmother alice she was the last child to ride in cars driven by liveried chauffeurs guarded by private detectives in overcoats and fedoras she was the last to be born before the depression when the vanderbilt riches seemed as limitless and eternal as the stars in the sky he says in the book the dynasty ended with gloria

lithium the elemental metal is a hot commodity these days since it s used in the manufacture of batteries increasing electric vehicle ev sales have many investors feeling optimistic about companies that produce and refine the basic material although lithium is a common substance prices for it skyrocketed some 1 000 from 2021 to the end of 2022 easily exceeding previous highs reached in 2017 but 2023 has been a different story as the effects of inflation and china s long pandemic lockdowns work through the system lithium supply is expected to briefly be in oversupply which has sent prices back down to levels not seen since 2021 image source getty images even with the oversupply soaring battery demand from evs and energy storage saving power for later distribution to the electric grid have some estimates pointing to a doubling of lithium demand in the next few years in the u s the 2021 infrastructure investment and jobs act set aside 5 billion in federal funding for ev charging stations more recently the 2022 inflation reduction act was put into place to provide credits for consumers to support president biden s goal of getting evs to account for 50 percent or more of new auto sales by 2030 with automakers on board there will be ample demand for lithium in the years ahead here s what you need to know before investing in this basic material used in battery development definition icon law of supply and demand the law of supply and demand is an economic theory asserting that supply and demand will meet each other at a certain equilibrium price five leading lithium stocks investing in lithium stocks in april 2024 like any basic materials and metals investment betting on lithium isn t for the faint of heart soaring demand for a material used in the manufacture of a product doesn t automatically equate to higher sales and profits for a company supply also plays a hand in the market price of the basic material so when supply outpaces demand prices fall and the material producer s sales can fall too even if overall demand is expanding as is the case with all mining operations getting new lithium projects up and running can be a costly endeavor it can take many years to ramp up to full production draining a mining company of its cash and other liquidity in the process chile has also thrown a wrench in the gears the south american country s president recently announced intention to nationalize the lithium industry with a state owned company this would affect the financial results for companies that operate in chile as well as any company with plans to develop lithium mining there chile s national congress would need to sign off on the plan before it proceeds chile is the world s second largest lithium producing country behind australia

washington afp advertising read more us lawmakers rubber stamped a short term bill to lift the nation s borrowing authority tuesday averting the threat of a first ever debt default but only for a few weeks the democratic controlled house of representatives voted along party lines to pass the stop gap 480 billion hike which advanced from the senate last thursday after weeks of heated debate it s about the kitchen table it s about our economy the global economy but it s also about our constitution which says the full faith and credit of the united states shall not be in doubt democratic house speaker nancy pelosi told reporters ahead of the vote democratic leaders had spent weeks underlining the havoc that a default would have wrought including the loss of six million jobs and 15 trillion in household wealth as well as increased costs for mortgages and other borrowing republicans refused to offer any of their own votes to avert the crisis and even blocked democrats who control congress from lifting the limit on their own via a simple majority but the party dropped its blockade in the senate last week ending for now an impasse that risked leaving the federal government incapable of securing and servicing loans after october 18 the new arrangement merely kicks the can down the road possibly to complicate another major funding deadline a shutdown that would begin from december 3 when the government s coffers theoretically run out full faith and credit the borrowing cap may yet turn out to be less pressing however economists estimate that the nation will reach the new revised debt limit sometime in mid december or early january slightly later than the december 3 date that congress originally projected the united states spends more money than it collects through taxation so it borrows money via the issuing of government bonds seen as among the world s most reliable investments around 80 years ago lawmakers introduced a limit on how much federal debt could be accrued the ceiling has been lifted dozens of times to allow the government to meet its spending commitments usually without drama and with the support of both parties and stands at around 28 trillion but republicans in both chambers of congress have this time objected saying they refuse to support biden s reckless taxing and spending plans in reality raising the debt ceiling doesn t authorize new spending it merely pays for expenses that both republican and democratic administrations have already committed to this is about meeting obligations that the government has already incurred including from the bipartisan covid relief or legislation passed last year pelosi said only three percent of the current debt that we re addressing here has been incurred during the biden years the absurdity of regularly risking a recession not to mention america s credit rating and the stability other major economies over partisan squabbling has not been lost on congress pelosi was asked tuesday about a growing clamor to take the decision on raising the debt ceiling away from the party politics on capitol hill and give it to the treasury that seems to have some appeal to both sides of the aisle because of the consequences for people of not lifting it she said many many democrats and republicans have voted against lifting the debt ceiling but never before to the extent of jeopardizing it 2021 afp

even with a recent rebound the brazilian fintech stock is down 35 year to date what happened shares of pagseguro digital pags 0 23 jumped on tuesday following the release of preliminary third quarter results the brazilian fintech stock closed the daily session up roughly 14 2 pagseguro expects that it will have notched total payment volume of 125 billion brazilian reals approximately 22 59 billion in the third quarter representing growth of roughly 85 year over year the company also estimates that it had 12 2 million active users at the end of q3 up 1 million users sequentially so what pagseguro stock has been under pressure due to macroeconomic challenges in brazil and a series of regulatory changes that could narrow some of the company s growth opportunities prior to tuesday s jump the company s share price was down roughly 17 across october s trading brazil s central bank announced on oct 8 that it was considering new regulations that would cap prepaid card transaction fees at 0 5 according to citigroup analyst gabriel gusan the potential change could result in pagseguro s annual revenue being lowered by roughly 4 in addition to the stronger than expected active user growth outlined in the preliminary q3 report pagseguro stock may have also gotten a boost from some favorable analyst coverage goldman sachs analyst tito labarta published a note on pagseguro today that maintained a buy rating on the stock and a one year price target of 64 per share based on a conversation with pagseguro management labarta estimates that the proposed prepaid card transaction cap would result in the company s revenue being lowered by 3 and its pre tax earnings being lowered by approximately 13 while certainly less than ideal these potential negative impacts were not as bad as initially feared now what pagseguro will publish its official third quarter results after the market closes on nov 11 coming on the heels of its recent preliminary reporting there probably won t be any big surprises about performance in the period there s a promising long term growth outlook for fintech services in brazil and other latin american markets and pagseguro is a leader in its corner of the market the stock could have big upside at current prices but investors should proceed with the understanding that regulatory and macroeconomic developments could create more pricing volatility in the near term
uschools istock washington the house voted tuesday to temporarily raise the debt ceiling by 480 billion after the senate approved the stopgap measure late last week putting off the risk of default until early december house speaker nancy pelosi called the lower chamber back to washington from a two week recess to pass the measure the bill passed along party lines tuesday evening in a 219 206 vote it now heads to president joe biden s desk for signature a default would send shockwaves to global financial markets and would likely cause credit markets worldwide to freeze up and stock markets to plunge employers around the world would likely have to begin laying off workers pelosi told reporters during a press conference on capitol hill tuesday the debt ceiling bill was packaged as part of a rule for floor debate of several other bills meaning there was not a stand alone vote on the debt limit measure the bill was considered deemed and passed once the rule was adopted pelosi staved off defections amid razor thin margins in the house she could have only afforded to lose three votes republicans for months have said that democrats would need to act on their own to raise the debt limit because they have total control of washington and are planning to pass a multi trillion social and economic package with zero input from republicans senate minority leader mitch mcconnell has said repeatedly that democrats should have to hike the debt limit because of the high cost of biden s proposed agenda democrats have argued that raising the debt limit is a bipartisan responsibility in part because it covers spending that already took place under the trump administration the house s return tuesday follows a chilling warning from treasury secretary janet yellen that if the house fails to act this week the u s is at risk of defaulting and will be unable to pay its bills yellen warned on abc s this week that mcconnell and republicans are playing with catastrophe over a pending fight to raise the debt ceiling fifty million americans wouldn t receive social security payments our troops won t know when or if they would be paid the 30 million families that receive a child tax credit those payments would be in jeopardy yellen said she said such a scenario could result in catastrophe president joe biden has said he will sign the bill into law once the house approves the measure tuesday but lawmakers will once again be at odds and at risk of fiscal calamity come december the new deadline will coincide with the end of the stop gap deal to fund the federal government pelosi indicated an off ramp on the debt ceiling drama is in the works she told reporters that the treasury department should be able to lift the debt ceiling unilaterally while congress would maintain the power to overrule an increase to the debt limit i m optimistic that these decisions have to be made pelosi said we are not a rubber stamp or a lockstep party we have a discussion and other family values that all members have brought to the table pelosi said the idea to give the treasury the authority to lift the debt limit seems to have some appeal on both sides of the aisle because of the consequences of not lifting it pelosi said she thinks the idea has merit we re just hoping that we can do this in a bipartisan way she added the speaker said she does not support raising the debt limit through the process of reconciliation which would allow democrats to pass any bill with just a simple majority the process is time consuming and democrats have firmly said they oppose using the process in a letter to biden mcconnell warned that come december he would be willing to allow the nation to default on its national debt rather than work with democrats on a resolution your lieutenants on capitol hill now have the time they claimed they lacked to address the debt ceiling through standalone reconciliation and all the tools to do it mcconnell said in the letter they cannot invent another crisis and ask for my help abc news allison pecorin contributed to this report copyright 2021 abc audio all rights reserved

bremer financial corp executives in early 2019 held preliminary merger talks with south dakota based great western bank on a deal that would have kept the bremer name and put its ceo in charge of the combined firm documents and testimony in a court hearing revealed tuesday but trustees of otto bremer trust which held a 92 stake in the bank at the time objected to the deal structure one trustee brian lipschultz said at the hearing it was an existential question of the trustees lipschultz said he added we had an absolute crisis on our hands the trustees feared that the trust s stake in the ongoing company at around 45 might constrain its annual dividend so much that it wouldn t be able to meet federal distribution requirements for a charitable trust the minnesota attorney general s office wants a ramsey county judge to remove lipschultz and the two other trustees of st paul based otto bremer trust alleging mismanagement the state s pursuit of the trustees began after they continued seeking a buyer for bremer financial in 2019 when no deal came together with great western and the bank s executives and board resisted looking for another appearing for a second day in st paul at a hearing on the state s dismissal request lipschultz provided more details about the disintegration of the relationship between the trustees and bremer financial executives and board members through 2019 under questioning from assistant attorney general carol washington lipschultz acknowledged the relationship turned so acrimonious that by early 2020 he and trustee dan reardon were texting allegations of criminal suspicions about bremer financial executives everything will come out lipschultz wrote in one text in january 2020 they are involved in truly criminal activities not just bad or conflicted governance amazing sad and unfortunate reardon replied assets being squandered recklessly by them under questions later in the day from the trust s outside counsel jan conlin lipschultz portrayed bremer financial executives and board members as initially open to discussions with great western he did not name the other bank by name the parties agreed at the start of the hearing not to publiclyidentify counterparties with the one in early 2019 referred to simply as company a but documents entered into testimony including its 2018 asset size and branch locations made clear that company a was great western other documents last week revealed that trustees held deal discussions later in 2019 with bmo harris s u s banking unit and huntington bancshares the ohio banking firm that recently paired up with tcf financial a representative of great western did not respond to a e mail inquiry for comment tuesday the sioux falls based firm last month agreed to a stock merger with montana based first interstate banksystem inc that will conclude next year under which it will take the first interstate name but in early 2019 its top executive met bremer financial ceo jeanne crain in person and madeprogress on a deal that would have united two of the largest regional banks in the upper midwest there would have been little overlap in branch locations with great western operating chiefly in south dakota iowa nebraska and kansas and bremer in minnesota wisconsin north dakota and montana bremer financial is not a party to the current court hearing and in separate litigation has disputed some details put forth by the trustees crain the top executive is scheduled to appear in the current legal hearing later this week the bank and trust have fought over whether the trust can sell its stake in the bank since the summer 2019 when bremer financial s board decided not to pursue any further deals the document establishing the trust in the 1940s written by the bank s founder otto bremer said the trust could only sell the bank under unforeseen circumstances on tuesday lipschultz described several conditions of the modern banking industry such as the digital banking revolution and consolidation of bank companies as conditions that met that criteria he also testified about documents created by bremer financial s top executives in the late 1980s the last time the legal relationship between the two entities changed that warned other bremer financial shareholders that the charitable trust could sell its stake anytime an offer to buy or merge could be received next year five years from now next week or never bremer financial told its shareholders then the foundation it noted had a responsibility to maintain its charitability by protecting and enhancing the foundation s assets is there anything in these documents that say bremer bank can block a sale conlin asked lipschultz not one he replied
like too many popular discussions of public policy the debate about rent stabilization is commonly driven by fear and half truths more than by reasoned assessments of the evidence such is the case in conversations across the country and now in the twin cities let s not relive the rent control nightmare others endured opinion exchange oct 5 but rent stabilization is too important a question to be left to heated rhetoric it deserves a clear headed and calm civic conversation as researchers we try to look at the actual data rather than exaggerated narratives in our reports on the rent stabilization topic we find little support for the disaster narratives of housing shortfalls predicted by simplified economic theory and the opponents of rent stabilization we do find significant evidence of the social benefits of residential stability brought by constraining rent increases with minor issues that proponents also need to address our research draws from studies of rent stabilization in places ranging from cambridge mass to san francisco calif to a variety of cities in new jersey on balance such ordinances do little harm moreover companion regulations can address unintended consequences that do sometimes emerge such as reduced cosmetic maintenance by landlords and owners withdrawing their units from the rental market through condo conversion or demolition in general there is little to mixed evidence that rent stabilization deflates property values reduces the rate of new housing construction or has detrimental impacts on mom and pop landlords some might argue that the proposed ordinance being debated in st paul is different because it would also apply to new apartment buildings this is a departure from many other ordinances and the proposed rent stabilization measure will hold the earnings and profit trajectories to specified levels but investors buy into financial instruments with fixed returns all the time including treasury bills municipal bonds and the like such financial modeling is nothing new to savvy investors it s also unclear how tightly future constraints would bind in our minneapolis rent stabilization study we found that if there had been such an ordinance there would have actually been little impact except on the most egregious side of the rental market basically it would have constrained only the most extreme rent increases which were never more than a small portion of the market it is useful too for the regional discussion of rent stabilization to include the potential benefits which are often ignored or under appreciated for example in our research we found that the greatest beneficiaries from rent stabilization in minneapolis would have been the lowest income renters and renters of color especially black renters this is a finding of some significance given the region s extreme racial disparities in well being in our work with policylink we found that the minneapolis metro is among the most prosperous of america s top 150 metropolitan regions ranked six out of 150 but also has higher racial disparities than 148 other metro areas also underappreciated is the value of residential stability in our research rent matters we found that displacement is damaging to renters moving for financial reasons causes poor health anxiety and even depression with stronger impacts on women given the barriers that women of color face for economic self determination this means that women of color are most deeply impacted by forced moves children s learning and social support is also impacted with long lasting impacts on their well being it s also the case that money spent on rent doesn t always help support local business the national equity atlas a project of policylink and one of our research centers shows that if st paul renters were not burdened if they were only paying 30 or less of their gross income on rent that their collective spending power would increase by 142 million the comparable figure for minneapolis is 248 million they could invest in themselves their children and their hometowns who doesn t want to live in that place our main message take a breath calm down and have a level headed civic discussion based on the evidence if the cities want to head in a new direction that values residential stability and centers racial equity this ordinance is worthy of thoughtful debate and careful consideration edward g goetz is professor and director center for urban and regional affairs university of minnesota manuel pastor is professor and director equity research institute university of southern california

our articles depend on you for their effectiveness share with kin coworkers and friends eric zuesse america s degenerate elites are courting a lunatic pyrrhic victory over china instead they should be facing a nuremberg tribunal china has now publicly announced that unless the united states government will promptly remove from china s taiwan province the military forces that it recently sent there china will soon send military forces into that province because not only did the u s secretly send special operations forces onto that island but because since the us has exposed the news through anonymous officials it has taken a step forward to undermine from covertly to semi overtly the key conditions for the establishment of diplomatic relations between chinese mainland and the us that statement threatening to cut off diplomatic relations with the u s comes from the chinese communist party s newspaper global times s editorial on october 8th its editorials speak for the chinese government at least as much as statements from the u s white house speak for the u s government the chinese editorial went on to explain that the mainland must respond to the us new provocations to make both washington and the island of taiwan fully realize the severity of their collusion otherwise in the next step us military staff may show up in taiwan island publicly wearing uniforms and their number may increase from dozens to hundreds or even more to form a de facto us garrison in the island in other words america s special operations forces might be killed when china sends its military forces into taiwan so as to deal with the insurrection that s now occurring in this province china is saying that it will be sending those troops and planes onto the island before america publicly invades the island in order to be in a better position to deal with the u s invasion if and when it occurs china is clearly aiming here to avoid there being a de facto us garrison on the island china if it is going to kill u s troops on that island wants to be killing only those few special operations forces personnel and not any garrison it wants to minimize the damage the u s government has officially recognized that taiwan is as the chinese government itself says a province of china not a separate nation therefore what the u s biden administration is now doing is actually in violation of official and actually longstanding u s government policy on the matter as i had reported on september 14th under the headline that china and u s are on the brink of war right now the neocons that biden has surrounded himself with are threatening to accuse him of having lost taiwan if biden backs down from his many threats to china threats that the u s government will reverse america s one china policy which has been in place ever since the 28 february 1972 shanghai communique when the u s government signed with china to the promise and commitment that the united states acknowledges that all chinese on either side of the taiwan strait maintain there is but one china and that taiwan is a part of china the united states government does not challenge that position it reaffirms its interest in a peaceful settlement of the taiwan question by the chinese themselves quietly but gradually the u s government in recent years has been giving increasing signs that it will abrogate this policy and grant to taiwan official recognition and an embassy in washington for it to do that would contrast blatantly not only against the 28 february 1972 shanghai communique but against other official u s policies for example consider crimea which the u s government demands to be a part of ukraine and not a part of russia regarding the relationship between crimea which was a province of russia between 1783 and 1954 but was then suddenly and arbitrarily transferred to ukraine by the soviet leader khruschev in 1954 and ukraine the u s government is demanding that crimea must be as khruschev arbitrarily ruled it to become in 1954 a part of ukraine the u s has this policy though public opinion polls that the u s government itself commissioned to be performed of crimeans both back in 2013 before the february 2014 u s coup in ukraine and after that coup showed overwhelming public support by crimeans for crimea s being restored to russia no longer a part of ukraine as had been the case since 1954 the u s government demands that crimeans who by more than 90 prefer to be part of russia instead of part of ukraine have no right to determine what their nationality will be but that taiwaners who might predominantly want to not be a part of china have a right to determine what their nationality will be the u s government demands that crimea be restored to ukraine which the residents of crimea had always opposed and still do but now also demands that taiwan not be restored to china which was part of china since 1683 and until japan conquered taiwan in 1895 and held it until taiwan became restored to china in 1945 perhaps america s anti china propaganda has been too successful and will bring nuclear annihilation maybe the owners of firms such as lockheed martin and of such firms as cnn the people who have effectively placed america s elected leaders into power will turn out to have been too effective at what they do right now this situation is looking like a runaway train that s heading for a catastrophic crash america s pretenses to supporting democracy in international affairs are blatantly a fraud in order to continue the u s empire that has become established after world war ii by means of numerous sanctions coups and invasions andrew bacevich the president of the quincy institute for responsible statecraft headlined on september 30th a horrible mistake recovering from america s imperial delusions and he wrote rather than picking sides in regional disputes saudi arabia vs iran israel vs hamas and hezbollah the united states should reposition itself as a genuinely honest broker rather than chiding some nations for violating human rights and giving others a pass it should hold all of them and itself to a common standard rather than flooding the region with advanced weaponry it should use its influence to reduce arms transfers rather than selectively opposing nuclear proliferation it should do so consistently across the board rather than scattering u s forces across the region it should drastically reduce the number of bases it maintains there at most two should suffice an air base in qatar and a naval facility in bahrain the same applies regarding such matters as taiwan and crimea bacevich concluded referring to the example of afghanistan that the ultimate horrible mistake to repurpose secretary of defense austin s phrase dates from the immediate aftermath of the cold war when the united states succumbed to a form of auto intoxication imperial delusions fueled by an infatuation with military power america s sanctions coups and military invasions must end as the quincy institute for responsible statecraft might say if they were more blunt what the u s government has been doing since 1945 is not responsible statecraft these sanctions coups and military invasions are instead imperial delusions just as bacevich says they are however america s billionaires whose donations determine which candidates will be politically competitive to stand even a chance of becoming nominated so as to stand a chance of then becoming elected into public offices in the u s federal government are essentially unanimous in favor of their military industrial complex which is the most profitable field for them to invest in consequently neoconservatism which is u s imperialism is bipartisanly dominant in both of america s political parties each party being financed by a different group of billionaires they are virtually unanimous for imperialism both parties voting in congress overwhelmingly for u s imperialism just about the only thing that they bipartisanly support because it s profitable for the billionaires that fund each of the two congressional parties or teams this is why joe biden continues and generally intensifies donald trump s foreign policies and why donald trump had continued and generally intensified barack obama s foreign policies all recent u s presidents have been and the present one is neoconservative or imperialist whatever else they might be for an example of this on 10 january 2021 just before the end of the trump presidency zero hedge headlined washington one china policy dead as pompeo lifts restrictions on us taiwan relations biden is simply intensifying trump s policy on china in fact all of this u s imperialism has been enormously profitable for america s billionaires and especially for the ones who have been investing the most heavily in defense industries this has been most clearly and most blatantly so after the ideological justification anti communism for the truman and eisenhower start in 1945 of the cold war finally ended in 1991 beginning at around 1990 the very same period when g h w bush started secretly instructing america s allies that the cold war would continue on the u s side even after the soviet union would break up and end its communism and end its side of the cold war the cumulative returns indexed to 1951 for the total stock market vs for industrials vs for defense which three segments had previously moved in tandem with each other sharply diverged after 1990 so that defense has since been soaring it s rising much faster than the other two sectors both of which other two sectors market and industrials continued after 1990 rising in tandem with each other that 1990 was the time when market valuations on america s armaments producers suddenly took off and left the rest of the economy ever increasingly behind it s all shown right there in that chart this means that the decision by george herbert walker bush to go for blood instead of to serve the needs of the american people has been vastly profitable for america s aristocracy interesting too is that the period after 1990 has been when the u s government became increasingly involved in invading the middle east the arms markets there were growing by leaps and bounds however after 2020 the u s and allied regimes seem to be refocusing again on great power competition including sanctions and other operations to promote regime change against any governments that don t cooperate with the u s regime s efforts against what it declares to be america s enemies they now openly equate economic competition against such targets as being something that is legitimate to be dealt with by even military means they openly presume that the military ought to serve their billionaires and no longer national meaning public defense they openly presume that imperialism is right and that it s okay for nations to fight each other in order to further enrich their respective aristocracies this is what the u s regime s support for taiwan to become an independent country is actually all about making america s billionaires even richer gideon rachman s financial times article on 12 october 2021 the moment of truth over taiwan is getting closer provides excellent documentation that the u s regime including its news media has been extremely successful in recent years at increasing the negativity of u s public opinion towards china s government and that this success has increased the pressure on u s president biden to go to war against china however rachman there failed to note that on 26 july 2021 the u s military news site defenseone had bannered concerning u s war games which had just concluded against china it failed miserably after wargaming loss joint chiefs are overhauling how the us military will fight and they reported that if the joint chiefs overhaul becomes successful it won t be until 2030 at the earliest so if there will be a u s invasion soon against china then america s armed forces will likely lose that war and the pressure upon biden to go nuclear against china will then become enormous so as to turn that defeat into victory perhaps america s anti china propaganda has been too successful and will bring nuclear annihilation maybe the owners of firms such as lockheed martin and of such firms as cnn the people who have effectively placed america s elected leaders into power will turn out to have been too effective at what they do right now this situation is looking like a runaway train that s heading for a catastrophic crash perhaps the question right now is how insistent are america s billionaires really that the u s government will become the world s first ever 100 encompassing empire dictating to each and every other nation are they willing to risk nuclear annihilation for that supreme supremacist goal after america s successful coup against ukraine in 2014 they ve been buying luxurious deep underground bunkers in preparation for this ww iii but is that really the type of world that they want to live and die in that s the question

update nov 30 2021 covanta s 5 3 billion sale to eqt infrastructure a european firm is now complete azeez mohammed a longtime energy executive has taken over as president and ceo along with a new board of directors the deal was completed with what the company described as the first ever sustainability linked leveraged buyout including two 2025 targets that must be met at risk of financial penalty the targets are for a cumulative 2 5 increase in sustainably processed waste and a 25 increase in waste recycled or reused this is part of a broader goal to increase activity in both categories 40 by 2030 eqt has also pledged to increase investments in efforts to move higher up the waste value chain upgrading equipment to reduce emissions and investing in host communities dive brief eqt infrastructure a swedish private equity firm plans to acquire all shares of covanta s stock at a price of 20 25 the transaction including net debt is valued at 5 3 billion and could close during the fourth quarter of this year pending regulatory approval according to a release eqt plans to work with covanta s team to bolster its existing portfolio of assets that service municipal and commercial customers as well as pursue numerous growth opportunities prime examples include a robust uk project pipeline and the company s environmental solutions division covanta will keep its corporate headquarters in new jersey and current management team our comprehensive analysis during the past nine months has been singularly focused on enhancing value for our shareholders eqt certainly recognizes the value we see in our business and this transaction represents an excellent outcome of our strategic review said covanta ceo michael ranger in a statement dive insight last fall the industry s largest operator of mass burn combustion facilities shook up its leadership team and kicked off a wholesale strategic review in an effort to turn around a stagnant stock price this outcome with eqt agreeing to purchase shares well above their recent values is being touted by covanta as a strong outcome for the company when that review was announced chairman of the board sam zell promised a radical change in direction and said all options would be on the table for covanta former board member ranger was brought in to lead the company for a salary of 1 with the rest of his compensation tied to stock performance and rolled out a series of initial cost cutting efforts as the review unfolded in recent months there has been discussion of covanta possibly exiting contracts closing certain facilities or divesting its environmental solutions division these options kicked off speculation about which companies could potentially acquire the latter division or whether win waste innovations the u s industry s second largest operator of waste to energy facilities might be an interested party in some form win waste was not interested in a transaction according to analyst reports if the eqt covanta deal closes the u s industry will no longer have a publicly traded company with similar assets though that could change if win waste goes public in the future as previously hinted while covanta isn t currently disclosing additional details the initial announcement indicates the company could continue in its current form for the near term eqt is excited to partner with the entire covanta team and to invest in organizational operational and digital technology initiatives that will enhance covanta s ability to provide sustainable solutions to growing waste challenges as a responsible investor eqt is committed to working with covanta on transforming and supporting the energy transition and circular economy across its local communities said alex darden a partner within eqt infrastructure s advisory team in a statement covanta s most recent quarterly earnings report in april showed signs of positive growth coming out of the pandemic as volumes recovered and operations stabilized the company raised annual guidance based on these trends and also outlined expectations for greater free cash flow as its portfolio of u k projects continues to expand in addition to an existing dublin facility covanta anticipates opening four more plants by 2024 during wasteexpo s recent investor summit chief operating officer derek veenhof said the country s waste market could potentially support another 10 plants and covanta would be in that race competing to build them veenhof said he still believed potential u s expansion might be possible in some form as disposal tip fees rise amid tightening capacity in multiple areas though without any type of notable federal driver around climate or waste management policy the company sees this as most likely to happen in select markets with supportive client relationships i think there s going to be more opportunity that comes out that market on either expansion or new build veenhof said about florida specifically asked for a possible timeline on expanding existing u s facilities or building new ones veenhof projected it could be within the next five to seven years covanta currently has 41 waste to energy facilities in north america and europe with a team of nearly 4 000 people managing an estimated 21 million tons of waste per year
for decades now the mexican government has pointed the finger for drug cartel violence at u s gun makers and the current administration even launched a 10 billion lawsuit against many but not all major firearms manufacturers earlier this year while mexican politicians may find it convenient to point blame u s gun laws for their failures to keep the drug cartels in check the simple fact is that the mexican black market for firearms and light weapons includes plenty of items that you won t find in stock at your local gun shop advertisement arms traffickers in mexico continue to sell their wares on social media networks that offer them visibility and anonymity and in complete defiance of measures taken to stop them a recent video circulating on social media shared by leading mexican journalist ciro gómez leyva features a whatsapp user showing images from a purported catalog of more than 100 weapons shared with potential customers by whatsapp the user registered as escualo offers firearms grenades and sophisticated accessories such as silencers and scopes in mexico city the advertised prices for the weapons were three times higher than those at gun stores in the united states according to gómez leyva i don t know about you but i can t remember ever seeing grenades offered for sale at a u s gun store they re apparently easy enough to find online however at least if you live south of the border and have access to social media networks like whatsapp and facebook the use of social media platforms to sell weapons is proving stubbornly difficult to resolve despite measures taken to stop it by governments and companies alike in 2016 facebook and instagram banned the sale of weapons on their platforms worldwide after being pressured to do by then us president barack obama but very quickly this ban seemed to be relatively toothless since dedicated groups continued to thrive in 2020 mexico s defence ministry announced its own crackdown on internet sales of weapons but both groups and individual sales listings for firearms continue to be commonplace on facebook in a search on the social media platform insight crime rapidly found several groups one of these venta de armas de fuego méxico was created in august 2021 had around 1 500 members and was selling beretta and ruger pistols with dozens of comments by interested buyers advertisement so why hasn t mexico s president launched a lawsuit against mark zuckerberg and facebook for fueling cartel violence zuckerberg s got much deeper pockets than the gun industry and if the platform isn t doing enough to crack down on illegal gun and grenade sales shouldn t the mexican government be just as interested in accountability for u s social media giants as it supposedly is for u s gunmakers i have a theory mexico s lawsuit isn t about stopping drug cartel violence at all for the mexican government it s primarily about avoiding responsibility for the corruption and graft fueling the cartels and for the gun control activists working with the mexican government in its lawsuit it s about trying to put american gun companies out of business the folks at insight crime believe that until the united states imposes more restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms nothing is going to change in mexico i d argue the opposite is true mexico s gun laws are the ones that need fixing not the laws in the u s clearly gun laws like restricting legal gun purchases to a single gun store in mexico city or prohibiting gun owners from owning any rifle larger than a 22 or a handgun larger than a 38 have proven to be completely and utterly worthless at stopping cartel violence it s hard to argue they re doing much at all to even prevent civilians from illegally obtaining a gun simply for self defense given the fact that anybody in mexico with enough pesos and a facebook account can find pistols rifles and even hand grenades after searching social media for a few minutes advertisement the u s firearms industry could be shut down tomorrow and the mexican drug cartels wouldn t blink an eye from central american stockpiles to illicit arms smuggled in from places like china already the source of precursor chemicals used by the cartels to manufacture heroin and fentanyl there are plenty of arms on the black market available to any cartel that wants them if the current administration in mexico is serious about combatting the cartels and i don t think it is it needs to take the fight directly to those illegal actors rather than aiding in the gun control lobby s quest to litigate american gun makers out of existence

menafn afp rising energy prices are weighing on households but the recent spike is unlikely to fuel a 1970s style oil crisis and should retreat early next year imf chief economist gita gopinath told afp tuesday energy prices collapsed last year amid the shutdowns imposed to contain the covid 19 pandemic but 2021 has brought a sharp rebound in demand as the global economy recovered gopinath said in an interview in the energy market a long cold winter followed by a particularly hot summer led to greater demand and depleted stocks especially gas reserves in europe this recovery is really quite unique she said speaking on the sidelines of the annual meetings of the international monetary fund and world bank supplies of many other goods have not been able to rebound as quickly as demand hampered in part by the spread of the delta variant of covid 19 which has made workers reluctant to return to their jobs and snarled supply chains those labor shortages are feeding into price pressures in countries like germany the united states and japan she said we are in a difficult situation where we ve seen prices go up very sharply and the key question is whether that will persist she said worst case scenario while energy prices will be elevated for the next couple of months we expect that to come back down by the end of the first quarter next year and into the second quarter she said once we get past the winter months we will be in a better place oil prices have soared in recent weeks jumping to multi year highs on monday with the benchmark wti crude jumping above 80 a barrel for the first time since october 2014 and up 30 percent since august which sent major stock markets tumbling the increase in energy prices has ramped up fears that overall inflation could tick even higher and hinder the global economic recovery gopinath cautioned that the weather will play a factor since a very severe winter could lead to broader power outages that will have a much bigger effect on the world the worst outcome would be an extremely severe winter in the northern hemisphere driving up demand for energy combined with a failure of producers including the opec to respond with increased output which could feed into headline inflation she said in february 2021 severe weather marked by polar temperatures and snowstorms caused a surge in electricity consumption in the southern united states texas with a population of nearly 29 million was unable to meet the explosion in demand and blackouts affected hundreds of thousands of homes however gopinath does not expect a crisis like the one seen in the 1970s because the world relies much less on energy relative to the size of the economy it would take a much bigger ratcheting up in gas prices for instance to have a kind of a stagflationary event she said referring to the economic crisis in the 1970s when inflation spiraled due to high oil prices as growth stalled the imf s latest forecasts call for inflation to return to pre pandemic levels by the middle of 2022 but warn of high uncertainty and upside risks in the united states
us congress averts default with stop gap debt limit hike democratic house speaker nancy pelosi is hoping for republican votes to raise the debt ceiling washington us lawmakers rubber stamped a short term bill to lift the nation s borrowing authority tuesday averting the threat of a first ever debt default but only for a few weeks the democratic controlled house of representatives voted along party lines to pass the stop gap 480 billion hike which advanced from the senate last thursday after weeks of heated debate it s about the kitchen table it s about our economy the global economy but it s also about our constitution which says the full faith and credit of the united states shall not be in doubt democratic house speaker nancy pelosi told reporters ahead of the vote democratic leaders had spent weeks underlining the havoc that a default would have wrought including the loss of six million jobs and 15 trillion in household wealth as well as increased costs for mortgages and other borrowing republicans refused to offer any of their own votes to avert the crisis and even blocked democrats who control congress from lifting the limit on their own via a simple majority but the party dropped its blockade in the senate last week ending for now an impasse that risked leaving the federal government incapable of securing and servicing loans after october 18 the new arrangement merely kicks the can down the road possibly to complicate another major funding deadline a shutdown that would begin from december 3 when the government s coffers theoretically run out the borrowing cap may yet turn out to be less pressing however economists estimate that the nation will reach the new revised debt limit sometime in mid december or early january slightly later than the december 3 date that congress originally projected the united states spends more money than it collects through taxation so it borrows money via the issuing of government bonds seen as among the world s most reliable investments around 80 years ago lawmakers introduced a limit on how much federal debt could be accrued the ceiling has been lifted dozens of times to allow the government to meet its spending commitments usually without drama and with the support of both parties and stands at around 28 trillion but republicans in both chambers of congress have this time objected saying they refuse to support biden s reckless taxing and spending plans in reality raising the debt ceiling doesn t authorize new spending it merely pays for expenses that both republican and democratic administrations have already committed to this is about meeting obligations that the government has already incurred including from the bipartisan covid relief or legislation passed last year pelosi said only three percent of the current debt that we re addressing here has been incurred during the biden years the absurdity of regularly risking a recession not to mention america s credit rating and the stability other major economies over partisan squabbling has not been lost on congress pelosi was asked tuesday about a growing clamor to take the decision on raising the debt ceiling away from the party politics on capitol hill and give it to the treasury that seems to have some appeal to both sides of the aisle because of the consequences for people of not lifting it she said many many democrats and republicans have voted against lifting the debt ceiling but never before to the extent of jeopardising it

before investing prospectuses for the funds contain this and other important information and are available free of charge by calling toll free at 1 800 621 1675 or visiting a prospectus should be read carefully before investing principal risk factors past performance is no assurance of future results investment return and market value of an investment in a fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost a fund s shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in a fund an investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency there can be no assurance that a fund s investment objectives will be achieved an investment in a fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges the risks of investing in each fund are spelled out in its prospectus shareholder report and other regulatory filings securities held by a fund as well as shares of a fund itself are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors such as general economic conditions political events regulatory or market developments changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result of the risk of loss associated with these market fluctuations in addition local regional or global events such as war acts of terrorism spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues recessions or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments such events may affect certain geographic regions countries sectors and industries more significantly than others the outbreak of the respiratory disease designated as covid 19 in december 2019 has caused significant volatility and declines in global financial markets which have caused losses for investors while the development of vaccines has slowed the spread of the virus and allowed for the resumption of reasonably normal business activity in the united states many countries continue to impose lockdown measures in an attempt to slow the spread additionally there is no guarantee that vaccines will be effective against emerging variants of the disease investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share s net asset value shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account however unlike mutual funds shares may only be redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants in very large creation redemption units if the fund s authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem fund shares may trade at a discount to the fund s net asset value and possibly face delisting one of the principal risks of investing in a fund is market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a fund fund shares or securities in general may fall in value an actively managed etf is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in managing such a fund s investment portfolio the portfolio managers management teams advisor or sub advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result first trust municipal cef income opportunity etf mcef and first trust cef income opportunity etf fcef invest in closed end funds cefs because the shares of cefs cannot be redeemed upon demand shares of many cefs will trade on exchanges at market prices rather than net asset value which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than nav premium or less than nav discount there can be no assurance that the market discount on shares of any cef purchased by mcef or fcef will ever decrease or when mcef or fcef seeks to sell shares of a cef it can receive the nav for those shares mcef and fcef may also be exposed to higher volatility in the market due to the indirect use of leverage through their investment in cefs cefs may issue senior securities in an attempt to enhance returns an underlying cef that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks including limited diversification an investment in an underlying cef concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically an underlying cef may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies an investment in an underlying cef containing securities of non u s issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting non u s issuers these risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with significant operations in emerging market countries an underlying cef may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market certain underlying cefs are subject to credit risk call risk income risk interest rate risk prepayment risk and zero coupon bond risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest and or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result credit risk is heightened for floating rate loans and high yield securities call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher yielding debt instruments held by a fund performance could be adversely impacted income risk is the risk that income from a fund s fixed income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed income securities in a fund will decline because of rising market interest rates prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected this may result in a decline in a fund s income zero coupon bond risk is the risk that zero coupon bonds may be highly volatile as interest rates rise or fall because they do not pay interest on a current basis the funds may invest in cefs and or etfs that hold high yield securities high yield securities or junk bonds are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings and therefore may be highly speculative these securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history narrowly focused operations and or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity the market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities certain of the fixed income securities held by certain underlying funds may not have the benefit of covenants which could reduce the ability of the issuer to meet its payment obligations and might result in increased credit risk income from municipal bonds held by an underlying cef could be declared taxable because of among other things unfavorable changes in tax laws adverse interpretations by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer master limited partnerships mlps are subject to certain risks including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics energy conservation taxes price controls and other regulatory policies of various governments in addition there is the risk that an mlp could be taxed as a corporation resulting in decreased returns from such mlp the use of futures options and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives these risks are heightened when an underlying cef s portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance an underlying cef s return or as a substitute for a position or security rather than solely to hedge or offset the risk of a position or security held by an underlying cef a fund s investment in cefs and etfs involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds in addition a fund s investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds income from the funds may be subject to the federal alternative minimum income tax certain underlying cefs may invest in distressed securities and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by an underlying cef or at prices approximately the value at which an underlying cef is carrying the securities on its books to the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the london interbank offered rate libor as a reference interest rate it is subject to libor risk the united kingdom s financial conduct authority which regulates libor will cease making libor available as a reference rate over a phase out period that will begin immediately after december 31 2021 the unavailability or replacement of libor may affect the value liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades any potential effects of the transition away from libor on the fund or on certain instruments in which the fund invests can be difficult to ascertain and they may vary depending on a variety of factors and they could result in losses to the fund each fund is subject to risks arising from various operational factors including but not limited to human error processing and communication errors errors of a fund s service providers counterparties or other third parties failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures although the funds and the advisor seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures there is no way to completely protect against such risks the senior loan market has seen a significant increase in loans with weaker lender protections including but not limited to limited financial maintenance covenants or in some cases no financial maintenance covenants i e covenant lite loans that would typically be included in a traditional loan agreement and general weakening of other restrictive covenants applicable to the borrower such as limitations on incurrence of additional debt restrictions on payments of junior debt or restrictions on dividends and distributions weaker lender protections such as the absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement and the inclusion of borrower favorable terms may impact recovery values and or trading levels of senior loans in the future the absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement generally means that the lender may not be able to declare a default if financial performance deteriorates this may hinder an underlying fund s ability to reprice credit risk associated with a particular borrower and reduce an underlying fund s ability to restructure a problematic loan and mitigate potential loss as a result an underlying fund s exposure to losses on investments in senior loans may be increased especially during a downturn in the credit cycle or changes in market or economic conditions the information presented is not

in world history expect to see another banking crisis soon but this time it ll be different there won t be bailouts this time because that option is now off the table back in 2018 the lawmakers behind dodd frank assured taxpayers that they wouldn t be the ones footing the bill if a banking crisis was to occur again but here s the catch while bailouts aren t an option anymore taxpayers will still be footing this bill that is because this time around bail ins will be the new tool of choice for financial watchdogs as they attempt to avert a financial crisis that is not only inevitable but imminent for context a bail in is the cancelation of bank debts owed to depositors and creditors in essence what this means is that banks have the legal right to take your hard earned money and they have this legal right because most of us have signed away these rights long ago the fact of the matter is that the majority of the united states population has willfully entrusted banks with their wealth without ever reading the fine print because if they did they would realize that they are entirely unsecured creditors to the bank and while that might not have mattered to people in the past it will when they begin to understand the magnitude of the incoming financial crisis now this brings us back to the ownership theory of money an idea i have discussed at great lengths in the past if you can t touch it you don t own it let s apply that to the fiat money system money today is generally being stored in one of two ways 1 traditional privately held money like cash gold and silver and 2 the digital form of cryptocurrency to be clear almost all money held by the banking system is already in digital form what many in the western cultures do not realize is how many people worldwide are unbanked out of the banking system altogether owning cash and hard assets is necessary for numerous reasons including the risk of electronic failures and internet blackouts cyber attacks bank closures and of course bail ins it is always important for individuals to protect their wealth and prepare for the worst possible scenario but in this economic climate it is critical we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the straw that breaks the camel s back here is the amount of currency being digitally printed by governments even as inflation continues to rise to unprecedented levels the recent news from the fed saw the estimate of average inflation climbing this year to 4 2 from 3 4 signaling that inflation is something u s citizens will just have to get used to while the u s dollar still remains the world s strongest and most trusted currency the collective trust and confidence in its value are beginning to falter and when financial watchdogs recognize that it is a real problem and need to re instill confidence in the american banking consumer a bail in will likely follow the masses are waking up the truth is becoming clearer to the world every day it is not feasible to continue to print ourselves wealthy to avoid the fact that there is something drastically wrong with the financial system and there is a real need for change today s financial system is broken with no real relationship to the physical economy and all that is physically tangible to the human experience financial markets are meant to reflect the physical economy but they miss the mark by a long shot the stock market continues to see massive gains all while the united states population experiences a horrible unemployment crisis with people struggling to secure basic necessities i founded the morgan report to provide people with the resources they need to make the right decisions that will help them build and preserve their wealth and throughout it all i have never stopped to doubt the massive role that monetary metals like gold and silver play in enabling people to build and preserve their wealth gold has had a compounded annual growth rate of 10 per year from the year 2000 to the present day clearly displaying gold s function as an effective wealth preservation tool for the past twenty years as for silver it has not kept up with gold yet it has an annual compounded growth rate of about 9 not too bad for a metal that is so unloved if the gold price is to reach 10 000 it ll be a direct consequence of the demise of the current financial system meanwhile with silver it s a different story it s more volatile and it s a much smaller market but that s a good thing at least for silver stackers because in the event of an explosion in the gold price silver will follow course even faster as people rush to protect their wealth these were only some of the thoughts i shared when i joined daniela cambone of stansberry research to discuss the looming financial crisis you can watch the full episode here
menafn asia times the 1980s called they want their economy back the s p 500 has lost about 4 since its september 2 peak and the nasdaq 100 has lost about 6 it probably will get a lot worse every survey of inflation shows that price pressures on businesses have jumped to levels last seen in 1980 at the tail end of the great stagflation today it was the national federation of independent business which reported that price pressures on businesses as well as plans to raise prices had reached levels not seen in more than forty years it s going to get worse fast two fifths of the us consumer price index reflects the cost of shelter and rents are rising at the fastest rate in history by 15 during the year through september according to the internet broker apartmentlist com the united states has never seen numbers like this they stem from a national shortage of apartments and the lowest vacancy rate on record at around 6 because leases take time to expire the huge increases in rents reported by private surveys haven t turned up in the government data yet over the next two years though a 15 jump in rents will work its way through the official data that means an additional 3 percentage points of inflation is built into the numbers for the next two years ensuring that the inflation rate will be well in excess of 5 auto prices the second largest item in the household budget are still rising at nearly 30 a year for used vehicles according to the industry standard manheim index we re not counting energy prices which will rise along the price of oil and we re not counting the innumerable items lost in the shuffle of global supply chains from smartphones some apple items have six week wait to consumer electronics to auto parts wages are rising the atlanta federal reserve s wage tracker puts year on year wage growth at 4 up from 3 just three months ago but with inflation raging in the 5 to 10 area american households will be hurting more than 50 of respondents to the national federation of independent business september survey said that jobs are hard to fill by far the highest proportion in history in other words even a 4 pay increase isn t enough to lure workers back into the workforce that means weaker supply chains more production delays and even higher inflation at some point the federal reserve will have to do what it has done so many times in its depressing past namely tighten monetary policy and reduce demand if people can t get credit they won t buy things at higher prices but that means a much slower economy lower profits and a nasty shakeout in the stock market

advertisement air freight bookings have soared by 70 per cent in the uk this month according to a cargo group while firms bid to bypass ports chaos and get goods into the uk in time for christmas amid the ongoing delivery crisis air charter service which sees firms hire planes to move goods said demand had skyrocketed this month having already surged during the pandemic group cargo director dan morgan evans predicted pre bookings for october to be around double that of the same period last year in addition to pre bookings in the uk increasing by 20 per cent year on year in september it comes as millions of britons were today urged to order gifts for christmas immediately to avoid disappointment because of delays at the uk s choked ports where containers are stacked high and ships are being diverted experts warn the crisis will not be solved until well into 2022 and will lead to gaps on the shelves throughout the festive period the most popular toys games consoles smart phones white goods as well as chocolate and even christmas trees are predicted to be in short supply this december britain s busiest container port felixstowe has become severely congested to the point maersk the world s largest container shipping company is diverting its big vessels away from the uk to rotterdam in the netherlands containers at the suffolk port are taking up to ten days to be put on to trucks instead of the usual three days while big ships are having to wait up to a week after arriving off the uk coast to dock and unload some customers are turning to the air to solve the backlog with pre bookings for air freight services in october soaring by 70 per cent meanwhile co chairman of the conservative party oliver dowden admitted just 20 out of 300 foreign lorry drivers who have applied for temporary visas are on the roads in another blow for delivery services he said the number of workers from abroad britain has been able to attract to drive trucks has been relatively limited and said it would not solve the current crisis experts have said britain s ports are exceptionally busy but a lack of staff and hgv drivers is causing delays ships are having to wait off felixstowe right for up to a week maersk has said containers are stacking up at felixstowe britain s biggest container port in yet another pre christmas crisis emerging as it is taking ten days instead of five for each one to be moved due to a lack of hgv drivers and port staff the backlog is affecting major retailers including ikea and major food companies including nestle the world s largest food producer of coffee baby food and chocolate as well as tens of thousands of smaller uk businesses waiting for orders from all over the world industry bosses are warning that empty shelves may have to be expected not only over christmas but well into 2022 desperate steel chemicals and glass factories plead for tax breaks on soaring energy bills as boris prepares to sign off hundreds of millions of pounds in loans desperate steel chemicals and glass factories today pleaded for tax breaks to help them cope with soaring energy bills as boris johnson prepares to sign off hundreds of millions of pounds in loans to keep them afloat energy intensive businesses insisted cutting taxes and levies was more important than a bailout after an extraordinary bout of wrangling in whitehall mr johnson appears to have sided with business secretary kwasi kwarteng following his spat with chancellor rishi sunak over the need for government support a package is now due within days but rather than handouts or a price cap on industrial energy costs it is expected to come in the form of loans it is understood the support will also come with strings attached ensuring companies cannot pay out big bonuses while they are benefiting the move could raise concerns that the government is merely kicking the can down the road as firms will have to repay the costs later when energy prices have settled down the treasury is said to have been alarmed at the prospect of doling out more cash warning that demands simply increase when sectors know the chancellor is involved in the process advertisement mr morgan evans told the guardian having so many flights pre booked at the beginning of the month for cargo is completely out of the ordinary it is impossible to say how many planeloads will be brought into the uk at this stage as that partly depends on demand for aircraft elsewhere in the world it is possible there simply won t be enough aircraft able to cope with the expected last minute demand that has characterised in previous years although we are confident that there are just about enough solutions out there shipping experts have warned the crisis is hitting britain particularly hard peter wilson managing director at cory brothers shipping agency said problems affecting shipping and transport is a global issue but added the uk has a significant pinch point around hgv drivers and the demand on them to move goods from the ports he told bbc radio 4 s today programme that s a really significant issue for us here in the uk asked if it will affect christmas he said it has the potential but stressed that the supply chain will not fail in the uk adding that consumers should be sensible think ahead plan appropriately and order your christmas goods and the items that you need in a timely fashion to ensure that you have them mr wilson said there is a potential that some items may not be available nearer to christmas and when asked what items are most at risk of that he said it s a real mix we import so much into the uk by container on these shipping lines so it s from white goods to your christmas toys and we include food goods with this as well so it could be a real mixed bag of all items but i think you know christmas the toys the goods will be the significant big selling point as we build up to christmas and i think that s where we re going to get pinch points some customers are turning to the air for a way around the backlog with air freight services rocketing this month by 70 per cent meanwhile tory co chairman mr dowden admitted just 20 out of 300 foreign lorry drivers who have applied for temporary visas are on the roads in another blow for delivery services he told lbc the number of workers from abroad that britain has been able to attract to drive trucks has been relatively limited asked if it was going to solve the crisis mr dowden said no it s not and that s why it is just one of a range of measures we are taking because of course we can t just do what we have always done which is when we have a shortage get more foreign labour in we need to improve the skills in our country and we need to get more people training to be hgv drivers that s why we are streamlining the recruitment process mr dowden said there are two different elements to recruiting lorry drivers successfully applications for visas from foreign drivers and the streamlining of the testing process which happens for hgv drivers already in this country he told mr ferrari over the longer term we need to get more people driving hgvs that s why we are investing more and streamlining that process in fact it s why we have got military testers also helping us with this the best way to solve this is getting people in this country to train as hgv drivers mr ferrari asked the minister i m sorry i must have misheard you i thought you said this process had been streamlined i don t see 20 out of 300 as particularly streamlined chairman he pushed the minister on whether or not he was pleased with a roughly 7 per cent success rate mr dowden replied that number is just a reflection of the number of applicants who have been processed and have actually got their visa so we have 300 on the road i see mr ferrari replied but mr dowden clarified no we have 300 who have applied for these visas i believe the number is just over 20 who have actually received them and are on the road i expect this number to increase over time mr ferrari branded the success rate hopeless adding you d get booted out of school for that minister maersk the world s largest shipping firm says it is diverting bigger ships away from the uk due to the delays at the dockside because it is quicker to avoid felixstowe and move goods via france to dover or to smaller uk ports such as hull ikea and nestle are among the huge businesses that say their products are being snarled up due to a lack of hgv drivers that is hitting all parts of british life thousands of shipping containers at the port of felixstowe in suffolk as shipping giant maersk has said it is diverting vessels away from uk ports to unload elsewhere in europe shipping containers are unloaded at the port of felixstowe in suffolk as the global supply chain continues to be disrupted on wednesday the heads of several import firms are growing concerned as containers packed with food furniture and electronics are backing up at britain s busiest freight port predominantly due to the uk s dearth of drivers however the disruption is not limited to felixstowe with sources pointing to a bottleneck at distribution centres in the midlands causing problems as well the lack of drivers to move containers along with a surge in imports and restrictions at ports due to covid has created a perfect storm according to the times maersk boss lars mikael jensen says its largest ships are being diverted from felixstowe to rotterdam because they were waiting for up to a week off the port he has warned that retailers may need to prioritise what they ship to britain in the coming months with 10 to 15 large ships from asia arriving in the uk every week he added that he felt it would be well into 2022 before the situation began to resolve itself he said we ve taken those measures because we saw because of the big ships there is a limit to how many berths they can call in felixstowe and because its slower it took longer to handle every ship instead of wasting time waiting we progressed to the next stop and arranged that the boxes are relayed from that port rather than wait for a week and then discharge adam searle of cp transport which operates 45 lorries out of felixstowe said the situation was a nightmare he told the telegraph my guys in the office are pulling their hair out every single day and are working extended hours just to try and deliver what our customers need i m scared for the final rush to christmas pictures from felixstowe yesterday showed how it was rammed with containers piled up over the gigantic dockside as the british international freight association said it understood average dwell times for cargo at the port have nearly doubled in the last two weeks from five to 9 7 days the backlog is affecting major retailers including ikea and major food companies including nestle the world s largest food producer of coffee baby food and chocolate as well as tens of thousands of smaller uk businesses waiting for orders from all over the world some cargo ships are now being sent to european ports with containers moved into the uk via dover or on smaller ships to less busy ports such as hull and liverpool because it is now quicker to avoid felixstowe inside those containers are tens of thousands of tonnes of goods destined for shops supermarkets and households for the busy festive period britons are already buying their turkeys gammons and christmas puddings due to shortage fears consumers are seeing products in some parts of supermarkets missing due in large part to issues with deliveries and a shortage of c02 used in thousands of products more empty shelves are pictured in the meat aisle at sainsbury s in leeds with fresh fruit supplies also down on the usual the sainsbury s store in leeds shows fridges left nearly empty as shoppers stock up on their favourite products and clear the shelves this department for transport map shows how much traffic is handled by ports dealing with more than two million tonnes the department for transport has also produced a graphic showing where goods come in from split by region this map from the department of transport shows ports split by cargo group ro ro stands for roll on roll off as in lorries while lo lo stands for lift on lift off as in containers britain s labour crisis is also being blamed for the logjam with one logistics company whistleblower telling itv news anonymously i m fed up with this year on year this port never has enough staff to cope with high demand now we re hitting another peak period and all that people are talking about again is shutdowns and gridlock these volumes were forecast there have been many meetings about the run up to christmas why are we on this position there are empty shelves in every major supermarket in the country due to shortages with store managers and staff also telling mailonline that deliveries are regularly now just not turning up due to a lack of drivers one logistics industry source told mailonline there had been much discussion that the peak season is going to be tough and some suspect the shipping lines will be making plans to spread the load between felixstowe liverpool southampton and london gateway they added that decision to drop a port call is nothing new and that there was anecdotal evidence that the dwell times at other major container ports is increasing the source said the increased pressure on inland depots and uk terminals in general is down to a number of factors including the ongoing hgv driver issue equipment shortage post brexit stockpiling and an increase in domestic spending due to a lack of foreign travel as well as other matters it came as boris johnson sealed a deal to reverse the shortage of co2 for use in beer and food production but shoppers will be paying more for staples almost immediately after the us company producing 60 of the uk s supply allowed to up its prices from 200 to 1 000 per ton the price of the gas which is used to carbonate drinks preserve food and stun animals for slaughter is expected to rise five times after the country s biggest manufacturer threatened to shut its uk factories the shortage of c02 is part of a storm of crises the government is accused of failing to get a grip on including a shortage of fuel and 100 000 hgv drivers a lack of food processing workers and butchers due to the pandemic and brexit gaps in the global supply chain and the highest rise in energy prices for decades hitting households and businesses this graphic from danish logistics and shipping company dfds shows its freight shipping routes in europe and beyond dr jean paul rodrigue from hofstra university in new york put together this map showing the world s main shipping routes the pm has brought in the former boss of tesco sir dave lewis to unblock britain s choked supply chains experts have warned that delays at felixstowe are bound to cause more problems with the flow of goods into the uk with just ten weeks to go until christmas the near ten day wait for containers to clear is nearly double the average for 2020 it comes despite the port which handles 40 per cent of britain s container imports only dealing with similar import volumes to 2019 with brexit and the pandemic causing problems felixstowe is the route into britain for much almost half of all of the uk s imports especially containers carrying goods from asia via the suez canal in the past year problems caused by the pandemic led to the delay of goods such as apple airpods and sony ps5s as well as a plethora of items ordered from china by uk businesses the shortage of lorry drivers means it is having more containers arrive than are being collected creating a backlog affecting major retailers including ikea and major food companies including nestle the world s largest food producer of coffee baby food and chocolate an ikea spokesman said like many retailers we are experiencing ongoing challenges with our supply chains why is the price of coffee going up how drought and frost in brazil has hit colombian farmers forcing up the price of beans world coffee prices have soared by 55 per cent this year which is mainly due to bad weather in top producer brazil that has hit supplies drought and severe frost are estimated to have destroyed about 20 per cent of its coffee plants and production of growers in brazil has been reduced by around 25 per cent this situation has prompted coffee farmers in colombia which is the world s number two producer to default on sales clinched when prices were much lower in order to re sell the coffee at higher rates this has seen colombia fail to deliver up to one million bags of beans this year or nearly 10 per cent of the country s crop leaving exporters traders and roasters facing steep losses however it is hoped that a price spike would be temporary because the defaulting in colombia is on coffee which ultimately exists and will weigh on markets once it is re sold colombian farmers say they will deliver the coffee later this year or next but buyers are unconvinced with many opting to see losses now and write the purchases off rather than risk bigger loses several global trade houses are said to be looking at losses of up to 10 million each on undelivered coffee advertisement as a result we are experiencing low availability in some of our ranges with felixstowe nearing capacity we have faced some challenges in returning containers to the port alex veitch of logistics uk said the current issues being experienced at felixstowe port are partly due to the hgv driver shortage robert keen director general of the british international freight association said bifa has anecdotal evidence that the import dwell time for containers at some of uk s main gateways for container shipping services has gone up from 5 to 9 7days over the past two weeks but members are resigned to this being just part and parcel of the deep sea shipping world these days a port of felixstowe spokesman said the pre christmas peak combined with haulage shortages congested inland terminals poor vessel schedule reliability and the pandemic has resulted in a build up of containers at the port the vast majority of import containers are cleared for collection within minutes of arriving the backlog at felixstowe comes as the spectre of bare shelves continued to haunt supermarkets low stocks were in evidence at supermarkets including a tesco in chester an asda store in south east london and a waitrose in surrey workers at the supermarkets said deliveries had just not turned up meanwhile there were warnings of price rises affecting staple items including baked beans and coffee kraft heinz ceo miguel patricio said yesterday the firm is raising prices where necessary blaming a lack of truck drivers in the uk and labour shortages and an increase in logistics costs in the us he added if costs keep going up we re going to struggle we will simply have to increase the price for customers the price of arabica coffee has jumped almost 73 per cent in the past year to levels not seen since 2014 after 20 per cent of coffee plants in brazil the world s biggest bean exporter were killed by drought and severe frost in the past year in colombia the third largest coffee producing country in the world farmers have refused to deliver bags of beans unless they receive higher prices shoppers face higher supermarket prices as part of a deal to protect vital supplies of carbon dioxide the price of the gas which is used to carbonate drinks preserve food and stun animals for slaughter is expected to rise fivefold after the britain s biggest manufacturer threatened to shut its factories carbon dioxide is also used in surgical operations in hospitals and as a coolant for nuclear power stations ministers stepped in with a subsidy worth tens of millions to keep the supply going for three weeks and allow space for cf fertiliser which makes three fifths of the uk s supply to negotiate with its customers it has now agreed higher prices that will guarantee supply until at least january but drinks companies and food producers may be forced to pass on the huge cost increase thought to be from 200 to 1 000 per ton to their consumers industry bosses warned yesterday that three in five retailers expect to increase prices before christmas in the face of rising costs for energy ingredients and wages it comes after last month s warning from tesco chairman john allan that food inflation could hit 5 per cent this year after a long period of falling prices spiking energy prices forced a major co2 producer cf fertilisers to shut down its two uk plants last month as the government stepped in for three weeks to prop up the firm in a move that was expected to cost taxpayers tens of millions of pounds business secretary kwasi kwarteng said the new deal between cf fertiliser and its customers industrial gas companies was a more sustainable solution he added critical industries can have confidence in their supplies of co2 over the coming months without further taxpayer support the deal reflected the vital importance of this material to everything from our nuclear industry to hospitals to the food and beverage industry last week mr kwarteng temporarily exempted parts of the co2 industry from competition law so the deal could go through previously ministers had warned that companies would have to accept a large rise in co2 rates with a possible fivefold increase now co2 customers will pay cf fertilisers a set price until january which will let the company continue to operate while global gas prices remain high but with energy bills for its factories expected to rise further still there is no guarantee that the firm can keep going beyond that date and a cf spokesman said the company expected the uk government and industrial gas customers to develop robust alternative sources of co2 as part of a long term solution for meeting demand environment secretary george eustice said the government has taken decisive action in these exceptional circumstances to allow a deal to be reached which will continue the supply of co2 gavin partington director general of the british soft drinks association said we welcome news of this arrangement which provides some certainty of supply over the next few months although co2 is a only a small percentage of total cost for most soft drinks producers the significantly higher prices for supply only add to the economic pressures already facing manufacturers including the shortage of hgv drivers andrew opie director of food and sustainability at the british retail consortium added we welcome a

uschools istock washington the house voted tuesday to temporarily raise the debt ceiling by 480 billion after the senate approved the stopgap measure late last week putting off the risk of default until early december house speaker nancy pelosi called the lower chamber back to washington from a two week recess to pass the measure the bill passed along party lines tuesday evening in a 219 206 vote it now heads to president joe biden s desk for signature a default would send shockwaves to global financial markets and would likely cause credit markets worldwide to freeze up and stock markets to plunge employers around the world would likely have to begin laying off workers pelosi told reporters during a press conference on capitol hill tuesday the debt ceiling bill was packaged as part of a rule for floor debate of several other bills meaning there was not a stand alone vote on the debt limit measure the bill was considered deemed and passed once the rule was adopted pelosi staved off defections amid razor thin margins in the house she could have only afforded to lose three votes republicans for months have said that democrats would need to act on their own to raise the debt limit because they have total control of washington and are planning to pass a multi trillion social and economic package with zero input from republicans senate minority leader mitch mcconnell has said repeatedly that democrats should have to hike the debt limit because of the high cost of biden s proposed agenda democrats have argued that raising the debt limit is a bipartisan responsibility in part because it covers spending that already took place under the trump administration the house s return tuesday follows a chilling warning from treasury secretary janet yellen that if the house fails to act this week the u s is at risk of defaulting and will be unable to pay its bills yellen warned on abc s this week that mcconnell and republicans are playing with catastrophe over a pending fight to raise the debt ceiling fifty million americans wouldn t receive social security payments our troops won t know when or if they would be paid the 30 million families that receive a child tax credit those payments would be in jeopardy yellen said she said such a scenario could result in catastrophe president joe biden has said he will sign the bill into law once the house approves the measure tuesday but lawmakers will once again be at odds and at risk of fiscal calamity come december the new deadline will coincide with the end of the stop gap deal to fund the federal government pelosi indicated an off ramp on the debt ceiling drama is in the works she told reporters that the treasury department should be able to lift the debt ceiling unilaterally while congress would maintain the power to overrule an increase to the debt limit i m optimistic that these decisions have to be made pelosi said we are not a rubber stamp or a lockstep party we have a discussion and other family values that all members have brought to the table pelosi said the idea to give the treasury the authority to lift the debt limit seems to have some appeal on both sides of the aisle because of the consequences of not lifting it pelosi said she thinks the idea has merit we re just hoping that we can do this in a bipartisan way she added the speaker said she does not support raising the debt limit through the process of reconciliation which would allow democrats to pass any bill with just a simple majority the process is time consuming and democrats have firmly said they oppose using the process in a letter to biden mcconnell warned that come december he would be willing to allow the nation to default on its national debt rather than work with democrats on a resolution your lieutenants on capitol hill now have the time they claimed they lacked to address the debt ceiling through standalone reconciliation and all the tools to do it mcconnell said in the letter they cannot invent another crisis and ask for my help abc news allison pecorin contributed to this report copyright 2021 abc audio all rights reserved

away from emission producing vehicles paid parking on lincoln avenue will offer some funding as well as finding room in the budget for extending transit services to steamboat ii and brown ranch what parts of the climate action plan do you think need to be prioritized and how can they be funded increasing energy efficiency of commercial and residential buildings this involves led light bulbs insulation and energy efficient systems this can be a fairly accessible step in the energy plan next would be changing the planning and development codes to ensure that all new developments and remodels have an energy efficiency and renewable plan waste reduction strategize with restaurants to source only compostable takeout containers and drinking cups and limit all single use plastic from every food and beverage establishment collaborate waste diversion efforts of innovative regeneration colorado waste management and twin enviro the city has a goal to diversify its revenue streams and reduce its dependence on sales tax revenue how would you propose accomplishing this we need to have a serious look at the budget and our capital needs and if we don t have the funding we need to be honest with the voters on actual services and needs we need to talk to the community about that we shouldn t be putting anything forward that the voters aren t going to support having a community discussion through surveying in order to maintain a healthy budget revenues are not keeping up with expenses and we need to talk to the community about infrastructure investments there are funds available through state and federal organizations yet these funds won t sustain so figuring out creative solutions that the community supports will be imperative to balancing the city s budget what steps should the city take to ensure that there is affordable housing now and into the future if the workforce can t live here they won t stay here and simply put there aren t enough employees now we know that brown ranch annexation is a huge piece of this solution and i will do everything i can to ensure the annexation and the economic development council can work with the yampa valley housing authority and county to get this project moving we need to have policies that support long term rentals we need creative solutions for workforce housing as well as family homes and senior housing we need to incentivize long term rentals develop affordable housing for incomes that are below the threshold of spending 1 500 per month on rent alone we need to revisit the city policy tap costing homeowners highly for bathroom remodels that would allow them to offer rentals as well as the ability to install kitchenettes we need to get creative with diversifying our housing stock council has prioritized diversity equity and inclusion for a number of years what steps do you think the city should take to move forward in this space we are not recognizing the diversity that is already here the role of the government is to serve the residents we have to be committed to making the city accessible to various languages age ranges and disabilities we need to include everyone by learning what the barriers are to finding opportunities to foster partnerships and collaborations in this community if elected what would you do differently than those elected before you i bring a fresh perspective as someone who is currently facing a lot of the challenges of affordable housing employment crisis the effects of climate change and the growing wage gap i can offer creative solutions to these problems while working hard to include the underrepresented and underserved populations in the conversations i will meet individuals where they are to better understand the barriers and opportunities they face this collaboration will be the foundation of my commitment as a city council member working hard to understand what are the best interests of the people i stand for small businesses public private partnerships and taking care of our locals i will prioritize public health and safety sustainability in action and keeping our community character alive i will bring a fresh voice vision and energy to city council that fosters a community where we grow together

would in turn increase values over time he said crypto democratized the retail investor space and it s brought millions of people an opportunity to participate in the value creation of a whole new and very inclusive multi trillion dollar industry dimon has been repeatedly a harsh critic of cryptos including last month for example i don t know if it s an asset i don t know if it s foreign exchange i don t know if it s a currency dimon said at the time according to bitcoin magazine adding that regulation will constrain bitcoin but as to whether it eliminates it i have no idea and i don t personally care i am not a buyer of bitcoin related fed working proactively to issue its own digital dollar could it topple bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies a few market participants are also warry of bitcoin including bryan slusarchuk ceo of fosterville south who told gobankingrates that the crypto has attracted a new generation of investors and speculators who generally distrust fiat currency paper currencies are being printed with reckless abandon all over the world and are becoming inherently less valuable every minute so i do understand the allure of bitcoin given its artificially created scarcity he stated but as it is so new it has yet to develop a meaningful track record as a currency gold on the other hand is finite by nature and has proven itself as a reliable currency for thousands of years while many competitor currencies have come and gone only gold has proven itself as a long term store of wealth and a hedge against uncertainty and real money it s interesting to note that other wall street giants have embraced an entirely different stance toward bitcoin and cryptos recently for example last week bank of america not only launched its digital asset research with the publication of a report titled digital assets primer only the first inning but also called the digital asset sector too large to ignore citing a 2tn market value and 200mn users we believe crypto based digital assets could form an entirely new asset class bitcoin is important with a market value of 900bn but the digital asset ecosystem is so much more according to the report see nearly 40 of america s wealthiest billionaires give relatively nothing to charityfind 6 best crypto etfs to look for in 2021 bofa added in the report sent to gobankingrates that despite potential regulatory headwinds maybe tailwinds ultimately we are bullish on the long term prospects for the digital asset ecosystem as it enters the mainstream we anticipate significant growth as digital asset use cases move beyond bitcoin s store of value thesis to an industry characterized by product innovation regulatory clarity increased institutional participation and mainstream adoption bitcoin is hovering around 56 000 today according to coinmarketcap data last updated october 12 2021

washington us lawmakers rubber stamped a short term bill to lift the nation s borrowing authority tuesday averting the threat of a first ever debt default but only for a few weeks the democratic controlled house of representatives voted along party lines to pass the stop gap 480 billion hike which advanced from the senate last thursday after weeks of heated debate it s about the kitchen table it s about our economy the global economy but it s also about our constitution which says the full faith and credit of the united states shall not be in doubt democratic house speaker nancy pelosi told reporters ahead of the vote democratic leaders had spent weeks underlining the havoc that a default would have wrought including the loss of six million jobs and 15 trillion in household wealth as well as increased costs for mortgages and other borrowing republicans refused to offer any of their own votes to avert the crisis and even blocked democrats who control congress from lifting the limit on their own via a simple majority but the party dropped its blockade in the senate last week ending for now an impasse that risked leaving the federal government incapable of securing and servicing loans after october 18 the new arrangement merely kicks the can down the road possibly to complicate another major funding deadline a shutdown that would begin from december 3 when the government s coffers theoretically run out full faith and credit the borrowing cap may yet turn out to be less pressing however economists estimate that the nation will reach the new revised debt limit sometime in mid december or early january slightly later than the december 3 date that congress originally projected the united states spends more money than it collects through taxation so it borrows money via the issuing of government bonds seen as among the world s most reliable investments around 80 years ago lawmakers introduced a limit on how much federal debt could be accrued the ceiling has been lifted dozens of times to allow the government to meet its spending commitments usually without drama and with the support of both parties and stands at around 28 trillion but republicans in both chambers of congress have this time objected saying they refuse to support biden s reckless taxing and spending plans in reality raising the debt ceiling doesn t authorize new spending it merely pays for expenses that both republican and democratic administrations have already committed to this is about meeting obligations that the government has already incurred including from the bipartisan covid relief or legislation passed last year pelosi said only three percent of the current debt that we re addressing here has been incurred during the biden years the absurdity of regularly risking a recession not to mention america s credit rating and the stability other major economies over partisan squabbling has not been lost on congress pelosi was asked tuesday about a growing clamor to take the decision on raising the debt ceiling away from the party politics on capitol hill and give it to the treasury that seems to have some appeal to both sides of the aisle because of the consequences for people of not lifting it she said

in united food commercial workers union participating food industry employers tri state pension fund v zuckerberg no 404 2020 a 3d 2021 wl 3433261 del sept 23 2021 the delaware supreme court adopted a new three pronged test for determining whether pre suit demand by a stockholder plaintiff would have been futile this new test builds up and refines the aronson and rales demand futility tests for derivative claims the court s decision comes on the heels of brookfield asset mgmt v rosson where the court clarified derivative standing by overruling the oft criticized direct and derivative dual natured claim under gentile v rossette see blog article here this decision is another step toward simplifying delaware law with respect to derivative claims plaintiff petitioner in this case asserted its derivative claim in the court of chancery against members of a prior slate of directors of facebook the decision board alleging that they breached their duties of care and loyalty by improperly negotiating and approving a stock reclassification the reclassification attempted to issue a new class of non voting shares that founder mark zuckerberg could sell for his philanthropic efforts without relinquishing his voting control instead of pleading demand on the facebook board the demand board to take action prior to filing suit the plaintiff petitioner chose instead to plead that such demand would have been futile because the reclassification was not a valid exercise of business judgment and a majority of the facebook board faced a substantial likelihood of liability and or lacked independence defendants moved to dismiss under court of chancery rule 23 1 the court of chancery agreed with defendants holding that the complaint did not adequately plead demand futility the delaware supreme court affirmed the lower court s decision on appeal in doing so it clarified how demand futility is determined under rule 23 1 there were two tests for demand futility under delaware law the aronson and the rales tests under the aronson test from aronson v lewis 473 a 2d 805 del 1984 which applied here the complaint must allege particularized facts that raise a reasonable doubt that 1 the directors are disinterested and independent and 2 the challenged transaction was otherwise the product of valid business judgment the court of chancery found that the second prong of this test focuses on whether a director faces a substantial likelihood of liability plaintiff petitioner here ceded that the complaint did not adequately plead bad faith so the thrust of its appeal was alleging a breach of the duty of care but because facebook has a 102 b 7 provision in its articles of incorporation exculpating directors from duty of care claims the success of plaintiff petitioner s appeal depended on the court holding that the second prong of the aronson test applies to claims where directors faced no risk of liability the court however held that exculpated care violations do not satisfy aronson s second prong the court then addressed a major issue identified by the lower court that the current demand futility framework is lacking in some key instances when a complaint challenges a decision made by the same board that would have fielded the litigation demand the aronson test applies in all other circumstances the rales test applies under the rales test from rales v blasband 634 a 2d 927 del 1993 the question is whether as of the time the complaint is filed a majority of the demand board could have properly exercised its independent and disinterested business judgment in responding to a demand but when the members of the board change between the challenged decision and the demand there is a gap in the framework this case exemplified the weakness in the demand futility framework here there were nine directors on the demand board six of them whom were on the decision board this would trigger the aronson test as the board is not comprised of a new majority but one of the six directors withheld from voting on the reclassification under a strict reading of aronson that director would not be under scrutiny because the test only focuses on the challenged decision which the director was not a part of aronson also fails to account for the new members of the demand board all of whom could be incapable of fairly considering a demand to address the weakness in the demand futility tests the vice chancellor combined the two tests into a three prong test asking i whether the director received a material personal benefit from the alleged misconduct that is the subject of the litigation demand ii whether the director would face a substantial likelihood of liability on any of the claims that are the subject of the litigation demand and iii whether the director lacks independence from someone who received a material personal benefit from the alleged misconduct that is the subject of the litigation demand or who would face a substantial likelihood of liability on any of the claims that are the subject of the litigation demand the court agreed with this approach and adopted it as the new universal test for assessing whether demand should be excused as futile the court stated that this approach treated rales as the general demand futility test while drawing upon aronson like principles when evaluating whether particular directors face a substantial likelihood of liability as a result of having participated in the decision at issue further the refined test refocuses the inquiry on the decision regarding the litigation demand rather than the decision being challenged which in the court s view is consistent with the spirit of aronson and rales note that this decision does not overturn aronson or rales as the court clarifies that cases properly construing the two tests and their progeny remain good law

united nations india has emerged from a very tough second wave of covid 19 gita gopinath the international monetary fund s imf chief economist said tuesday at the release of the flagship report that showed india continuing to be the world s fastest growing major economy clocking a growth rate of 9 5 per cent this fiscal year and 8 5 per cent in the next the imf s world economic outlook weo report kept the gross domestic product gdp growth projections it had made in july while india was in the grip of covid 19 s second wave and had cut by 3 per cent its forecast of 12 5 per cent made in april before the pandemic s resurgence briefing reporters at the release of the report in washington gopinath said india came out of a very very tough second wave and that led to a big downgrade in july but we have no change india is doing well in terms of vaccination rates and that s certainly helpful she said india does however face many challenges she noted as of now you know there are many challenges that the indian economy always does face with regard to the financial market with regard to the fact that the virus has not gone yet gopinath said asked if the large fiscal deficit in india was a major concern malhar nabar the deputy division chief in imf research department said that while a medium term strategy was needed to bring it down it was still possible to meet the pressures from any future pandemic upsurge we think that there s still room to provide more support if needed if the pandemic takes a turn for the worse and to provide it in a targeted manner to the worst affected households and firms he said but going forward over the medium term it would be important to put in place credible medium term strategy to bring down the debt to gdp ratio and create space to meet the future development needs and infrastructure needs he added the weo said that india s covid battered economy had shrunk by 7 3 per cent in the last fiscal year its long term forecast for india s gdp growth is 6 1 per cent in 2026 in the weo tables china followed india with eight per cent this year and 5 6 per cent the next a reduction of 0 1 per cent for both years from the forecast made in july the uk came next with 6 8 per cent growth this year followed by france at 6 5 per cent and the us at six per cent the global economy is projected to grow 5 9 per cent in 2021 and 4 9 per cent in 2022 0 1 percentage point lower for 2021 than in the july forecast the weo said the downward revision for 2021 reflects a downgrade for advanced economies in part due to supply disruptions and for low income developing countries largely due to worsening pandemic dynamics gopinath in her foreword to the weo said the global recovery continues but the momentum has weakened hobbled by the pandemic she wrote about the global picture fuelled by the highly transmissible delta variant the recorded global covid 19 death toll has risen close to 5 million and health risks abound holding back a full return to normalcy pandemic outbreaks in critical links of global supply chains have resulted in longer than expected supply disruptions further feeding inflation in many countries overall risks to economic prospects have increased and policy trade offs have become more complex she warned the weo projected a wary outlook overall the balance of risks for global growth is tilted to the downside the major source of concern is that more aggressive sars cov 2 covid 19 variants could emerge before widespread vaccination is reached the weo which stressed the importance of vaccination said the development of covid 19 vaccines was encouraged by unprecedented public support as an example it cited the help in scaling up manufacturing by the indian government grants to vaccine producers the imf forecast is more than a per cent higher than the world bank s estimate of 8 3 per cent for this fiscal year which puts it behind china s 8 5 per cent growth this year the bank s regional economic update released last week said india s gdp growth is expected to moderate to 7 5 per cent next year and 6 5 per cent in 2023 24 the united nations which made its forecast for the calendar year rather than the fiscal said it expected india s economy to grow by 7 5 per cent this calendar year and rebound to 10 5 per cent next year india s consumer price index is expected to grow by 5 6 per cent this fiscal year and by 4 9 the next according to the imf s weo the maldives whose economy shrunk by 32 per cent last year is expected to rebound to 18 9 per cent this year and moderate to13 2 per cent next year the weo

per cent the next year according to the weo sri lanka s growth is forecast to grow 3 6 this year and moderate to 3 3 next year while nepal s gdp is expected to grow by 1 8 per cent this year and then

washington reuters us central bankers broadly agree they can soon begin reducing their support for the economy as early as next month but are divided over how much of a threat high inflation poses and more importantly what they might need to do about it with the economy set to grow this year at its fastest pace in decades inflation riding well above the fed s comfort zone and the labour market much healed from the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic most policymakers believe it is prudent to start cutting back the us 120 billion s 162 8 billion in monthly asset purchases the central bank has been making to spur the economic recovery fed chair jerome powell said last month that as long as the job market data is decent he expects the wind down of the fed s purchases of treasuries and mortgage backed securities to start next month and be complete by the middle of next year after a government report on friday showing us employers added 194 000 jobs last month well below many economists expectations fed vice chair richard clarida on tuesday oct 12 said the employment guidepost was all but met though he did not point specifically to november for the start of the tapering of the asset purchases he repeated mr powell s forecast for the timing of the end of the taper and the readout of september s policy meeting will likely cement that view most analysts expect the coming taper to be steady and boring as philadelphia fed president patrick harper has put it any hint in the minutes or elsewhere that policymakers plan to speed up or slow down the taper based on the pace of the economic recovery would mark a departure from the predictable pattern the fed followed in 2014 when it tapered the bond purchases made to nurse the economy back to health after the 2007 2009 financial crisis and recession and would be a surprise to markets more likely perhaps is that the minutes deliver new colour around policymakers inflation outlooks and particularly whether any feel they will ultimately have to sacrifice their goal of reaching full employment in order to prevent inflation from spiraling upward economic projections released alongside the fed s policy statement last month showed the central bank projecting inflation to run at 4 2 per cent this year more than double its flexible 2 per cent target unpleasant situation mr powell and mr clarida have played down that possibility even though fed policymakers are about evenly divided over whether they believe interest rate hikes will need to start next year or in 2023 their projections are entirely consistent with the fed s policy framework that aims at attaining both maximum employment and stable inflation mr clarida said on tuesday
