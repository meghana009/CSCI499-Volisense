commentary sampling techniques core samples are obtained from core drilling hq and nq diameter diamond core was drilled on a 3 4 5m or 6m run core was cut using an automatic core cutter and half core sampled at 2m intervals cover sequences were not sampled drilling techniques core drilling was advanced with hq3 hq nq3 and nq diameter coring configuration core from inclined drill holes are oriented on 3 4 5m or 6m runs using an electronic core orientation tool reflex actiii at the end of each run the bottom of hole position is marked by the driller which is later transferred to the whole drill core run length with a bottom of hole reference line drill sample recovery core recovery is systematically recorded from the commencement of coring to end of hole by reconciling against driller s depth blocks in each core tray with data recorded in the database drillers depth blocks provided the depth interval of core recovered and interval of core drilled core recoveries were typically 100

was conducted at the red chris mine digital data logging was captured validated and stored in an acquire database all drill cores were photographed prior to cutting and or sampling the core sub sampling techniques and sample preparation sampling sample preparation and quality control protocols are considered appropriate for the material being sampled core was cut and sampled at the red chris mine core processing facility half core samples were collected in plastic bags together with pre numbered sample tags and grouped in wood crates for dispatch to the laboratory sample weights typically varied from 5 to 10kg sample sizes are considered appropriate for the style of mineralisation drill core samples were freighted by road to the laboratory sample preparation was conducted at the independent iso 9001 certified and iso 17025 accredited bureau veritas commodities canada ltd laboratory vancouver bureau veritas samples were dried at 650c and crushed to 95 passing 4 75 mm and the split to obtain up to 1kg sub sample which was pulverised using lm2 to produce a pulped product with the minimum standard of 95 passing 106µm duplicate samples were collected from crush and pulp samples at a rate of 1 20 duplicate results show an acceptable level of variability for the material sampled and style of mineralisation periodic size checks 1 20 for crush and pulp samples and sample weights are provided by the laboratory and recorded in the acquire database quality of assay data and laboratory tests assaying of drill core samples was conducted at bureau veritas all samples were assayed for 59 elements using a 4 acid digestion followed by icp aes icp ms determination method ma250 gold analyses were determined by 50g fire assay with icp es finish method fa350 carbon and sulphur were determined by leco method tc000 and mercury using aqua regia digestion followed by icp es ms determination method aq200 sampling and assaying quality control procedures consisted of inclusion of certified reference material crms coarse residue and pulp duplicates with each batch at least 1 20 assays of quality control samples were compared with reference samples in the acquire database and verified as acceptable prior to use of data from analysed batches laboratory quality control data including laboratory standards blanks duplicates repeats and grind size results are captured in acquire database and assessed for accuracy and precision for recent data due to the limited extent of the drilling program to date extended quality control programs are yet to be undertaken whereby pulped samples will be submitted to an umpire laboratory and combined with more extensive re submission programs analysis of the available quality control sample assay results indicates that an acceptable level of accuracy and precision has been achieved and the database contains no analytical data that has been numerically manipulated the assaying techniques and quality control protocols used are considered appropriate for the data to be used for reporting exploration drilling results verification of sampling and assaying sampling intervals defined by the geologist are electronically assigned sample identification numbers prior to core cutting corresponding sample numbers matching pre labelled sample tags are assigned to each interval all sampling and assay information were stored in a secure acquire database with restricted access electronically generated sample submission forms providing the sample identification number accompany each submission to the

duplicate results show an acceptable level of variability for the material sampled and style of mineralisation periodic size checks 1 20 for crush and pulp samples and sample weights are provided by the laboratory and recorded in the acquire database quality of assay data and laboratory tests assaying of drill core samples was conducted at intertek all samples were assayed for 48 elements using a 4 acid digestion followed by icp aes icp ms determination method 4a ms907 which is considered to provide a total assay for copper gold analyses were determined by 50g fire assay with aas finish method fa50n aa which is considered to provide a total assay for gold sampling and assaying quality control procedures consisted of inclusion of certified reference material crms coarse residue and pulp duplicates with each batch at least 1 20 assays of quality control samples were compared with reference samples in acquire database and verified as acceptable prior to use of data from analysed batches laboratory quality control data including laboratory standards blanks duplicates repeats and grind size results are captured in the acquire database and assessed for accuracy and precision for recent data extended quality control programs including pulp samples submitted to an umpire laboratory and combined with more extensive re submission programs have been completed analysis of the available quality control sample assay results indicates that an acceptable level of accuracy and precision has been achieved and the database contains no analytical data that has been numerically manipulated the assaying techniques and quality control protocols used are considered appropriate for the data to be used for reporting exploration drilling results verification of sampling and assaying sampling intervals defined by the geologist are electronically assigned sample identification numbers prior to core cutting corresponding sample numbers matching pre labelled calico bags are assigned to each interval all sampling and assay information were stored in a secure acquire database with restricted access electronically generated sample submission forms providing the sample identification number accompany each submission to the laboratory assay results from the laboratory with corresponding sample identification are loaded directly into the acquire database assessment of reported significant assay intervals was verified by re logging of diamond drill core intervals and assessment of high resolution core photography the verification of significant intersections has been completed by company personnel and the competent person qualified person no adjustments are made to assay data and no twinned holes have been completed there are no currently known drilling sampling recovery or other factors that could materially affect the accuracy or reliability of the data location of data points drill collar locations were surveyed using a differential gps with gnss with a stated accuracy of 0 5m for all drill holes reported drill rig alignment was attained using an electronic azimuth aligner downhole survey was collected at 6 12m intervals in the cover sequence and every 6 to 30m in diamond drill core segments of the drill hole using single shot axis mining champ gyro the single shot surveys have been validated using continuous survey to surface axis mining champ along with a selection of drill holes re surveyed by an external survey contactor using a devigyro tool confirming sufficient accuracy for downhole spatial recording a lidar survey was completed over the project area in nov 2019 which was used to prepare a dem topographic model for the project with a spatial accuracy of 0 1m vertical and 0 3m horizontal the topography is generally low relief to flat elevation within the dune corridors in ranges between 250 265m australian height datum ahd steepening to the southeast all collar coordinates are provided in the geocentric datum of australian gda20 zone 51 all relative depth information is reported in ahd 5000m data spacing and distribution within the south east crescent and breccia zone drill hole spacing ranges from 50 to 100m to 50 by 50m within the resource extents outside the initial resource boundary drill hole spacing ranges from 50 to 200m in lateral extent within the breccia zone over an area of 2km2 the data spacing is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity significant assay intercepts remain open further drilling is required to determine the extent of currently defined mineralisation no sample compositing is applied to samples drilling intersects mineralisation at various angles orientation of data in relation to geological structure drill holes exploring the extents of the havieron mineral system intersect moderately dipping carbonate and siliclastic sedimentary facies mineralised breccia and sub vertical intrusive lithologies geological modelling has been interpreted from historic and newcrest drill holes variable brecciation alteration and sulphide mineralisation is observed with a footprint with dimensions of 650m x 350m trending in a north west orientation and over 1000m in vertical extent below cover the subvertical southeast high grade arcuate crescent sulphide zone has an average thickness of 20m and has been defined over a strike length of up to 550m and extended to over 700m in vertical extent below cover drilling direction is oriented to intersect the steeply dipping high grade sulphide mineralisation zones at an intersection angle of greater than 40 degrees the drilled length of reported intersections is typically greater than true width of mineralisation sample security the security of samples is controlled by tracking samples from drill rig to database drill core was delivered from the drill rig to the havieron core yard every shift on completion of geological and geotechnical logging core processing was completed by newcrest personnel at the havieron facility high resolution core photography and cutting of drill core was undertaken at the havieron core processing facilities samples were freighted in sealed bags by air and road to the laboratory and in the custody of newcrest representatives sample numbers are generated directly from the database all samples are collected in pre numbered calico bags verification of sample numbers and identification is conducted by the laboratory on receipt of samples and sample receipt advise issued to newcrest details of all sample movement are recorded in a database table dates hole id sample ranges and the analytical suite requested are recorded with the dispatch of samples to analytical services any discrepancies logged at the receipt of samples into the analytical services are validated audits or reviews internal reviews of core handling sample preparation and assays laboratories were conducted on a regular basis by both project personnel and owner representatives in the competent person s opinion the sample preparation security and analytical procedures are consistent with current industry standards and are entirely appropriate and acceptable for the styles of mineralisation identified and will be appropriate for use in the reporting of exploration results and mineral resource estimates there are no identified drilling sampling or recovery

website drilling has defined an intrusion related mineral system with evidence of breccia and massive sulphide hosted higher grade gold copper mineralisation geology the havieron project is located within the north western exposure of the palaeo proterozoic to neoproterozoic paterson orogen formerly paterson province 45 km east of telfer the yeneena supergroup hosts the havieron prospect and consists of a 9km thick sequence of marine sedimentary rocks and is entirely overlain by approximately 420m of phanerozoic sediments of the paterson formation and quaternary aeolian sediments gold and copper mineralisation at havieron consist of breccia vein and massive sulphide replacement gold and copper mineralisation typical of intrusion related and skarn styles of mineralisation mineralisation is hosted by metasedimentary rocks meta sandstones meta siltstones and meta carbonate and intrusive rocks of an undetermined age the main mineral assemblage contains well developed pyrrhotite chalcopyrite and pyrite sulphide mineral assemblages as breccia and vein infill and massive sulphide lenses the main mineralisation event is associated with amphibole carbonate biotite sericite

atn reports third quarter 2021 results 2021 10 27 globenewswire2021 10 27 alaska communications acquisition drives 49 year on year consolidated revenue growth international telecom continues to generate subscriber and revenue growth alaska communications performed in line with expectations expanding domestic network reach to grow high speed data revenue and customersâ beverly mass oct 27 2021 globe newswire atn international inc nasdaq atni today reported results for the third quarter and nine months ended september 30 2021 business review and outlook michael prior chief executive officer commented â œthe alaska communications acquisition has significantly increased the scale of atnâ s domestic operations and has opened additional opportunities for us to pursue growth initiatives that also provide significant social and economic benefits by bringing high speed connectivity to the communities we serve â œthe addition of approximately ten weeks of alaska communications operations was the major driver of a nearly three fold increase in our us telecom segment revenues with fiber based services to enterprise government wholesale and residential customers representing the majority of that growth â higher firstnet construction revenues also contributed to the increase additionally we experienced growth in our legacy domestic business in the western u s due to higher consumer broadband revenues following our late 2020 build out of rural broadband networks under various government programs and public private initiatives â atn now owns and operates approximately 6 000 fiber route miles in the u s and with more federal government funding becoming available to help connect rural communities to true high speed data access we have allocated additional resources to capture opportunities to build out rural middle mile fiber networks and fiber and fixed wireless connections this is a priority for the strategic transformation of our legacy domestic wholesale roaming business into a broader fiber based communications platform and it is in keeping with our corporate mission of bringing reliable and affordable access to the modern communications infrastructure to historically underbuilt areas â œinternational telecom revenue increased in the third quarter reflecting the positive performance of several of our key international markets where upgrades and expansions of our networks and effective marketing campaigns have resulted in continued subscriber growth we are pleased with the third quarter and year to date revenue performance of this segment and see additional growth opportunities on the horizon higher expense levels in part reflected a difficult comparison with the unusually low operating costs we had during the pandemic and increased regulatory costs â while supply chain disruptions have not had a material effect on our business year to date we continue to monitor this potential given its impact on other communications infrastructure and technology companies â œlooking ahead we see opportunities to drive additional revenue growth in both of our business segments we are continuing to expand our networks and offerings in several of our international telecom markets â â where we see the potential to increase penetration and market share â domestically in addition to rural network buildouts in the â œlower 48â we continue to upgrade and extend our fiber network in alaska adding wholesale enterprise and residential connections to grow our customer base utilizing that expanded network reach and capability â mr prior noted third quarter 2021 results third quarter 2021 consolidated revenues of 166 8 million were up 49 compared to the prior year quarterâ s revenue of 111 7 million â the company closed the acquisition of alaska communications in late july which contributed 46 8 million to third quarter revenues â the third quarter of 2021 had an operating loss of 1 0 million and adjusted ebitda2 of 36 8 million compared with the prior year quarterâ s operating income of 9 6 million and adjusted ebitda2 of 31 2 million â the decrease in operating income was mostly the result of increased transaction related fees and amortization expenses from the consolidation of alaska communications results â the adjusted ebitda2 increase was due to the addition of 10 6 million from alaska communications partially offset by a net decline in the international telecom segment â the net loss attributable to atnâ s stockholders for the third quarter was 2 6 million and a 0 22 loss per share compared with the prior year periodâ s net income attributable to atnâ s stockholders of 2 7 million or 0 17 income per diluted share third quarter 2021 operating highlights the company

and managed it services including data voice and video services from the companyâ s fixed and mobile network operations in bermuda and the caribbean and include direct government payments as part of the fcc high cost support program in the usvi â international telecom revenues were 85 3 million for the quarter a 3 increase year on year mainly due to subscriber and arpu growth which drove increases in mobility and fixed revenues in multiple markets partially offset by the loss of 1 4 million in fcc high cost support in the usvi â carrier services revenues also increased as travel and tourism increased in the u s virgin islands â operating expenses increased in most of the markets compared with the prior year as operating expenses returned to normalized pre pandemic levels and due to the introduction of higher regulatory fees in guyana earlier in 2021 â as a result when compared with the prior year quarter operating income of 13 2 million and adjusted ebitda2 of 26 9 million decreased by 18 and 10 respectively for the third quarter of 2021 us telecom us telecom revenues consist of broadband carrier services managed it services fixed enterprise and mobile retail revenues from the companyâ s networks and operations in alaska and in the western united states including various government programs such as caf ii e rate lifeline and rural healthcare support programs â us telecom segment revenues were 81 5 million in the quarter up 53 4 million from the prior year period â this increase was mostly due to the addition of 46 8 million of revenues from alaska communications as well as 6 0 million of increased construction revenue related to the firstnet contract build â adjusted ebitda2 for the quarter was 16 4 million compared to the prior year periodâ s adjusted ebitda2 of 7 9 million â this increase was driven by the addition of the alaska communications results of 10 6 million partially offset by approximately 2 0 million of additional expenses in our private network operations for the segment the current periodâ s operating loss was 9 8 million compared to the prior yearâ s operating income of 2 2 million primarily due to 8 8 million of transaction related fees and amortization expense related to the alaska communications acquisition and the additional expenses in our private network operations â by the end of the third quarter of 2021 the company had completed and activated approximately 50 of the total sites related to the network build portion of its firstnet agreement and expects to complete an additional 15 of the total

revolving facility â net cash provided by operating activities was 47 7 million for the nine months ended september 30 2021 compared with 71 6 million for the prior year period â the decline in operating cash flow compared with the prior year is mostly the result of a current year decrease in operating income and a 25 7 million increase in the firstnet construction customer receivable â â for the nine months ended september 30 2021 the company used net cash of 50 3 million for investing and financing activities compared to 97 6 million for the prior year period â the net use of cash

in the age of covid businesses have been forced to pivot it s safe to say we are all sick of hearing the overused pivot word but there is a reason it has been used so frequently it s pretty accurate for nearly two years companies have taken everything they once knew flipped it upside down and reimagined how they do business while the hardships businesses have faced have been immense within the covid narrative there have also been stories of perseverance and success each year albuquerque business first celebrates some of the area s most successful businesses via its fastest growing companies awards in non covid times growth of any kind is an incredible accomplishment and certainly one worth celebrating in covid times that achievement is amplified after a call for nominations from the public abf s accounting partner redw then took the list of nominated companies and audited each company s revenue for the past three years those revenue figures were then tabulated to create a percentage that showed the amount by which each business grew over that three year period to be eligible companies had to be privately held and based in new mexico companies are broken into three categories based on revenue size those categories include companies with less than 5 million in revenue companies with 5 million to 10 million in revenue companies with more than 10 million in revenue a ceremony honoring the companies was held oct 21 at sandia resort casino each company s exact rank in its respective category was revealed at the event in the coming days abf will provide an in depth look online at the top companies in each category as well as list what every honoree attributes as their secret to success whatever the reason one thing is certain new mexico is all the better for their presence meagan nichols everest cannabis co is planning for the future and that s what has made the company so successful this past year with the sale of recreational cannabis set to start in 2022 everest is making moves one of those moves was a recent rebrand the company was formerly known as everest apothecary it was a name that coo trishelle kirk said resonated with what the company was known for being a leader in medical cannabis now with recreational being added the name change expands the company s reach we really wanted to make it more of a lifestyle brand something that resonated with every gender gender identity age and background kirk said everest also recently retrofitted its website to make it easier for customers to see what products it has in stock at its locations delivery is something everest introduced last year at the height of the pandemic the company plans to continue to offer that service long into the future and that s something that makes sense for a company that not only has seven retail locations but also grows and manufacturers some of its products kirk said everest which has a vertically integrated medical cannabis license currently has two grow locations and a manufacturing facility the company manufacturers anywhere from 50 60 of its products the company has also seen increased growth on the employee front everest has 87 employees up from 50 in 2019 and with new locations coming each dispensary will employ seven to eight new workers aside from its current locations everest is looking to open another spot in santa fe and an additional three locations in the next year kirk said everest has submitted its producer application for recreational cannabis it plans to submit applications for retail and manufacturing licenses when the state s regulation and licensing department opens those up but companies don t just grow because they can it starts with the culture kirk said and right now the culture of everest is one that aims to be very much aware of the current climate it s really important to recognize that a lot of people are struggling right now both our team members and our patients how can we be part of the solution and not be part of the problem so i think that s our biggest covid lesson kirk said year company was founded 2015 number of employees 87 top local executive trishelle kirk coo company address multiple locations

given the mass exodus of major western oil companies from iraq in recent months and no sign of this reversing any time soon russia and china are in an even better position to advance their own interests in the oil and gas rich country the opportunity has in no way been diminished by iraq s elections in the last couple of weeks that left anti u s firebrand cleric moqtada al sadr in place as de facto leader alongside his sairoon marching forward coalition this has not been lost on lukoil in its approach to the supergiant west qurna 2 oil field located around 65 kilometers northwest of the southern port of basra and with roughly 14 billion barrels of reserves in place like the first sparrow of spring threats from lukoil to iraq s oil ministry over west qurna 2 and then the other way around are a regular and much anticipated feature of the oil year for seasoned market watchers and this year has been no different first was lukoil s threat to sell part or all of its stake in the field unless its terms are improved whereupon the oil ministry did nothing for a while then came the oil ministry calling lukoil s bluff and saying that it would leave if it wanted provided that a suitable buyer was found whereupon lukoil was silent for a while and now the familiar fork in the road has been reached in which the russian firm has said that if it is to stay then it wants an improvement in the deal it has at west qurna 2 both sides have their reasons for wanting a change in how the field operates and the key event that shaped all of the subsequent tactical posturing on both sides occurred in the lead up to august 2017 when lukoil announced that it was to dramatically increase output at west qurna 2 at that time the west qurna 2 field had been steadily producing around 400 000 barrels per day bpd about nine percent of iraq s total oil production for some considerable time under the operation of lukoil which held a 75 percent stake in the field the remainder being held by iraq s state run north oil company the development plan was to increase crude oil production to 480 000 bpd in phase 2 and then to add another 650 000 bpd to the total in phase 3 which would focus on the deeper yamama formation the ultimate target of 1 13 million bpd might appear high to some although the original target was 1 2 million bpd but it is entirely justified both by u s geologists when they were on the ground during the u s occupation and by various international oil companies iocs the problem even back then though from lukoil s perspective was that it believed the level of remuneration it was receiving per barrel drilled was too low by that point the russian company had already spent at least us 8 billion on developing the field according to its spokesmen but was only being compensated us 1 15 per barrel of oil recovered this was the lowest rate being paid to any ioc in iraq at that time and was dwarfed by the us 5 50 per barrel being paid to gazpromneft in its development of the badra oil field related oil and gas stocks are popular once again lukoil was aware that on its own the west qurna 2 development would allow it to double its overseas production once phase 3 kicked in lukoil s total hydrocarbon production globally was 2 2 million bpd in 2016 however it was also aware that even with iraq s world low lifting cost per barrel of oil along with iran and saudi arabia of us 1 2 per barrel without capital expenditure included and us 4 6 per barrel including capital expenditure its profit per barrel based on recovery compensation alone was extremely slim also grating on the russian company was that because of the ongoing cash crunch in iraq the oil ministry still owed lukoil around us 6 billion for various unpaid compensation on recovered barrels and other development payments this said back in august 2017 lukoil was assured that the oil ministry would pay the us 6 billion that it owed the company expeditiously and that a higher compensation rate per barrel would be looked into as soon as was feasible in addition the oil ministry would allow the russian company more leeway in its application of the terms of the development and production service contract for the west qurna phase 2 contract area signed by lukoil on 31 january 2010 this would allow for a more spread out field investment development program by lukoil over the length of the contract which had also been extended from 20 to 25 years so lowering the average cost per year to lukoil anyhow the russian company for its part would invest at least us 1 5 billion in the oil field in the following 12 months with a view to raising production from the 400 000 bpd level to 1 13 million bpd it was agreed more problems from the russians perspective began almost as soon as the new agreement had been made with delays in the re payment of the us 6 billion owed to it by the oil ministry and in the less rigorous application of the development investment program as well given this slippage on the deal by the oil ministry as far as lukoil was concerned the russian company decided not to pump at the full volume that it knew it could at that point as it believed with some justification that it was not going to be paid for any extra efforts that it made from the oil ministry s perspective though its own view of lukoil s activities markedly changed in november 2017 just three months after the agreement of august when it found out that not only had lukoil hit 650 000 bpd production over various extended periods in the previous two months but that it could sustain production of at least 635 000 bpd for the foreseeable future but was choosing not to do so for the economic reasons outlined above at that point the oil ministry agreed to extend the timeframe of the contract to 25 30 years effectively reducing the daily cost of capital per barrel of oil recovered and to allow lukoil the option of increasing its stake from the present 75 percent to 80 percent a source who works closely with iraq s oil ministry exclusively told oilprice com in return lukoil agreed to invest an extra us 1 4 billion in the short term and a further us 3 6 billion down the line depending on variables including opec quotas and the continued development of export capacity in the south he said related alaska s oil renaissance stumbles despite rise in crude prices once again though another year or so went by with iraq s oil ministry unwilling and or unable to meet its obligations under the terms of the august 2017 agreement and the november 2017 agreement this prompted a visit in february 2019 to iraq s then prime minister adil abd al mahdi of russian president vladimir putin s special envoy to the middle east and africa mikhail bogdanov given that on the one hand al mahdi was facing putin s man in the middle east and on the other he knew full well that he would have to account for whatever was said to the real leader of iraq moqtada al sadr after the meeting had ended it is little wonder that the meeting was very tense according to the iraq source however russia wanted to safeguard what it had in southern iraq to add to the central role that rosneft had in kurdistan and to prevent the americans from pushing it out and west qurna 2 allowed it to show good faith to baghdad so the agreements of 2017 were reiterated and that is where the matter was left at that stage the iraq source told oilprice com what has changed from the basic stand off position was the recent withdrawal of several iocs from iraq as highlighted by oilprice com and the lack of change in real leadership in iraq as a result of the recent elections some of lukoil s senior management think that the time is right once again to try to force the oil ministry into making good on its previous promises to increase its per barrel compensation on the field said the iraq source even more specifically according to a senior oil and gas industry source in moscow spoken

us president joe biden pictured at a campaign event in arlington virginia on october 26 2021 is keen to take some big wins with him to europe washington afp the white house and democratic congressional leaders raced wednesday to resolve lingering disputes on their giant social spending plan before president joe biden flies overseas although several lawmakers signaled a deal by day s end looked impossible house speaker nancy pelosi wrote to colleagues that biden s domestic agenda was moving closer to passing but a key centrist senator later dismissed a new tax on billionaires to help pay for the 1 5 2 trillion package as a non starter biden hopes to use passage of the build back better act as evidence of the united states leading the world on global warming and other issues as he heads to a g20 summit in rome and united nations climate gathering in glasgow the president was mulling a galvanizing visit to capitol hill later in the day and white house aides were assessing the situation hour by hour his spokeswoman jen psaki told reporters but pelosi the top house democrat has given lawmakers until at least the end of thursday to ready their final language on the historic bill targeting climate change child care pre school education and health care the mammoth package is crucial to another big win biden had hoped to secure before jetting off to rome a 1 2 trillion infrastructure bill to transform us roads bridges and broadband access the bills are linked because the democratic left flank in the house is withholding its green light on the senate passed infrastructure legislation until progressives have seen a final text on build back better their top priority 50 50 senate weeks of negotiations between the party s left and center have yet to produce consensus even on the price tag of the social welfare package let alone the provisions it should include or how to pay for it biden has no votes to spare in the 50 50 split senate so any democrat can tank any bill throwing biden s domestic agenda into disarray biden met tuesday evening with moderate senators kyrsten sinema and joe manchin both holdouts on build back better who have spent weeks chiseling the original 3 5 trillion top line to somewhere nearer half that there was no significant breakthrough but a white house official said the trio made progress on top of what has been accomplished in recent days and the senators were in follow up meetings wednesday with biden aides the speaker has said that 90 percent of the build back better act is done and we re just waiting on the final agreement from the two senators who haven t agreed on everything yet and we need them pramila jayapal leader of the 96 member congressional progressive caucus told msnbc house leader steny hoyer pelosi s deputy echoed reassurances from democratic senate chief chuck schumer and the white house that a deal on the social spending package was close but ruled out an infrastructure vote wednesday democrats have yet to reach consensus on a slew of issues in the build back better package including taxes paid family leave prescription drug pricing and expanding health care coverage for the elderly and low income americans not nailed down there s just huge pieces of this that are not nailed down so each time i hear well it s almost done i don t know what the hell people are talking about democratic senator jeff merkley told nbc in a last second scramble to pay for biden s plans senate democrats proposed a billionaires tax that would target roughly 700 tycoons with over 1 billion in assets or 100 million in income for three consecutive years the collective fortune of america s billionaires soared by 70 percent during the pandemic according to the liberal leaning institute for policy studies from almost 3 trillion in march 2020 to over 5 trillion by october 15 this year under the proposal according to us media billionaires would begin paying capital gains taxes of 23 8 percent on the appreciation in value of tradeable assets such as stocks and bonds regardless of whether they are sold the tax would bring in an estimated 300 billion around a fifth of the expected compromise cost of build back better but the idea appeared dead on arrival as sinema and richie neal the chairman of the powerful house ways and means committee indicated they were against it and manchin explicitly dismissed it as divisive there were signs of light however with tentative agreement among the democrats who control congress and the white house on a minimum 15 percent corporate tax on the profits of companies clearing more than 1 billion a year nearly 200 companies would be subject to the tax another key revenue raiser that could generate as much as 400 billion its backers say crucially manchin and sinema are both on board

production in the september quarter was in line with our expectations and reflects the replacement and upgrade of the sag mill motor at cadia the completion of the re bricking of autoclave 4 at lihir and other planned maintenance shutdowns across the group which is consistent with prior years we expect gold and copper production to increase in the december quarter with lower planned shutdown activities and completion of the sag mill motor replacement and we remain on track to meet our fy22 guidance we were very pleased to take a significant step forward in advancing our organic growth agenda in october the findings of the red chris block cave havieron stage 1 lihir phase 14a and cadia pc1 2 pre feasibility studies demonstrate the depth and quality of our global organic growth

production for decades to come this is a genuinely exciting time for newcrest and highlights our commitment to deliver superior returns to our shareholders we look forward to providing further updates as we progress these compelling opportunities said mr biswas overview gold production was 27 lower than the prior period9 mainly driven by lower mill throughput rates at cadia lihir and telfer as foreshadowed in the june 2021 quarterly report cadia s mill capacity was limited by the replacement and upgrade of the sag mill motor resulting in lower gold production during the period mill throughput rates were also lower at lihir and telfer following planned and unplanned shutdown activities newcrest s aisc for the september 2021 quarter of 1 270 oz3 was higher than the prior period reflecting lower gold and copper sales volumes higher production stripping at lihir with increased waste mined and a lower realised copper price this was partially offset by the benefit of a weakening australian dollar against the us dollar on operating costs injury rates were higher than the prior period at cadia telfer and red chris newcrest is focused on visible safety leadership supported by

esg or environmental social and governance refers to a wide range of considerations that impact a company s performance both in the public markets and within its internal culture in the wake of the metoo and black lives matter movements employers have been called upon by their shareholders and investors to emphasize the s in esg and to take action to address sexual harassment racial injustice and other inequalities in the workplace investor initiatives prioritize diversity and inclusion most recently several investment firms have called upon corporate leadership to lead the way in making substantial changes to how companies serve their shareholders employees and communities for example in 2019 the chairman and ceo of blackrock inc a multinational investment management corporation and the world s largest asset manager issued a letter encouraging companies to align their corporate purpose with better serving all stakeholders blackrock called upon its companies to increase board diversity provide compensation in line with serving and retaining quality talent and focus on human capital management consistent with these objectives in september 2020 blackrock revealed that in the prior year alone it voted against board directors more than 1 500 times for insufficient diversity following in blackrock s footsteps other investment firms have also placed diversity initiatives at the forefront bnp paribas asset management and legal general investment management lgim have also supported diversity focused resolutions this year with lgim supporting 21 such proposals put forward by shareholders of its portfolio companies including amazon in 2020 goldman sachs announced that it would only help take public those companies with at least one diverse board member with that number increasing to two diverse members in 2021 in 2019 nasdaq launched its esg reporting guide imposing additional pressure on employers to institute policies encouraging social consciousness in the workplace although nasdaq does not require esg reporting by its rules its esg measures are encouraged in order to guide employers in finding the best route to improve operations enhance strategy broaden risk oversight or engage with new investors among the social data nasdaq emphasizes are compensation considerations such as ceo pay ratio and gender pay ratio corporate culture and employee turnover factors including gender diversity and non discrimination safety and health metrics and human rights issues pressure for internal social reform is not limited to private investors and stockholders at both the state and federal level government initiatives are taking hold several states have instituted pay transparency laws requiring that employers disclose the wage or salary range for positions at varying levels of the application process e g nevada requires employers provide the wage range to applicants who have completed an interview whereas colorado imposes a more onerous standard requiring employers disclose the wage range in any job posting other states have implemented laws protecting victims of sexual harassment including laws preventing non disclosure agreements in settlements relating to sexual harassment and other laws increasing sexual harassment claimants ability to litigate their claims at the federal level president biden has promoted his own esg agenda since his campaign for the presidency setting forth the biden agenda for women intended to further women s economic and physical security and ensure that women can fully exercise their civil rights and recently on june 26 2021 the house of representatives voted to pass the esg disclosure simplification act of 2021 h r 1187 which would require the sec to define esg metrics to guide required corporate disclosures in coming months and years employers can expect to see mounting pressure not only from the private sector but from governmental entities as well what employers are doing to meet demands with employers feeling the pressure to meet the demand for corporate social reform employers have been reevaluating their social policies procedures and priorities to rise to the challenge while such measures such as esg audits and internal reform are certainly encouraged from the investor perspective it is important that employers who commit to such initiatives show equal commitment to following through to implement changes after identifying areas for improvement although these esg efforts are still developing and evolving certain patterns and creative attempted solutions have emerged in these initiatives including increasing top down diversity from the board to management to the workforce periodic refreshing of board membership conducting pay equity audits increasing training on preventing responding to and investigating claims of workplace harassment improving internal record keeping and reporting of sexual harassment complaints implementing policies to recuperate compensation made to executives during periods of fraudulent activity or misconduct including sexual harassment in addition to diversity and other non discrimination initiatives employers are offering additional social programs to improve company culture and encourage employee retention some creative initiatives include permitting remote work for the long term increasing the company s presence in the community by engaging in philanthropic efforts such as serving underrepresented communities offering financial literacy programs such as matching student loan payments instituting employee emergency savings programs and providing financial assistance even without engaging in new and creative initiatives there are still steps employers can take to meet demands for increased social awareness such as reviewing their current policies and comparing them to current practices considering the effectiveness of current training regarding employment policies like harassment discrimination and retaliation and reviewing hr related documents policies and practices and consider potential improvements to better serve the needs of the company and all employees

discussion of non gaap financial measures to supplement the companyâ s unaudited selected financial results calculated in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles â œgaapâ the company discloses certain non gaap financial measures that exclude stock based compensation and other items including gross profit non gaap operating expenses non gaap operating profit non gaap net income non gaap and earnings per diluted ads non gaap these non gaap measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to gaap and may be different from non gaap measures used by other companies we believe that these non gaap measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with the companyâ s results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the companyâ s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable gaap measure we compensate for the limitations of our non gaap financial measures by relying upon gaap results to gain a complete picture of our performance our non gaap financial measures are provided to enhance the userâ s overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future specifically we believe the non gaap results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non gaap results exclude certain expenses gains and losses that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results and because they are consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the company we use non gaap measures to evaluate the operating performance of our business for comparison with our forecasts and for benchmarking our performance externally against our competitors also when evaluating potential acquisitions we exclude the items described below from our consideration of the targetâ s performance and valuation since we find these measures to be useful we believe that our investors benefit from seeing the results from managementâ s perspective in addition to seeing our gaap results we believe that these non gaap measures when read in conjunction with the companyâ s gaap financials provide useful information to investors by offering the ability to make more meaningful period to period comparisons of the companyâ s on going operating results the ability to better identify trends in the companyâ s underlying business and perform related trend analysis a better understanding of how management plans and measures the companyâ s underlying business and an easier way to compare the companyâ s operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of our competitors that supplement their gaap results with non gaap financial measures the following are explanations of each of the adjustments that we incorporate into our non gaap measures as well as the reasons for excluding each of these individual items in our reconciliation of these non gaap financial measures stock based compensation expense consists of non cash charges related to the fair value of restricted stock units awarded to employees the company believes that the exclusion of these non cash charges provides for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies due to the varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types in addition the company believes it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of share based compensation on its operating results ssd solutions restructuring are charges relate to the restructuring of our underperforming shannon product lines and include goodwill impairment expenses and the write down of nand flash and ssd inventory valuation foreign exchange gains and losses consist of translation gains and or losses of non us denominated current assets and current liabilities as well as certain other balance sheet items which result from the appreciation or depreciation of non us currencies against the us â we do not use financial instruments to manage the impact on our operations from changes in foreign exchange rates and because our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we therefore exclude foreign exchange gains and losses when presenting non gaap financial measures â silicon motion technology corporation consolidated

ftse100 7253 27 24 35 0 33 dax30 15705 81 51 25 0 33 by greg peel shocked to the core australia s headline inflation rose by 0 8 in the september quarter as expected the annual rate fell to 3 0 from the june quarter s 12 year high 3 8 the primary reason for the fall was that last june the economy was surviving on government handouts which expired after last year s lockdown the biggest contributors to inflation last quarter were owner occupier house purchases 3 3 and fuel costs 7 1 the surprise however was the rba s trimmed mean or core inflation number it rose 0 7 for an annual rate of 2 1 up from 1 8 to mark the first move into the rba s target zone since 2015 the big increase was in non tradable inflation which includes such items as electricity water all public services hotel accommodation real estate construction local transportation the core does not include fuel costs in isolation a drop in headline inflation should be positive on a global comparison basis and even a trans tasman basis but the move above 2 for the core rate only implies one thing the first rba rate hike might be closer than the central bank insists the asx200 opened up 30 points in the first half hour yesterday and at 11 30am was up 24 at 12pm it was down 24 you can probably tell when the cpi data hit the australian two year bond yield which the rba is supposed to be capping at 0 10 rose 5 points to 0 18 the five year beyond the qe range jumped 13 basis points to 1 34 the ten year ticked up 1 point to 1 80 and the fifteen year fell 2 points to 2 16 the implication here is a near term inflation impact in a slowing economy the market is now pricing in three rba rate hikes in 2022 to 0 75 the rba is still on nothing until 2024 rate hikes are good for banks up 0 5 yesterday unusually consumer staples were the worst performing sector on the day in falling 2 0 but that was due to a 12 0 plunge for a2 milk a2m following an investor day that probably didn t go as well as planned materials fell 1 1 watch out today commodity prices have had a shocker overnight utilities fell 1 2 because agl energy agl fell 4 0 likely sliding on the coalition s pretend emissions plan supporting the banks to balance the index were healthcare 1 1 and telcos 1 9 with telstra tls still rising 3 2 on the government handing the company a big chunk of taxpayer money it s all academic as this morning the futures are down 40 points on weakness on wall street and as noted some big falls among commodity prices losing faith i noted yesterday morning that earnings reports after the bell on wall street for microsoft google and twitter which were all beats for the quarter garnered no initial response from investors instead they went away and had a closer look at the numbers last night microsoft dow closed up 4 and google 5 while twitter fell 11 reporting last night before the open visa fell 7 which was worth over 100 dow points mcdonalds dow went the other way up 2 7 on its report and coke up 1 9 but the bulk of dow stocks closed lower with selling once again accelerating into the close visa blamed the lack of overseas tourism many believe bnpl will see off 20 interest credit cards for good the most recent move up in us bond yields can be attributed to inflation numbers but now as in australia the opposite is true last night on the bank of canada news the us ten year yield fell 9 basis points to 1 53 while the two year rose one point persistent inflation and slowing economic growth which some are calling stagflation but only because they don t have another word for it stagflation was coined in the seventies when the us australia and everyone else was suffering surging inflation back then uncontrolled by central banks a deep economic recession not a slowing from the peak and rampant unemployment in 2021 currently falling so it s some sort of flation but observers suggest the reason why wall street appears to be rolling over once more is simply because it ran up 7 from september and into earnings season not helping is the shambles that is biden s infrastructure ambition democrats remain unable to get close to a compromise that billionaire s tax i spoke of yesterday as good as binned while microsoft s rally last night was unable to save the dow even microsoft and google combined could not prevent the nasdaq from closing only flat in a session which saw a big drop in long bond yields by the close volumes on the nyse reflecting the s p500 not the nasdaq were around 3 5 to one selling to buying the big tech names may have a big impact on all indices

once more implying increased supply the biggest consumer of power in smelting is aluminium weekly us crude inventories showed a rise last week add in talk that iran may come back to the table to talk

article 3 months old commodities oct 28 2021 this story features lake resources n l and other companies for more info share analysis lke a glance through the latest expert views and predictions about commodities oil gas lithium nickel magnesium steel and coal current tight market suggests support for oil and gas stocks lithium sector a hive of activity as un climate change conference looms tightness in the nickel market likely to persist acute shortage of magnesium to have significant implications jarden anticipates heightened demand for us steel as china curbs production china s coal market expected to become more balanced by eva brocklehurst energy morningstar suspects the market is underestimating the demand for oil over the medium term tight supply and high prices should underpin oil because of an underperformance of the opec alliance compared with stated targets combined with a recovery in demand as economies normalise a mid cycle oil price forecast of us 55 bbl for west texas intermediate and us 60 bbl for brent is maintained over time the analysts believe the upward pressure on oil prices will ease this will occur as sanctions on iranin exports are modified or lifted while opec should be able to build production levels up over time us producers also plan to grow at low single digit rates which will be enough to bring new supply onto the market and keep it balanced after 2022 meanwhile natural gas prices in europe are extremely high which is the result of a combination of factors inventory in europe had been replenished over the summer although production remains affected by the pandemic electricity producers are trying to purchase natural gas in order to make up a power deficit before winter arrives and on the supply side there is not a lot of excess natural gas available europe has to compete with asian buyers such as china which is making its first steps to rely less on coal for electricity generation and more on natural gas the analysts believe the transition in the electricity market to renewables is likely to lead to greater variability in power generation and as intermittency remains an issue for renewables generators are resorting to natural gas in summary while there is a lot of negative sentiment around investing in oil companies many oil stocks have surged and based on long term forecast for prices and demand the analysts believe these are undervalued lithium activity is heating up in the lithium sector and bell potter runs the ruler over the major transactions that have occurred since the start of 2021 the broker expects heightened news flow for the sector given the un climate change conference will be held shortly specifically in just over the last two months there have been purchases of stakes such as the lilac solutions earn in to 25 of the kachi lithium brine project owned by lake resources lke sayona mining s sya acquisition of 60 of moblan lithium project and the zijin mining takeover of neo lithium pilbara minerals pls and posco have firmed the joint venture to develop a 43 000tpa lithium hydroxide plant in south korea while mineral resources min and albemarle will re start the wodgina lithium mine by the september quarter of 2022 in other news suzhou cath energy has an agreement with avz minerals avz to earn a 24 equity interest in the manono lithium and tin project and ioneer inr has a 50 50 joint venture with sibanye stillwater to progress the rhyolite ridge project nickel morgan stanley envisages persistent tightness in the nickel market china may be curbing its stainless steel production yet supply disruptions and strong demand for electric vehicle batteries are overriding factors in determining the outlook for nickel the broker observes the current draw on nickel exchange inventory at an average rate of 1000t day since early september has tightened the market and pushed the price to test a 10 year high of 21 000 t last us 19985 there has been a net reduction of 225 000t in nickel demand on an annualised basis from china or 9 of global primary refined supply the broker observes yet these energy driven cuts to stainless production are likely to be more temporary than the environmentally related restrictions on carbon steel a healthy rebound in china s stainless output is also likely as power shortages ease after the winter on the supply side refined nickel supply is expected to improve once the rainy season in the philippines has passed norilsk has also indicated its output was up 55 in the september quarter morgan stanley does not expect the nickel price will follow the lead of iron ore given a much tighter market the broker also disregards the potential bearish view of tesla s confirmation it will switch to nickel free lfp battery chemistry in its standard range models magnesium an acute shortage of magnesium has challenged several industries and morgan stanley suspects without much of a buffer in the system china s output restrictions are likely to weigh a shortage of magnesium could have widespread impact on the automotive aerospace beverage can and consumer goods sectors china s smelters are facing strict controls and while there was some recovery in october utilisation is capped at 40 china makes up 87 of the world supply of magnesium europe is considered the most challenged in obtaining magnesium as it has no supply of its own and relies on china while the us has supply there are some risks to components coming from canada and mexico morgan stanley also points out magnesium begins to oxidise after 3 6 months which means it is hard to store for a long period what will occur in the broker s view is that aluminium producers being unable to secure enough magnesium to produce their major aluminium alloys will instead switch to primary metal for delivery into lme warehouses the broker suggests the current shortage of magnesium is likely to mean end users look for alternatives and for in areas for which there are no alternatives it may not be possible for production such as steering wheels to recover completely steel jarden considers the us steel market will experience growth in demand in 2022 albeit at a slower rate compared with 2021 the broker forecasts demand growth of 2 7 with potential upside stemming from infrastructure investment the swing factor could be automotive production affected by semiconductor supply shortages and china s curbs to steel production could mean steel prices are supported globally jarden notes the global steel production utilisation rate has risen steadily to over 80 which is high by historical standards while the market is pricing in a mean reversion in the us steel price in 2022 23 the broker believes there is a risk for subsequent years as us steel production capacity expands yet as china restricts steel exports and cuts production capacity this should reduce the risk of the market being hit by oversupply as a result decarbonisation should mean rising demand for scrap metal and support ferrous scrap pricing jarden has initiated coverage on sims sgm with a buy rating and bluescope steel bsl with an overweight rating the former has 6 of global market share of seaborne scrap that should benefit from rising scrap demand while expansion into e cycling and repurposed data centre equipment should diversify earnings sources the broker forecasts bluescope s north star us fy23 pricing will be 58 above the average pricing since 2019 at around us 1173 t coal jpmorgan suspects after an extremely volatile year for china s coal consumption the worst of the shortage is probably behind the country amid a change to the government s attitude towards domestic production new production should reach the market in november and growth in coal production will accelerate coal price momentum should therefore subside and lead to a de rating of coal equities extreme coal volatility in china over 2021 was caused by both weather and government policy hydro production was extremely weak and increased the requirement to boost thermal coal power tight import controls and mining restrictions also led to limited supply growth a coal shortage has persisted over the past month which the broker suggests is because incremental supply could not cover the lack of australian coal imports jpmorgan expects demand will moderate and lead to a normalisation of coal inventory supply tightness in the winter peak season is not expected to be as severe as summer given new domestic supply should enter the market find out why fnarena

there are two contested election races on nov 2 among the six district council positions that have two year terms district 5 s seat is being sought by gary macdougall and michael gallagher gallagher is a retired north attleboro assistant town manager who served as director of administrative services under former mayors susan kay and david madden macdougall is a software executive at a quincy firm and he has worked on some political campaigns and ballot questions the district 6 seat is being sought by john abbott and ed hancock hancock is a retired weymouth police officer who served the department for 23 years and abbot is director of operations at technical assistance collaborative in boston the candidates in the following district races stated what their priorities would be if elected on nov 2 in response to a question by the weymouth news more weymouth district 5 council candidates focus on development town finances district 5 michael gallagher i decided to run for office for a number of reasons the two most important to me is proposed development in areas abutting district 5 and the sustainability of the town s budget and the potential long term impact to the taxpayers development within any community is inevitable opportunities to create additional housing stock and attract commercial entities is important to the long term viability of the town however development that taxes the town s already overburdened infrastructure must be done in such a way as to not adversely impact the taxpayers who will not otherwise finally benefit the sustainability of the town s operating budget and the potential impact to the taxpayers should the increase in annual spending continue as it has over the past six years is of paramount concern to me increases in recurring spending have significant short and long term impacts on the taxpayers and must be addressed gary macdougall one of the first priorities for me would be to review zoning with the plan to protect our residents many residents are concerned about the over development increased traffic and large projects that haven t been very transparent our zoning is directly related to these issues a powerful tool the town council has is the ability to make zoning changes this is not used enough to help our citizens additionally i d like to work with the school committee closely to understand why the district is losing students the foundation of a great town is rooted in its ability to have great schools we should be investing in our schools as that has a direct impact on our property values and improve our business climate more columbian square union point top priorities for weymouth district 6 candidates district 6 john abbott i have three top priorities for the next two years if i am lucky enough to be elected to represent district 6 on the town council the first is securing funding for the completion of the columbian square re design project to ensure the safety of vehicles and pedestrians and to maintain a smooth flow of traffic through the busy intersection the second is to provide oversight over the new master developer at union point there have been too many broken promises and false starts at union point it is time for voices of union point residents to be heard the final priority will be to continue to be an advocate for the weymouth public schools and weymouth students as a father of five kids who go to the public schools i am committed to making sure the schools continue to receive the funding they need edward hanock if i am elected in november i will follow through with making weymouth a better place to live as my first priority as an elected town councilor i will work hard on the budget and infrastructure issues to improve weymouth as a whole one of my top priorities would be for the redesign of columbian square to make it an overall safer passage for drivers and pedestrians also improving access for ambulances and public safety vehicles while traveling through columbian square to south shore hospital or emergency call destinations another top priority would be the commercial and residential development of union point opportunities to work with the master developer brookfield properties to make weymouth one of the most desirable cities to live in the south shore during this development being able to fix the water sewer issues by considering the mwra options for the entire town of weymouth uncontested district races the councilors that represent districts 1 2 3 and 4 are running for reelection without any opposition district 1 councilor pascale burga was elected in 2019 after defeating victor pap a former town councilor who served from 2007 2012 district 3 councilor kenneth difazio a local attorney has been serving the council since 2000 and district 4 councilor arthur mathews a u s postal service employee was elected in 2001 district 2 councilor maureen kiely has been serving the council since councilors appointed her to serve the remaining months of former councilor thomas j lacey s term after he resigned in july 2018 she stated what her goals would be during the next two years in response to a weymouth news inquiry district 2 maureen kiely since taking office my focus has been on quality of life issues that affect residents i am proud of my record and my work on the new tufts library the new state of the art chapman middle school the reopening of station 2 road and sidewalk improvements and fighting to keep our farmers market to ensure opportunities for community engagement and local farmers who provide a healthier weymouth as a budget committee member i carefully reviewed and voted favorably for record funding for schools and restoring police and firefighters to keep our community safe i will continue to do so as chair of the senior committee i will continue to work closely with the senior center and the administration in backing incredible resources available to our aging population i look forward to continuing to make weymouth a great place to live work and play i respectfully ask for your vote nov 2

in the last few years we have seen an uptick in behavioral health groups focused on psychedelic treatments there are now at least five 5 psychedelic assisted therapy platforms traded on nasdaq with numerous others listed on the toronto stock exchange and elsewhere ketamine treatments in particular have garnered considerable attention from patients providers and investors treatment models range from more traditional psychotherapy and infusion services similar to those offered by columbia university to telemedicine enabled psychotherapy coupled with mail delivered tablets of ketamine under the mindbloom model however despite the growth in adoption ketamine remains a controlled substance and ketamine behavioral health remains an industry with material regulatory risks we have set forth certain key considerations for various stakeholders involved with ketamine behavioral health legal status and reimbursement ketamine is a schedule iii controlled substance currently with certain exceptions the use of ketamine for depression and related behavioral health matters is off label this means that although ketamine is approved by the fda for some medical uses it is not specifically approved to treat depression while the practice of prescribing off label drugs is legal and common there is an inherent level of risk when such drug is a controlled substance with a history of recreational abuse accordingly the american psychiatric association has issued guidelines for clinicians who wish to use ketamine for such purposes notably ketamine infusions or prescriptions for behavioral health matters are generally not reimbursable by medicare or other federal health care programs as a result in such circumstances the federal anti kickback statute and stark law may not be applicable reimbursement from commercial payors is also uncommon and most practices are cash pay nevertheless state anti kickback statutes self referral laws patient brokering acts and similar laws would remain applicable particularly if they are all payor in scope ketamine treatments constitute the practice of medicine ketamine prescription and administration whether intravenous oral or nasal constitutes the practice of medicine accordingly issues such as provider licensure scope of practice physician supervision prescriptive authority and the establishment of a physician patient relationship among other factors are material to the operation of a practice such laws and regulations are largely governed at the state level and there may be i considerable variations among state laws and ii frequent updates to such laws for example virginia allowed a covid 19 related telemedicine waiver to expire on june 30 2021 several other states have either rescinded telemedicine waivers or allowed them to expire other states may continue to allow looser restrictions on telemedicine prescriptions of controlled substances and other areas of state law that may be relevant to ketamine behavioral health platforms corporate practice of medicine and potential solutions numerous states prohibit the corporate practice of medicine cpom which means that corporations and other non professional entities may be prohibited from practicing medicine or employing physicians to furnish professional medical services because ketamine behavioral health platforms furnish medical services they must comply with state cpom prohibitions and related laws relating to professional entities and fee splitting there are numerous fairly common methods of complying with cpom restrictions including by way of allowing non physician investors to own in a management company which enters into an exclusive long term management services agreement with a physician practice owned by a physician because state laws vary widely with respect to cpom restrictions it is important to review state laws carefully and structure for specific requirements regulatory licensure in many states operating a ketamine clinic does not require a specific regulatory facility license assuming compliance with related laws a ketamine clinic could largely operate with the federal dea licenses and state controlled substance licenses of its providers however in certain states an outpatient treatment center permit may be either necessary or desirable yet again in other states like florida a specific license may be required for medical practices that are not owned by physicians often times the process of obtaining such license requires disclosure of non physician ownership finally depending on the model of the ketamine practice facility level dea licenses and pharmacy permits may be required we recommend a careful review of a ketamine behavioral health platform s model against the backdrop of federal and state laws in order to develop optimal and compliant legal structures footnotes

the combined net worth of elon musk and jeff bezos approached us500 billion 665 billion on wednesday fuelled by the unrelenting rally in tesla shares and a broad surge in tech stocks that sent the nasdaq 100 to an intraday record the value of the two fortunes a sum bigger than the market value of johnson johnson and about equal to that of america s biggest bank jpmorgan chase co is yet another watershed moment in what s shaping up to be a historic week for billionaires tesla chief elon musk and amazon founder jeff bezos are the two richest people in the world a groundbreaking proposal from us senate finance chair ron wyden to tax billionaires on unrealised gains was released in detailed form on wednesday morning only to be dropped in negotiations hours later wyden insists the billionaires tax plan isn t dead but talks have instead moved on to a possible 3 per cent surcharge on top of the highest income tax rate for those earning more than us10 million while such a plan would draw in a larger number of taxpayers than the billionaires tax and help pay for a democratic social spending plan that could approach us2 trillion it would take a smaller bite from the wealthiest americans such as musk and bezos
an aborted democratic plan to tax assets held by billionaires was vulnerable to attack on constitutional grounds experts told the washington free beacon the constitution authorizes three forms of taxation and tax law gurus interviewed by the free beacon said the ill fated billionaire s tax did not fit neatly in any of those categories the measure would have taxed assets that appreciate in value year over year like a stock or a closely held company which aren t currently taxed until they re sold senate finance committee chairman ron wyden d ore on wednesday morning unveiled the billionaire s tax to finance president joe biden s pricey social spending agenda prominent democrats including house ways and means committee chairman richard neal mass and sen joe manchin w va quickly came out against the plan assuring its demise advocates believe the billionaire s tax would have raised 200 to 250 billion over the next decade the wyden plan applied to taxpayers with a net worth of 1 billion or those who report 100 million in income for three consecutive years wyden and treasury secretary janet yellen embraced the billionaire s tax after a handful of congressional democrats came out against other more straightforward revenue raisers such as hiking the capital gains tax tax experts who spoke to the free beacon say the wyden plan could not be considered an income tax since an increase in the value of a given asset isn t income as defined by law advocates counter that appreciating assets balloon a top earner s net worth over time and those top earners can borrow against said assets growing their holdings more still steven j willis a law professor who specializes in tax at the university of florida believes supreme court precedent forecloses that argument in a series of cases beginning in 1920 the supreme court made clear and reiterated that income has to be clearly realized that s always been thought to take a transaction a sale an exchange a transfer something other than mere appreciation willis told the free beacon the 16th amendment authorizes congress to collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived the two key words there are from and derived willis said that s where the realization concept comes from eileen j o connor who led the justice department s tax division in the george w bush administration said inflation can create a double whammy for affected taxpayers not all increases in an asset s value are in fact appreciation but instead are merely the effects of inflation o connor told the free beacon thus affected taxpayers would be suffering the double whammy of a reduction in the purchasing power of their dollars plus a tax on how that inflation boosted the price of their assets congress would be exacerbating the consequences of the government s own bad economic policy in the alternative wyden plan boosters believed his proposal could be justified as an excise tax wyden s concept is somewhat similar to the estate tax which the supreme court has upheld as an excise tax andy grewal a law professor who teaches tax at the university of iowa is less certain about this line of argument an excise tax applies to some kind of activity grewal told the free beacon for example if you produce oil we will impose an excise tax here the theory is that the activity is owning a lot of property to me that s too clever a distinction because being rich isn t an activity that left a direct tax apportioned among the states as the last available avenue for wyden s proposal the apportionment requirement means that a tax must be the same amount per person in every state grewal says it s functionally impossible to impose wyden s tax in this way if congress wants to tax property directly it has to follow these complicated apportionment requirements which as a practical matter it can t do grewal said so if this is really a property tax in disguise then there s no real way to impose this billionaire s tax in general the legal difficulty was aggravated by the fact that there are few precedents to consult and scholars debate the veracity of those authorities that do exist while supporters crafted theories to defend a billionaire s tax against constitutional attacks it s questionable whether a right leaning supreme court would have blessed them wyden s proposal implicated other legal quandaries o connor told the free beacon that taxpayers and the government could and likely would have challenged each other s valuations of particular assets and she anticipated an expansion of the irs would accompany enactment of a billionaire s tax if an asset is not publicly traded you are going to have disagreements about its value o connor said valuations raise contentious issues all the time and if this were to become law the irs would need another group of people to decide how much assets are worth nonetheless a legal challenge would have faced difficulties first in most cases a tax cannot be challenged preemptively a plaintiff must either pay the tax or face off with the irs in tax court that gives rise to a second purely practical obstacle as time passes courts could become reluctant to close a revenue stream that the federal government comes to rely upon i have less confidence than i wish i did that if congress did pass and the president signed such a tax that it would be undone and overturned o connor told the free beacon

by david shepardson washington reuters the united auto workers union backs u s president joe biden s administration s proposed tougher vehicle fuel economy requirements but does not support even more stringent requirements that some environmental groups have sought the union outlined its position in written comments to the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa which set a deadline of oct 26 for comments which were still being posted on wednesday in august the nhtsa and the environmental protection agency epa proposed new tougher vehicle efficiency and emissions rules after the trump administration rolled back obama era requirements nhtsa s proposed rule strikes the right balance of continuing to improve fleet fuel economy sets targets that are achievable and encourages automakers to invest in new technologies the uaw said warning tougher requirements could undermine the overall achievability of regulations and fail to acknowledge the industry disruptions of recent years nhtsa has proposed increasing fuel efficiency 8 annually for model years 2024 2026 the epa plan proposes a 10 increase in 2023 emissions reductions followed by 5 annual improvements in the next three model years the consumer federation of america urged nhtsa to adopt a more stringent alternative 10 increases annually saying it would save consumers at least 28 billion general motors nyse said on wednesday that differences between the epa and nhtsa proposals could make vehicles with tailpipes the mainstream compliance solution every dollar spent propping up legacy engines is a dollar not spent on the investments necessary for future battery electric vehicles the sierra club environmental group criticized the nhtsa for offering loopholes that would allow automakers to double down on gas guzzlers and award credits for technology that doesn t actually slash emissions the uaw supports nhtsa s proposed restoration of incentives for hybrid or overperforming pickups a group of 22 state attorneys general and several major u s cities urged the nhtsa to consider even more stringent standards in september they urged epa to finalize more stringent requirements epa spokesman nick conger said the agency intends to finalize the rule by dec 31
again we begin at the beginning the wisdom is simple save america kill the bill there are lots of rumors about what s in and what s out on both spending and taxes so far as we know as hillary vaughn reported there is no deal my sources who are smack inside republican senate and house leadership tell me we are weeks away and even then no one knows about that as hillary reported this afternoon house ways and means chair richard neal said the so called wealth tax is out of the bill of course it was knocked out this summer then it came back and now it s knocked out again good very good but let s pause a moment the progressive left democrats cannot help themselves like a moth drawn to a flame they cannot help themselves it is a perfect example of the philosophy of the current democratic party that says punish success successful people are bad evil a scourge to society the big government socialist dems have no interest in jobs wages family incomes for typical middle class blue collar americans they could not care less about economic growth they re interested only in redistribution taking from peter to pay paul progressive billionaires tax hopes just dashed by one of their own democratic tax policy wants to soak successful individuals and businesses large and small because they oppose success and simply want to raise money for welfare entitlement purposes welfare dependency is their mantra welfare dependency without any workfare this is an old school socialist view they want equity which we used to call equality but they want equal results not just equal opportunity like the old soviet union and socialist governments everywhere these policies would make everyone equally poor except for the politically favored nomenklatura sound familiar leftwing experts ruling over the swamp just sayin now back to the billionaire s tax first of all the vast majority of the billionaires were not billionaires when they started out in their garages or wherever they made a bet they took a risk usually with a small pile of money and as they exercise their god given talents they gave us another economic revolution this led by new technology advances furious democrats take shots at each other over socialist wish list now this stupid bill sponsored by senator ron wyden would actually tax so called billionaires from the day their assets started appreciating when they weren t wealthy and their stock was worthless and so was their business that s monumentally stupid then there s the issue that year in and year out the list of richest people changes changes a lot irs studies of the so called fortunate 400 show that 71 of the very rich qualify for the list only once courtesy of the tax foundation this point regarding the top 400 taxpayers if this goofy idea ever went into place the irs would be shooting at a moving target and by the way it s not just billionaires it s defined as those who earn more than 100 million in three consecutive years beware folks that number will be coming down lower and lower varney the left playing tricks to vilify the rich the irs believes we re all guilty of hiding information in our bank accounts the other problem is mark to market values often go up and they often come right back down the wealthiest tend to have their wealth from the sale of capital assets or the sale of private business as markets fluctuate so would their taxable value under this regime we used to believe that capital investments turn to taxable income when there is a transaction to sell even that is subject to constitutional interpretation over differing definitions of wealth and income but finally i want to remind that these billionaires have created literally tens of millions of jobs leading to higher wages and greater family incomes and in america we used to believe that you could start a business at home around some crazy idea that no one believes in and then you keep at it and it becomes a phenomenal good or service get fox business on the go by clicking here like maybe a small cell phone or computer or medical procedure or medical equipment or even therapies and vaccines to save america those folks who succeeded way back before they got rich should be praised as the entrepreneurial backbone of the free enterprise american economy we used to think that way this is the land of opportunity one thing my two presidential bosses knew is that government policies should reward success not punish it they knew that incentives mattered and if it pays more to work invest innovate invent etc they will do so and if it pays less they won t and we used to understand that a good paying job requires a solid healthy business click here to read more on fox business but if you penalize the business through higher taxes it will fail and so will the workforce or if the business reaches out to investors but we heavily tax capital then they won t take risks and there won t be a healthy new business and there won t be a prospering new workforce delivering higher and higher incomes to their families save america kill the bill and that s my riff this article is adapted from larry kudlow s opening commentary on the october 27 2021 edition of kudlow
grand forks u s rep kelly armstrong this week sharply criticized biden administration policies that he says have created an unacknowledged tax on americans and an energy crisis in a land of plenty armstrong a republican from north dakota participated in a tuesday oct 26 news conference with other gop members who also were critical of various policies pushed this year by president joe biden reps elise stefanik r n y drew ferguson r ga and steve scalise r la spoke of concerns they have with a host of biden backed initiatives and issues they believe biden s agenda has created but armstrong whose home state is what he calls an energy powerhouse specifically targeted energy issues make no mistake this is self induced this is created by the biden administration armstrong said of rising gas prices and increased energy rates for consumers this is bad for consumers bad for domestic energy producers and bad for american workers we are creating policy that makes energy more expensive and puts us in a bad competition on the world stage it s that simple armstrong spoke for a little more than 2 minutes during the 20 minute news conference which was conducted via a livestream broadcast while the others spoke in more general terms about the president s initiatives immigration and the nation s supply chain issues for instance armstrong quickly listed what he believes are biden s mistakes regarding energy including advertisement canceling the keystone xl pipeline waiving sanctions on nord stream 2 a european pipeline restricting leases to develop minerals on federal lands unrealistic climate goals that armstrong believes cannot be achieved in the announced time frame of 2030 and in august reaching out to opec the organization of the petroleum exporting countries to increase its output for american consumption meanwhile armstrong said costs will rise for consumers north dakota is an energy powerhouse yet we have gotten notice from our two utilities that people are going to pay upward of 150 to 200 more for their energy costs this winter he said he noted biden s pledge made earlier this year that those earning less than 400 000 annually will not see new taxes people who are paying 200 more to heat their home in north dakota in the winter will disagree armstrong said armstrong also was critical of american gas prices earlier this week the national average price of a gallon of gas was 3 367 up more than 1 20 from the price in october 2020 the prices in north dakota and minnesota are about 20 to 25 cents cheaper than the national average according to aaa but still about a dollar higher than a year ago we need to talk about it and we need to be honest with the american people about it because their costs are going up armstrong said noting that costs are increasing whether it s at the pump or to heat their house or to feed their families and we re not spending enough time talking about why that is biden meanwhile last week said americans likely will see high gas prices into next year but he attributes it to outside influences such as opec my guess is you ll start to see gas prices come down as we get by and going into the winter excuse me into next year in 2022 the president said during a cnn town hall in baltimore as quoted by the bloomberg news agency i don t see anything that s going to happen in the meantime that s going to significantly reduce gas prices advertisement some analysts say gas prices have risen due in large part to high demand especially as americans have begun traveling again in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic according to a release earlier this week from aaa the increase in prices is due to higher demand coupled with elevated crude prices and low inventory levels global oil production is still below pre pandemic level according to energy information agency data furthermore while total domestic gasoline stocks decreased last week gas demand increased said gene ladoucer north dakota spokesman for aaa while the u s economy continues its recovery from the depths of the pandemic demand for gas is robust while supplies are tight

mark fields the pr play of the week goes to hertz interim ceo mark fields for igniting a pr firestorm under the auto rental company that recently emerged from chapter xi on oct 25 hertz announced plans to place an order for 100k teslas by the end of 2022 a move that would create the largest electric vehicle rental fleet in north america though the media largely focused on how the deal propelled tesla s market valuation over the 1t mark and further enriched founder elon musk the announcement signaled the birth of the new hertz which fields promised will recharge the auto rental experiences of leisure and business customers around the world fields also inked tampa bay quarterback tom brady as spokesperson for the new hertz brady will star in ads that use his game day let s go rallying cry and show the seven time super bowl champ renting recharging and driving an ev from a hertz airport location fields followed up the tesla news with an oct 27 announcement of a venture with uber to make 50k of its evs available for ride shares he also unveiled another plan to sell used hertz vehicles through the popular carvana online car buying site fields a former ford motor president took the hertz job on oct 5 as the company demoted chief paul stone to coo the board of directors might want to remove the interim from fields title especially since hertz has scheduled a public offering of its stock by the end of the year the pr misplay of the week goes to facebook ceo mark zuckerberg for trying to scapegoat others for his self inflicted woes we are seeing a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company the ever perceptive leader of the embattled social media platform told investors during a conference call others will determine whether whistleblower frances haugen s depiction of a company that prizes profits before people takes down zuck but a masterful pr campaign certainly has put the facebook founder in the hot seat high tech guru kara swisher who moonlights as a new york times columnist likened the masterful rollout of the facebook papers to the planning that preceded the invasion of normandy the wall street journal series got the ball rolling by using documents leaked by an unnamed fb insider that revealed the company knew its instagram unit worsened the body image problems of young girls cbs 60 minutes unmasked haugen during a one on one interview in which the plain spoken former fb product manager came across as cool calm and media trained meanwhile a collection of 17 global news sources including the new york times and guardian have been poring over their troves of the leaked facebook papers in the hopes of breaking more bombshells in the coming weeks haugen who has already testified before the us congress and british parliament is in the midst of a european crusade calling for tighter regulation of facebook that will take her to paris berlin and brussels which is the seat of the european union she has earned the financial and pr support of billionaire ebay founder pierre omidyar who now advocates for tighter scrutiny of big tech to protect citizens rights and the fabric of democracy zuckerberg s notion of an orchestrated effort to take down facebook is spot on he may have met his match much of that pr push is coming from within the company which is a sad commentary on facebook s leadership the weather forecast calls for a storm of misinformation ahead as the united nations cop26 climate conference kicks off on halloween and runs through nov 12 in glasgow apco worldwide and logically released a report on oct 27 that found international events and major government policy interventions are key drivers for spikes in climate change misinformation it said the 2020 world economic forum great reset theme triggered a major new climate misinformation conspiracy the glasgow conference goers will focus on measuring progress against the 2015 paris accords to limit global warming to 1 5 degrees celsus and move toward a net zero economy cop26 also needs to focus on how misinformation poses a threat to achieving those climate goals daniella lebor director of apco believes the communications business can do a lot more to counter misinformation by deploying countermeasures focused on addressing false content large scale interventions such as public awareness campaigns improved data sharing between social media platforms and researchers and investments in high quality media literacy practices are vital components to successfully addressing our current information crisis she said bernie loves sarah taking a page from sarah palin s book national treasure bernie sanders whacked the mainstream media for their extraordinarily poor job in covering what was actually in president biden s build back better program did you mean to say lamestream bernie sanders lamented the endless stories breathlessly reporting about the insider politics connected with biden s plan conflicts between the house and senate the size of the program and high profile opposition of sens joe manchin and krysten sinema sanders said extremism is not the only threat to america s democracy ignorance and lack of knowledge could also do the trick it is hard to ask people to have faith in their government when they have little understanding of what their

of nations report released today countries that are depleting their resources in favor of short term gains are putting their economies on an unsustainable development path while indicators such as gross domestic product gdp are traditionally used to measure economic growth the report argues for the importance of considering natural human and produced capital to understand whether growth is sustainable the changing wealth of nations 2021 tracks the wealth of 146 countries between 1995 and 2018 by measuring the economic value of renewable natural capital such as forests cropland and ocean resources nonrenewable natural capital such as minerals and fossil fuels human capital earnings over a person s lifetime produced capital such as buildings and infrastructure and net foreign assets the report accounts for blue natural capital in the form of mangroves and ocean fisheries for the first time a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the sustainability of wealth is crucial to a green resilient and inclusive future said world bank managing director for development policy and partnerships mari pangestu it is essential that renewable natural capital and human capital are given the same importance as more traditional sources of economic growth so that policymakers take steps to enable long term prosperity according to the report global wealth grew significantly between 1995 and 2018 and middle income countries are catching up to high income countries however growing prosperity has been accompanied by unsustainable management of some natural assets low and middle income countries saw their forest wealth per capita decline 8 percent from 1995 to 2018 reflecting significant deforestation meanwhile the value of global marine fish stocks collapsed by 83 percent due to poor management and overfishing over the same period the projected impacts of climate change may exacerbate these trends in addition mispricing of assets like carbon emitting fossil fuels can lead to overvaluation and over consumption development can be put on a more sustainable path by taking a comprehensive view of wealth and putting in place policy measures including carbon pricing to better value and nurture assets such as forests mangroves and human capital global wealth inequality is growing the report indicates low income countries share of global wealth has changed little from 1995 to 2018 remaining below 1 percent of the world s wealth despite having around 8 percent of the world s population over one third of low income countries saw declining wealth per capita countries with declining wealth tend also to be degrading their base of renewable natural assets for low income countries appropriately managing renewable natural capital which accounts for 23 percent of their wealth remains crucial globally the share of total wealth in renewable natural capital forests cropland and ocean resources is decreasing and being further threatened by climate change at the same time renewable natural capital is becoming more valuable as it provides crucial ecosystem services for example the value of mangroves for coastal flood protection has grown more than 2 5 times since 1995 to over 547 billion in 2018 the value of protected areas per square kilometer has also rapidly increased the changing wealth of nations provides the data and analysis to help governments get prices and policies right for sustainable development said world bank global director for environment natural resources and the blue economy karin kemper by ignoring polluting and climate warming impacts fossil fuel assets have historically been overvalued while assets that contribute to climate mitigation like forests are undervalued the report shows that human capital measured as the population s expected lifetime earnings is the largest source of worldwide wealth comprising 64 percent of total global wealth in 2018 middle income countries increased their investment in human capital and in turn saw significant increases in their share of global human capital wealth although the long lasting effects of the covid 19 pandemic are still unknown low income countries are likely to experience the most severe impacts with a projected loss of 14 percent of total human capital human capital is additionally constrained by gender gaps across all regions and income groups with little improvement since 1995 air quality also has serious consequences for both human capital and climate change and accounts for over 6 million premature deaths annually nonrenewable natural capital wealth minerals fossil fuels has declined since 2014 mainly due to falling commodity prices the report looks at the projected impacts of a low carbon transition and border carbon adjustment taxes on fossil fuel wealth and provides recommendations for managing the economic risks posed for resource dependent countries countries that are heavily dependent on fossil fuel wealth were found to have lower shares of wealth from human capital despite their high income levels with human capital only comprising 34 percent of their wealth the report outlines several priorities for policymakers to diversify and rebalance their national portfolios to be more resilient and sustainable it recommends actively investing in public goods like education health and nature to prevent unsustainable depletion and manage future risks recommendations also include policy and pricing measures that help reflect the social value of assets and to steer private investment toward better outcomes for all this may include for example actions like repurposing fisheries subsidies and taking action to price carbon and promote renewable energy assets download the changing wealth of nations 2021 here

side of this crazy global pandemic we continue to work with our customers our suppliers and our partners to stabilize our industry and chart the path to recovery while this summer brought us new challenges with the variants we have seen encouraging signs of increased vaccination rates further progress on coordinated international travel policies and protocols and ongoing discussions with customers on their fleet planning as expected the recovery has been uneven however it continues to gain broader momentum giving us confidence in the resilience of our market vaccines have proven safe and effective and they re key to personal health and to reopening the global economy reopening travel routes and businesses our customers both commercial and defense have implemented vaccine mandates for their employee populations after careful review and consideration and to ensure compliance with president biden s executive order we are implementing a requirement for us based employees to show proof of being fully vaccinated from covid 19 or have an approved reasonable accommodation as we have done since the beginning of the pandemic we will continue to prioritize the health and the safety of our employees we are making important progress in transforming our business driving stability and quality in our operations and investing for the future i m proud of our team s continued resiliency and unwavering focus on our mission before i go through our business update i d like to formally welcome brian west our new cfo who is with us here today in the two months since brian started he has spent countless hours at our operational sites with the finance and the broader teams digging into issues gaining an in depth understanding of our business brian is an exceptional leader and we re grateful to have him on board with that let s start with an update on the business in the next chart beginning with the 737 program we continue delivering to our customers and supporting their efforts to return their fleets to service in the third quarter we delivered 62 737 max airplanes the most we ve delivered since the first quarter of 2019 we have made noteworthy progress since receiving approval from the faa and today over 175 countries have approved the resumption of 737 max operations we ve delivered more than 195 airplanes including about one third of the 450 airplanes originally in inventory we have largely placed the airplanes that required remarketing our airline customers have returned more than 200 previously grounded airplanes to revenue service 31 airlines have returned their fleets to service and those airlines have safely flown over 206 000 commercial flights totaling more than 500 000 flight hours importantly the fleet has an impressive schedule reliability rate of more than 99 and as domestic and regional traffic recovers for example intra europe demand for the 737 max continues to improve in september we saw the eighth straight month of positive net commercial airplane orders primarily due to the 737 max at the end of the quarter we had over 3 300 aircraft in our 737 backlog highlighting the airplane s families value proposition given this demand during the third quarter we increased our production rate to 19 airplanes per month and continue to progress toward a production rate of 31 per month in early 2022 while we continue to deliver from inventory we are balancing the need to increase the production rate to position us to support increasing demand longer term we re actively working to ensure the production system including the supply chain is stable prior to making decisions to further increase the production rate raw materials logistics and labor availability will also be key watch items for future rate increases as we previously communicated the timing of remaining regulatory approvals will shape our near term delivery plans and our production rate ramp beyond 31 per month following the completion of the 737 max flight test in china during the third quarter we continue to work toward approval by the end of the year with a resumption of deliveries to follow in the first quarter of next year we also continue to make progress on the certification of the 737 max 7 and the max 10 we currently anticipate the first delivery of the max 7 in early 2022 and the first delivery of the max 10 in 2023 as always we will follow global regulators lead in the steps ahead on all certification matters on the 787 program we remain fully committed to our methodical approach to driving first time quality and stability in our operations the issues that our engineering teams and or our suppliers have identified and are addressing are part of this purposeful process and we have transparently communicated with our regulators our customers and our suppliers every step of the way as recently shared we have also identified quality issues with a sub tier parts supplier and while our review is ongoing there are no immediate safety of flight concerns we are in regular communication with the faa on these issues and are committed to taking any action required to address them as to the 787 generally we are conducting inspections and rework and we continue to engage in detailed discussions with the faa regarding the required actions for resuming deliveries as we mentioned last quarter we continue to reprioritize production resources to support the inspection and the rework and are currently producing at a rate of approximately two airplanes per month once deliveries resume we expect to return to five per month over time keep in mind exact timing of deliveries and future production rates will depend upon inspections and rework ongoing customer and supplier conversations production stability and our activities with the faa again our regulators will make the ultimate determination but we believe we have a clear line of sight to the steps ahead and we are continuing to make steady progress to begin delivering airplanes to our customers moving to the 777 and the 777x program the combined production rate is two per month given continued strength in freighter demand we have coordinated with our supply chain and are increasing 777 freighter production capacity in the near term we now expect 2022 777 deliveries to be relatively in line with 2021 on the 777x program we continue to subject the airplane to a comprehensive test program to demonstrate its safety its performance and reliability while working through our rigorous development process to ensure we meet all applicable requirements we continue to engage with the faa and global regulators throughout this process and like any development program we are learning along the way and incorporating those learnings into our plans as we progress in our certification work we continue to conduct boeing flight tests and began engine performance flight testing earlier this month the airplane is performing well and in line with our customer commitments based on the data that we ve collected to date we will validate these results and we will continue to work with the faa to ensure we meet their requirements prior to beginning the certification flight test we still expect that we will deliver the first 777x in late 2023 given the continued robust freighter demand and the compelling economics of the 777x we are currently evaluating the timing of launching a freighter version of our 777x airplane we will keep you updated as we progress in this evaluation in addition for the 737 max 7 the max 10 and the 777x we are investing in our future laying the foundation for our next commercial airplane development program this quarter we stood up an integrated product team to bring together a digital environment where the next commercial new airplane and production system can be designed together while we have not launched a new airplane this is an important step in our digitization journey and our development journey to evaluate how we holistically design build test certify and support the airplane and production system it will build on the invaluable experience of our recent defense programs meanwhile we continue to execute for our customers across our business let me highlight a few key milestones our defense space and security team made progress on key programs for example our mq 25 unmanned test asset completed aerial refueling of a f 35c fighter jet and an e 2d command and control aircraft we also delivered 37 aircraft in the quarter including the first ch 47f chinook to the royal australian army as was recently shared the nasa and boeing teams have identified the most probable cause of the valve malfunction on our commercial cruise starliner and we are working through corrective and preventative actions we are currently working toward opportunities for the second orbital flight test to launch in 2022 pending hardware readiness to rocket manifest and space station availability as we have demonstrated we will continue to prioritize the safety of our employees crew members and spacecraft as we progress in our global services business our team continued to perform and demonstrate sustained recovery from the impacts of covid 19 as cargo demand increases we announced plans to create additional capacity for the 767 300 boeing converted freighter in addition to these program accomplishments we continue to make progress on our commitment to drive the future of sustainable aviation boeing recently joined a virtual white house event on sustainable aviation reiterating our commitment to have our commercial airplanes capable of running on 100 sustainable aviation fuels by 2030 and our partnership with skynrg to expand the global supply of sustainable aviation fuel we also hosted a two day boeing innovation forum in glasgow bringing together partners in the region customers aviation experts and stem students to accelerate efforts to ensure a safe and sustainable aerospace future we were also excited to participate in the iata annual general meeting to discuss our path toward a more sustainable future and how we can support the aviation sector s commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in fact just yesterday our chief technology officer along with the ctos from six other leading aerospace manufacturing companies reaffirmed our commitment to reaching this industrywide target now let s turn to the next slide to discuss the industry environment last month we released our 2021 boeing market outlook which forecasts a total market value of 9 trillion over the next decade this is up from 8 5 trillion a year ago and from 8 7 trillion in the prepandemic 2019 forecast reflecting the market s continued recovery the forecast closely aligns to what we laid out last year our government services defense and space markets remain significant and relatively stable while increased government spending on covid 19 response is adding pressure to defense budgets in some countries others are increasing spending on their security overall the global defense market remains strong and enduring with all of our major programs we remain focused on delivering the highest quality innovative capable and affordable platforms to the warfighter and maintaining the health of our supplier base the diversity of our portfolio creates new opportunities and continues to help provide critical stability for us as we move forward we continue to focus on our customers needs expanding capabilities on our trusted platforms investing in next generation technologies like autonomy and building on our foundation in model based engineering to deliver and intelligently support key franchise programs like the t 7a and the mq 25 we see strong continued bipartisan support for us national security including strategic investments in boeing products and services as congress works through its annual budget and authorization process for fiscal year 2022 the f a 18 and the chinook block ii remain critical capabilities for the warfighter both domestically and for non us customers we will continue to work with the administration and with congress to ensure the necessary support for these key programs is in place the commercial market is shaping up largely as we expected while near term pressure due to covid 19 continues the recovery is broadening and the key long term fundamentals remain strong we ve seen positive momentum in some markets however the recovery continues to be uneven in the third quarter we saw global departures increase slightly to an average of 67 of 2019 levels up from 59 the previous quarter similar to what we saw in the first half of the year domestic traffic is leading the recovery however traffic took a slight step back in the late summer due to the delta variant and increased travel restrictions resulting in global august domestic traffic of approximately 30 below 2019 levels since then it has shown signs of improvement most notably in the domestic china market the us domestic market continues to be a bright spot in the recovery with tsa screenings resuming an upward weekly trend since mid september and peak travel days are reaching 80 to 85 of 2019 volumes we are also seeing the recovery accelerate in more parts of the world which reduced travel restrictions and coordinated protocols japan s domestic traffic is accelerating after the country recently dropped its covid state of emergency and european airlines have seen large booking spikes following the us decision to open to vaccinated foreign travelers in november passenger traffic in other parts of the world particularly southeast asia remained significantly lower due to continued travel restriction uncertainty and case rates even there however there is increasing momentum for air travel as vaccination rates climb international operations are starting to see incremental improvement with august traffic 69 below 2019 which was an improvement from june and july and we re seeing promising signs of entry protocols loosening across the transatlantic corridor despite this progress international traffic is still a long way from full recovery limited coordination on travel protocols are still significantly hindering traffic in the international segment yet the active fleet is now approximately 85 of its previous size with single aisle activity levels slightly above twin aisle with utilization rates and load factors still below historic levels airlines are flying around 60 of their normal global capacity recent changes to government policies could accelerate this to 70 by year end however we have seen continued variability in capacity due to supply chain and logistics challenges our customers are facing as the recovery continues to expand airlines are shifting their focus to medium term fleet planning as part of this assessment airlines have retired or announced plans to retire around 1 500 airplanes since the onset of the pandemic we anticipate this trend will continue as our customers modernize their fleets to reduce carbon emissions and increase operational efficiency with oil prices today approximately 30 higher than at the end of 2019 operating efficiency is top of mind for most of our customers the new airplanes we deliver will be as much as 25 to 40 more fuel efficient with commensurate reductions in emissions compared to the airplanes they replaced the freighter market remains robust with cargo traffic 8 higher year to date through august compared to 2019 with limited belly cargo capacity on passenger airlines more dedicated freighters are being utilized to transport cargo this is resulting in healthy demand for our freighter offerings with 24 additional freighter airplanes ordered in the quarter and strong demand for boeing converted freighters in fact our converted and new freighter orders through the first nine months of this year have already surpassed our highest annual freighter tally in history as we look to the medium and long term we see our original forecast still holds we continue to expect passenger traffic to return to 2019 levels in 23 to 24 and then a few years beyond that to return to long term growth trends we still see recovery in three phases first domestic then regional markets such as intra asia intra europe and intra americas flights and finally long haul international routes we ve seen this phased recovery translate into demand with strong 737 max orders this year which mainly support domestic markets we anticipate demand for widebody aircraft to take longer in line with the international traffic recovery our 10 year commercial airplane market outlook is largely unchanged from what we assumed a year ago reflecting the impacts of the global pandemic as well as the ongoing market recovery from now until 2030 we forecast demand for over 14 000 single aisle airplanes such as the 737 max which equates to roughly 115 to 130 airplanes per month from a 20 year perspective we still see the impact of covid but to a lesser extent as traffic reverts to long term trends through 2040 we project demand for about 43 500 new airplanes an increase of about 500 planes over last year s forecast and as air travel grows we re committed to reaching sustainability goals and future guidelines through government and industry partnerships and a combination of technology policy and operational advances and a significant area of growth projected demand has increased for dedicated freighters including new and converted models with sustained demand for air cargo tied to expanding e commerce and air freight s speed and reliability we project the global freighter fleet in 2040 will be 70 larger than the prepandemic fleet on the global trade front we continue to support and monitor us china trade relations given the importance of the chinese market to our economy and our industry s recovery as well as our near term delivery profile and future orders all of which influence future production rates we remain in active discussions with our chinese customers on their fleet planning needs and continue to urge leaders in both countries to resolve trade differences by reiterating the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry ultimately america s leadership in aerospace as well as the health and stability of millions of commercial aerospace jobs rely on free and fair trade and we are confident our leaders understand the importance of this area not just for our business but for the overall health of our economy and competitiveness turning to the commercial services market we saw demand improve again in the third quarter as we supported airlines during their peak summer season we expect this trend to continue near term slightly ahead of our expectations that said we still anticipate a multi year recovery that may be uneven liquidity is improving across the industry and managing liquidity remains critical for the aerospace industry s bridge to full recovery as we highlighted previously product differentiation and versatility will be key as airlines adapt to evolving market realities in fact the 787 has been the most utilized widebody airplane during the pandemic and demand for the max continues to grow so far this year we have sold more than 550 737s across each of the models from dash 7 to dash 10 reflecting the value of versatility and commonality i m confident our product line is well positioned and we re focused on executing to meet that customer demand despite the continued challenges our industry is facing due to covid 19 passenger traffic is increasing and more broadly we re seeing incrementally positive indicators for economic growth with economic activity picking up labor availability within our supply chain will be the critical watch item as we position for a robust recovery we re focused on delivering for our customers and capturing the opportunities ahead we re maintaining and in some cases expanding key investments in strategic processes technologies and capabilities that will define our future and whether we re investing in manufacturing technology digital engineering technology advances autonomous solutions supply chain capability or platform designs sustainability will be a key factor in every decision we re continuing our transformational efforts to create long lasting value which will improve our performance help us generate positive cash flow and create a foundation to enable us to return to healthy margins while we do this we remain committed to safety quality and transparency and i m confident in our future with that let me turn it over to brian brian west executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks dave and good morning everyone in the short time i ve been here the priorities couldn t be more clear deliver for our customers drive the highest levels of safety quality and stability in all we do innovate for the future and generate positive sustainable free cash flow while we have our share of challenges i m impressed with the team and confident in our path forward let s turn to slide 4 please third quarter revenue increased to 15 3 billion primarily due to higher commercial deliveries and commercial services volume we recorded a 0 60 loss per share in the quarter primarily driven by higher commercial volume partially offset by lower tax benefits third quarter 2021 was also impacted by 787 abnormal costs and the commercial crew starliner charge now let s move to commercial airplanes on slide 5 revenue was 4 5 billion reflecting higher 737 deliveries partially offset by lower 787 deliveries although commercial airplanes operating margin continue to be under pressure it improved in the quarter due to higher commercial airplane deliveries and the bca backlog is currently valued at 290 billion moving to the 737 max we delivered 62 airplanes in the quarter we currently have approximately 370 max airplanes built and stored in inventory including those that we have successfully remarketed we know where the vast majority of the airplanes are going given the demand and we anticipate delivering most of these airplanes by the end of 2023 this assumes we resume delivery to our customers in china during the first quarter of 2022 this delivery timing and the production rate ramp profile remains dynamic given the market environment customer discussions regulatory approvals and supply chain stability there is no material change to our assumptions for the 737 abnormal costs or our assessment of the liability for estimated 737 max potential concessions and other considerations to customers turning to the 787 we did not deliver any 787s in the third quarter while we continue our reviews and work with the faa as dave mentioned in line with our accounting practices we recorded 183 million of abnormal costs in the third quarter due to the low rate of 787 production as well as inspection and rework costs these costs will continue in future period while we complete the rework and we remain at an abnormally low production rate we currently anticipate total 787 abnormal costs to be approximately 1 billion our latest assessment of the financial impact of these abnormal costs and the estimated impacts of delayed deliveries to customers has been included in our third quarter closing position the 787 program margin remains near breakeven we still expect overall unit margins to hold up relatively well and we re confident in the demand and the health of the 787 program over the long term as we ended the third quarter we have approximately 105 787s in inventory timing of deliveries will be dependent upon completing necessary inspections and rework ongoing fleet planning conversations with our customers and closing out our activities with the faa while the commercial recovery will take time we remain focused on driving stability on the 787 program and across the business as we bridge to the recovery we expect improvements in commercial airplanes financial performance due to increasing deliveries and continued efforts by the bca team to transform for the future let s now move to defense space and security on slide 6 third quarter revenue decreased slightly to 6 6 billion and operating margin was 6 6 primarily due to a 185 million earnings charge on our commercial crew starliner program driven by the second uncrewed orbital flight test now anticipated in 2022 and the latest assessment of remaining work we received 6 billion in orders during the quarter including an award for four chinook block two helicopters to the us army and a jdam contract for the us air force we also received the award from germany for five p 8a aircraft the bds backlog is currently valued at 58 billion let s now turn to global services on slide 7 in the third quarter global services revenue increased to 4 2 billion and operating margin grew to 15 3 driven by higher commercial services as the market recovers from the impacts of covid 19 operating margin was also favorably impacted by lower severance costs and mix of products and services during the quarter bgs won key contracts worth approximately 4 billion including 12 additional 737 800 boeing converted freighters for bbam and an award for performance based logistics support of the global c 17 fleet total backlog remains at 19 billion we continue to see incremental improvement in commercial services during the third quarter and we expect the quarterly revenue trend to improve as we support increasing airline flight operations looking ahead we expect the continued commercial market recovery to drive commercial services to increase as a percentage of total bgs revenue let s now turn to cash flow on slide 8 operating cash flow for the quarter was negative 0 3 billion reflecting higher commercial deliveries higher order receipts reduced expenditures on lower widebody production rates and importantly benefits from our business transformation efforts operating cash flow was favorably impacted by a 1 3 billion income tax refund while we continue to see a cash flow benefit from order activity and we saw some advanced payment timing benefit in the third quarter we still expect advanced payment burn down to be a headwind through next year let s move to slide 9 and discuss our liquidity position we ended the third quarter with solid liquidity including 20 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet we have access to a total of 14 7 billion across our bank credit facilities which remain undrawn our debt balance decreased by 1 2 billion from last quarter to 62 4 billion driven by the paydown of bond maturities as we mentioned last quarter we expect to have lower total debt at the end of the year due to the paydown of maturing bonds and early paydown of the remaining 4 billion delayed draw term loan given continued uncertainties in our environment we are vigilantly managing our cash we ve seen our cash balance begin to stabilize due to prudent actions taken across the business and increasing commercial deliveries therefore we believe we currently have sufficient liquidity we remain committed to reducing debt levels and actively managing the balance sheet our investment grade credit rating is very important to us and we will consider all aspects of our capital structure to strengthen our balance sheet cash flow expectations are largely unchanged from what we shared last quarter we still expect full year 2021 to be a use of cash and turn cash flow positive in 2022 as always cash flow may vary quarter over quarter due to timing of deliveries as well as receipts and expenditures including the potential of further cash tax benefits and max customer settlement payments the key driver of cash flow in 2022 compared to 2021 is higher 737 and 787 delivery volume the significant working capital benefit of delivering airplanes from inventory will have some offset from the reduction to advances and progress payments balance as we previously shared our advances balance largely reflects delivery plans from before the pandemic and max production pause while we anticipate a meaningful burn down next year we expect the balance will normalize by the end of 2022 also keep in mind there will be an impact to cash flow in 2022 for compensation to customers for delivery delays and some headwind from the strong 2021 order book which helped fill the near term skyline and improved cash flow in this calendar year as we bridge to sustainable free cash flow generation we continue to proactively manage our liquidity and look to strengthen our balance sheet in closing while our business environment is dynamic we re confident in the future the key enablers for our business and our financial performance for the remainder of this year and into 2022 include vaccine distribution and travel protocols which will ultimately facilitate the commercial market recovery remaining 737 max regulatory approvals us china trade relations and resumption of 787 deliveries our team continues to closely examine all aspects of our business simplify and streamline our work and make long lasting change above all else we ll stay focused on safety quality stability innovation while generating sustainable free cash flow with that i ll turn it back to dave for closing comments dave calhoun president and chief executive officer thanks brian we re making important progress we re taking the right actions to drive stability to drive safety and quality in everything that we do and while the path can be dynamic i m confident in our recovery and in our long term growth i ll close by thanking our teammates your resilience your passion and your commitment continues to impress these are challenging times and you continue to bring your best to boeing each and every day as we look to the future we re investing in our people and our teams to be sure boeing remains a unique place to build your career and contribute to our important mission thank you for all that you do to support our customers our company and each other and with that brian and i will be happy to take questions questions answers operator our first question is from doug harned with bernstein please go ahead doug harned sanford c bernstein analyst good morning thank you dave calhoun president and chief executive officer hi doug doug harned sanford c bernstein analyst so you have taken customer compensation related to the max down from 9 8 billion to 3 4 billion and this understandably helped with getting deliveries out in a tough demand environment and i think of it as many of your customers are effectively seeing a discount through compensation but two issues around that first how complete are your compensation negotiations at this point in other words is the remaining 3 4 billion largely spoken for and it s just a matter of paying it out over time and then second how do you work with new customers to see if i m an airline i look at others benefiting from these effective discounts and discounts that would not be available to me potentially and is this an issue that can hold back new max orders or put added pressure on pricing dave calhoun president and chief executive officer so doug i think as you know we have done everything in our power to separate the settlement of the contract misses that we ve experienced from new airplane orders and discounts so we ve done everything in our power to keep them separate and we ve been very successful in that process no negotiation is complete until it s complete so i can t be perfectly accurate on this front but the lion s share are in fact in the rearview mirror and we know where the wiggle room is with respect to the we think the final ones on the other hand i ll never say we re done until we re done i am quite confident that pricing discipline going forward has been and will continue to be sustained and maintained and i think as we shift from what used to be a demand problem to more of a supply problem in the course of next calendar year that in fact all of the trends are in our favor on that front so i really i think this has been managed well in the separation of those issues and i think we re in a pretty good and disciplined place with respect to pricing doug harned sanford c bernstein analyst so your sense is that when you re talking with new customers around this you re essentially back to the kind of pricing you would normally be at on the max in other words nothing that in a sense is handicapped by the deals you ve made over the last two years essentially dave calhoun president and chief executive officer yes doug i feel very strongly that that is in fact the case and i ve been involved in them and we ve already we have proof points so yes doug harned sanford c bernstein analyst ok great thank you operator next we ll go to the line of myles walton with ubs please go ahead myles walton ubs analyst thanks i was wondering you had commented on the time line for exhausting or liquidating the max inventory i don t think you made a similar comment on the 787 of those 105 aircraft could you lay out the time line you think you could get those out the door dave calhoun president and chief executive officer yes i think it s too early for me to even suggest that one we ll be as aggressive as we can in moving them out but as you know it all depends ultimately on the fleet planning changes that our customers employ we ve caused them harm to date as they rethink their fleet planning they re going to take them when they want to take them i can t jam them down anybody s throat so as soon as we have real clarity with respect to the timing of all that we will give you a good firm guidance on it myles walton ubs analyst ok and a follow up to that is there baked into the program concessionary damages that have been included or would those are those still being calculated and given it s a year ongoing i d imagine you re starting to mount those if that s correct dave calhoun president and chief executive officer no we are actively talking with customers and as we close the quarter there are provisions for what we believe those concessions to be as we stand here today myles walton ubs analyst ok all right i ll leave it to you thanks brian west executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question is from sheila kahyaoglu with jefferies please go ahead sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst good morning dave and brian thank you for the time you re actually a month your two months on production on the 787 maybe what are the gating factors to restarting you gave a bit of color on that if you could give a little bit more and how do we think about underlying demand for the 787s dave calhoun president and chief executive officer yes so i wish i could give you a little more clarity it s going to be when it s going to be with respect to increasing the rates and also beginning deliveries because we really do have to get through these issues that prevent us from getting ticketed while i believe we have clear line of sight on the issues we ve got to give our own teams and then the faa time to get through all their analytics and agree with everything that we re doing with respect to the rework plans et cetera we are well through it but we re not through it so until that happens until we can announce deliveries commencing it s going to be hard for me to give you guidance with respect to demand look if i thought we were going to be at something below five a month anytime soon i would make bigger adjustments and we d have less of an abnormal cost scenario abnormal costs for me are important cost to keep this line up running fresh and ready when five comes back and so that s where we are and i also just happen to believe on the basis of the testimony from customers and their experience with the airplane as i said and i reiterate the irony of the whole story is it s the most utilized widebody out there it s delivering on efficiency it s delivering on everything we promised it s got cargo capability which has been an important factor in the way the role that it s played it s just i think the demand is going to be quite robust and i think as we get to the second half of next year that will begin to play out for all of us but at this moment in time i just can t be real definitive until we commence deliveries sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst ok thank you operator next we ll go to the line of ron epstein with bank of america please go ahead ron epstein bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning guys dave calhoun president and chief executive officer hi ron ron epstein bank of america merrill lynch analyst so dave just on the 777x you guys are saying you re reasonably confident that it s going to be completed in late 2023 maybe can you give us some color around why you would think that would be the case i mean most airplane development it s not just you guys to be fair have had this effect of slipping into the next year that s the end of the year so what gives you the confidence there dave calhoun president and chief executive officer well the time we gave ourselves just for starters we put a lot of time into this that prior to the 737 max recert we would never have included it would have been the total opposite we would have been doing sort of straight lines from here to the cert so we have put time in based on everything we ve learned from the max so far our experience is that there have been pauses that the faa has taken maintaining the same posture that they did with the max boeing get your house in order before we run this test boeing do this before we do that and we have stuck to that discipline and that has that was all part of the original plan and the timing for fourth quarter of 23 so we re still on that plan nothing at this moment in time has sort of or posture taken has suggested that we re that the plan isn t still workable so that s why it really was a it was that first moment when we surprised everybody with the delay and the time that it was going to take it was all the planning involved in that that i think still gives us confidence ron epstein bank of america merrill lynch analyst and then maybe as a follow on to that same question what are the technical milestones that were sitting outside the company obviously right that we can keep an eye on just as followers to understand that you are indeed not you but the company is indeed on track dave calhoun president and chief executive officer well on technical milestones meaning commitments to our customers efficiency just that and the other thing i think we re we ve done all of our own flight tests it s another reason why we re so confident we ve been flying and so we are in a pretty good place on all that front and we believe we can meet those expectations if not surpass them so no shortfalls on that front technically as we work through all the safety protocols and all the documentation required on that front i can t really guide you to any one thing and i don t believe there is any one thing that gets in the way but if there was ever going to be a gotcha that s where it would be ron epstein bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok operator our next question is from noah poponak with goldman sachs please go ahead noah poponak goldman sachs analyst hi good morning everybody dave calhoun president and chief executive officer morning noah poponak goldman sachs analyst dave you mentioned you re on the 787 you were in discussion with the faa about the required actions to resume deliveries can you tell us what the faa s required actions are at this point you mentioned conducting inspections are you still are there still inspections for potential new issues or have you found everything you re going to find and the inspections are now just looking for those to then do the rework i know there s uncertainty here and it s up to the regulator but you mentioned having some line of sight and i think for the investment community this time line feels very uncertain so if you could just kind of tell us everything you know here even if there is some uncertainty just to help us some have some degree of visibility dave calhoun president and chief executive officer yes i on the subject of certainty i can t give you certainty until i m certain i wouldn t use the word very so i would characterize it as something quite a bit less than that our tip to tail inspection and i think i mentioned this the last time we re all together is complete so we re not out there hunting for anything we did have a sort of a late breaking from a parts supplier that unfortunately is a sub tier supplier to other suppliers where we have to track a particular material substitution question that was brought to us by their regulators and track it through every part and then every supplier to us so that process just takes time we have of course segmented those parts we believe we re in a good place we don t believe there s safety ramifications on the other hand on the subject of compliance we have to make sure we re compliant with the material specs that are included in our design so that just takes some time we are working our way through it we re well past halfway we re working our way down to the finish line but that was the one that sort of added some time to this and then with respect to the workload it s 90 boeing we re the ones that have to satisfy ourselves that we re compliant and then the faa has to agree with those set of analytics and they have to agree with all of our ultimately the judgments we make and that s reasonably well in hand we ve been transparent from the word go so there won t be any surprises with respect to what the issues are and or the data that we re collecting to support our ultimate conclusions so i think we re in an ok place i wouldn t say very uncertain i don t use that term but we are uncertain and we ve got to get to that moment where we can start delivering noah poponak goldman sachs analyst you were done a tip to tail inspection is the faa done or is the faa still searching for additional possible issues dave calhoun president and chief executive officer yes no they i wouldn t suggest they ve been hunting for them in any profound way this is from the very beginning this has been mostly boeing on boeing so but anything and everything that we ultimately find and or a supplier volunteers to us we take it straight to the faa and then we begin to work our way through it so again i want to be careful this is not a problem with the faa they re doing their work we just have to solve these things by ourselves and bring it to them and make sure that they agree with our judgments noah poponak goldman sachs analyst so it sounds like it s now just down to this titanium component input issue is that correct dave calhoun president and chief executive officer that s the long pole in the tent noah poponak goldman sachs analyst ok all right thanks a lot dave calhoun president and chief executive officer yeah operator our next question is from kristine liwag with morgan stanley please go ahead kristine liwag morgan stanley analyst hey good morning guys dave calhoun president and chief executive officer good morning kristine liwag morgan stanley analyst dave on the 737 max inventory aircraft and inventory right some of these airplanes had different customers than the initial customers can you provide more color in terms of the additional work and testing that needs to be done on these airplanes before they re delivered and how long that process takes dave calhoun president and chief executive officer well that s a little bit of why some drift into 23 so it s like everything we don t get to unilaterally decide who gets them and how fast they get them they got to incorporate them into their fleet plans and there has been some repositioning of airplanes that require work and you re right about that that s all included in our forward estimates with respect to the program performance it s very manageable and i think well within our means to do it all i wouldn t consider it significant relative to the number of airplanes that we re going to move most of them are going to move under previously determined plans so that s probably the best color i can give to you but that is why there is some drift into 23 with respect to deliveries kristine liwag morgan stanley analyst i see and i guess on production right the supply chain has been in low production for the 737 max for some time now and there s a lot of inventory also in the supplier system considering the constraints that other industries are seeing with regards to supply chain raw materials and labor what gives you the confidence that you can get to 31 per month and sustain that next year dave calhoun president and chief executive officer well because 31 was the number we used to evaluate the supply chain i continue to believe and the evidence is beginning to support that by the second half of next year our industry will be supply constrained so in trying to determine what the right rate would be for us at 31 we believe we have a supply chain that can handle that and you re right with the amount of inventory build that we have asked for during these current months with low production rates we think we re in a pretty good place to be able to do that with respect to increasing from 31 as we go through the second half of the year and forward i think that will be an assessment of the supply chain not an assessment of demand that gets us to whatever number we get to i think we re going to be in a supply constrained world probably from second half through all of 23 with respect to narrowbodies and that s true i believe for the industry kristine liwag morgan stanley analyst thank you dave calhoun president and chief executive officer yes operator next we ll move to david strauss with barclays please go ahead david strauss barclays analyst good morning thanks for taking my question a follow up there on max i guess dave what is the reason you re not delivering more max aircraft i guess if i look at market share of narrowbody deliveries year to date even adjusting out that you can t deliver into china market share is for the max is something like 35 40 so is it an issue with rework is it an faa issue or is it a market share issue and when would you expect to see you ve talked about max getting back to 50 market share when should we see that in terms of delivery levels dave calhoun president and chief executive officer yes good question david i the bigger source of variability with respect to completions and deliveries is on the inventoried airplanes that we are bringing back that we re bringing into service as opposed to ones coming fresh off the production line so there s of course as you know there s a lot of warming up there s a lot of things that you have to do and depending on what you find you ve got to do the work to make sure the readiness is what it needs to be and we ve said to the team take all the time you need to get that exactly right we re going to do this one airplane at a time so we still have more variability in that than i d like to have we are getting a little more stable i think as we move into next year we re going to be quite stable on that front but at any rate that has been the source of most of our delivery variation on the max we got to keep we do have to keep that discipline that is why we re at the reliability rates we re at which is extremely high david strauss barclays analyst and a follow up on that dave can you be any more specific at all the 370 max that are in inventory is it kind of we do a little bit more liquidate a little bit more through the end of the year and then it s kind of half of whatever is remaining is 22 and half is 23 or is it still going to be more skewed toward 22 dave calhoun president and chief executive officer ought to be more skewed to 22 yes yes it will be more skewed to 22 and remember like i said we don t all these airplanes have homes and so fleet our customers fleet plans and all the turmoil that we ve created for them we got to incorporate every one of these deliveries into their fleet plans and so it s a the counterparty has a lot of sway with respect to when we deliver and how we deliver and like i said that has a lot to do with sort of the tail moving into 23 david strauss barclays analyst thanks very much dave calhoun president and chief executive officer yes operator our next question is from cai von rumohr with cowen please go ahead cai von rumohr cowen and company analyst yes thanks so much so dave what percent of the 370 approximately are planes in inventory are for china what percent dave calhoun president and chief executive officer i don t have that number i don t have the percentage on the tip of my tongue brian if you might but what i will say this is the risk if the question is related to risk the risk related to that number continues to go down as we continue to sort of move out delivery rates and then secondly with the robustness of the market the willingness and the number of people interested in potentially taking some big portion of that that s also sort of at the door so it s not as big a risk to our company as it once felt on the other hand i don t have the number on the tip of my tongue brian west executive vice president and chief financial officer yes cai it s roughly a third cai von rumohr cowen and company analyst ok that s very helpful so the one problem i have is if you re really going to take down more than half of the inventory in storage and you re going to have you re going to raise the production rate to 31 by my math you have to deliver over about 500 planes next year maxs or more and you really only did an average of 20 per month in the third quarter i guess 26 in september october doesn t look a little so much stronger so how do we get there i mean that just seems like a huge huge increase in deliveries is there a problem there what am i missing dave calhoun president and chief executive officer yes no we have to get better at delivering out of the completion center our inventoried airplanes which i think we will as i mentioned to you before we ve had a lot of variability on that front and we ve got to be better at that and that is the kind of work that we re doing so i m reasonably confident i m not sure i ve got the same math you ve got but nevertheless you re in the ballpark and that s what we have to commit to do cai von rumohr cowen and company analyst excellent thank you very much dave calhoun president and chief executive officer yes operator next we ll go to peter arment with baird please go ahead peter arment robert w baird co analyst good morning dave brian dave calhoun president and chief executive officer good morning peter arment robert w baird co analyst maybe one for brian it seems like he s getting lonely over there just maybe how you re thinking about kind of the drivers the bigger buckets as we think about comparing 2022 versus 21 and obviously a lot determined on some of these liquidations of what s parked brian west executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so a big piece of it is going to be as i mentioned the deliveries and the subsequent inventory unwind we ve talked a lot about how the 737 is going to unwind we would the same thing with the 787 we continue to and that will be a huge benefit to the going from negative to positive we always want to temper folks to make sure they appreciate that the advance burn down will happen by the end of 2022 and it s going to naturally occur as those deliveries take place so really it s deliveries a vast majority of that swing in the cash flow as well as continuing to drive the operations to higher stability and continue to work our business transformation efforts peter arment robert w baird co analyst is there any and just a follow up on that is there any color on what the burn down looks like on the advanced line brian west executive vice president and chief financial officer we don t have that specifically but we do know that based on the some of the order activity from this year and the delivery timing between the two years it s naturally going to have to burn down and we re preparing for that it s a headwind but not so much so that we can t accomplish that free cash flow generation largely because we re going to deliver a lot more airplanes peter arment robert w baird co analyst appreciate the call and thanks brian operator and our next question is from hunter keay with wolfe research please go ahead hunter keay wolfe research analyst thank you for getting me on good morning i have two quick ones what are you penciling in for tax refunds for the 22 free cash flow guide and then of the 105 787s that you have in inventory right now assuming the faa gave the green light to start delivering again how many of those 105 require additional rework and how many could be delivered pretty quickly thank you dave calhoun president and chief executive officer well let me answer the second question first i ll let brian discuss taxes although i doubt he ll want to forecast it most of the rework with respect to the issues that have come up on the 787 is in the rearview mirror for us so this will be a little less about that now whatever we find in these last set of parts and anything that we may have to do on that front as i said is ahead of us but we ve been doing rework nonstop for the last seven months so it s not a giant mountain ahead of us so then it just becomes a question of customer when do they want it now remember international ops for almost all of our customers are still significantly below where they used to be so when do they want them how does it meld into their fleet plan because we re going to be incredibly accommodative to that and then second just how we orchestrate the movement through our completion center alongside the faa so those will be the determinants but it will not be a giant rework backlog that is going to prevent us from delivering airplanes brian west executive vice president and chief financial officer yes on the taxes we could expect something but when we execute our swing from negative to positive it s not a factor in underwriting that case so not a lot hunter keay wolfe research analyst got it thank you both brian west executive vice president and chief financial officer yes matt welch vice president investor relations that concludes the boeing company s third quarter 2021 earnings conference call thank you for joining duration 63 minutes call participants matt welch vice president

begin with a strategic update and then cover the investments that we re making in innovative technologies to accelerate growth in our supply chain and dedicated businesses i ll also discuss today s announcement of our plan to acquire midwest warehouse distribution system john will take you through our third quarter results which exceeded our expectation again this quarter and review our disciplined capital allocation strategy focused on returns i ll then discuss our updated 2021 outlook let me start with some key highlights about the market and our results long term transportation and logistics outsourcing trends continue to support our growth strategy and investments trends in warehousing and distribution as well as in e commerce fulfillment and last mile delivery of big and bulky items have continued to accelerate since the pandemic began our strategic investments remain focused on leveraging these favorable outsourcing trends unprecedented challenges impacting labor supply chains and truck production are providing us with additional growth opportunities because they help drive companies to make long term outsourcing decisions we re seeing record new contract wins in supply chain and dedicated which we fully expect will contribute to long term profitable growth fms is also benefiting as companies are looking to source truck capacity in this extremely tight market consistent with our disciplined capital allocation strategy we re investing in our higher return logistics businesses through our planned acquisition of midwest warehouse distribution system which adds multi client warehousing capabilities in supply chain and accelerates growth we also announced plans to return capital to shareholders over time through discretionary and anti dilutive share repurchase programs use of the new discretionary program is anticipated to occur over time dependent on several factors including balance sheet leverage the availability of quality acquisitions and the stock price we now expect to achieve roe in the range of 18 to 19 for the full year the team has done an excellent job of leveraging favorable pricing trends in used vehicle sales and rental resulting in outperformance in both these areas in addition we ve continued to increase lease pricing resulting in improved portfolio returns and a 4 increase in revenue per average active lease vehicle we expect additional benefits going forward as leases are renewed and repriced and as we utilize data analytics to further segment customer pricing based on application equipment type and other key drivers of lease returns moving to cash flow we generated strong year to date free cash flow of over 800 million and have increased our full year free cash flow forecast to 1 billion to 1 1 billion up from our prior forecast of 650 million to 750 million our full year forecast reflects an estimated cash flow benefit of 400 million from deferred capital expenditures due to oem delivery delays as well as record proceeds from the sale of our used vehicles with balance sheet leverage currently well below our target range we have additional capacity to enhance shareholder value by deploying capital consistent with our disciplined capital allocation strategy slide five provides an overview of the investments we re making to drive accelerated growth in supply chain and dedicated a key element of our strategy to generate higher returns developing new and enhanced products such as ryder last mile e commerce fulfillment and freight brokerage provides opportunities to leverage profitable growth areas innovative technology enables us to deliver value added logistics solutions that are in high demand last quarter i highlighted ryder last mile offering this quarter i ll discuss rydershare our real time freight visibility and collaboration tool that has proven to be a key differentiator in winning new business sales and marketing are key to our brand awareness and ensuring customers are aware of our full array of supply chain capabilities our ever better campaign and the increased digital marketing presence have driven a significant increase in qualified sales leads we re also expanding our sales force and investing in their capabilities to drive additional growth opportunities strategic m a opportunities such as our planned acquisition of midwest are focused on adding new capabilities geographies and or industry verticals these opportunities are an important way to accelerate growth especially in supply chain and dedicated ryder ventures our corporate venture capital fund aims to invest 50 million over five years through direct investment in start ups our investments here advanced strategic relationships where we typically are working together to develop new products and capabilities that benefit our customers and solidify our position as an industry leader we ve made investments in numerous exciting areas such as e commerce micro fulfillment and digital driver staffing and are working with these start ups to address important customer needs we also recently announced strategic alliances with several autonomous technology firms which enables us to leverage our expertise in asset management maintenance and transportation positioning us as an innovative leader in this emerging space slide six takes a closer look at rydershare an innovative digital product that combines ryder s nearly 90 years of logistics experience with best in class technology rydershare provides users with real time freight visibility throughout the life cycle of an order as well as the opportunity to share information between suppliers carriers and shippers on one platform with ryder s team of supply chain experts managing exceptions rydershare

s transportation volume and supply chain and dedicated now runs through rydershare the platform has processed over 4 4 million transactions and has over 5 300 users to date we re also excited about our recent launch of rydershare for warehousing this enhancement makes rydershare the only visibility platform that connects transportation with warehousing we expect this will be a key differentiator in winning new business i ll turn the call over to john now to briefly cover our third quarter results and review our capital allocation strategy john j diez executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks robert total company results for the third quarter on page seven operating revenue of 2 billion in the third quarter increased 11 from the prior year reflecting revenue growth across all three of our business segments comparable earnings per share from continuing operations was 2 55 in the third quarter as compared to 1 21 in the prior year higher earnings reflect improved performance in aftermaths from higher rental used vehicle sales and lease results as well as a declining depreciation expense impact related to prior residual value estimate changes return on equity our primary financial metric reached 15 7 for the trailing 12 month period roe reflects higher earnings from rental used vehicle sales and declining depreciation expense impact improved lease performance also contributed to higher roe and reflects the impact of our pricing initiatives year to date free cash flow was strong at 829 million although down from the prior year when capital expenditures were unusually low due to covid turning to fms results on page eight fleet management solutions operating revenue increased 8 reflecting 37 higher rental revenue driven by strong demand and higher pricing rental pricing increased 9 primarily due to higher rates across all vehicle classes fms realized pre tax earnings of 186 million up by 170 million from the prior year 93 million of this improvement is from higher gains on used vehicles sold and a lower depreciation expense related to prior residual value estimate changes improved rental and lease results also significantly contributed to increased fms earnings rental utilization on the power fleet was a record 83 in the quarter and well above the prior year s 71 results also benefited from ongoing momentum from lease pricing initiatives partially offset by a 3 smaller average active lease fleet fms ebt as a percentage of operating revenue was 14 9 in the third quarter and surpassed the company s long term target of high single digits for the trailing 12 month period it was in line with the target at 9 7 page nine highlights global used vehicle sales results for the quarter used vehicle market conditions remain robust due to strong freight activity and timing supply from truck production constraints higher sales proceeds reflect significantly improved market pricing globally year over year proceeds more than doubled for both tractors and trucks while sequentially tractor proceeds were up 32 and truck proceeds were up 27 versus the second quarter 2021 as you may recall last year we provided a sensitivity noting that a 10 price increase for trucks and a 30 price increase for tractors in the u s would be needed by 2022 in order to maintain current residual value estimates our current tractor and truck proceeds significantly exceed these levels average current pricing in the u s for tractors and trucks is well above our residual value estimates used for depreciation purposes as such we are comfortable with our residual value estimates and we do not anticipate the need for any significant adjustments at this time during the quarter we sold 4 900 used vehicles down 44 versus the prior year and down 18 sequentially reflecting lower inventory levels used vehicle inventory was 3 500 vehicles at quarter end below our target range of 7 000 to 9 000 vehicles turning to supply chain on page 10 operating revenue versus the prior year increased 14 due to new business higher volumes and increased pricing growth was partially offset by the impact of supply chain disruptions and automotive production activity we expect this disruption to continue to impact our automotive customers until global supply chains normalize and we continue to work with our customers to mitigate the impact we have included an estimated impact from potential shutdowns in our balance of year forecast as the situation remains fluid scs pre tax earnings decreased 62 and trailing scs ebt as a percent of op revenue of 6 2 was below target this reflects lower automotive earnings higher labor costs and strategic investments partially offset by positive earnings from these business we anticipate the pricing adjustments we re implementing to improve scs ebt percentages in the first half of 2022 and to move around the target range or move to around the target range in the second half of next year moving to dedicated on page 11 operating revenue increased 16 due to new business higher volumes and increased pricing new contract wins and dts continue to be robust with year to date sales results already reaching full year record levels new contract wins are driven by ongoing secular outsourcing trends as well as current labor and supply chain challenges that are driving companies to make long term outsourcing decisions we re signing larger deals across a diversified industry base and new contract wins are also benefiting from cross selling opportunities from fms and scs dts pre tax earnings decreased 54 and trailing dts ebt as a percent of op revenue was below target at 5 3 this reflects increased labor and insurance costs partially offset by positive earnings from new business although unprecedented labor challenges are affecting current results in dts and scs we are increasing our recruiting efforts and successfully working with our customers to implement price adjustments to address higher market costs we re encouraged by the early progress we re making on these price adjustments as we continue to deliver the superior service our customers expect we re confident that our new and expanded customer base and pricing adjustments will improve dts ebt percentages in the first half of 22 with it moving to around our target range in the second half turning to slide 12 lease capital spending of 807 million was above prior year s plan due to increased lease sales activity in the year lease returns are benefiting from pricing initiatives and support a more normalized lease capital investment rental capital spending of 583 million increased significantly year over year reflecting a higher planned investment in the rental fleet we plan to grow the rental fleet by approximately 15 in 2021 and in order to capture the increased demand we ve seen from strong e commerce and overall freight activity our full year 2021 forecast for gross capital expenditures of 1 9 billion to 2 billion is below our initial forecast range this reflects an estimated impact of 400 million from deferred vehicle purchases due to oem delivery delays that robert highlighted earlier turning to slide 13 our 2021 free cash flow forecast has increased to a range of 1 billion to 1 1 billion up from our previous forecast of 650 million to 750 million the full year forecast reflects our strategy to balance moderate growth in the capital intensive fms business while generating positive free cash flow over the cycle it also reflects the impact from delayed oem deliveries and record proceeds from used vehicles sold and as noted earlier balance sheet leverage declined due to higher earnings and cash flow and is expected to remain below the low end of our target range this year importantly we now expect to achieve roe of 18 to 19 this year due to stronger than expected performance in fms and a declining depreciation impact higher year to date comparable ebitda which excludes the impact of gains and losses on used vehicle sales reflects revenue growth and improved operating performance turning to slide 14 i d like to review our capital allocation priorities which are focused on creating long term shareholder value by investing in high return opportunities that generate positive free cash flow over the cycle our first priority for capital is investing in high return organic growth opportunities which includes moderate fms lease fleet growth and accelerating growth in scs and dts in our fms business we estimate investments of between 1 8 billion to 2 1 billion annually and that is the amount needed to replace leased vehicles as contracts are renewed and to refresh the existing rental fleet we also estimate investing between 200 million to 500 million in annual fleet growth which represents lease fleet growth of approximately 2 000 to 4 000 vehicles with commensurate growth in rental returns in both lease and rental are expected to continue to benefit from ongoing pricing initiatives investments to accelerate growth in our higher return and less capital intensive supply chain and dedicated businesses as well as technology investments that expand or enhance our capabilities are also key priorities for organic growth capital targeted acquisitions such as our planned acquisition of midwest are focused on adding new services capabilities or industry verticals and provide us with important opportunities for long term profitable growth accretive tuck in acquisitions that supplement our base business as well as investments by ryderventures provide additional opportunities for us our capital allocation strategy is also focused on returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases ryder has made an uninterrupted quarterly dividend payments for more than 45 years our dividend growth rate over the past 10 years is 7 and our current dividend yield is around 3 the new share repurchase programs discussed earlier allow for both anti dilutive and discretionary share repurchases we remain committed to offsetting dilution through the use of the anti dilutive program the discretionary program is planned to be utilized over time to manage leverage and its usage will be dependent on several factors including balance sheet leverage the availability of quality acquisitions and stock price our capital allocation priorities are focused on achieving roe of 15 or higher over the cycle while generating positive free cash flow and maintaining target leverage i ll now turn the call back over to robert to discuss our outlook robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks john turning now to our eps outlook on page 15 we re raising our full year comparable eps forecast to 8 40 to 8 50 up from our prior forecast of 7 20 to 7 50 and well above a loss of 0 27 in the prior year we re also providing a fourth quarter comparable eps forecast of 2 36 to 2 46 significantly above the prior year of 0 83 used vehicle sales rental and lease are the key drivers of higher expected full year results gains are expected to be down slightly in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter reflecting strong pricing partially offset by fewer vehicles sold due to low inventory levels looking ahead to 2022 we expect both higher revenue and earnings record new contract wins in 2021 in supply chain and dedicated are expected to benefit 2022 revenue growth supply chain and dedicated margins are expected to improve in the first half of next year and move toward the target range in the second half reflecting price increases to address higher labor costs barring any further market disruptions we expect strong freight conditions and truck production challenges to continue into 2022 benefiting fms results declining depreciation expense impact is expected to benefit year over year earnings comparisons by 85 million however this is expected to be fully offset by higher book values on vehicles being sold next year used vehicle sales volumes are expected to be flat to modestly higher used truck pricing for the year is expected to be flat to modestly higher in 2022 remaining strong through at least the middle of the year and potentially declining in the second half if new truck production ramps up and used vehicle inventories and the overall market begin to normalize free cash flow next year is expected to decline largely reflecting the 400 million capital expenditure deferral from 2021 into 2022 due to oem delivery delays given the unusual oem production situation it would be appropriate to look at combined free cash flows in 2021 and 2022 overall we re pleased with the trends that favor outsourcing and our efforts in sales marketing and new product development we re confident in the actions we re taking to increase returns including higher pricing to offset labor challenges positioning us well for 2022 that concludes our prepared remarks this morning before we go to questions please note that we expect to file our 10 q later today at this time i ll turn it over to the operator questions and answers operator and we ll take our first question from allison poliniak with wells fargo allison poliniak wells fargo analyst i just wanted to ask about supply chain solutions obviously some margin pressure there is there a way to kind of dissect that a little bit more for us in terms of what was due to the automotive versus the higher labor cost certainly you expect some improvement into next year but i just want to try to see kind of where those buckets are at this point robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes if you just look at supply chain a lot of the challenges really come from the auto group and it s primarily the semiconductor shortages that are impacting production therefore impacting the amount of revenue that we re getting from that side of the business and also some of the driver turnover and the driver shortage challenges that really are affecting all of the transportation related verticals but significantly i would say around the automotive so steve anything else that you want to add there john steven sensing president of global supply chain solutions and dedicated transportation solutions no i think just those two robert and then we did increase our investment both in rydershare the ever better campaign and a couple of other areas so i think those three kind of sum it up robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer i would just add alison the goal is for us to through the price increases that we re putting through to offset the labor cost increases and a supply chain within automotive starts to hopefully stabilize as we get into the back half of next year we do expect margins to improve in the first half and then get back toward our target ranges of high single digits in both supply chain and dedicated in the back half of next year operator we ll take our next question from scott group with wolfe research scott group wolfe research analyst robert you said that there was an 85 million benefit from lower depreciation next year but there was an offset i missed what that offset was if you could just help us robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes the offset is the rising residual values if you remember this year the residual values that we have in place are at the accelerated level which was much lower when we made those changes back in 2019 and 2020 as we go to next year it goes back to the policy levels which will be higher residual values so what we re saying is that that it s about 85 million which is the offset that we see with the roll off of depreciation so really when you think about year over year the real impact is going to be from what happens with pricing and volume within used vehicle sales and we think that s going to be flat to up as we look at next year certainly strong in the first half and then maybe pricing coming down in the second half as more inventory begins to get into the market especially the truck really if the truck oems can get their production levels back scott group wolfe research analyst and just so i understand that so the higher residual value so that shows up in even if used prices stay the same gains on sales would just be lower next year by 85 million is that what you re trying to say robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer correct correct if pricing stays the same gains will be less by 85 but then you ll have a benefit in depreciation of 85 million scott group wolfe research analyst okay and your view though on the market is that maybe just talk about your view on oe production for next year and it sounds like you think used pricing stays firm through the first half and then maybe starts to moderate a little bit in the second half robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes it s still pretty early in the process but yes our view right now is that from what we re hearing from the oems the semiconductor challenge and production challenge still sticks around through the first half of the year and then really improves in the second half so if truck production is limited it s going to be hard to get used truck inventory into the market right because the inventory is created by a replacement when a new truck comes in the used truck goes into the market that it s replacing so without new trucks coming into the market you re going to have a constrained used truck market at least for a period of time i mean there could be some seasonal adjustments in the first quarter we may see a little bit come in but i think overall we ll continue to be pretty constrained and we get into the second half then if production ramps up you ll see certainly the year over year comps get a lot tougher but you ll also see maybe some of the pricing coming down i m sorry let me just add that the net of that i would say since prices have risen so much this year and are at much higher levels now the net of all that is on average we think pricing will be flat to up because it s coming from a very high level right now operator we ll now take our next question from stephanie moore with truist stephanie moore truist analyst i wanted to talk a little bit a little bit more longer term focused than the pricing opportunity within fms i believe pricing initiatives successfully began really several years ago during admittedly a weaker freight environment so we could assume ryder kind of had historically been underpricing based on its level of services so fast forward now and just given this freight environment where we re seeing really strong pricing as well so it s kind of a long winded way of asking is ryder catching up for maybe underpricing in the past or is this just a function of the current environment and really what is the opportunity in pricing as we get out of this current environment whenever that might be robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes stephanie thanks for the question look i think when you look at when did we start raising prices and leases was in 2018 as we started to see the used truck market really take a pretty significant decline starting in the end of 15 through really that lasted through 2020 so really to account for that additional risk we realize we ve got to get the pricing up so we ve had some good success with that i think customers in the market has recognized the importance of this and the value that we bring so the good news is that each year when a vehicle turns out it s being repriced at the higher prices we re about halfway through that if you think back in 18 19 20 we re in the fourth year now maybe a six year cycle but we re also continuing to evaluate and look for opportunities to adjust pricing especially as we implement more data analytics around understanding which applications which vehicle types really are costing us maybe more money than we thought and we need to adjust the pricing there so i think it s an ongoing benefit to the returns and it s something that we still have just on what we ve done so far we still have a couple more years benefit to go and i think there s ongoing process let me hand it over to tom and he can give you a little more color about kind of what we re seeing in the market and the acceptance of that of those price increases tom havens president of global fleet management solutions senior vice president and global chief of operations yes we do continue to have more opportunity in the pricing segmentation that robert mentioned so that has been ongoing since 2018 and we ve continued to refine that process and i would tell you that you have seen a nice increase in the rates in the lease fleets on a per unit basis thus far that s reflected in the p l and the numbers you re seeing today but we have had also a very strong sales year this year at the new pricing levels and because of the oem delays the majority of that equipment hasn t yet arrived and that new pricing isn t reflected in the p l yet so we re really encouraged with what that s going to look like in future years and as robert mentioned we re still about halfway through it and working through an entire lease replacement cycle so we would expect to continue to see expansion in the margins as we work through the entire replacement of that fleet and we have from an acceptance standpoint we like i said we have seen solid sales results this year so we haven t seen customers leaving us through this cycle through the pricing increases so we expect to retain that business and add new business at the new pricing as we move forward robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer so this environment is certainly helping but we don t think that this pricing is dependent on this robust environment we see the pricing acceptance really began prior to us getting into this environment that we re in this year so we see this as an opportunity going forward operator we ll now move on to our next question from with golderman sachs jordan alliger golderman sachs analyst just a question you gave some color on scs and dts and the margins progression obviously fms has had fantastic margins i m just sort of curious all things considered with your outlook for used trucks and the depreciation impact etc i mean how do you think about fms margin as we look forward from here robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes jordan we ve targeted fms margins at high single digits obviously we re going to exceed that this year with the strong performance on the gains and rental side and longer term do we think that the high single digit really target can go up absolutely it s just if you recall we still have a lot of depreciation going through the p l as a result of the residual value changes that we made a couple of years ago and last year and that s going to put a little bit more pressure on margins than we would normally expect but once we get over the next year or two that normalizes completely and certainly i see an opportunity for us to revisit those target margins but in the short term definitely the environment of strong gains and strong rental is going to keep us above that high single digit target operator we ll take our next question from jeff kauffman with vertical research partners jeff kauffman vertical research partners analyst congratulations just a quick just want to clarify i should know this but it s escaping me right now you re looking like you re generating about 26 higher revenue per vehicle in rental but the rate change your broadcasting is 9 3 so can you help me kind of disaggregate what s driving that differential robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes i think what you re missing there is the improvement in utilization right so utilization is up from the low 70s to the low 80s so that s obviously given us higher revenue per unit beyond just the pricing jeff kauffman vertical research partners analyst right so there s no mix differential now that you re largely sold out or any kind of changes in services or fees that s driving that it s just strictly utilization robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer let me ask tom that but i don t believe so tom tom havens president of global fleet management solutions senior vice president and global chief of operations no i don t think so robert that said i think it s the utilization driver i think going into next year we may see a mix in the fleet chain so more trucks less tractors but we haven t that we haven t seen that yet jeff kauffman vertical research partners analyst just a quick follow up autonomous seems to be the hot word these days you ve got a lot public some of which you re partnering with and i just wanted to take a step back and understand ryder s opportunity here and kind of where let s say autonomous catches on it it s a few years out but let s say it s going to happen you re committing to partnerships with a lot of companies where can that come to benefit ryder and are there any new business opportunities that might arise as autonomous vehicles become more established on the highway robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes jeff look that s a great question i think we re certainly early days in this technology so there isn t full clarity yet on exactly how this is going to evolve but i do believe that ryder is well positioned in many ways to participate in this market as a n asset management company that knows how to own and manage and maintain trucks and as a transportation provider with our dedicated and supply chain businesses that does final mile delivery most of the autonomous technology that s being tested today is really on highway kind of hub to hub which the final mile would actually be done by a driver so ryder has the capability to handle that very well just even within our current network you think about the facility of networks that we have we have 800 facilities across north america some of which could be used as hubs for this type of activity so we re in the r d phase i would tell you we re excited about it though because we see the technology beginning to evolve and we think that we certainly are well positioned to play a part in that operator we ll take our next question from todd fowler with keybanc capital markets todd fowler keybanc capital markets analyst robert i just wanted to first follow up on your response to an earlier question so based on your fourth quarter comments it seems like that gains are going to be about 200 million this year is your expectation for 2022 that gains will be at that same 200 million level but the cadence will be different starting off stronger and then slowing toward the back half of the year or is that 200 million a different number for 2022 robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer no the gains if you just look at gains alone they ll probably be down by 85 million because our 85 million because our the book value of our vehicles is going to be up 85 million so if you just only look at gains they re probably going to be down about 85 million however that 85 million will be offset by lower depreciation expense as more of that those vehicles that we had to adjust residual values for as those have rolled off our disproportionate depreciation expense rolls off so net net it s what we re saying is flat assuming flat to up pricing and flat to up volume your gains would be down not more than 85 million but offset by a benefit of 85 million in depreciation expense operator we ll take our next question from brian ossenbeck with jpmorgan brian ossenbeck jpmorgan analyst okay just wanted to ask about the just overall pace of outsourcing new business wins you re seeing in scs and dts we often hear that this might be the peak of those decisions but i would tend to think that events like we re seeing now would actually create a longer tail for some of those opportunities so maybe you can just elaborate on that and then your confidence in getting some of these projects back to profitability i guess more broadly in the entire segment you re talking about improving in the first half getting back to target in the second half but that assumes no further disruption so maybe you can also elaborate on flexibility to kind of move along with any other disruptions you might see to try to keep those closer to where you expect them to be robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes brian listen i ll just hand it over to steve in a minute to give you more color but i ll just tell you this whenever we hear on the news supply chain disruption and people talking about the importance of supply chain that s really good news for ryder because that means companies are really focusing on this capability and this function and they re looking for companies that can help them not just with the immediate issues that they they re facing today but how do they avoid that in the future right how do they design their supply chains and run them differently so they don t run into these issues two years from now and those are a lot of the conversations that we re having on companies that are redesigning their supply chains and relooking at this so i do think i agree with you i think it is a longer tail issue and we re certainly seeing the benefits of that in some of the sales again these are contracts that are multiyear contracts so all the contracts we re signing now they re signing now are going to pay dividends for a long period of time so steve why don t you give him a little more color john steven sensing president of global supply chain solutions and dedicated transportation solutions share it is a differentiator in the market as robert said the dts sales we ve already hit our full year plan at the end of q3 so that continues to allow us not only to win but to win larger deals as well and we re seeing that on the scs side i expect scs by the end of the year to be at a record level as well don t see anything slowing down at this point and comfortable there i think on your question on the profitability just one reminder q3 of last year was really a record ebt percentage for both dts and scs really hitting on all full cylinders low turnover lower open spots volume was steady and then conversely this year it s kind of the opposite of that so we re having really good discussions with the customers both on dts and scs on the rate issues and we expect to start solving that q4 but really in the back half of next year operator we ll take our next question from justin long with stephens justin long stephens analyst i wanted to follow up on the rental market obviously the utilization rate in the third quarter was at an extremely high level any updated thoughts around utilization in the fourth quarter curious what s getting baked into the guidance there and then robert as you talk about earnings growth in 2022 what s the assumption for rental robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer all right let me hand over the first part of that question to tom and then we can talk about the second tom havens president of global fleet management solutions senior vice president and global chief of operations yes we re like we said we delivered a record utilization in q3 and we re expecting similar performance in q4 so we re expecting utilization in the mid 80s again going into q4 which will be at or near another record quarter robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes so continued strong now i m almost willing to say we are red lined i mean our utilization is about as high as it s it is as high as it s ever been and i would expect that to continue certainly through the fourth quarter as we look at next year i think you can assume especially in the first half of the year but i would say even most likely still to the second half a very robust rental market we are we do plan on adding vehicles we re going to be adding vehicles to the fleet to take advantage of some of that but we expect still a very tight truck market as oem production still continues to be somewhat hampered and not really seeing relief of that until the second half of the year so even as they begin to ramp up in the second half i would expect rental to continue to be rental continue to be very strong remember also we are shifting some of our investments there to more straight trucks to be able to take advantage of the e commerce demand which is really strong so some of that i would say is even outside of the unusual truck tightness right now i think demand for straight trucks for the rise in e commerce is a longer term secular trend that we plan on being able to capitalize on justin long stephens analyst and just to follow up on that robert i know rental growth this year is expected to be around 15 any initial thoughts on what the growth in the fleet could look like next year i m sure you re having to plan ahead a little bit more given the oe constraints robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes i don t have i can t give you a number justin because we haven t finalized that yet but certainly expect it to be up from these levels operator we ll take our next question from bert subin with stifel bert subin stifel analyst a question on supply chain side of things was operating income and supply chain in line with your expectations for the quarter or was auto ultimately softer and inflation higher than expected and maybe just to add on to that what should we expect the long term trajectory for supply chain to be is this the largest segment five years from now robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes let me let steve answer the first questions on versus expectation because it was slightly below what we had expected so go ahead steve why don t you give them some color on that john steven sensing president of global supply chain solutions and dedicated transportation solutions yes bert it was really in the quarter there were more chip shortages than we expected earlier in the year certainly and that continued to linger and then you had the driver kind of turnover pay issue that continued to go through the quarter so we ve seen that kind of flatten out a little bit but still cautious as we go through the back half of the year robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer so to your the second part of your question yes we do expect supply chain and dedicated certainly at this accelerated growth rate to continue to become a larger part of the overall ryder story if you depending on what acquisitions we re able to do and how much organic growth we get over time yes it could become more than 50 of the overall revenues but that s we re probably looking at least five years out before we start to see that but higher return businesses we want to make sure we re doing the right acquisitions and we re growing it and getting the right returns which we ve got line of sight to getting our margins back to where they need to be in both of those segments and feel really good about the prospects for it going forward bert subin stifel analyst great just a clarification question is the midwest acquisition contemplated in your 4q guidance i didn t know with some uncertainty around when that gets completed robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer no yes it s not remember we re going to close it the plan here is to close it here at the beginning of november so you ve only got a couple of months anyway but no it s not built in operator we ll hear next from scott group with wolfe research scott group wolfe research analyst i apologize if i missed this did you give the margin or expected earnings accretion from the acquisition for next year robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer no we have not we have not we expect it to be accretive certainly but we did we have not fully flushed that out yet or given it scott group wolfe research analyst or some sense of what the margin that they re operating at now is robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes no we haven t given that we haven t given at that but clearly in alignment with what we see in supply chain scott group wolfe research analyst okay and then just i want to make sure i ve got some of the pieces right for depreciation the 85 million next year reduction is that just from the accelerated rolling off is there any incremental tailwind from depreciation just from the annual studies that you guys do every year robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes no that s just from accelerated and some of the policy rolling off there we don t expect to make any changes to residual value estimates this year scott group wolfe research analyst okay and then just as we go forward the next few years i think you said there s still a bunch of excess depreciation as that rolls off the next few years do we see the same sort of offset with the fair values getting reset higher where sort of the net impact going forward is a push or is there still some net benefit in the out years robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes no i believe let me hand it over to john but i believe that the residual values from next year on are set at policy so they re not there is no increase in residual values going forward after next year so any benefit that we get from depreciation policy does not have that offset john is that correct john j diez executive vice president and chief financial officer so generally speaking that is correct you should expect that we re going to see a tail off of the depreciation benefit continue to impact even beyond 2022 and then as robert mentioned we do expect that network values will kind of settle into kind of where we expect them to rise to next year over time because the accelerated impact is largely behind us in 2022 so that should give you an indication of what we expect going forward scott group wolfe research analyst okay so next year is a push but we could get back to a tailwind in 23 robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes john j diez executive vice president and chief financial officer it won t be significant though scott just to set expectations robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes the 85 million will be much less in the following year operator we will hear next from stephanie moore with truist stephanie moore truist analyst on the supply chain and dedicated segments and in terms of being able to pass through higher labor costs is this just based on those contracts something that s a function of done annually or it s contract by contract or is it based on regional inflation levels with maybe true ups just any color you can provide on passing those through would be helpful robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer steve why don t you update on it john steven sensing president of global supply chain solutions and dedicated transportation solutions yes well stephanie let me talk first of all in our dedicated business we have annual cpi increases what we re seeing right now is those wage increases are higher than what s priced in we are having those conversations and we ve we re going to ink i d say the majority of our customers within dts by the end of the year on our scs business i think it s kind of a mix a large percentage of our warehousing business about half of that is cost plus so that is kind of real time when those things happen we just get with the customers and make those adjustments and then in some of the other segments and our dedicated that s in the supply chain we do that both annually and in some of our new contracts really all of our new contracts going forward we have put a more frequent opener in those contracts so that we can deal with any future changes that come up on us very quickly operator we hear next from todd fowler with keybanc capital markets todd fowler keybanc capital markets analyst robert on the asset management update slide lease extensions are up pretty significantly which makes sense given some of the delivery delays i think in the past as the lease fleet has aged the warranty or the maintenance expense excuse me starts to ramp up can you talk a little bit about the repricing that you re doing on the extensions or your ability to kind of buffer any higher costs with running an older lease fleet at this point robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes i ll hand it over to tom but let me just say that some of that spike in extensions is driven by some a couple of large trailer fleets that we extended that really disproportionately impact the count but let me hand it over to tom so he can talk about what that means for rate and cost tom havens president of global fleet management solutions senior vice president and global chief of operations yes if i were to kind of split that bar up into power and trailers the vast majority of it is actually in trailers but you re right our running costs do go up and if you look at the lease fleet i think our average fleet age is up five or six months that does drive cost but i can tell you that on our extensions we are more than recovering that cost in the new rate to customers we absolutely have that i guess running cost risk covered in the new rate extensions as we go forward robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer todd i know you ve been following the capital for a while so i would also add that remember we changed with a change in lease accounting we changed our revenue recognition on maintenance cost so that impact that we used to see as the fleet aged that margins would deteriorate we don t expect to see that as the fleet ages any and this go around because the way revenue recognition works as the fleet ages you get to recognize more revenue to offset those costs we should have more of a stable margin yes todd fowler keybanc capital markets analyst okay robert yes okay so then just to kind of follow it through as we think about some of the lumpiness in the deliveries as you go into next year the trade off would maybe be that we can see the lease fleet actually move up a little bit my guess is that rental utilization though has benefited from people renting if they don t have a truck so as you kind of push some of the delay this year and kind of balance out into next year how does that kind of come through from a margin standpoint it seems like it s maybe a net neutral or not a big negative or positive one way or another robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes i mean if you think about it on rental it should be a positive because we still expect strong rental demand next year lease as a lease fleet if you think about margin being relatively stable margin percent because of the way revenue recognition works on the maintenance revenue even if the fleet ages the margin stays the same so you re to the extent we grow the lease fleet you should see a benefit in the overall lease margin dollars for lease and then on the used truck side we said we expect to be flat to up on pricing for the year again strong in the first half potentially pricing slowing down in the second half but net for the full year certainly flat to up because we re at such a high level now even relative to the average of where we were this year todd fowler keybanc capital markets analyst yes okay all of that helps now we just need to see the year coming together the way you ve got it mapped out so unlike the last couple of right okay operator we ll hear next from bert subin with stifel bert subin stifel analyst outside of the commercial side of things it seems like fms revenues sort of moderated this quarter how much of that is just limited ability to get new trucks versus the strategy you guys have put in place to improve profitability there robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes i d say it s a combination of the two but tom why don t you give him some color on that tom havens president of global fleet management solutions senior vice president and global chief of operations yes i think if you look at both the lease fleet and the rental fleet both underpinning both are the supply chain disruption so even if you look at our rental fleet there s still about 1 000 units that had not been delivered from our initial order so as good as the results were they could have been better and it s a similar story with lease we typically have a lag from when a deal is signed to when a new unit arrives and certainly that has been elongated so i think underpinning both of those fleets are the supply chain disruptions operator and at this time there are no additional questions i d like to turn the call back over to mr robert sanchez for closing remarks robert e sanchez chairman of the board and chief executive officer okay thank you listen thank you thanks everyone for your continued

as democrats in congress fight among themselves over how much of u s president joe biden s build back better social and environmental spending package to enact disagreements over other proposals to raise tax revenue have party members proposing a novel and highly controversial wealth tax put forward by senate finance committee chairman ron wyden an oregon democrat the tax would force about 700 of the country s wealthiest people to pay taxes on unrealized gains on their assets for example amazon founder jeff bezos would be required to pay taxes on the increase in value of the shares he holds in his company even if he never sells them the tax would also be retroactive if it were to pass bezos would owe a massive tax bill on the aggregate growth of his amazon based wealth dating to the company s founding in 1994 the proposal would allow the accumulated taxes to be paid over a span of five years going forward bezos portfolio would be assessed annually and the increase or decrease in its value would be the basis for an annual tax bill while supporters of the idea praise the plan for making the ultrawealthy pay their fair share in taxes critics say the plan would be difficult to implement and might even be illegal wealth taxes are generally rare with only a handful of countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd levying them primarily in europe wyden s plan is getting attention now because other democrats have shot down more conventional methods of raising revenue the biden administration originally wanted to increase taxes on the wealthy by ending the practice of allowing investments to pass to a deceased person s heirs without being taxed when democrats in congress balked at that the party s leadership proposed a slate of tax rate increases arizona senator kyrsten sinema however said she would not vote for any tax rate increase dooming that proposal and prompting wyden to put his plan on the table major challenges remain as of wednesday morning some democrats including west virginia senator joe manchin were concerned about the plan manchin said he worried that targeting specific individuals with higher taxes could be divisive with only 50 votes in the 100 member senate and vice president kamala harris available to break a tie democrats cannot afford to lose even a single one of their members given that republicans are expected to vote unanimously against the measure some experts warn that the democrats could run into trouble because they are trying to attach this new tax toward the end of negotiations on the bill this has been picked up pretty late said garrett watson a senior policy analyst at the tax foundation a washington think tank they re trying to develop the details including the drafted legislative texts that we got this morning in order to determine how this will be administered the details will be tricky he said i think it still has a pretty arduous path forward given concerns about how this may affect markets about its complexity about the fact that it is targeting a very narrow group of individuals constitutional question one legal challenge the proposal will almost certainly face is whether unrealized gains count as income under the 16th amendment to the constitution which made federal income tax legal if unrealized gains fail to meet the definition of income the tax will not work that s because when the federal government imposes taxes other than the income tax the burden must be apportioned so each state contributes a percentage commensurate with its share of the population because billionaires aren t evenly distributed across the country administering the tax would be practically impossible measurement problems even those who broadly agree with requiring the ultrawealthy to pay taxes on unrealized gains aren t sure wyden s proposal will work finding a way to tax those investment profits is a good idea said howard gleckman a senior fellow at the tax policy center in washington however he added i m not sure that the proposal that s circulating in congress right now is the best way to do it a major problem he said is that not all wealth increases are as easily measured as a portfolio of public company stocks much of the wealth of america s richest people is tied up in privately held companies which are difficult to value or in highly illiquid assets such as art collections real estate and yachts wyden s proposal recognizes that and waits until those assets are sold to tax them it adds a surcharge meant to approximate years of tax payments to the capital gains tax paid on the asset s appreciation even more complicated now you have two separate systems for taxing very very wealthy people and that s going to create a lot of additional complications gleckman said the solution takes what was already going to be a very complex addition to the tax code and makes it even more complicated and the more complex the system gets the more potential loopholes there are for wealthy americans tax advisers to exploit when you impose a tax like this on billionaires you re trying to tax people who have unlimited resources to hire the smartest tax lawyers that exist on the planet and they will find ways to avoid the tax gleckman said congress will try to anticipate all of the tricks that people will use but they inevitably will miss some rarely imposed within the oecd only five countries levy what the organization refers to as a recurrent tax on net wealth they are colombia france norway switzerland and spain as recently as 1990 a dozen oecd countries had some sort of wealth tax but over the years most of those programs were abandoned wealth taxes have seen a pretty sharp decline in their use particularly in europe and the oecd over the last 20 or 30 years because they have not been very workable said watson of the tax foundation the reason is exactly the type of issues we re running into now as it relates to valuation and liquidity it just makes more sense to do it when gains are realized and even in this proposal we see that with non publicly traded assets an oecd report found that decisions to repeal net wealth taxes have often been justified by efficiency and administrative concerns and by the observation that net wealth taxes have frequently failed to meet their redistributive goals the revenues collected from net wealth taxes have also with a few exceptions been very low buy borrow die workaround the wyden proposal attempts to fix a serious gap in the u s tax code that allows very wealthy americans to pass vast wealth down through generations of heirs without paying significant taxes in the current u s federal system the ultrawealthy can easily avoid paying taxes on their assets especially if they are held in investments because the only taxable event is the sale of those assets crucially when a wealthy investor dies the assets are transferred to heirs at their present value meaning that the gains that they may have accumulated over years and decades are never taxed this results in many of the very wealthy using what tax experts call the buy borrow die method of funding their lifestyles instead of selling their assets to obtain cash they take out large loans from banks which offer them at low interest rates because the borrowers pledge their investment holdings as collateral as long as their investment portfolio earns a return higher than the interest rate the bank is charging they can continue to grow their wealth even as they spend when they die their estate pays off the outstanding loans from the accumulated profit leaving heirs a larger inheritance than would have been available to them had the underlying assets been sold to fund spending during the wealthy individual s lifetime

quarter and how we re thinking about the remainder of the year before handing it over to john who will go into more detail on our performance i ll then share some closing thoughts before opening the line for your questions let s start with an overview of the quarter turning to slide 4 i want to begin by thanking our team for an exceptionally strong quarter their ability to remain focused on execution helped us deliver our eighth consecutive quarter of earnings growth in the second half of 2021 we ve seen a shift in the challenges created by the covid operating environment we ve moved away from having to adjust to the fluctuations that came from lockdowns like the change in demand from foodservice to food processors instead we re adapting to an environment that is driven by an uneven global recovery this dynamic demand is driving increases in commodity and energy prices and creating many supply chain challenges our team has remained agile and i m proud of how we ve navigated this market shift we also responded well to unforeseen disruptions like the great work our team did managing the impact from hurricane ida in north america we also continue to set high watermarks across a number of our key operating metrics we ve done this all while continuing to prioritize the safety of our team their families and communities as covid remains with us in addition to solid operational execution our positioning and approach to risk management allowed us to capture opportunities quickly when the market conditions changed this was especially true as crush margins improved over the late summer when oil seed prices dropped and oil values expanded due to tightening supply the strength of our global platform and footprint continue to provide benefits in the face of broad logistical disruptions our integrated value chains and owned ports have helped us to continue supporting customers at both ends of the supply chain this quarter and our results over the last 1 5 years have shown the power of our global network and operating model looking ahead we continue to see a dynamic set of factors and we re more confident than ever in our ability to react and manage well to capture market opportunities as part of our work to continue positioning bunge for the structural shift we are seeing in the consumer demand for sustainable fuel in september we announced our proposed joint venture with chevron as a key step we will increase production of renewable feedstocks by nearly doubling the combined capacity of two soy crush facilities that will be contributed to the jv chevron recognizes our expertise in oil seed processing and farmer relationships as well as our commitment to sustainable agriculture and we recognize chevron s expertise in refining and distribution partnering with a global leader in energy is a significant step forward in building the capability to make change at scale to help reduce carbon in our own and our customers value chains this partnership will establish a reliable supply from farmer to chevron s downstream production and distribution to the infuel consumer it also allows us to better serve our farmer customers by accessing demand in the growing renewable fuel sector it will also enable us to pursue new growth opportunities together in lower carbon intensity feedstocks as well as consider feedstock pre treatment investments in addition to the chevron jv transaction we announced an agreement to sell our wheat mills in mexico to grupo trimex as part of continuously looking for ways to improve our portfolio we concluded the business was not in line with our long term strategic goals and we re pleased with the outcome of selling to a well respected wheat miller we expect the sale to be completed in 2022 turning to our segment performance results in agribusiness were driven by strong execution and better than expected market environment in processing we benefited from higher margins in soy and soft crush in the northern hemisphere merchandising results were better than expected and very strong compared to prior year results in refined specialty oils improved in all regions with particular strength in north america driven by strong demand from foodservice and renewable diesel we re also seeing continuous improvement in our innovation pipeline which enabling us to launch exciting new products to the market i d like to congratulate our team for their efforts to help customers with creative solutions this innovation capability as well as our skill at solving supply chain issues have helped create a step change in many long term customer collaborations and commitments our team is also making measurable progress improving sustainability across our operations and investments following the launch of the bunge sustainable partnership in brazil earlier this year we ve already improved the visibility into our indirect supply in high priority regions to approximately 50 and that s exceeding our 2021 target of 35 and while we still have work to do having this insight into our supply chain will help us meet our industry leading non deforestation commitment and finally regarding our non core businesses i want to call out the role our sugar jv has had in our year over year improvement we re pleased that this business has been performing well in a challenging weather market additionally bunge ventures had a successful quarter as a result of the benson hill ipo and john will give you more details on the impact of that investment in the quarter we also repurchased 100 million in shares and our board authorized a new 500 million repurchase program demonstrating our confidence in the business this reflects our balanced approach to capital allocation where the return of capital to shareholders is always evaluated along with other investment opportunities and before handing the call over to john i wanted to note we ve increased our outlook for 2021 reflecting our strong third quarter results and continued favorable market trends for the full year we now expect to deliver adjusted eps of at least 11 50 and we expect the strong momentum to carry over into 2022 so with that i ll turn the call over to john to walk through our financial results in more details john neppl chief financial officer thanks greg and good morning everyone let s turn to the earnings highlights on slide 5 our reported third quarter earnings per share was 4 28 compared to 1 84 in the third quarter of 2020 our reported results included a negative mark to market timing difference of 0 22 per share and a 0 78 per share gain on the sale of our u s interior grain elevators which closed back in early july adjusted eps was 3 72 in the third quarter versus 2 47 in the prior year adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes or ebit were 698 million in the quarter versus 580 million last year reflecting higher results in agribusiness and refined specialty oils in processing high results in north america european softseeds and our asian european destination soy value chains all benefited from improved margins these were partially offset by lower results in south america where margins were down from a strong prior year in merchandising improved performance was primarily driven by higher results in ocean freight due to strong execution and our global vegetable oil value chain which benefited from increased margins in refined specialty oils the strong performance in the quarter was primarily driven by higher margins and volumes in north american refining which continued to benefit from the recovery in foodservice and increased demand from the renewable diesel sector higher margins in europe largely driven by favorable product mix also contributed to the improved performance results in south america and asia were slightly higher than last year in milling lower results in the quarter were driven by brazil where higher volume and lower unit costs were more than offset by lower margins results in north america were comparable with last year the increase in corporate expenses during the quarter was primarily related to performance based compensation accruals the gain in other was primarily related to our bunge venture s investment in benson hill which went public during the quarter improved results for our non core sugar and bioenergy joint venture were primarily driven by higher prices and sales volumes of ethanol and sugar for the quarter gaap basis income tax expense was 92 million compared to 38 million for the prior year the increase in income tax expense was due to higher pre tax income net interest expense of 38 million was below last year resulting from higher interest income related to the resolution of an historical value added tax matter let s turn to slide 6 here you can see our continued positive eps and ebit trend adjusted for notable items and timing differences over the past four fiscal years along with the most recent trailing 12 month period this is an exceptional performance and i echo greg s appreciation of the amazing execution by our global team slide 7 compares our year to date sg a to the prior year we achieved underlying addressable sg a savings of 25 million of which approximately 75 was related to indirect cost looking ahead we are monitoring cost inflation globally and we will be working hard to offset this impact where we can while still making the necessary investments in our people processes and technology moving to slide 8 for the most recent trailing 12 month period our cash generation excluding notable items and mark to market timing differences were strong with approximately 1 9 billion of adjusted funds from operations this cash flow generation was well in excess of our cash obligations over the past 12 months allowing us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet turning to slide 9 during the quarter we received two credit rating upgrades moody s raised us to baa2 and fitch upgraded us to bbb both with stable outlooks this now puts us at our target rating of bbb baa2 with all three rating agencies the chart on this slide details our year to date capital allocation of adjusted funds from operations after allocating 137 million to sustaining capex which includes maintenance environmental health and safety and 25 million to preferred dividends we had approximately 1 1 billion of discretionary cash flow available of this amount we paid 215 million in common dividends invested 102 million in growth and productivity capex and repurchased 100 million of common shares leaving approximately 725 million of retained cash flow our pace of capex spend this quarter was below our expectations due to supply chain related delays which we don t see improving by year end as a result we are reducing our 2021 capex forecast by about 100 million and we ll be rolling over these projects into next year in addition we have a nice pipeline of growth and productivity investments that are under consideration which we will likely which will likely lead to a higher than baseline spend for the next couple of years we will provide more details on our outlook during our q4 earnings call in february the 100 million of share repurchases in the quarter completed our 500 million authorization as greg mentioned earlier bunge s board has authorized a new 500 million program earlier this year we increased our quarterly common dividend by 5 in may of next year we will again review our dividend with consideration for the recent increase in our earnings baseline from 5 per share to 7 per share and the success in strengthening our balance sheet so as we have been demonstrating we will continue to take a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation as you can see on slide 10 by quarter end readily marketable inventories exceeded our net debt by approximately 1 1 billion a significant change from a year ago please turn to slide 11 for the trailing 12 months adjusted roic was 19 4 12 8 percentage points over our rmi adjusted weighted average cost of capital at 6 6 roic was 13 7 7 7 percentage points over our weighted average cost of capital at 6 and well above our previously stated target of 9 the spread between these metrics reflects how we use rmi in our operations as a tool to generate incremental profit moving to slide 12 for the trailing 12 months we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately 1 6 billion and a cash flow yield of 21 6 the decline in cash flow yield from the prior year reflects a growth in book equity of the company please turn to slide 13 and our 2021 outlook as greg mentioned in his remarks taking into account our strong third quarter results and favorable market trends we ve increased our full year adjusted eps from 8 50 to 11 50 our outlook is based on the following expectations in agribusiness results were expected to be up from our previous outlook and now forecasted to be higher than last year in refined specialty oils results are expected to be up from our previous outlook and well above last year we continue to expect results in milling to be generally in line with last year excluding bunge ventures corporate and other is expected to be lower than last year driven by higher performance based compensation a portion of which was historically allocated to the segments additionally the company now expects the following for 2020 an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 15 to 17 net interest expense in the range of 200 million to 210 million capital expenditures in the range of 350 million to 400 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately 420 million in non core full year results in the sugar and bioenergy joint venture are now expected to be up considerably from the prior year with that i ll turn things back over to greg for some closing comments gregory heckman chief executive officer thanks john before opening the call to q a i want to offer a few closing thoughts as john and i noted we expect a strong close to 2021 driven by agribusiness and refined specialty oils looking ahead we expect favorable market conditions to continue and we re confident in our ability to capture the upside from opportunities while minimizing the downside based on what we can see right now we would expect eps to be well above our baseline for the next couple of years driven by higher than baseline assumptions for refined and specialty oils and soft seed crushing and we ll continue to deploy cash we generate to create value by investing in growth projects with strong returns and returning capital to shareholders in closing we re very pleased with our team s strong performance and our revised outlook in today s environment we re right where we need to be a key participant in the global food and agricultural network we re excited about our role in the accelerating shift in demand for sustainable food feed and fuel and the growth we have ahead of us we ll now open the line for your questions questions and answers operator our first question today comes from ben theurer with barclays please go ahead benjamin theurer barclays analyst thank you very much and good morning greg john congrats on the very strong results and thanks for beating and raising again the guidance gregory heckman chief executive officer thanks ben benjamin theurer barclays analyst well done now in light of your closing remarks a question related to that so you basically said that you think this is you re going to be able to be above baseline for the next couple of years and i think the important fuel lies on the years like multiple years now what s driving that sustainable lasting better environment versus what you saw when you in first place put out your expectation just in summer of last year you didn t raise this summer so what has changed since then within the underlying fundamentals to really put you in that situation that you now can say that you expected to last above that level for the next couple of years and then with that cash flow you re all generating do you think you can accelerate some of the investments and by the way i appreciate very much that you also think of shareholders returning them cash but what opportunities do you see in the market where do you still want to invest in to maybe be in a position to even further increase what you ve just did to the baseline eps gregory heckman chief executive officer okay a lot there ben but yeah let me let me start by just a quick reminder remember that was an earnings framework and when we first put it out right early in the turnaround and we were right at the front end of covid so once we had a good understanding of kind of how the environment was improving our new operating model how that was working then we updated that framework so as you just referenced so what we ve now reflected remember the framework is an ability to look at kind of average margins on soy crush the soft crush as well as our specialty in edible oils business so what we see coming in the next couple of years as we talked about so one we continue to see the focus and the talent of this team to continue to operate we see the stronger demand from refined fuel i think we see the long term kind of the lack of capital what has been invested in this industry and we see that the refined specialty oils we expect that run rate that we see here in q3 based on the demand from foodservice and refining to carry through 2022 so we think that roughly 150 million a quarter is a pretty good run rate maybe a little less little more each quarter but we think that that ll be a pretty good ratable for 2022 so that of course will be above that baseline earnings and then with the demand as well around renewable diesel and refined fuels overall continued support for softseed crushing kind of driven by the oil side of that and so we expect those to be above our baseline earnings as well and then as far as the speed of growth i mean we are absolutely focused as the transformation is done we ve turned the resources to focus on the growth we ll continue to do the organic things right the number of debottlenecking projects already underway and we the timing of doing growth is at the right time when the numbers are right and that allows we let the numbers drive the investment but we ve got the balance sheet now where it needs to be and i think we ve shown that we can execute and so we ve earned that right to grow and with kind of changing landscape between as you think about the growth right we continue to grow our leading global crushing business and of course the origination distribution that supports that as well as our other associated grain processing businesses to serve the producer we ve got our specialty and refined oils business really hitting on all cylinders right now and position and looking not only do organic growth but where we have some opportunity for both on acquisitions and then of course the trend in plant proteins is right in the sweet spot of not only supporting growth in our plant lipids business but in our developing plant protein business and that will be a multi year build but absolutely excited about that trend that s in place and then of course on the renewable fuels and renewable diesels and sustainable aviation fuel and the changes that are happening there so just there is a lot of levers to pull for growth and so we can be very thoughtful and as i said let the numbers drive our decisions john neppl chief financial officer yeah and ben as you pointed out 7 baseline is our footprint as of today or as we put it together a few months ago and as we grow as we have an opportunity to invest in good projects and the landscape changes we will continually update that well i should say on a periodic basis as material things change benjamin theurer barclays analyst okay perfect well with that i ll leave it here thanks again and congrats gregory heckman chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from luke washer with bank of america please go ahead luke washer bank of america analyst hi good morning and congrats on good results obviously a great quarter gregory heckman chief executive officer thank you luke washer bank of america analyst looking at your guide for the full year obviously it s a low end number at 11 50 but clearly a pretty big jump here from 8 50 to 11 50 but the implied guide for 4q was closer to 2 which is obviously on eps which is obviously much lower than 3q and much lower than 4q of last year and i know that this is a floor but as we think about the fourth quarter you have crush margins that are pretty good your elevation margins are good the outlook looks very strong so is there anything in the fourth quarter that would temper your expectations and how is the visibility looking at the fourth quarter gregory heckman chief executive officer well part of it is the timing right i mean part of the performance here in q3 was the timing of what we did have open on crush people definitely not extended out as far in crush last time we were together crush margin were definitely depressed and as we saw that rally we were able to benefit from that this quarter but we were also hedging q4 then as people are going out farther on the curve so we definitely caught part of this last move but not all of it as we ve hedged q4 out we like the momentum and where that s carrying into q1 and we can see that and that s why we feel good about getting off to a very good start here in 2022 luke washer bank of america analyst great and then as you think about baseline i know you set the new baseline of seven only a quarter ago but it feels like maybe even 3q beat your expectations is there any change in the way that you re looking at the outlook structurally whether it s part of your business or that industry more broadly or softening is pretty much the same as when you set that baseline gregory heckman chief executive officer yeah i think the way we look at the framework is the same i think what we ve seen change are the continued strength from the recovery of covid around refined and specially oils from the foodservice side what we ve seen was the continued demand being added from the renewable diesel sector what it s going to take here in multi years to do the work to build some of the supply that s going to be needed and just the overall operating environment this come clear and made it confident for us to look out and say look above where the baseline model is refined specialty oils are going to outperform that softseed crush is going to outperform that because that framework is built around averages so some of it is our ability to continue to execute in a really tough environment right we re suffering from the same challenges around labor and wages and energy inflation and back end of covid here so the confidence in the team to stay focused and really drive the big earnings engine here while we re continuing to work on the growth opportunities so it s definitely environment externally but internally it s also as we continue to get reps here with our eight straight quarter of improved results john neppl chief financial officer and i think luke it s important the 7 was never intended to be a forecast or what we felt like the necessarily the earnings power will be in the company in any given environment it was based on as greg called it a framework based on average historical we kind of call mid cycle margin structure the company should be able to hit 7 a share but obviously in the environment we re in today we re performing substantially above that because a lot of the assumptions we made in that model we re exceeding those today and as well as we go forward and have an opportunity to invest some of this excess cash flow we hope to be able to update that model over time to a higher number luke washer bank of america analyst sounds good and maybe if i can sneak in just one more on your investment in benson hill are you guys what s your relationship with benson hill do you plan to get involved or you guys working together how is that relationship gregory heckman chief executive officer well it s really like all the investments we do in our bunge ventures we can use that as an innovation platform as a knowledge building platform where we re looking at things that could enhance our stickiness with how we work with customers that could lower our cost it could be new technologies to enhance our business or frankly it could be new technologies that could be a threat to our business and so we make investments based on the company themselves and how it fits with the knowledge that we want to continue to earn whether we do business that s a separate decision that s at arm length whether we have a commercial relationship depending on the products and services that that company does and so some of our bunge ventures portfolio companies we do business with because it makes sense in some of our pure investments we do a little bit of business with benson hill luke washer bank of america analyst sounds good thank you operator our next question comes from tom simonitsch with jp morgan please go ahead tom simonitsch j p morgan analyst thank you good morning everyone gregory heckman chief executive officer good morning tom tom simonitsch j p morgan analyst firstly a clarification when you say 150 million per quarter is a fair run rate for refined and specialty oils for next year can you clarify how that compares to your baseline john neppl chief financial officer yeah it s i don t have the exact number in front of me on the baseline but it s considerably above what we had in the 7 baseline driven really by the refining margins in that business and what we re seeing when we assumed it on the baseline it was probably closer to maybe 100 million a quarter so you re looking at probably at least a couple of hundred million difference between the 7 baseline and where we are today tom simonitsch j p morgan analyst that s very helpful thank you and maybe could you provide some more color around what you re seeing in your milling business what needs to happen for that segment to grow beyond this year gregory heckman chief executive officer well we continue to make investments in our corn milling business here in the u s to serve customers and in south america as well we started another mill back up here last year and continue to make investments there but it s really working with customers it s where we ve got the connection to our supply chain network where we ve got crossover with customers with our specialty and refined oils business and where we think we ve got the scale to be relevant to customers and the connection to have an edge to win long term so you ll see us leverage around our strengths tom simonitsch j p morgan analyst thank you i ll pass it on gregory heckman chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from adam samuelson with goldman sachs please go ahead adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yes thanks good morning everyone gregory heckman chief executive officer good morning adam john neppl chief financial officer good morning adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst so maybe following up on tom s question and thinking about how your the discrete areas where you re seeing upside to that baseline framework i think you called out the soft seed side soft seed crush is well think back in july the baseline assumption had been about 50 a ton of kind of gross margin in that on the 10 million tons that or so that you do for soft seed how have you framed the upside to that from the market environment looking forward gregory heckman chief executive officer yeah i think we what we ve looked at we called the refined out because that one is a little more ratable and it s the big moving number as i know you guys are trying to think about 2022 we re carrying good momentum in q1 in both soft and so we can see that and then of course not as much visibility out to the balance of the year but just kind of when we look at the s ds around the soft and what we expect we expect that to perform above baseline we didn t really quantify it but we re definitely comfortable that it will contribute above baseline so that s why we wanted to call it out as well adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay and can i just ask on the distinction in terms of soft seed and not and not the soy crush is there i mean clearly the vegetable oil demand broadly that whole complex is tight the demand is very robust is there more concern about the demand on protein that wouldn t lead you to be incrementally constructive on soybean pressure or is it simply just lack of visibility beyond the first quarter gregory heckman chief executive officer no it s just lack of visibility i think from the macros we re fairly constructive with what we re carrying into q1 and then we ll see how things develop and how things develop in crops in the second half definitely looks like we re probably going to have built some stocks in oilseeds and that should actually be good from an environment but a lot s got to happen yet on getting things planted and seeing the weather develop and so on adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst got it and if i could just squeeze another one and just given some of the inflation you re seeing across the environment it seems like things were handled quite well through the third quarter but how should we think about rises in energy prices logistics labor just the impact in the business and particularly energy and thinking about europe given some of the issues there specifically gregory heckman chief executive officer yeah energy we think about as another input right just like oilseeds it s one of the costs into cogs and so it s part of the risk management as we re trying to manage the energy at risk in our assets we ve definitely seen i think more kind of violent moves in those as we ve seen normally those are part of what goes into the crush margin as we re pricing and so those will get passed along of course when you see moves like we ve seen here sometimes depending on the region it may take a little longer to get those passed along but the other thing we have is with the global footprint then we ll pull back crush if margins get squeezed by the energies we ll pull crush back in that region and we can run harder in another region so again that s one of the things about the global network that s very helpful so it s just another one of those things around another dislocation and disruption that we have to manage john neppl chief financial officer yeah i would just say adam on the wages side i mean like everybody else we re subject to wage inflation not only in the u s but globally but i think we feel like if we can maintain a position as being a low cost producer in the industry as others struggle we should come out on top and so we re obviously managing that as effectively as we can but availability labors are primary concern especially in an environment we re in right now margin environment we ll continue to manage that first and then the inflation will pass along what we can and continue to focus on being a low cost operator adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay that color is really helpful i ll pass it on thanks operator our next question will come from vincent andrews with morgan stanley please go ahead vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thank you and let me reiterate congratulations on the quarter and results in general gregory heckman chief executive officer thank you vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst could i just ask has anything changed about since you guys came in have you how has your sort of risk parameters evolved now that you re a couple of years in eight great quarters in a row and better operating environment are you taking bigger swings at anything or is it still the same or has something changed about the philosophy gregory heckman chief executive officer absolutely not one of the things about our philosophy we said all along right is to manage the risk appropriate for the earnings power of the company and the environment that we operate within and that is as our risk teams and our commercial teams work hand in glove assessing the dynamic environments that we re in and looking at the earnings at risk out in the forwards of our assets and as we ve said those earnings are just at risk until we can book the oilseeds and book the energy and sell the oil and sell the meal in our crushing or the same hedging the inputs and outsets in our grain processing or in our distribution assets so i think what the big thing that s changed is we re operating as one bunge and we are using our information as one company to execute better for our customers we re using our global network to flex in a time where dislocation has kind of become the norm with almost less globalization and more regionalization and quite frankly there is still a lot of embedded optionality in tens of thousands of customers and millions of tons of physical flows and the liquidity in those physical flows for us to manage the risk for ourselves and our customers and it exists when you act like one big global company and you run that business in a very disciplined way vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst okay and you mentioned obviously that south america is planning now and they ll have whatever crop they wind up having but i think i heard you say that there ll probably be some build in oilseeds inventory which is obviously a logical assumption but i also thought i heard you say that would be good for you or did you say good for the environment or just how are you thinking about sort of how next year could play out in the scenario where let s say brazil and argentina have a very large crop gregory heckman chief executive officer sure yeah it looks like bean planting is off to a record start down in brazil i think we re getting close to 50 planted and we re seeing i think right now estimates are expected for there to be bigger soy crops in the u s argentina and brazil and i d say in the strong demand environment we ve got right you ve got palm continuing to have problems on the supply side and just globally oils not only from the renewable diesel and renewable fuels demand side but now with palm a little bit of a supply so oil continues to remain strong we continue to see we expect to be some growth in meal demand next year so that is a more favorable operating environment now as i said the crops have got to get grown and the weather has got to show up and how the farmer markets and everything has to develop but net net it feels pretty good i think that s why even though we re not calling out all the specifics is why we say we feel that we can be well above the earnings framework here for the next couple of years vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst okay so just to follow up on that so even in that environment you believe that there would be strong enough margins and enough sort of dislocations still in the market that you could be above that 7 figure gregory heckman chief executive officer absolutely vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst okay thanks very much gregory heckman chief executive officer thank you john neppl chief financial officer thanks vincent operator our next question will come from ben bienvenu with stephens please go ahead ben bienvenu stephens inc analyst hey thanks good morning everybody gregory heckman chief executive officer good morning ben john neppl chief financial officer good morning ben ben bienvenu stephens inc analyst i want to revisit this discussion around capital allocation and just to hear your thoughts around whether or not there s been any consideration around whether you could raise your roic goals obviously you steadily raised your baseline earnings power framework scenario that you think about characterizing the company with when you think about what progress you ve made at bunge over the last two years and you think about the underlying earnings power of the business does it make sense to raise that threshold for roic and when you look at the pipeline of potential opportunities is there a robust set of opportunities organic or inorganic that exceed that roic threshold gregory heckman chief executive officer let me start and i ll hand over to john the one thing is that the main about the only time we talk about that threshold on roic is quarterly with you all because we have the teams focused on competing for working capital based on how their returns on competing for risk capital based on how their return on invested capital and how their aroic where we re looking at how effective we are in working capital so we re constantly driving to get the best return possible not kind of just jump over the hurdle we needed that framework when we were talking to investors but frankly we re driving and competing against always trying to improve the lowest returning internally and to grow the businesses that are the highest returning john neppl chief financial officer yeah ben and i would just say that certainly with where we ve been able to get to in terms of our roic and our adjusted roic metric which we think is an important way also to measure the business there s no doubt that i think we feel like we re at a different plateau today as we go forward here and look at our opportunities we ve got we feel like a pretty good pipeline of opportunities and certainly our goal will be to raise that 9 to something north of that and i think if i remember back even a year and 1 5 years ago greg made a point that once we get to 9 we ll raise it and we are well above 9 and certainly i think we ve got enough momentum in the business improvement of the operating model and i think some attractive investment opportunities that we should be able to raise that as we head into next year and take a look at our plan for next year and what we believe we can do we ll come back on that ben bienvenu stephens inc analyst yes okay that s great thank you secondly the sugar and bioenergy business i know it s non core it s performing considerably better than we ve seen over the last couple of years i know that you were in a higher priced sugar and ethanol environment currencies more in your favor than it s been over the last few years i assume that hasn t changed any considerations you have around how relevant that business is in your portfolio and what do you think the appetite is in the markets to make some of the strategic decision with that business gregory heckman chief executive officer first it has not changed our view long term on that i mean our plan is to still exit the business we re certainly happy with the current performance it makes it a lot easier to hold it until we find the right buyer but we are actively in that process and it takes time obviously to get the right counterparties and the right structure but we re actively looking at it today and our goal would be to get that done as soon as we can but at the same time we want to balance speed with value but certainly i think we think that business is worth a lot more today than it was a year or two years ago and so we re optimistic that we ll get something done ben bienvenu stephens inc analyst okay great thanks and best of luck gregory heckman chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from rob moskow with credit suisse please go ahead rob moskow credit suisse analyst hi just some kind of macro questions do you do any work internally to try to figure out how far along china is in rebuilding its pig herd after african swine fever and how that s influencing their exports or imports of soy and then i had a second question about soy planting intentions with energy costs as high as they are would that result in more crop rotation into soy away from corn next year and if so does that make a difference to you or not gregory heckman chief executive officer yeah thanks rob on china we ve definitely seen they re in the late stages of rebuilding that herd and you ve seen those margins come off and a little bit of herd reduction in the places where they ve really built too fast as they kind of outpace their demand we haven t seen any major impact from afs impact continue so of course that will have some effect we believe that will have some effect on their imports of meat no doubt so that continues to develop i m sorry second part of the question rob moskow credit suisse analyst the energy gregory heckman chief executive officer yeah the energy the higher energy prices in total actually are supportive for demand for renewable fuels and it looks like i think we re in a we re in a situation here for a while where everybody believe there ll be higher crude and higher energy prices here for a few years as we kind of work through the transition a lower carbon energy footprint and we do think that that will be net friendly and as far as the corn versus soy acres yeah there s no doubt that the market is sending the signal on oilseeds but i think it s more than just corn versus soy we ll have to watch wheat as well and the other oilseeds to kind of see the fight for acres and that one hasn t played out yet but that will be a real interesting point here over the next few years as the market is sending the signals for us to build some additional capacity and additional acres and or production per acre to serve the demand rob moskow credit suisse analyst and maybe i ll sneak one more in then have you done any tracking of global capacity for soy crush because you re not the only one that s increasing capacity right now for renewable fuels any sense as to what that s done to global crush capacity so far this year gregory heckman chief executive officer yeah so as we think about global crush capacity a couple of things one of course we re always watching it closely and i think if you remember all the way back maybe investor day when we talked about we need some additional global crush capacity right whether it s a weather problem a government problem now we ve seen an energy problem curtailing some run time in china in that to get that balance right i think what s interesting this year when we saw argentina run harder through the first half than they did prior year and margins stayed good globally and i think that that tells us something as well and then as they didn t run as hard later in q3 and then we saw global margins then rebound again so there s we re definitely we re tracking all the projects that are announced and then we ll actually track all the projects that actually get built we don t think they ll be exactly the same and look with what it takes to permit and order projects and order equipment and get the labor in place that extra crush coming in or watch it s out there 2 5 three years before it starts making a real difference rob moskow credit suisse analyst yeah gregory heckman chief executive officer so we re we continue to look at where we re going to put our expansions and of course we announced the expansion we re going to have will be on the water and that allows us to not only serve the domestic market with meal but to be able to export to get to the world market and so as we make expansions in our own footprint we want to be very very thoughtful about as energy goes through this transition in the next 10 years to 15 years which they feel renewable feedstocks are a big part of that we also have the right lowest cost footprint for the long term and so that s why we continue to be very thoughtful about the long lived assets that we put in the ground john neppl chief financial officer and i think rob one other thing relative to the chevron jv for example there have been other jvs announced a lot of those are greenfield builds they re going to take a number of years before they re operational whereas because we re taking two existing plants and put in the joint venture we re going to be up and running immediately with chevron so we re pretty excited about that of course the expansion that we ve talked about will come over time but certainly we re going to be able to hit the ground running with them rob moskow credit suisse analyst great thanks for the color gregory heckman chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from ken zaslow with bank of montreal please go ahead ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst hey good morning guys gregory heckman chief executive officer good morning ken john neppl chief financial officer good morning ken ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst when i think about refined oil it seems like both you and your competitor have done joint ventures with the refiners right so it almost seems like pretreatment may not be coming down the pipe for all this renewable diesel so refined oil margins may stay longer than maybe we initially expected can you make a comment on how you re thinking the refined oil margins might actually the duration of them gregory heckman chief executive officer well we feel comfortable enough that we ve now called them all the way through 22 above our baseline so that s we re pretty confident because we re a little maybe conservative on how far we like that to reach out with projections and look it will be the industry will be making those decisions right our industry on how we re serving the renewable diesel industry and the renewable diesel industry making the trade offs on can they make a return on investment on pretreatment and is pretreatment best built at refining at renewable diesel production or somewhere else to gather other low ci feedstocks and so the one thing this is developing very quickly and that s one of the things we re so excited about our relationship with chevron this is a jv this is a platform that we re starting and we re using the combined knowledge of two global industry leaders where we ve got the philosophy of leveraging each other s strengths we re not trying to do chevron s expertise they re not trying to do ours but we are trying to bring that together everywhere from looking at the economics and understanding how the feedstocks work in the refinery understanding what we can do with the producer around regenerative ag in the supply chain developing other low ci feedstocks and thinking about long term how we grow together to meet those needs and take advantage of those opportunities so i think that the relationship and the way that we have formed that with chevron is a little unique to some of the others in the industry and we think it s powerful and we re excited about the opportunities that that s going to generate ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst but it s fair to say that slowdown in the pretreatment creation probably should extend the refined oil margins for longer is that at least a fair statement gregory heckman chief executive officer no absolutely it s a direct trade off to using the refining capacity in the oilseed crushing industry so ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst and then yeah i wanted to just i know we ve talked about this a little bit with the cash deployment i d be honest i m not that clear so help me out here the so pieces of it is that there s a lot of projects that are in the pipeline for 2022 and then beyond that there s opportunities that you will be able to deploy cash more externally can you talk about one the projects that and again you re not going to give me exact projects but how much cash do you think you can deploy over the next couple of years for internal and i m assuming we could assume a 15 or so percent return on that and then the other part is how quickly do you want to deploy the cash for external opportunities and then i ll leave it there and i appreciate your time john neppl chief financial officer yeah ken this is john i think it s pretty conceivable that we ll probably so our baseline capex historically has been call it 400 million to 450 million the last two years cumulatively will be about 200 million below that run rate cumulative because of the underspend in the last couple of years i think we ll see that amount probably assuming supply chains loosen up next year and we can get the equipment we need and the labor we could conceivably see something in the 600 million to 700 million range i think easily in capex over the next couple of years a lot of that is projects that we ve got in the pipeline that we re analyzing not going to say we re going to do all of them but it s everything from continued debottlenecking we ve got a couple of greenfields and then of course we ve got a couple of projects we ve already announced that are going to take time and will be part of that number and then ultimately we re always going to be looking at the m a side and any opportunity there might be there and i think we feel more confident today that we have a right to be a consolidator in the industry if the opportunity comes given what we ve been able to do so we re going to look at all facets of it but i think what we can control we re going to certainly focus on very good projects organically and again as i said before we have a good pipeline of things everything from debottlenecking greenfields and things like that that were some underway and some we re still assessing ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst great i appreciate it thank you guys gregory heckman chief executive officer thank you operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i d like to turn the conference back over to greg heckman for any closing remarks gregory heckman chief executive officer thanks again for joining us today and thanks for your interest in bunge i want to thank the team again for continued incredible execution in what continues to be a very dynamic environment and it just continues to demonstrate the strength of bunge we look forward to speaking with you again soon everybody have a

yoy increase our outlook for 2021 demonstrates our confidence that investments in our long term strategic roadmap will accelerate the evolution of qumu s saas based business model adjusted ebitda loss

11 9 million at 2020 fye vs 10 million at 2020 fye the increase derived from positive operating cash flow based on the company s fourth quarter 2020 financial results pipeline of business and progress

offering at 6 75 per share and the share price rose above 10 in february 2021 36 days later on march 4 2021 qumu publicly released its 2020 financial results and 2021 guidance including 2020 revenue up 15 to 29 1 million and an adjusted ebitda loss of 2 3 million 2020 fye cash and equivalents of 11 9 million 2021 revenue guidance up at least 20 or approximately 35 million the share price on this day closed at 7 87 on april 29 2021 qumu issued its q1 2021 financial and operating results and reiterated its fy 2021 prior strong guidance based on the company s q1 2021 financial results business

and strikingly changed its outlook and withdrew prior 2021 guidance the company expects revenue for q2 2021 to range between 5 7 million and 5 9 million this compares to revenue of 9 3 million in q2 2020 and 5 8 million in q1 2021 net loss for q2 2021 is expected to range between 4 9 million and 4 3 million as compared to 692 000 in q2 2020 and 4 5 million in q1 2021 these transformation challenges have pushed our anticipated growth inflection point likely into early next year and impacted our ability to achieve the desired overall revenue growth in 2021 we believe our overall revenue will be flat or decreased modestly over the next several quarters as we work to gain full sales traction in building the recurring saas revenue stream we are rightsizing our burn rate slowed our hiring and made other cost cutting measures to ensure adequate working capital that supports our longer transition to saas this new business outlook approach supersedes qumu s revenue guidance for 2021 issued on april 29 2021 which was withdrawn effective today the share price on this day closed at 3 85 and was preceded by relatively massive volume the company s underwriter and principal analyst coverage as of june 11 and 29 2021 lowered its target share price to 6 00 from 11 00 and now qumu at 2021 revenue of 23 2 million and an adjusted ebitda loss of 15 9 million they are also projecting 2022 revenue of 24 8 million and an adjusted editda loss of 3 1 million the above unfavorably compares to 2020 revenue and an adjusted ebitda loss of 29 1 million and 2 3 million respectively summary if qumu after expending near 150 million purchasing and investing in the video conferencing platform can t make the grade in the public markets especially in a favorable demand environment and fresh equity capital than in our view qumu must very quickly become part of a significantly larger company with a fully developed sales force and engineering and where there are public and other cost synergies qumu s value must now approach 300 million to generate a satisfactory risk adjusted irr dolphin also does not believe a rule 13e 3 transaction is appropriate or maximizes value at the end of q1 2021 qumu had net cash of approximately 25 2 million and analyst coverage suggests a burn of over 5 0 million in q2 2021 given the prior eight years how could the board allow a six month cash burn exceeding 10 million of fresh equity capital with declining revenue and so adversely surprise new qumu investors with 60 days of guidance even if results materially improve there was no need to expend so much newly raised equity capital and at the expense of the credibility of the ceo and board given where the company is and the financial environment the board must not permit net cash to drop below 18 million or approximately 1 00 per share without certainty immediate economic reward qumu is neither a start up nor suffered from under investment it is currently operating in a favorable demand environment and having recently raised material equity capital and jeopardized the credibility of new ceo and a reconfigured board what has transpired can t be acceptable the current share price is about 2 60 how long will the board give its most recent relatively massive investment to generate meaningful recurring profitable revenue and how much more is the board prepared expend we believe these questions and others will need to be clearly answered in the next 100 days if qumu believes any statement of fact made herein is materially inaccurate please contact dolphin or its counsel in writing within 10 business days of receipt of this letter so correction can be made if we don t hear from qumu in writing dolphin shall assume no correction is required or offered as a very large and growing shareholder dolphin and another entity hopes the board s 10 million and apparently growing wager yields a near term favorable result for all constituents accordingly dolphin

opportunity investments wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of october 20 2021 stuart a tanz chief executive officer thank you good morning everyone here with me today is michael haines our chief financial officer and rich schoebel our chief operating officer building on the strong momentum that we generated during the second quarter as the west coast fully reopened again we continue to steadily advance our business as we progressed through the third quarter capitalizing on the strong demand for space we increased our portfolio lease rate to over 97 again where it had been for six consecutive years prior to the pandemic additionally during the third quarter we again achieved solid rent growth extending our consecutive streak to 39 quarters in a row of achieving positive releasing rent spreads on both new and renewed leases worth highlighting is the fact that we successfully achieved rent growth every quarter during the pandemic which speaks to the strength of our grocery anchored portfolio and our diverse tenant base as well as the acumen of our team along with continue to achieve solid leasing results we are also enhancing our portfolio through our investment program we are again pursuing acquisition opportunities and are pleased to report that we have already lined up thus far four terrific grocery anchored shopping center acquisitions which together total about 123 million specifically during the third quarter we acquired an excellent grocery anchored shopping center located in silicon valley the property is ideally situated at the entrance to a highly desirable affluent master planned residential community with an average household income of over 237 000 the shopping center s anchored by new seasons supermarket which is a strong regional operator akin to whole foods and is a perfect fit for the surrounding community additionally at the start of the fourth quarter we acquired another well established grocery anchored shopping center located in southern california just north of san diego the center is anchored by albertsons and cvs beyond these two acquisitions we also have two additional grocery anchored shopping centers currently under contract and separate transactions that together total about 62 million both properties are located in the seattle market and both feature strong national supermarket operators what s important to note is that all of these new acquisitions fit and complement our existing portfolio extremely well all four shopping centers in our core markets where we have a strong well established presence like our existing portfolio these new acquisitions feature very strong supermarket operators all of which are long time tenants of ours and all have performed exceptionally well throughout the pandemic in terms of pricing the overall blended yield on the 123 million of acquisitions is approximately 6 going in with the opportunity to increase that yield notably during the next 12 to 24 months safe to say that we are excited about these new acquisitions as they will undoubtedly enhance our presence within our key core markets as well as provide compelling new growth opportunities going forward lastly turning to dispositions we are pleased to report that during the third quarter we completed our exit of the sacramento market selling our last two properties for approximately 44 million in total generating a gain of about 13 million taking into account our second quarter disposition we have sold 70 million of properties in total this year now i ll turn the call over to michael haines our cfo to take you through the details mike michael b haines chief financial officer thanks stuart for the three months ended september 30 2021 the company had total revenues of 71 4 million as compared to 69 8 million in total revenues from a year ago the increase was largely attributable to our rent collection rate returning to being in line with our historical pre pandemic norms resulting in lower bad debt which was less than 1 of total revenues in the third quarter again in line with our historical run rate with respect to net income for the third quarter of 2021 gaap net income attributable to common shareholders was 20 1 million equating to 0 17 per diluted share and for the first nine months of 2021 gaap net income was 45 million or 0 38 per diluted share included in net income is the gain on sale from property dispositions as stuart noted with selling the two of remaining sacramento properties the company recorded a 12 9 million gain in the third quarter for the first nine months we reported a total of 22 3 million in gains which includes the property sale will we completed in the second quarter in terms of funds from operations for the third quarter of 2021 ffo increased to 32 6 million equating to 0 25 per diluted share which brings our ffo for the first nine months to 0 74 per diluted share same center net operating income for the third quarter increased 4 on a cash basis as compared to a year ago and for the first nine months of 2021 same center noi increased by 2 2 with respect to capital raising initiatives in addition to the 70 million raised through property dispositions thus far in 2021 we have raised just over 46 million of equity through our atm program which includes a 11 2 million that we raised beginning of the third quarter between the atm issuance and the property sales we raised approximately 116 million of equity proceeds in total year to date we are utilizing the majority of these proceeds together with cash flow from operations to fund our shopping center acquisitions turning to our balance sheet we continue to have nothing outstanding on our 600 million unsecured credit facility looking ahead we expect our credit line balance will remain minimal if not zero for the remainder of 2021 with our credit line at zero of the company s outstanding debt today is entirely fixed rate and in terms of debt maturities nothing has maturing this year and in 2022 we only have two small mortgages maturing totaling about 23 million our goal is to pay these mortgages off of the cash flow from operations and possibly some additional equity issuance proceeds depending upon market conditions with respect to our financial ratios interest coverage for the third quarter was a solid 3 3 times additionally the company s net debt to ebitda ratio was 6 6 times for the third quarter in terms of ffo guidance we continue to expect ffo for the full year 2021 to be between 0 98 and 1 2 per diluted share the key factors that will drive where we finished the year in that range are the timing of closing the pending acquisitions as well as the timing of new lease commencements possibly offset by raising additional equity through our atm again depending upon market conditions our goal is to be well positioned in terms of our balance sheet as we look toward to 2022 now i ll turn the call over to rich schoebel our coo rich richard k schoebel chief operating officer thanks mike starting with our portfolio lease rate as stuart highlighted during the third quarter we increased our portfolio lease rate to over 97 again specifically our portfolio lease increased to 97 4 as of september 30th breaking our lease rate down between anchor and non anchor space our anchor space continues to hold firm at 100 leased where it has been throughout the pandemic in fact our anchor space has been 100 leased for 19 consecutive quarters now approaching five years in a row and in terms of non anchor space our lease rate increased 94 3 during the third quarter which is approaching our record high that we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019 just before the pandemic began driving our lease rate higher is the demand for space which continues to be impressively strong across our portfolio in core markets and this demand is coming from a wide range of necessity based service and destination tenants especially those seeking in line space we are also seeing a growing number of anchor tenants now pursuing new more cost effective smaller prototype formats tailored to focus on their most popular offering and their omnichannel initiatives from our perspective we continue to capitalize on the demand to enhance our tenant base at every opportunity including recapturing in line space early proactively replacing shop tenants that have struggled coming out of the pandemic with much stronger new tenants additionally our strong performance throughout the pandemic where we worked hand in hand helping the existing tenants adapt and thrive is now serving to draw new tenants to our shopping centers away from competing properties that did not have the management acumen nor the wherewithal to work with tenants during the pandemic in fact during the third quarter we signed several new tenants that were forthcoming and telling us that they were coming to our centers specifically because of our performance over the past year and their interest in building a long term relationship with roic in terms of our specific leasing activity during the third quarter we had another strong active quarter leasing 375 000 square feet of space in total including signing 49 new tenants all of which being in line space and we renewed 72 tenants 69 of which were in line space renewals and three that were anchor renewals two of those anchors being longtime supermarket tenants and one being a longtime pharmacy tenant with respect to releasing spreads same space comparative rents on new leases increased by 10 9 and renewal rents increased by 5 2 during the third quarter these spreads are on a cash basis so they don t capture future contractual rent steps during the lease term as we ve commented before during the past year a number of tenants have requested keeping their initial rent at the same level as the expiring rent and then having greater rent steps in the future years in addition to getting higher rent steps in the future our tenant improvement commitment is notably lower looking ahead at the remainder of 2021 we have no anchor leases scheduled to expire and we only have 154 000 square feet of in line space expiring between now and year end while that would suggest a fairly quiet fourth quarter in terms of leasing we continue to work very hard to capitalize on the demand for space across our portfolio creatively recapturing and relocating existing tenants accordingly we expect to have another active successful quarter in terms of leasing additionally we are also highly focused on getting new tenants open as quickly and efficiently as possible as you may recall the economic spread between leased and billed space at the beginning of the third quarter the spread stood at 4 5 representing 10 4 million in additional incremental annual rent on a cash basis we are pleased to report that during the third quarter tenants representing 1 9 million opened their stores and started paying rent as it stands now we are on track to get open more than double the amount of incremental rent that we achieved last year taking the 1 9 million into account together with our leasing activity during the third quarter which totaled 1 5 million in new incremental rent as of september 30th approximately 10 million of incremental cash base rent had not yet commenced as it s shaping up so far we currently expect to have a strong fourth quarter in terms of getting new tenants open and operating now i ll turn the call back over to stuart stuart a tanz chief executive officer thanks rich just to underscore rich s comments regarding leasing our biggest priority coming out of the pandemic is bringing the right best new tenants to our centers tenants that will complement our existing tenancies and will serve to grow customer frequency as well as enhance the appeal and long term value of our properties as rich indicated demand for space continues to be strong across our portfolio there are a number of important fundamental factors that are driving the ongoing demand for space across our portfolio three of which i would like to highlight first is the location of our shopping centers our properties are well situated in the heart of densely populated communities communities that are sought after given their demographic profile by a growing and diverse number of necessity based service and destination tenants the second driver of the demand for space at our centers is the fact that our properties are anchored by strong well established supermarkets that have a long history of drawing very consistent reliable daily traffic to our shopping centers daily traffic that benefits all of our tenants the third driver that is often overlooked is that our shopping centers are located in sought after mature markets that are among the most highly protected markets in the country with significant barriers to entry which in turn has greatly limited new supply in our core west coast markets over the years looking ahead given that civic leaders and city planners are very focused today in addressing the growing housing shortage on the west coast prioritizing new housing development we expect that our shopping centers will continue to be highly protected going forward lastly in terms of acquisitions beyond the properties that we currently have under contract we are continuing to work hard at sourcing additional acquisitions focusing primarily on off market relationship driven opportunities to acquire irreplaceable properties while these types of opportunities can be a bit unpredictable in terms of deal flow and timing we are optimistic based on our ongoing discussions in the current level of interest of potentially having an active robust year in 2022 of growing our portfolio again in summary with all of this in mind from potential acquisition opportunities the strong demand for space in the underlying fundamental drivers we continue to be excited about roic s future prospects and we are confident in our ability to continue building long term value now we will open up the call for your questions operator questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of katy mcconnell from citi your line is now open stuart a tanz chief executive officer good morning katy michael b haines chief financial officer hey kate katy mcconnell citi analyst good morning everyone so first for the 10 million leasing pipeline at what point would you expect that pool to be fully online and do you anticipate any meaningful rent commencement delays resulting from supply chain disruptions or labor shortages in your market richard k schoebel chief operating officer you know it s always hard to predict we currently expect that by year end tenants representing around 2 million or maybe as much as 3 million of the 10 million spread will open our doors and commence paying rent but i think as you touched on there could be some impacts from the supply chain but so far we haven t seen a meaningful impact but it could going forward temporarily delay some tenants from getting open as they well to week to get their fixtures and others inventory just hard to predict katy mcconnell citi analyst okay got it and then could you discuss the pricing of the acquisitions that you ve secured to date and how much of a spread are you seeing generally between marketed and off market deals that you re looking at today stuart a tanz chief executive officer well deals that are widely marketed in very good locations are trading right now in the five i would say sub five cap rate range on the west coast for us it s a matter of these relationships that we have and the ability to execute with sellers that know us well and we have the ability to execute pretty quickly or probably quicker than most sellers and because of our depth of experience and operating for close to 30 years we have a pretty good understanding of the issues that others that other potential buyers do not or have trouble getting their hands around katy mcconnell citi analyst okay great thanks richard k schoebel chief operating officer thank you stuart a tanz chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of wes golladay from baird your line is now open stuart a tanz chief executive officer good morning wes wes golladay baird analyst hey stuart i want to go back to that comment about a robust 2022 could you maybe put that in context to what roic was doing between 2011 and 2017 is the pipeline somewhat comparable to that or maybe in between what you ve been doing in the last few years stuart a tanz chief executive officer well of course during the pandemic we really didn t do much but going back before the pandemic in the earlier years in mid years of the company we were acquiring close to 200 million to 300 million a year and assets the pipeline for 2022 is looking as robust as it was back then right now wes golladay baird analyst okay fantastic and then i guess you did mention on the call planned recaptures is that going to be meaningful or is it will be just mainly shops or will there be any anchors in that richard k schoebel chief operating officer i think again another one that s hard to predict it s obviously driven by the our ability to recapture but there will probably be a mix of combining some shop space to accommodate larger format tenants along with potentially rightsizing some anchors as well which we ve done throughout the years wes golladay baird analyst okay and was there any meaningful changes to the any of the drivers of the guidance i think you reaffirmed it for the ffo share you mentioned maybe some atm issuance may drive your acquisitions but i guess looking at the core same store noi and bad debt is that all tracking which you expected michael b haines chief financial officer yeah i would say excuse me i would say so yes we kept we just reaffirmed that basically the biggest wildcard for the rest of the year is getting the tenants open as rich mentioned we currently expect that the strong quarter getting those tenants in the fourth quarter and if its something that happens it could be the toward the higher end but that could potentially be offset or if we were to raise a bit more equity during the quarter and the timing of that and the amount that i think there is wes golladay baird analyst great thanks everyone stuart a tanz chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of rj milligan from raymond james your line is now open stuart a tanz chief executive officer good morning rj rj milligan raymond james analyst hey good morning just my first question is for rich the 10 million gap between economic and leased occupancy can you talk about the cadence of that 10 million coming online when do you expect that to be in fully in the numbers richard k schoebel chief operating officer so again i think we re hopeful during the 4th quarter we could get as much as 3 million to upwards of 3 million commenced obviously we ll be also adding to that number during the quarter and so we would expect that of the existing 10 million the majority of that will be done by the second quarter or online by the second quarter of 2022 but again we ll be adding to that number throughout that period of time rj milligan raymond james analyst okay and you guys in your prepared remarks you mentioned the backfilling or some of the covid fallout with stronger tenants i m just curious which types of tenants are still on the watch list and given sort of the recovery that we ve seen post covid do you expect fallout to be long or less than your long term average over the next say year or two given the fact that you have been successful in backfilling the vacancy that you ve had richard k schoebel chief operating officer yeah i mean i think the one the tenants that have really struggled through covid included the dry cleaners some of the more boutique y type of fitness tenants and some of the personal services nail salons threading and things like that most of those tenants are back open and operating and doing quite well at this point but there probably will still be some fallout of tenants that got over extended during the pandemic rj milligan raymond james analyst okay and then one last question which is more bigger picture for stuart stuart you and a lot of your peers seem to be ramping up acquisitions which obviously seem too big mergers in the sector do you think we re at the start of an acquisition cycle or do you think this is just a smaller window where buyers see upside and nois due to covid disruption and i guess maybe you could put that also in the context of record low cap rates for the sector and where there is opportunity to increase those going in yields stuart a tanz chief executive officer well obviously the global picture will drive a lot of this whether it s interest rates or anything that could happen in terms of the coming out of the pandemic if something were to happen but when you look on the ground today the pipeline of deals is extremely strong there seem to be a law there during the pandemic where sellers pulled back and now that things now that money is available both from a financing and a capital perspective it certainly has accelerated in the minds of a number of owners to bring their properties to market i think that s going to continue for a while and i think that from the sector s perspective i think it will certainly play well into reits growing their portfolio during the next certainly six months to a year depending on what happens of course with interest rates and other things that we cannot control rj milligan raymond james analyst okay great thanks guys stuart a tanz chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of juan sanabria from bmo capital markets your line is now open stuart a tanz chief executive officer good morning juan sanabria bmo capital market analyst good morning just hoping you could going back to i think it was wes s question on guidance for same store noi and any color on where you expect to be given the year to date i think is q2 relative to the previously communicated range of q4 and what the drivers are this is just the lease commencement between the high and low end of whatever the range is today michael b haines chief financial officer well i guess what i would say each quarter bounces around a little bit but it largely depends on the time in getting new tenants open in the fourth quarter and as it stands now we think same center noi for the year which should still be in the 3 range juan sanabria bmo capital market analyst okay and then on the rent bumps that you talked about negotiating with tenants to have a similar new rate when they re on the new lease but getting bigger bumps can you just describe or quantify how much rent bumps have moved in and what the split is between kind of fixed and floating and what are callers there may be in place given inflation is a bit higher than we all anticipated a year ago richard k schoebel chief operating officer sure i mean i think in terms of renewals some of those flat rents are per the terms of the lease that particularly you would see with an anchor tenant but in terms of the shop tenants they just don t want to see a big spike in the rent right away upfront so keeping that rent flat helps them come out of the pandemic and then we re getting higher rent steps on the back end but on average for a shop lease you re going to see a 3 maybe a 3 5 annual increase for that extended term juan sanabria bmo capital market analyst okay great thank you very much richard k schoebel chief operating officer you re welcome stuart a tanz chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of craig schmidt from bank of america your line is now open stuart a tanz chief executive officer good morning craig craig schmidt bank of america analyst good morning i m wondering if the funding of new acquisitions in 22 will include additional asset sales stuart a tanz chief executive officer the answer is we are currently finishing up the budgeting process right now it will be done shortly and then we will begin analyzing 22 in terms of asset sales the answer to your question is probably yes depending on obviously market conditions but yes we will continue to look at churning some of our capital and as it relates to growing our portfolio in 22 craig schmidt bank of america analyst great and are you able to give us a sense of what the disposition cap rates was for the 70 million you sold year to date stuart a tanz chief executive officer yes the blended cap rate craig was about 7 in sacramento craig schmidt bank of america analyst great and then you re pretty much approaching your high occupancy do you still think you can take it higher by the end of the year or given the 97 9 previous peak you re 97 4 may not move stuart a tanz chief executive officer well you know look i think if the demand continues to stay at the current levels that we ve seen i do think we re going to get back to the pre pandemic occupancy levels a lot quicker than most whether that s the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year i do think that we will get to that number pretty quickly and we may go beyond it at this point given how strong the demand is from that we re seeing out there in terms of filling primarily our in line space so i m excited looking ahead in terms of where things are going the again the demand has been extremely strong to think that we could pick up 50 basis points in just one quarter alone is quite an achievement not only for our team but also showing you how strong the market is at west craig schmidt bank of america analyst great thanks a lot stuart a tanz chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of todd thomas from keybanc capital your line is now open stuart a tanz chief executive officer good morning todd todd thomas keybanc capital market analyst hi good morning i wanted to follow up on your comments around the acquisition pipeline moving forward it sounds like you re seeing potential to deploy capital in that 200 million to 300 million dollar range similar to where the company was during much of the last decade is the appetite for investments there would you look to do that sort of volume if there was an opportunity and we continue to hear about cap rate compression and more competition for retail properties do you think that you can still achieve the 6 going in yield as you move forward stuart a tanz chief executive officer well you know it s obviously a tough answer to a tough question to answer given that you are asking me to look forward but in terms of what we see in our pipeline right now i think we can certainly be buying around that number maybe probably a bit less given the cap rate compression but more importantly what we re buying has juice that s what s really important the abr on these assets are low gives us the ability to do what we ve done in the past in terms of getting very strong increases going forward and more importantly delivering that yield that 100 to 150 basis point spread after buying these assets given the acumen from our management skills and leasing so i m very positive looking at where we sit right now as we move into 22 and i do think that given our cost of capital today that we ll be able to achieve those results given hopefully given market conditions stay the way they are todd thomas keybanc capital market analyst okay that s helpful and yeah maybe rich in terms of the abr for the portfolio today the abr for some of the acquisitions we ve seen retail sales on a national basis sort of pick up and reset at a higher level is there any way to sort of characterize the portfolio s health ratio or occupancy cost ratio today relative to where it was maybe pre pandemic just given some of the increases in sales that we ve seen across the board richard k schoebel chief operating officer yeah well i think as you re touching on we are seeing across the board for the tenants that report sales strong growth in those sales numbers we don t in our business get sales from all the tenants so some of those are a bit hard to nail down exactly what the increase is but from anecdotal conversations with the tenant base many of them have had very strong sales and obviously that s improving there their occupancy costs todd thomas keybanc capital market analyst okay i know historically you don t collect a lot of percentage rent or overage rent do you anticipate seeing an increase in that in the near term richard k schoebel chief operating officer yes i mean i think again depending on the use there have been some very strong sales some have pushed tenants into percentage rent and whether that s offset by other tenants that have decreased in their sales what that net is going to be we really won t know until probably the first quarter because some of these sales are done on an annual basis calendar year but i would expect that it will be a bit stronger than last year todd thomas keybanc capital market analyst okay and then just back to the acquisitions real quick how should we think about funding acquisitions if you do get back to sort of the level that you re talking about in the 200 million range or maybe more you ve been active on the atm you continue to be efficient through the atm at the current level or pace would you anticipate needing to raise capital through maybe an offering if you return to that 200 million to 300 million level or more and on our and are you comfortable with that where the stocks trading today michael b haines chief financial officer mike on the acquisition front we would likely utilize our credit line lease commercially and we will also look to raise equity in step of closing those transactions obviously the goal one of the goals is to keep our current financial ratios intact as far as the market conditions is very kind of subjective to us about where the stock price is but we ll see how it plays out over the next three to six months we ve stuart a tanz chief executive officer i mean it s a combination of free cash flow which is very strong right now given our payout ratio it s a combination of hitting the market when we think it s the right time to hit and it s a combination of turning our capital in terms of asset sales it s those three that will help fund this pipeline going forward todd todd thomas keybanc capital market analyst okay got it what s free cash flow what was free cash flow in the third quarter roughly michael b haines chief financial officer it s probably about 12 5 million it s about 40 million or so for the year stuart a tanz chief executive officer it s a big number michael b haines chief financial officer into the reset of the dividend yeah todd thomas keybanc capital market analyst okay great all right thank you stuart a tanz chief executive officer thanks tom operator your next question comes from the line of mike mueller from jp morgan your line is now open michael mueller jp morgan analyst yeah hi stuart a tanz chief executive officer good morning michael michael mueller jp morgan analyst hey good morning just a quick follow up to craig s question what s the highest if you look at this portfolio or maybe even back to pan what s the highest physical occupancy level that you ve generally run at stuart a tanz chief executive officer if you go all the way back to the pan pacific days the management team today which is the same management team i have had seen we ran as high as i believe it was in the low 98 range that s where we were during the pan pacific is which is basically 100 occupied because you re always going to have a tenant that is going to either through a divorce or partnership break up or other things not extend the term of their lease or not renew so you always have some fractional vacancy at that level you re basically pretty well leased and well then that helps us drive rents at that point i mean that s the secret of getting these high rents that we ve reported year after year both the p p and at roic its that occupancy and we certainly see us heading in that same direction right now michael mueller jp morgan analyst okay and at 98 leased that would translate into about what on the physical side on the build side richard k schoebel chief operating officer i mean it s hard again it s hard to predict because we don t know when that s going to come online but it s probably a 2 to 3 spread in terms of build versus leased at that point i would guess michael mueller jp morgan analyst got it okay michael b haines chief financial officer and our gaap price right now little on 5 right now stuart a tanz chief executive officer yeah what because of the pandemic michael b haines chief financial officer right stuart a tanz chief executive officer but the other thing again todd and i think you know this not todd but mike i think you know that well is that the company leases double what rolls over in the portfolio year after year so that s being sort of active very active versus being proactive and i think that continues to look like it s where we re heading right now in terms of the velocity of our tenant base and achieving strong releasing spreads michael mueller jp morgan analyst got it i appreciate it thank you stuart a tanz chief executive officer yeah michael b haines chief financial officer thank you mike operator your next question comes from the line of katy mcconnell from citi your line is now open michael b haines chief financial officer great it s michael gorman here stuart a tanz chief executive officer good morning hey michael how are you michael gorman btig analyst very good stuart and hey mike so i just had a couple of questions as you outlined sort of the capital sources free cash flow atm asset sales how are you thinking about monetizing any of the entitlements on one side to generate capital and advance those projects but also thinking about raising institutional capital either in a jv or fund format or in other ways in terms of another sort of tool in the toolkit to be able to fund these great acquisitions that you re being able to source given your long term presence in the market stuart a tanz chief executive officer so in terms of entitlements or in terms of our our densification that is going well and we are looking at potentially selling off two of the three projects right now and those should be fully entitled bellevue is already entitled and it s construction drawings for permitting but pinole and novato it s very close to being entitled and the goal there is probably to sell those assets that could generate another 30 million to 40 million of proceeds in terms of jvs as you probably know michael gorman btig analyst yeah stuart a tanz chief executive officer and i think you ve known us now for almost three decades michael gorman btig analyst pool floor and i get all that stuart a tanz chief executive officer right michael gorman btig analyst i know going through the pandemic you looked at other things and i would assume other people are calling you they want to get into the market and whether you want to stuart a tanz chief executive officer right michael gorman btig analyst that capital or not at the risk of complicating the story and things like that i know you ve been open to it i just didn t know where your current mindset was and whether the institutional investors are more aggressively calling you to deploy that capital stuart a tanz chief executive officer yeah look they are aggressively calling us and we are looking at as we always do we have an open mind for everything but it s got to be a the perfect deal as you would say for us to even consider that but certainly at the present time we re not considering going off balance sheet it s just from experience we ve always learned decade after decade market after market as markets go turn back and forth that having a clean structure is what investors really want they want a straightforward transparent structure that in the end really delivers what i would call very transparent results michael gorman btig analyst okay and then bellevue was supposed to i think originally start in the first quarter i assume if that s not the case right now so is there sort of an updated timing as we think about the growth potential in these projects stuart a tanz chief executive officer yeah i mean look the project is going well just in terms of trying to get to the finish line and getting a permit however there is so much activity in belgium the city of bellevue right now that the city just can t handle the amount of permitting whether it s amazon or others so we anticipate now this project really starting in the third or fourth quarter of next year and it s just because there s so much demand out there i mean every time we get on the phone with our construction people and our project manager although we are moving through the process we just keep hearing that the city is it just keeps getting backlogged and more backlogged and more backlogged so michael gorman btig analyst yeah stuart a tanz chief executive officer so right now it does look like it s going to be the third or fourth quarter of next year before that project could break ground michael gorman btig analyst okay great and then just last one that we had was just sort of reconciling a little bit on the guidance into 4q and thinking about the run rate and variables for 22 i know right now you ve maintained guidance which would imply 0 24 to 0 28 range for the fourth quarter 0 04 is a pretty wide range especially given the fact you gave 0 25 in the third quarter which we ve seen the base i recognize you have the asset sale that happened late in the quarter i recognize the acquisitions could be later it just seems like even if the acquisitions are later even if they happen in the beginning of the quarters probably only a penny if that just given the yield and one quarter contribution we re already in november so just help us sort of push like what gets you to 0 28 and what in the world would ever get you to 0 24 it just seems like your guidance really should be more 0 25 to 0 26 rather than this wider range stuart a tanz chief executive officer well i think as rich touched on i mean a lot of this is getting these tenants open and paying rent and we and we are that is moving along at a pretty good pace but there is so much uncertainty out there in terms of either supply or the fact that retailers are still having a hard time getting good employees that that it s just being somewhat conservative but really erring on the side of being conservative that you still have the pandemic out there and although it s we re getting out of this pandemic you just don t know what can happen and we as a management team we just tend to be more conservative michael gorman btig analyst no i get that i just didn t know if there was something i mean you re talking about every penny is a 1 000 003 i didn t know if there were something that takes you to the high end which 0 28 seems like a pretty big ramp from 0 25 and by the same token stuart i don t see why you should step back in ffo heading into the fourth quarter and i understand all the conservatism but that s your range right and so i m just trying to understand if there is variables that we don t know about that would drive it one way or the other because as we think about 2022 really understanding what the 4q is in the run rate your consensus numbers are currently are at like a buck or seven bucks away 0 26 0 27 cents a quarter so where you re coming out of and what the drivers are for next year are very important so that s why i was trying to get a little bit more sort of meat on the bones to understand that stuart a tanz chief executive officer well the only thing that s out there mike that could move the needle a bit is we are litigating with a couple of very large tenants due to them shutting down it actually didn t shut down during the pandemic they just didn t pay rent and we ve reserved most of that and so if that gets resolved during the fourth quarter that could move the needle michael gorman btig analyst that s one time in nature i m really thinking about stuart a tanz chief executive officer that is correct michael gorman btig analyst is that embedded in the 0 24 to 0 28 or that s in addition to that stuart a tanz chief executive officer no it is not that could move the needle but again we re erring on the side of being conservative and rich i don t know if there s anything else from a just from a tenant perspective that you see yeah michael gorman btig analyst i m just wondering like what takes you up to 0 28 like you re doing 0 25 in the third quarter moving up 0 03 is a big thing and if you re at 0 28 in the fourth quarter then the numbers are too low for next year so that s i it s just an awfully wide range i can understand the conservatism at 0 24 0 25 i m just trying to understand how you get the 0 27 0 28 stuart a tanz chief executive officer well i mean again it could be just the fact that we get a lot more tenants open and paying rent that s really what could drive that number and again we re erring a bit on the conservative side but that s really what in my view could drive that number up michael gorman btig analyst and so if it doesn t happen the 4th quarter it should happen the first quarter since we think about 1q you should be getting up to that higher end level pending any aggressive dispositions are aggressive equity raise right stuart a tanz chief executive officer that is correct michael gorman btig analyst right so then that has an upward bias as we think about next year enrolling in that if you only do 0 25 0 26 in the fourth quarter you get those tenants open later you re rolling in it at 0 27 0 28 as we start the year stuart a tanz chief executive officer yeah michael gorman btig analyst okay all right thank you so much stuart a tanz chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of linda tsai from jefferies your line is now open stuart a tanz chief executive officer good morning linda tsai jefferies analyst good morning in terms of the dividend is the view that you would continue to maintain the current rate in order to allocate that cash toward acquisitions and delivering stuart a tanz chief executive officer in terms of the dividend we can we intend to continue conserving as much cash flow as possible that s really our top priority in terms of the dividend with that in mind we intend to continue to maintain a dividend that s in line with the minimum amount required for reits linda tsai jefferies analyst got it and then just in terms of your longer term growth expectations you ve discussed getting 2 5 to 3 5 on a blended basis from contractual rent increases across the portfolio how much do you think external growth contributes in 22 or 23 stuart a tanz chief executive officer well again hard to predict in terms of how much we re going to acquire at this point but if we certainly meet some of the goals that we think we can set for the year i think that will have a positive benefit in terms of earnings growth it just depends on how much we acquire and how fast we acquire it in terms of that earnings growth but we re looking things are looking pretty positive sitting here today as we look into next year linda tsai jefferies analyst thanks operator your next question comes from the line of chris lucas from capital one your line is now open stuart a tanz chief executive officer good morning chris chris lucas capital one securities analyst good morning how are you guys doing stuart a tanz chief executive officer we re doing well how about yourself chris lucas capital one securities analyst good hey just a couple of follow ups stuart maybe if i could for mike on your balance sheet can you remind us what your guide rails are it relates to leverage from a net debt to ebitda basis you are sort of in them i think in the mid sixes roughly right now michael b haines chief financial officer you really get down to six six that obviously mid sixes mid to low sixes is really kind of the goal chris lucas capital one securities analyst okay and then on the kind of going back to some of the other questions as it relates to just sort of the cadence of rent commencing so rich you mentioned 2 million to 3 million in the fourth quarter we re one month in i m assuming that there is a point in december which nothing really gets delivered so we kind of got maybe four five weeks we re really looking at that is the variance here is there a single tenant or is it just a variety of a number of tenants that is sort of the delta here in terms of openings richard k schoebel chief operating officer it s a variety of tenants i mean there are some of the larger tenants in there as well and you know that are working through permitting processes which are a bit more drawn out given how busy the cities are as stuart touched on so go ahead chris lucas capital one securities analyst i was just going to say is permitting the biggest wildcard for you it s not the materials its not getting the work done it s getting the final permits out richard k schoebel chief operating officer yeah i would say that s probably the biggest driver is the permitting process i mean we do have a couple of tenants that have experienced some delays in getting whether the fixtures their ff e in and installed and we have a couple of tenants that are fully built out that have had some challenges finding employees but in some of those cases their rent is going to commence regardless of their ability to find an employee chris lucas capital one securities analyst okay and then sort of of the total signed but not opened bucket the 10 million is there any anchor leases in that bucket or is it all shop space richard k schoebel chief operating officer there is an anchor lease in that bucket yeah we re working through the permitting process right now chris lucas capital one securities analyst and you still expect to have everything all of that 10 million essentially in place and paying by the middle of next year richard k schoebel chief operating officer yes chris lucas capital one securities analyst okay the last question i had just had to do with the mix of sort of tenants that are in your portfolio as it relates to national versus regional versus the local has that is that mix shifted at all in any meaningful way from one bucket to the other pre covid to now richard k schoebel chief operating officer i don t think so i mean i think again it always depends on the space that you have available that would fit a particular user s needs i think that there may be a fewer of the local tenants out there today but there are still local tenants out there and we are seeing very strong demand from the regional operators as well as the nationals chris lucas capital one securities analyst okay and then michael my last question is for you it relates to just the sort of so second quarter you had sort of reversals to bad debt it was a positive for gaap income and then this quarter the number was negative again was there any positive reversals that sort of a net number was negative or can you give me a lot more detail as to what was in that five negative 548 000 michael b haines chief financial officer sure yeah so the 548 000 you re referring to during the third quarter as we always a careful tenant by tenant analysis we reversed 932 000 of previous bad debt reserves but then that was offset by approximately 1 5 million of new bad debt booked in the third quarter and that s what resulted in 548 000 now that equates to the 548 000 is less than 1 of our total revenue its kind of our in line historical norm chris lucas capital one securities analyst okay thank you that s all i had michael b haines chief financial officer yeah richard k schoebel chief operating officer thanks operator this like your next question comes from the line of tammi fique from wells fargo your line is now open stuart a tanz chief executive officer good morning tammi tammi fique wells fargo analyst good morning thank you for taking my call just wondering it looks like the year to date leases signed have a shorter term versus what you were signing in 2019 i guess i m just wondering if there are specific reasons that either roic or the tenants are looking to sign shorter term leases today or if it s just kind of a mix richard k schoebel chief operating officer it always is a mix there have been a few tenants that have wanted shorter term which to be hon9est i think works to our advantage but because in three years time if we have to sign the 3 years lease i think we re going to be in more of a landlord market at that point but again it really depends i mean some tenants are coming to us and looking to lock in 10 years of term we ve had several tenants this quarter who are exercising a 5 year option but asking for more committed term right now i think we see a lot with the restaurant tenants i think they want to secure those locations for the long term so we don t like to hand out options we d rather get committed term so it is a bit of a mixed bag tammi fique wells fargo analyst okay thanks and then rich maybe just one more question for you you spoke about some potential additional pandemic related fallout from some of the smaller shop tenants that are over extended i guess i m just wondering if that fallout is still greater today than you ve seen historically or if you feel like the environment for move outs is fairly normal at this point richard k schoebel chief operating officer i think it s really fairly normal there s always a churn as stuart touched on and i don t think we re not seeing a lot of distress in the tenant base right now it s a handful of tenants that struggled through the pandemic tammi fique wells fargo analyst okay great and then maybe just one last one for stuart the couple of acquisitions and you closed on in the third quarter they have pretty high occupancy in place i guess i m just wondering if you can talk about the specifics of the 2 assets that you acquired that can drive sort of that upside 100 150 basis points that you referenced and then maybe give us a sense for how long it will take to capture that upside thank you stuart a tanz chief executive officer well the upside is really coming through the efficiency of management in terms of on the margin it s coming through leasing up to our historical norms which is 100 and we are have made some really nice strides since closing the transactions to hit those goals and it s really to reposition a couple of the way of some tenants that are coming up for renewal that we know won t renew it s a combination of all of those and that s progressing very well and you know i m sitting here today and i m probably going to tell you that the yields are going to move pretty quickly in terms of heading getting toward the thresholds that we like to move these yields to after buying these assets so very very high quality assets with very good tenants and we re excited about these acquisitions a couple of these deals happen before that we came out of the pandemic in terms of the relationships and getting them tied up and we have the advantage of obviously striking because of buying at the right price to really really drive some nice value for shareholders in a very short period of time tammi fique wells fargo analyst okay great thank you for your time stuart a tanz chief executive officer thank you operator i am showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference back to mr stuart tanz stuart a tanz chief executive officer in closing i d to thank all of you for

twas the halloween of 1968 and black shadows seeped from behind buildings pouring into the streets of the city the shadows became forms dressed as witches inspiring terror and awe as they came to a halt carrying faux roasted boar heads the group requested an audience with satan at the new york stock exchange as they ordained wall street wall street mightiest wall of all street trick or treat the corporate elite up against the wall street the first of several performative activism zaps to come this protest united what became known as the women s international terrorist conspiracy from hell w i t c h throughout history the witch has taken on several different connotations but w i t c h took it to a new level as part of the fight for gender equality the group was created from a surge in interest in feminist activism following a miss america protest wherein picketers compared the pageant to a livestock competition the name serves as a reference to witches throughout history those scapegoats who have taken the blame for the ills of society portrayed as the ultimate female transgressor although their movement died out fairly quickly their message continues on through the work of activists today as women find themselves being condemned of faults not their own vying to win a seat on the erie county council lydia laythe speaks from both her political experience and her work as a trauma therapist it s easier to blame and scapegoat someone else particularly someone who doesn t have a voice in the conversation or a seat at the table laythe said it s the reason why wealthy conservative white men like donald trump blame immigrants or people of color for the ills of the working white poor it s a lot easier to blame someone who s not there than to take responsibility and take accountability ourselves for the issues we face during the 1960s and 70s protests radical feminists gave power to middle class white women using the witch as a symbol doing exactly what its opponents accused it of distorting traditional values that devalue women these sorts of historical beliefs are still embedded subconsciously in our culture in our government and in the ways we operate laythe vocalized it s really easy to miss how our beliefs and our assumptions have not evolved as our medical and scientific knowledge has evolved we still hold onto these beliefs that were made out of total fallacy laythe explained that many of these past beliefs relate back to aristotle s teachings in de generatione animalium aristotle explained the woman was merely a means to incubate the human form that the male created if the offspring was born female aristotle referred to it as imperfect and the female was blamed for not properly nursing the offspring in the womb this theory was adapted into the teachings of famous philosophers such as st thomas aquinas and st augustine affecting religious teachings and the basic understanding of reproduction joan chittister a benedictine sister of erie addresses these outdated and largely misunderstood religious beliefs in her 2019 book the time is now a call to uncommon courage chittister describes how male ministers chose rigid compliance with church laws to remain superior powerful and primary when in fact jesus healed the outcast and enemies and gathered men and women equally to his side she continues on to say the church to this day disposes of women as secondary to god s plan for discipleship despite the model of jesus and his openness to women as leaders in her book chittister declares there is a moment in life that we begin to understand too what da vinci meant when he warned us nothing strengthens authority so much as silence then our simpering silence ends and the prophetic spirit in us rises as it is always meant to do at that moment we become free although new waves of feminism have emerged since the 60s and 70s many of the issues surrounding reproductive rights and diversity are still present in modern feminism many of the movements created in the past were based on the needs of white women jasmine flores running to be the first latina elected to erie city council said she limits her interactions with activism to those who are inclusive of all identities we have lots of work to do in erie to be inclusive and diverse flores explained i personally limit my interactions with the demographic that practice old school mentalities and refuse to step in line to changing times before they run out of time i focus on engaging with my community to bring us together to fight for our needs to be met as a unified front laythe commented on the subject as well saying that today feminism is intersectional i think the previous approaches to feminism were a little biased laythe observed we need to be doing more to support everyone as we grow and evolve as a movement i think it just needs to be bigger we re learning that everything is interconnected and if we are truly trying to empower women or to empower marginalized people we have to empower everyone as for the kind of performative activism w i t c h practiced flores believes there s no place for it in today s era as there are many problems in the erie community that people could put their efforts toward the tricks of old are turning to tricks of the new as even the symbol of the witch looks to change the narrative and see women s power as a good thing from glinda the good witch of oz to disney s maleficent to hermione granger and countless more the movement toward equality is still only growing larger and as mike roeder once said it s better to build a longer table than a taller fence tricks and treats aside make this halloween a little more magical no matter witch cause you fight for chloe forbes can be reached at cforbes

originally published on social matter march 20 2018 why go about detailing the effects of a valium overdose when it is clear beyond any reasonable doubt that the teenager m s j died of sorrow so reads in full the entry titled the redundant autopsy by andres gallardo in his poetic collection of fictional obituaries though written by a chilean and first published in mexico in 1989 the point is well received in america today whether it be valium xanax klonopin fentanyl or oxycontin americans are sad and the pills we take to treat that sadness are killing us and as the bodies of overdose victims stack up in morgues overworked medical examiners are indeed not bothering to perform what would assuredly be redundant autopsies on each one in 2014 47 055 americans died of drug overdoses 10 574 of those deaths were from heroin 21 103 were from natural semisynthetic and synthetic opioids including methadone in other words prescription drugs such as fentanyl and oxycontin that was the first year the opioid crisis began to gain national attention but as is often the case things only got worse in 2015 52 404 americans died of drug overdoses 12 989 of those deaths were from heroin 25 608 were from natural semisynthetic and synthetic opioids including methadone in 2016 63 600 americans died of drug overdoses 15 400 of those deaths were from heroin 37 680 were from natural semisynthetic and synthetic opioids including methadone here s a chart summarizing these numbers current year total overdose deaths total heroin overdose deaths total non heroin opioid including methadone overdose deaths 2014 47 055 10 574 21 103 2015 52 404 12 989 25 608 2016 63 600 15 400 37 680 sources for numbers are here here here and here at present overdoses of any kind are the leading cause of death for americans under the age of fifty with opioid overdoses leading the pack the average life expectancy in the u s has gone down two years in a row now almost entirely because of this source no one is hopeful that the numbers for 2017 when released will show signs of a lessening crisis after all the sources of the pain fueling the drug use are not lessening namely demographic displacement and economic dispossession and those are trends we ought to strive to reverse but let s face it that will take a while in the meantime we should use state power to ebb the rising tide of fatal ennui this particular effort let s call it the opioid war to differentiate it from the generic drug war and the opium wars of the past will be unique for one big reason most of the drugs are being made legally granted heroin is a big part of the problem as well but that is being fueled by addicts switching to it from pills as the center for disease control and prevention has noted past misuse of prescription opioids is the strongest risk factor for heroin initiation and use especially among people who became dependent upon or abused prescription opioids in the past year the increased availability of heroin its relatively low price compared to prescription opioids and high purity appear to be major drivers of the upward trend in heroin use overdoses and deaths that is to say that the fundamental problem is the pills and while there are now more than a few illegal manufacturers of these pills again few addicts start there as andrew sullivan recently pointed out in his heartbreaking look at the opioid crisis 75 percent of those addicted to opioids in the united states began with prescription painkillers given to them by a friend family member or dealer incredibly the source of this country s most fatal drug binge is legally available prescription drugs of course if the prescription pills were suddenly unavailable most every user would rapidly switch over to heroin or street pills as plenty have already done ergo and ironically the opening act in the opioid war should be to cut off sources of heroin and poppies the root plant for non synthetic opioids in preparation for the cut off of pharmaceutical opioids keeping heroin poppy out of the country is easier than most people would have you think almost none of it is cultivated in the united states and between 75 and 85 percent of the world s heroin comes from one country afghanistan all ties between america and that shithole should be closed our military should completely withdraw our embassy closed diplomatic relations severed and trade completely banned as it is with cuba they produce nothing of value and we should have ended our occupation of the country years ago anyway the ensuing chaos and violence will almost certainly cut down the heroin business immensely if islamists or the chinese take over it will end completely china s approach on crime makes richard nixon look like michael dukakis and the taliban was quite successful in its crack down on the drug trade in the early 2000s when they cut down production by around 94 percent as the new york times put it in may of 2001 at heroin s source taliban do what just say no could not the second big source of heroin is mexico that problem is trickier but much can still be done the wall should be built its guarding force militarized and drug sniffing dogs brought out en masse non citizens caught smuggling hard drugs into the country should face a minimum of 20 years in prison before deportation if we can put a man on the moon aid insurgencies across the globe and occupy other nations on a whim we can secure the border simultaneously we can incentivize the mexican government to do its part tie all foreign aid to demonstrated progress on combating the drug lords build them free maximum security prisons in exchange for increased arrests and harsher penalties for dealers let them know that ending the flow of drugs into our country is their number one priority as the flow of heroin lessens which may well increase prescription abuse the opioid war will really get going its most important operation will be the day national guardsmen are sent into the executive offices of every pharmaceutical company in the country that manufactures opioids there the denizens of the c suite will be told that they have one calendar year to come out with non lethal versions of their painkillers or their companies will be nationalized in the interest of public health the targeted companies will be the manufacturers some localities in america have already begun litigating against for their role in the opioid crisis purdue pharma allergan and endo health solutions among others given that they only follow orders the distributors and major pharmacies walgreens cvs et al can be left out of it ultimately not every single guilty party needs its skyscraper occupied the threat of state intervention with the barrel of a gun will be sufficiently frightening that the entire industry will fall in line the idea would be to introduce to the pharmaceutical industry what libertarian economic historian robert higgs calls regime uncertainty as defined by the mises wiki regime uncertainty is a pervasive lack of confidence among investors in their ability to foresee the extent to which future government actions will alter their private property rights normally this is meant to describe the kind of economic slump a country can enter in when every major industry is fearful that it may be next in line to get nationalized so risky innovation infrastructure maintenance and investment plummet that is certainly a bad thing but when an entire industry is playing and profiting with drugs that are the leading cause of death in a nation it is a good thing those companies should be fearful that some day the state s hammer will fall is nationalizing a private company legal in the u s yes and no has it been done absolutely most famously was in 1952 when president harry truman nationalized several dozen steel mills the workers at the mills were on the brink of striking and could not come to a resolution with the owners and steel production was incredibly important at the time because the u s was embroiled in the korean war president truman got fed up with both factions and pre empted the issue through nationalization three and a half months later in youngstown sheet tube co v sawyer the supreme court said the president had no authority to do this and the mills were handed back over to their prior owner however plenty of other presidents have managed nationalizations without consequence indeed president truman himself had managed to get away with it before putting the army in charge of several railroads for nearly two years and woodrow wilson did the same during world war i when fdr nationalized the apparel retailer montgomery ward the chairman had to be carried out of his office by guardsmen and though that was the most dramatic one plenty of other companies were briefly nationalized during fdr s tenure as well nationalization has occurred more recently too remember that before september 11 2001 airport security was not run by one big government agency in short in times of national emergency nationalization can be done and the opioid crisis is a national emergency as others have pointed out in 2016 more americans died from overdoses than died in the vietnam war this is an emergency and we need to act like it and as the world s finest prophet of power niccolo machiavelli advised i consider that it is better to be adventurous than cautious because fortune is a woman and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and ill use her and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by the adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly she is therefore always woman like a lover of young men because they are less cautious more violent and with more audacity command her moreover it would only take the threat of nationalization for these pill pushing companies to act businessmen tend not to be a courageous bunch none of them want to take a stand against the state if doing so risks prison and bankruptcy on top of that every one of them knows they will profit to high heaven if they are the first to develop a non lethal opioid equivalent soma if you will the stocks for all these companies will plummet immediately after the troopers show up but whoever wins the innovation race will see their stock top facebook s and they ll all know this with stakes this high i trust the american entrepreneurial spirit will save the day in the interim the press and the left will squawk about fascism reason magazine will compare president trump to adolf hitler a few legal theorists will grandstand and the calls for impeachment will be renewed but nothing will come of it meanwhile no ceo is going to bank on the senate or supreme court bailing him out of prison when instead he could just triple research funding for a drug that will make him millions if not billions of dollars none of this nor all of it put together would be a silver bullet no policy solution ever is but it would be an excellent start with new patients receiving a drug that is both less addictive and less fatal the entry point of this crisis will be largely cut off already existing addicts will still be in dire straights but new ones won t be joining them with half the regularity of today importantly everything outlined above could be done through executive actions no new laws or congressional approval would be required president trump could do this all from start to finish and he should overdose deaths will not hit zero because of these actions but they will dramatically lessen if nothing is done they will continue to rise better to take dramatic steps now instead of waiting for the body count to get higher if in one s year time no company has developed an adequate fentanyl replacement then the threatened companies should indeed be nationalized from there the government will take over the research process it was the government after all that developed the atomic bomb the hydrogen bomb and the world s most successful space program infinite funds and national determination can quite often make dreams come true this recourse does risk being struck down by scotus and has a bigger chance of blowback of other kinds including impeachment but it would be worth the risk most any risk is worth saving tens of thousands of lives lost every year over nothing better or more preventable than a quick high and should the judge roberts try attempt to check the president he could stop emulating fdr truman and wilson opt for an older democrat to emulate and say now let him enforce it

the internet is what it is today with its ability to connect people across countries time zones and cultures thanks to the friendly regulatory climate it was born into sadly the regulatory climate of 2021 is far less welcoming to disruptive technologies this is bad news for the future of u s innovation and the emerging blockchain industry whether washington takes a heavy handed or a light touch approach to crypto regulation over the next few months could make a multitrillion dollar difference over the next few years to understand how much we stand to lose as a result of bad blockchain policy it s first important to understand just how much we have gained as a result of good internet policy in the 90s it s easy to forget that the success of today s internet behemoths was anything but certain in the early years of the tech boom during the dotcom bubble of the late 90s for example many companies were dismissed as scams and some of them were but even the most promising companies were still seen as speculative bets and their stock prices were subject to extreme volatility it s also easy to forget that the very concept of the internet was foreign to most people in its early years by today s standards it was slow overly complex and difficult to use by anyone without a strong technical background many dismissed the internet as a fad including nobel prize winning economist paul krugman who made this prediction in 1998 by 2005 or so it will become clear that the internet s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine s noted a scam a fad a bubble overly complex too volatile does any of this sound familiar history doesn t rhyme so much as it plagiarizes and it s impossible to ignore that the crypto skeptics of today use the same vocabulary as the internet naysayers of yesteryear now imagine if u s policymakers had heeded the words of the internet s critics in the mid to late 90s imagine if they had cracked down on e commerce digital publishing and fledgling social media platforms to preserve the old way of doing things imagine if they had shaped regulations to stem the free flow of physical goods ideas and information made possible by the internet the american people would have missed out on trillions of dollars in economic opportunity and the bounties of the digital age would have gone to countries with more tech friendly policies this is the risk we face today we find ourselves at the dawn of a new age of american innovation like the internet before it crypto has the potential to redefine everything we know about how business politics media finance and even relationships work but if legislators give in to crypto s critics by taking a draconian approach to regulation the u s will fail to reap the economic rewards of this world changing technology and entrepreneurs will flee to friendlier shores even now the stage is being set for a blockchain brain drain take the senate passed infrastructure bill which includes a provision that would define crypto miners validators and even software developers as brokers requiring them to report information to the irs about anonymous blockchain participants that they would have no way of obtaining in effect this provision would kill the nascent defi decentralized finance industry and make it almost impossible for everyday americans to invest in new cryptocurrencies in other words this latest move sends a hostile message to blockchain advocates we don t want you here at best the senate proposal belies a gross misunderstanding of how cryptocurrencies work at worst it exposes regulatory capture and the willingness of legislators to give in to special interests sadly the threat of bad regulation doesn t end there sec chair gary gensler has expressed his belief that many digital assets are not commodities but securities and should be regulated as such following this same logic he s signaled his intent to crack down on the use of stable coins cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of the u s dollar americans are using stable coins to earn 4 to 8 percent apy on their savings through various lending programs but the sec wants to put a stop to these lending programs ostensibly to protect investors what s unclear is which government agency will protect investors from the unlimited money printing that is devaluing their dollar savings at a rate of 5 3 percent per year washington has gotten off on the wrong foot when it comes to crypto but it s not too late to correct course regulation of crypto is not necessarily a bad thing in fact it s a key step on the path to mainstream adoption it s critical however that policymakers shape regulation in a way that minimizes the risks of this new technology without eliminating its benefits congress found a way to do this with the internet in the 90s section 230 while far from perfect and in need of reform today paved the way for a flexible regulatory environment that allowed for many online companies to thrive in the famous words of jeff kosseff section 230 contains the 26 words that created the internet and it s worth adding trillions of dollars in economic wealth indeed regulatory clarity is key to extracting maximum value from the emerging crypto economy whether that value comes from defi protocols decentralized forms of social media tokenized assets nfts or some other application of blockchain technology that we can t even imagine today as policymakers seek to find the right balance on regulation they should remember that the u s didn t become the tech capital of the world by choking innovators with red tape the u s became what it is today by taking a prudential approach to regulation one that enabled the entrepreneurial spirit this is the same entrepreneurial spirit that inspired the private sector technological advances that made the apollo moon landing possible it s the same spirit that brought about smartphones millions of times more powerful than the apollo 11 guidance computers and it s the same spirit that has motivated a group of visionaries to push the boundaries of the digital frontier through blockchain technology will washington s leaders stifle that spirit to the detriment of our economy and our reputation as a global leader in innovation or will they nourish that spirit to usher in the next chapter of the digital revolution let s hope they choose the latter matt sandgren is the former staff director of the senate republican high tech task force a 15 year veteran of capitol hill he also served as a senior counsel on the senate judiciary committee and as the final chief of staff to senator orrin g hatch he is now the executive director of the orrin g hatch foundation
a new tax proposal introduced by democrats in congress on wednesday would tax the gains billionaires makes on assets to help pay for president joe bidenâ s social and climate change agenda the presidentâ s two infrastructure bills have been stalled in congress for months but this proposal democrats say will help fund some of the big ticket items â money goes up in the stock market in bonds in ownership stakes in companies year after year after year â michael kink with strong economy for all explains â they don t pay any taxes on that right now so this bill would define those gains as income you would have to report if you re a billionaire how much your investments and other holdings have gone up in a year and you d pay the regular income tax rate on that â the federal plan unveiled would affect only around 700 taxpayers who earn more than 100 million per year or who have more than 1 billion in assets for three straight years according to democrats congressional lawmakers have been negotiating back and forth for the past few months on each detail in bidenâ s social spending proposal which would include expanding medicaid coverage and expanding the child tax credit the billionaires tax proposal is already meeting pushback from a few moderate democrats and republicans in congress state republican party chairman nick langworthy blasted the idea of raising taxes â i don t think any of us should be surprised that they re going to try to shove a tax increase down our throat â langworthy commented â with where the country is heading you can t help but think we re probably going to head to a recession raising taxes is not the answer â however a â wealth taxâ does have broad support across the country and in a recent poll around two thirds of americans support raising taxes on billionaires earlier this year the state legislature passed a bill that raised taxes on the wealthiest new yorkers and corporations kink says this is expected to generate over 4 billion for new york â if you re trying to put together a budget that actually invests in communities that actually drives money into early childhood into housing into clean energy into education and higher education you need money for those kinds of investments â kink said â and the billionaires and the big corporations are the ones that have it â this specific proposal has a long way to go in congress before it could ever hit the floor for a vote and there are other proposals on the table that would also potentially raise taxes on the ultra wealthy in america to help pay for the two infrastructure bills

spain s on demand delivery platform glovo has announced what it s calling the couriers pledge an initiative which commits its business to setting a new fairer social rights standard for its gigging couriers the self defined standard covers earnings safety communication and support for development opportunities glovo says the commitments will eventually apply to couriers working across its entire market footprint whatever their exact employment status the delivery platform and dark store operator currently has 74 000 couriers across its market footprint mostly in europe and africa but it says it expects to have 240 000 couriers active on the platform by 2023 so the pledge looks set to touch a lot of platform workers that said the slated improvements to glovers as it calls gig workers working conditions will not arrive overnight instead changes to bring its various regional operations in line with the pledge will be rolled out gradually over the next 24 months to take account of local differences in regulations and operational conditions per co founder sacha michaud nor will the application of the pledge be precisely uniform each market will have specifics reflecting local differences in ops or indeed laws he notes for example that in some markets it works with third party contractors who supply couriers so it can only ask those other companies to make sure their workers are covered the first of markets where the pledge will be applied happen to sit at the edges of europe georgia and morocco beyond that glovo says it will be figuring out the rollout map as it goes along so it s not clear when its home market of spain might be covered but it says its goal is to have its whole fleet of couriers covered by the end of 2023 and just under half 40 by the end of q2 2022 fairwork is involved but is it fair work glovo writes that it collaborated with fairwork an academic research project which benchmarks gig platforms against a set of fairness principles to help it come up with the contents of the pledge which is comprises four components see below aka pillars as glovo calls them however fairwork told techcrunch it does not endorse glovo s pledge as fully instituting fairness for glovo workers dubbing it only a first step toward improving conditions so the preliminary external assessment is that glovo could still do a lot better fairwork will be carrying out regular possibly quarterly or biannual audits to assess whether glovo is living up to the commitments as it rolls the pledge out across its markets glovo has said these reports will be made public it also specifies that fairwork is not being paid by for this oversight work in order to preserve its independence going public about wanting to improve and being transparent about whether it actually has is a key part of the strategy here per michaud we identified that this is the right thing to do and we re going to commit openly to doing that he tells techcrunch we need a window to execute on that in the different regions for the complexity of our business from an operations perspective and regulatory and we ll find a way to make it happen in every single country and the ones we launch in the future as well while michaud is quick to talk up what he argues are the good things gig work has done for the world of work reeling off familiar talking points like easy access to income with very low barriers for people who maybe might have difficulty to find other types of work or income and of course the familiar gig platform claim of flexibility or work that he euphemistically couches as having a dynamic nature and maybe suits people who don t do well with more traditional rules based employment he accepts that a course correction is needed that said there is no admission that the model itself is intentionally exploitative rather he suggests gig platforms historically miscalculated believing they were catering to a specific niche of people who just needed a few extra hours work to supplement their income but now the reality is a large number of glovo s couriers depend on the platform as their primary or even sole source of income he says hence we have a certain responsibility as a company to give them more guarantees and more coverage so they can continue working on a certain baseline as he hedges its goal for the pledge michaud also rejects the idea that increased competition in the on demand delivery space with dark store q commerce startups busy bubbling up all over europe as well as new on demand delivery businesses zeroing in on dedicated niches like pharmaceuticals or high end lux brands is a retention motivation for glovo offering couriers better conditions i think regulatory wise it s going to move in this direction that we re doing he hazards instead adding we see no point in waiting why then aren t these conditions glovo s standard already operationally wise it s complex is his response on that the dynamics in every market is very different and regulation is very different sometimes it s not that easy he also argues it s not a question of choosing which is the best model generally and pretty much adamantly our couriers have said very large percentage wise that they want flexibility at the same time as having decent earnings and autonomy and sometimes depending on the regulation it s quite complex to manage both those things so that s why the commitment and the two year window mind the fairness gaps michaud describes the goal for the pledge as being to plug what he calls gaps in the fairness of couriers working conditions glovo s pr announcement also talks about creating equality of access to social rights and benefits for couriers independent of the way couriers work with the platform there s some gaps still says michaud in an interview with techcrunch as a company and other platforms as well i think we need to fill those gaps our commitment to the pledge is to try and cover the gaps and improve them and make a commitment that by a certain date the end of 2023 that any courier on our platform will have certain minimum guarantees or social rights below are the four components glovo lists in the couriers pledge and how it top line defines them fair earnings fair earnings per hour should be secured and regular collaboration has to be rewarded 360 safety all couriers must have fully fledged insurances covering any unforeseen situation safety on the road has to be a top priority proactive management we will hear and act upon couriers needs and issues in a transparent manner following a two way communication caring for couriers working as a rider should be a temporary thing fostering learning opportunities and keeping an open dialogue is a key goal there s a little more detail in the fuller document glovo also shared where for example proactive management boils down to demonstrable service level agreements slas being implemented to guarantee effective communications between courier and platform staff and it offers the commitment that any difficult concept or the algorithm logic needs to be explained in a simple and understandable way so they know how the glovo platform works it also pledges an easy appealing process if a courier is disabled from the app but there is zero talk of collective bargaining something workers in the eu are entitled to as a right michaud bills the initiative as open hence why presumably glovo isn t branding it the glovo couriers pledge as he s hopeful other delivery platforms will sign up although he adds that it hasn t yet approached any competitors about doing so on this it s worth noting that uber already came out with its own suggestion for a new standard for platform work as it put it for europe back in february when it published a whitepaper lobbying the eu to adopt california style laws that don t disrupt its business model i e by requiring it to pay full employment benefits whether glovo s pledge has more substance than uber s whitepaper remains to be seen but engaging fairwork as an auditor is certainly an interesting and laudable step after all the group wasted no time blasting uber s whitepaper as corporate lobbying masquerading as progressiveism fairwork also accused uber of trying to legitimize a lower level of protection for platform workers than most european workers benefit from arguing there s plenty of scope for it to improve conditions for workers within existing laws and further excoriating it for claiming improved conditions are dependent on regulatory change so glovo will need to tread carefully to avoid a similar accusation that it s delaying rolling out better working conditions for portions of its gig workers as a cynical ratchet to try to drive local policy change to align with its business model the wider context here is of course that gig platforms have even from the get go faced accusations that they are inherently exploitative of labor and seek to erode workers rights critics accusing them of applying a bogus classification of self employment that exploits delivery couriers by extracting the labor of an army of precarious but essential to the business function labor force without providing the benefits and rights of employment platforms typically counter such accusations by arguing that couriers want gigging flexibility rather than traditional employment and further claiming outdated employment laws don t allow them to provide benefits without applying the sort of rigid conditions their workers don t want however on that they are counter accused of a self serving selective interpretation of the law and therefore of dragging their feet on offering better conditions see fairwork s aformentioned evisceration of uber they have also often lost litigation challenging their employment classifications in the u k for example uber lost a long running employment litigation earlier this year after the supreme court ruled that a group of drivers were workers not self employed contractors as uber had tried to argue for literally years while in spain one of the markets where glovo operates the country s top court rejected its classification of delivery couriers as autónomos last year and lawmakers there have since passed a labor reform specifically targeted at recognizing platform delivery couriers as employees portugal is also reported to be eyeing a similar law glovo did not responded to the change in spanish law by instantly employing the circa 10 000 couriers active on its platform in the country it has said it will be hiring around 1 800 couriers but michaud admits it hasn t yet hit that figure it has also chosen to make changes to how it operates the platform to try to justify keeping a majority of its local glovers as freelance couriers some of whom may be employed by third party agencies at which point they are essentially being subcontracted to do gig jobs on its platform but which it argues spain s labor reform allows the net result is that even with a labor law in place that says delivery couriers working on platforms like glovo are employees plenty of platform workers in the country are still not employed and thereby face a variety of working conditions this in turn means glovo s decision not to prioritize rolling out the pledge to couriers in its home market looks well interesting michaud claims spain s regulations make applying the commitments there more complex since he argues that most of its local couriers don t want to be employed and that local employment law on freelancers self employed ties its hands on giving additional benefits because it would imply a labor relationship again i insist most of these workers don t want so you re excluding them is his familiar line of argument this suggests glovo will be directing its efforts in spain at least initially not on improving working conditions for the majority of couriers but pushing for amendments to the labor reform to allow it to eventually raise courier benefits somewhat without having to reclassify them as full fat employees as the law intends and which would instantly give them well far better working conditions so it is to put it politely rather tautological nonetheless michaud summarizes its domestic plan as working with the social agents and finding common ground to get those workers that stay autonomous the benefits and the guarantees that they need he also points to how glovo is now operating in italy calling it a good guideline of what it s hoping to achieve elsewhere via the pledge flagging a recent gig economy regulation he says covered a lot of the things that are already in the commitments for example we give guaranteed income per hour there but they re freelancers we begin paying their social security directly so they re covered when they re ill it includes safety training and obviously material and obviously it includes further education so all the pieces that sometimes are missing so that s a fairly good reference there we are giving guaranteed income earnings per hour it maintains the flexibility they re autonomous they have collective voice they re represented by trade unions still there are further steps glovo believes it can make for couriers there too per michaud who adds italy will hopefully be under the pledge early next year toward better gig work across the eu european union lawmakers meanwhile have an active eye on conditions in the gig economy across the bloc having been nudged to take a public interest by the surge in popularity of delivery platforms during the peak of the covid 19 pandemic last year the commission has spent the better part of this year consulting on how conditions for gig workers might be improved initially through platforms making changes themselves but also dangling the prospect of pan eu standards coming down the pipe so the eu s executive scoping out potential legislation gives gig platforms a serious incentive to jockey for position and try to frame the terms of debate and ultimately pushing their own version of what fair standards are on policymakers in a speech back in february the eu s digital policy chief margrethe vestager warned that what she acknowledged can be poor and precarious working conditions on gig platforms must be addressed but she also talked of wanting to find a balance between making the most of the opportunities of the platform economy and ensuring that the social rights of people working in it are the same as in the traditional economy so it s really not clear what the commission is cooking and at the time of writing the eu executive had not responded to a request for an update update a commission spokeswoman confirmed it will be coming forward with an initiative before the end of this year and is currently considering responses to the second stage of the consultation as it works on defining the contents of the initiative with the eu s process ongoing glovo s pledge is timed to preempt any rules the bloc s lawmakers might draw up and which could even end up overruling country specific labor reforms potentially rolling back those complex regulations that so trouble gig platforms business interests that means glovo s pledge must be read at least in part as a lobbying instrument illustrating its strategic red lines it is notable for example that glovo s pledge on earnings does not commit to paying couriers for every single hour of working time such as when they are logged into the app and waiting for a job to come in or waiting outside a restaurant for a delivery to be made up and brought out to them or biking through traffic jams and pouring rain trying to find a customer s address or waiting outside the customer s address for the person to answer the door and so on michaud confirms that glovo continues to pay couriers per delivery the pledge as it stands doesn t change that rather the suggestion is glovo will top up courier earnings if they fall below a locally set wage indicator for hourly earnings it says it s using wageindictator data to make these calculations as well as factoring in any additional costs the courier may have to fund to carry out deliveries in that location e g bike repairs fuel etc so its definition of fair earnings continues to limit how much couriers can earn on its platform by not paying for all their actual working time this is a recurring battleground in gig economy litigation and over in the u k uber s recent post supreme court ruling announcement claiming it would now treat drivers in the country as workers did not extend to paying them for all the hours they clock up logged into the uber app either instead it said it would be calculating working time from the point a trip commences today they re only paid per job confirms michaud referring to the majority of glovo delivery couriers who the startup does not directly employ before adding we have different types so it s very varied that s why we wanted to equal the playing field for everyone to a certain we raised this issue with glovo s chosen auditor fairwork suggesting that paying by working time would be fairer than paying per delivery and they agreed fairwork advised glovo on how their pledge could comply with the fairwork principles in that process we advised them that workers should be paid for waiting time at the rate of the living wage researcher alessio bertolini told us fairwork will be auditing and scoring glovo on that basis we are pleased that glovo has consulted with us in this process and has indicated openness to being held accountable to their commitments by fairwork however this does not constitute an endorsement from fairwork of glovo s commitments as fully meeting all standards of fairness he added workers are actively contributing to platforms operations and revenue and to customers ability to receive prompt service during all the time they are logged in and available to accept jobs they are giving up personal time and the freedom to do other activities in other places they are also often representing the platform with branded equipment and apparel for all these reasons it is fairwork s strong position that waiting time is working time and should attract fair pay so well glovo may find its first full fairwork audit a fairly painful read too for the record michaud dodged the question about paying couriers working time rather than per delivery when we put it to him sidestepping into a tangent on how it measures earnings per hour to ensure they reflect a local average based on data from wageindicator but that s not what we were asking he also segued into talking about glovo s use of technology to distribute jobs to couriers saying it has stock management systems in most of the countries where it operates which he said are intended to optimize supply and demand in order to make up earnings to that local wage level presumably by sharing out available jobs between couriers to avoid too much of an earnings skew between individuals with the pledge he says the idea is to plug gaps in this job distribution system topping up earnings in instances where couriers aren t sent enough jobs by the platform but not plugging the bigger wage gap resulting from glovo choosing not to pay out their working time he mentions a courier he says he met recently in ghana who told him that he d been working for over two hours and had only had three deliveries saying that s not good enough and that it s the type of thing we want to address before adding we want to step up and hopefully other companies will join us in raising the bar however glovo s preference for raising the bar on courier earnings remains far below fairwork s definition of what is actually fair pay and well what european employment law has long established as fair a minimum wage per each hour of time worked so for now at least it is essentially a familiar gig economy push to try to normalize a lower tier of employment rights for platform workers who are already among the most vulnerable and precariously placed workers in society whether eu policymakers will be swayed by this deregulatory pitch is the next pressing question michaud confirms he will be presenting the pledge to the commission and members of the european parliament this week the support of meps will be required to pass any eu legislation in this area parliamentarians also frequently amend commission proposals i think this is the way the gig economy will go especially in europe he suggests fleshing out the pitch eu lawmakers will hear there s a strong case for who the workers are on these platforms who generally have low access to normal employment or certainly at that given time it s easy access to income it s very flexible and dynamic and then again what i think is true if someone is working on a platform and it s the primary source or very important source of their income although we will cover everyone even if they re only working five hours a week they ll still have the necessary coverage i think there needs to be better coverage better social benefits when they re ill they should have coverage and things like that which often are not covered asked for its assessment of the general state of delivery gig worker conditions across europe fairworks bertolini said standards are shockingly low which may be why some of the bigger and better resourced gig platforms with lashings of vc cash to spend on an in house team of policy staffers to hone pitches and lobby lawmakers spy a chance to frame themselves as offering higher gig work standards as previous fairwork reports in europe such as germany and u k already have shown the vast majority of platforms fail to provide even the most basic labour standards that would be considered fair he went on some of the main issues include the lack of a minimum wage floor lack of statutory health and safety protections lack of access to due process and lack of channels for collective representation many of these issues stem from the classification of workers as self employed or independent contractors in order for platforms to avoid obligations and protections regardless of employment status all workers should have the same basic legal rights and social protections bertolini added if a lower tier of protections for certain classes of workers is institutionalized we risk seeing a race to the bottom he also warned that putting guarantees into law to avoid the misclassification of independent contractors aren t in and of themselves a panacea as spain is perhaps finding out now we believe that guaranteeing that workers are not misclassified as independent contractors is an important part of the solution but it shouldn t be everything what we are seeing in many countries is that even platforms that rely on an employment model can use systems of subcontractors to avoid their legal responsibilities any future eu legislation should take into consideration these issues and make sure that these companies are made responsible for the conditions of the workers on their platform we believe all workers however they are classified should benefit from minimum standards of fairness in their jobs bertolini also said that given the variety of classifications and rights associated with employment status in different countries fairwork s view is it is most important to ensure that all workers are provided with decent labour standards across fair pay fair conditions fair contacts fair management and fair representation regardless of their specific employment classification we do not support any employment classification system that falls short of guaranteeing these standards for all gig workers such as the example of prop 22 in california he added so commission lawmakers look like they re going to have their work cut out to find their sought for balance between precarity and stability screwing their courage to the sticking place may be more profitable on this fundamental rights issue
consumer reports looked at the side by side price comparison for dollar stores and nearby grocery stores example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video greenville n c remember that old joke that there s a starbucks or mattress store or mcdonald s on every corner these days you might be seeing more dollar stores than coffee shops believe it or not dollar stores outnumber starbucks and mcdonald s combined and more are coming four of 10 store openings this year are expected to be dollar stores said brian vines consumer reports investigative reporter according to a recent consumer reports survey 88 of americans shop at dollar stores at least sometimes the most common reason they re inexpensive and convenient but are the savings real a cr investigative reporter says yes but there s a caveat when compared with nearby grocery stores dollar stores were indeed cheapest for an entire purchase for each of our shoppers but even though you might save more money at a dollar store your options for items could be pretty limited said vines because of those limited options cr says don t bother with a shopping list when you go to a dollar store instead go in with a strategy and be flexible not many dollar stores carry fresh fruit and vegetables but they often stock frozen versions of each which can be as nutritious if you re in need of some over the counter medicine skip the name brands like advil and tylenol and opt for the generics which are chemically identical and often much cheaper and always check the expiration date no matter where you shop it s important to remember that you may be able to get many of these items cheaper in bulk at big box stores but in an emergency or if you just need a little dollar store offerings are usually a good bet
biden s big climate policy died but that s not the whole story collapse america s political commentary about climate change has been rather gloomy recently core parts of president joe biden s climate plan have crumbled in the face of washington political realities this month the lack of one key senate vote in his own party forced the president to scrap a clean electricity proposal that supporters had described as essential for lowering the country s greenhouse gas emissions now that same lawmaker sen joe manchin of west virginia is reportedly opposing another climate component of the build back better act this one involving fees on emissions of methane a gas with even more planet warming potential than the carbon that often leaks from gas and oil wells pundits have suggested that all of this threatens u s standing at a key international climate conference that opens next week the cop26 gathering some advocates have questioned whether the american political system and perhaps even democracy writ large is equipped to deal with a global and existential climate crisis but that mostly empty version is not the only climate story these days and many researchers advocates and policymakers say it s important to recognize and build on the progress that is happening despite the consensus among scientists that faster and greater action is needed these individuals caution against a rhetorical approach of panic and last chance alarm indeed they are finding strength and inspiration in bottom up success stories macro shifts in attitudes and even the messy grappling of the political process itself there is a lot of hard work going on says daniel bresette executive director of the environmental and energy study institute an education and policy organization in washington but it takes time to build a majority block of votes to pass legislation there s a way to look at that pessimistically and say well the process isn t working andrew harnik ap sen joe manchin a democrat from west virginia a holdout vote who sank president joe biden s clean electricity program speaks to reporters on capitol hill in washington on oct 27 2021 mr biden is seeking to ensure that 150 billion in spending canceled by mr manchin will be spent on other climate initiatives yet the only way climate action can happen he says is if enough people agree that it s needed and that is happening it s ok to acknowledge that it might take a little bit of time that s not to say he doesn t feel time pressure mr bresette like many involved in climate policy believes that the longer governments and individuals take to lower greenhouse gas emissions the greater the damage to earth s climate and the harder it will be to reverse it a united nations report released earlier this week found that countries current emissions promises fell short of avoiding the sort of climate change that would cause in officials words endless suffering at the same time he and others see climate movement particularly outside of the federal legislative process municipalities across the united states have embraced significant climate action from dallas which plans to become carbon neutral by 2050 to los angeles which this summer began piloting electric school buses to transport students below the level of the state there are all sorts of amazing things happening katharine hayhoe director of the climate science center at texas tech university said on the podcast climate pod recently dr hayhoe author of the new book saving us a climate scientist s case for hope listed numerous local climate initiatives in texas from houston s climate action plan to the fact that fort hood is powered 43 by clean energy change is happening i feel like if it can happen in texas it can happen everywhere but as you can see it is percolating up from the bottom and what is going to be the last to change is our politics at the state and the national level even still 10 u s states have passed

heading out the door read this article on the new outside app available now on ios devices for members download the app earlier this month the new york times published an article asserting that plant based meat companies like beyond meat are getting pretty terrible sustainability ratings from firms like sustainalytics which rank all sorts of public companies some of the esg ratings they reported were even as bad as carnivorous counterparts like tyson foods and jbs and yet everything we know about beef says it is a major contributor to environmental degradation worldwide and far worse than most vegetarian food products so what s really going on here is everything we thought about the sustainability of a plant based diet false not quite what are esg ratings it s important to understand who the rating firms are and what these ratings are meant to do in the same way that credit ratings for companies try to capture credit risks these other values called esg ratings try to capture all the risks to the corporation and its investors that can t be found on a balance sheet they look at the environmental social and governance factors that could lead a company to financial trouble that means looking at the environmental impact of a company but also other things like their company culture hiring practices controversies and interactions with governments take tesla says florian berg a research associate at the mit sloan school of management who focuses on sustainable investing tesla makes a much more environmentally friendly product than its peers in the auto industry but often gets dinged by analysts for its poor company culture and high turnover if your product creates a lot of good impact in the world as is supposedly with tesla it doesn t mean that you have a good esg rating berg notes and berg s own research has found the ratings from different firms while correlated can be really different at times much of that can be chalked up to different methodologies and what different firms say they value so the potential alarm being raised about beyond meat and other brands is not exactly coming from environmental advocates but rather from firms wrapped up in the global financial market and they look at a lot more than just emissions and land use how accurately do esg ratings reflect sustainability while an esg rating can be a pretty good indicator for sustainability according to berg they are not a perfect analog for real world environmental impacts it could potentially happen that you create a portfolio using esg ratings he says and the portfolio they deemed to be sustainable emits more co2 emissions per invested dollar than if you had invested just in the s p 500 beyond meat for example has a rating of severe from sustainalytics in contrast ford motors exxon mobil royal dutch shell bp and dupont chemicals all have better ratings wells fargo which fell in hot water for creating millions of fraudulent bank accounts for customers without their consent also has a better sustainalytics rating electric company pg e which has been found liable for multiple devastating wildfires in california got the severe label yet even it has a better overall score than beyond meat that esg firms equate emissions water pollution or land use biodiversity impacts of plant based meat to with that of commodity pork and beef because they can t name their beet juice s farm or because they don t report their building s electricity is a bad faith detraction matthew hayek matthewhayek october 15 2021 how do the environmental impacts of plant based companies compare to industrial animal agriculture the times reported that sustainalytics analysts want companies like beyond meat and impossible foods to be more transparent about their supply chains waste management and sourcing transparency and data are things most consumers probably want to see too but that doesn t necessarily mean that beyond meat is worse for the environment than a basket of fossil fuel companies or tyson foods in fact what we do know about food systems and their impacts suggests that animal protein is far worse for the environment than vegetarian sources as an environmental scientist who analyzes the climate impacts of our food production systems and consumption choices i find this assertion by sustainalytics that we don t know if jbs and beyond meat are any different is absurd matthew hayek a professor of environmental studies at new york university wrote on twitter years of peer reviewed research hayek continued show that the impacts from plant protein and fat ingredients are significantly smaller than those from beef chicken and pork even if those impacts aren t precisely quantified to the degree esg analysts want them to be indeed research shows that the rearing of livestock generates 14 percent of the world s carbon emissions that s similar to the total emissions from transportation though meat and dairy make up 18 percent of global calories consumed they use 83 percent of the world s farmland and cause 60 percent of the total emissions from agriculture workers on factory farms in the u s often make low wages and can face serious injuries or diseases linked to their jobs plant based meat companies probably aren t going to save the world and do likely have some of their own environmental and labor impacts that we should take seriously but it s important to have some perspective about how they compare to other companies as well how these financial ratings are made and what they mean being a vegetarian means pushing our food system to be better that s a complicated process but one we can do when we have the knowledge get more of what you love from vt follow us on instagram facebook and twitter and sign up for our

biden s big climate policy died but that s not the whole story collapse america s political commentary about climate change has been rather gloomy recently core parts of president joe biden s climate plan have crumbled in the face of washington political realities this month the lack of one key senate vote in his own party forced the president to scrap a clean electricity proposal that supporters had described as essential for lowering the country s greenhouse gas emissions now that same lawmaker sen joe manchin of west virginia is reportedly opposing another climate component of the build

this threatens u s standing at a key international climate conference that opens next week the cop26 gathering some advocates have questioned whether the american political system and perhaps even democracy writ large is equipped to deal with a global and existential climate crisis but that mostly empty version is not the only climate story these days and many researchers advocates and policymakers say it s important to recognize and build on the progress that is happening despite the consensus among scientists that faster and greater action is needed these individuals caution against a rhetorical approach of panic and last chance alarm indeed they are finding strength and inspiration in bottom up success stories macro shifts in attitudes and even the messy grappling of the political process itself there is a lot of hard work going on says daniel bresette executive director of the environmental and energy study institute an education and policy organization in washington

150 billion in spending canceled by mr manchin will be spent on other climate initiatives yet the only way climate action can happen he says is if enough people agree that it s needed and that is happening it s ok to acknowledge that it might take a little bit of time that s not to say he doesn t feel time pressure mr bresette like many involved in climate policy believes that the longer governments and individuals take to lower greenhouse gas emissions the greater the damage to earth s climate and the harder it will be to reverse it a united nations report released earlier this week

everywhere but as you can see it is percolating up from the bottom and what is going to be the last to change is our politics at the state and the national level even still 10 u s states have passed legislation that commits to 100 clean electricity by 2050 or sooner this summer illinois became the first midwest state in that camp pledging to shift to carbon free energy by 2045 oregon aims for

says chris chyung senior campaign manager at the center for american progress i just keep pointing to them as a beacon quite honestly if we can t get things done in a divided congress then we can definitely look toward the states to mitigate some of that but at the same time the states can t do it all on their own the biden administration agrees with this latter point it has promised to use the full power of the presidency to fight climate change and has been integrating climate policy into various arms of government last week for instance it released new analyses on how climate change intersects with national security foreign policy and migration it has taken steps to integrate climate analysis into financial decisions from federal procurement to rules on private sector retirement plans the securities and exchange commission is weighing a mandate for corporations to disclose their climate risks significantly climate legislation remains very much in play although much of the media focus over recent weeks has been on the disintegration of the clean electricity performance program the president has said that he is committed to using the 150 billion that would have gone to that initiative for other climate action items that according to reports could go to efforts like climate focused block grants to states and clean energy tax incentives for consumers and industry the loss of cepp created a hole in our carbon reductions and although there s no one silver bullet that will fill that it s powerful that they are reallocating those funds to other climate programs says jamaal raad executive director of evergreen action a climate action advocacy group already the democratic spending bill has more than 200 billion worth of incentives for clean energy technologies from aviation fuels to electric cars with extra going to those made in the u s this funding would come in addition to important climate efforts that have already received bipartisan support through the infrastructure bill passed by the senate earlier this year points out sasha mackler director of the energy project at the bipartisan policy center it has some very monumental new programs representing the down payment on the development of the advanced technologies that we know we re going to need to hit our net zero targets he says it would really be a step change in the level of effort and investment by the federal government examples from the infrastructure bill include 9 5 billion for clean hydrogen 7 5 billion for electric vehicle charging and 11 5 billion for low carbon mass transit plus other investments connected to offshore wind energy and these numbers mr mackler points out are by no means hidden they are really climate focused technology initiatives he says and that bill was passed in the senate with a broadly bipartisan vote it gives me encouragement that when framed in the right way a lot of climate policies are actually pretty popular and that story gets missed this isn t to say that all of these efforts are enough he and others reiterate more comprehensive actions will be needed as scientists see global warming currently on track to result in devastating extreme

a number of recent studies have shown a growing american consensus on the importance of climate action this week an associated press norc center for public affairs research poll found that 59 of americans say the issue of climate change is very or extremely important to them up from 49 who said the same thing in 2018 new research from the climate leadership council a bipartisan group that has long advocated for a price or tax on carbon shows that many americans support climate action as well especially when those efforts are connected to labor force and economic progress in a poll released today for instance the group found that most americans across political lines were in favor of what s called a border carbon adjustment a fee on imports connected to carbon pollution resulting from producing those goods and more than 75 of respondents said they were willing to pay more for a product if they knew it was made in america with less carbon pollution and that paying more would help create jobs here by bringing more manufacturing and production back to america there s a narrative out there that voters want to do something on climate but they re not willing to be part of the solution says greg bertelsen ceo of the climate leadership council that view is an oversimplification the fact is americans want climate policies that are effective at what they re intended to do which is lower emissions

in april sudan s president omar al bashir was ousted in a military coup with the head of the regime cut off a power struggle ensued between the military junta and the popular movement demanding civilian rule in august the main opposition coalition and the transitional military council formally signed a power sharing agreement following nine months of nationwide protests and brutal repression by paramilitary forces the massive struggle from below offers a powerful example of how to fight against authoritarianism and for democracy sudan s uprising was one of the most well organized and advanced revolts in the region at its peak millions were participating in sit ins the country was paralyzed by a general strike and military discipline was breaking down among the rank and file women and union leaders were at the forefront of demonstrations in a widely circulated video that captures the spirit of the revolution an unnamed woman leads a march chanting from kordofan has emerged after we have been hit by gunfire this is a government with no feelings and the nuba mountains like darfur their blood is very expensive we will protect our land oh farmer our sudan will be set free this blogpost will focus on the roots of the uprising then examine the events of the 2018 2019 revolution itself with a particular focus on revolutionary agency the roots of sudan s uprising the neoliberal restructuring of the sudanese economy began during the 16 year dictatorship of nimeiry 1969 1985 at the behest of the international monetary fund imf he liberalized the economy curbed food subsidies and increased privatization which benefited his political islamist party rejecting the imf measures and the implementation of sharia law a popular uprising toppled nimeiry in 1985 and ushered in a short lived democratic government in 1989 the islamists retook power through a military coup bringing bashir and his national congress party to power they continued to implement neoliberal policies and the process of privatization enriched a small group of military generals bashir devoted an estimated 70 of the national budget to the military and security sector overtime the highest strata of the military developed a significant degree of economic and political power in 2003 bashir relied on the janjaweed a notorious group of arab militias to push back rebels in darfur as part of the ongoing civil war over resources and land allocation the resulting campaign has been called a genocide the janjaweed were transformed into a state sanctioned paramilitary force called the rapid support forces rsf commanded by general mohamed hamdan dagolo commonly known as hemedti hemedti uses the rsf as a personal militia to defend his massive business empire or gold mines and airlines decades of authoritarian rule repression racism and crony neoliberalism wrecked sudan s economy and exacerbated social tensions in 2013 people rioted over bread prices in a prelude to the recent protests the rsf crushed the protests killing over 100 people and arresting hundreds more during this wave of civil unrest neighbourhood resistance councils developed and these small groups of friends and neighbours worked together to share information and coordinate protests sudan s economic woes due in large part to exorbitant military spending were exacerbated following the succession of south sudan in 2011 sudan lost 75 of its oil revenue additionally twenty years of u s sanctions largely cut sudan off from the global financial market bashir responded by ramping up austerity measures with the imf s encouragement the privatization of public assets and the slashing of government food and fuel subsidies contributed to social unrest in response to soaring commodity prices and repression by the rsf demonstrations became a consistent feature of sudanese civil society the 2018 19 revolution in mid december 2018 people in atbara a small town far away from the capital khartoum rioted over an increase in bread prices and burned down the headquarters of the ruling national congress party an army colonel defected to the side of the protesters and prevented the rsf from entering the city in other towns and cities simmering economic frustration and resentment towards the regime boiled over though formal trade unions had been infiltrated by the regime independent labour organizations played a pivotal role in the uprising in particular the sudanese professionals association spa took a lead in coordinating protests and came to be seen as the organic leadership of the movement this network of banned trade unions formed through struggle in 2016 is composed of professional workers such as doctors lawyers engineers and journalists these workers led increasingly precarious lives as wages declined working conditions worsened and the lifting of government subsidies threatened their social position the demands for economic justice quickly broadened to calls for the regime to fall on the 1 january 2019 the forces for freedom and change ffc a broad opposition coalition spearheaded by the spa of workers associations liberal and leftist political parties feminist groups and armed movements published a list of demands at the top was the end of bashir s presidency the revolt continued to gain momentum reawakening old networks and drawing on experience from past struggles on 6 april the anniversary of the 1985 popular uprising protesters began a massive sit in at the army headquarters in khartoum similar sit ins began in other cities they became a gathering place for millions of people to debate the way forward share community meals and sing revolutionary songs the outpouring of creative resistance and solidarity offered a glimpse into another possible society though the regime has systematically disenfranchised rural parts of the country and used racism to reinforce the urban rural divide the movement permeated rural communities as well unlike in 2013 urban resistance was matched by rural struggle in many places student led the way with mass marches and the armed movements followed this non violent lead the ffc included the sudan revolutionary front an alliance between armed rebel groups largely based in peripheral areas when the regime attempted to use racism divisively the chant went up ya onsori wa maghroor kol albalad darfoor hey racist we are all darfur in an extraordinary show of anti racist solidarity the regime responded to the movement with violence on 6 april military and security forces attempted to violently disperse the sit ins killing dozens of protesters called to fire on fellow citizens some junior army officers and lower ranking soldiers refused their orders and several were killed defending the popular movement the revolutionary consciousness spreading among the lower ranks of the army terrified the high command on 11 april the generals disposed bashir gambling on a coup in order to avoid a collapse of the army and placate the people the military announced a transitional military council tmc headed by defence minister awad bin auf a man with direct connections to atrocities committed in darfur he was forced to step down within 36 hours general abdel fattah al burhan bashir s former chief of staff and head of ground forces took his place hemedti head of the rsf emerged as the de facto leader of the tmc the formation of a military junta did not quell the protests having learned the lesson of egypt s revolution the movement refused to leave the streets until the military ceded power in the words of sudanese activist mohamed mustafa diab the sudanese people understand that the enemy is not a single man it is the whole regime and everything it represents a civilian government or an eternal revolution that is one of the most popular slogans right now as long as we maintain pressure we the sudanese people will have the final say foreign powers quickly backed the sudanese military hoping to preserve the structure of the state saudi arabia has benefitted from thousands of rsf troops fighting in their bloody war in yemen european nations rely on rsf soldiers to patrol the desert and prevent migrants from reaching europe abdel fattah el sisi egypt s military dictator and head of the african union eased political pressure on the tmc in an effort to promote stabilization in late april the ffc and the tmc entered into a stormy process of negotiations brokered by the african union and ethiopia the negotiations were compromised from the start in may an article by a small group of socialists in egypt clearly articulated the contradiction the problem is not so much the personalities of the negotiators as the overall strategy of the opposition by agreeing to negotiate with al bashir s generals and allowing them to participate in the transition period the leaders of the opposition are trying to reconcile the demands of the revolutionary street on the one hand and the counter revolutionary generals on the other this strategy is suicidal for the revolution regardless of who the negotiators are they will betray the hopes of the revolutionaries the tmc threatened its negotiating partners with arrest and when talks broke down conditioned resumption of discussion on compromise they repeatedly demanded an end to the sit ins and a dismantling of the barricades set up around khartoum whenever the ffc called off negotiations they came back to the table before winning significant demands or conditions much of the negotiating process was opaque according to hajooj kuka a neighbourhood resistance committee activist this lack of transparency was frustrating for the movement he explained the people who are on the street who are organizing these protests who are out and protesting and putting their lives in danger don t really know what s happening and this attitude that there s a few elitists who know better and who should negotiate in hiding is really against the revolutionary feel of what s happening on the ground this negotiation strategy can be explained in part by the political parties within the ffc that have traditionally functioned as the institutionalized opposition to bashir their method of negotiating with the regime and participating in parliament primed them for a compromise with the military additionally the class position of many of the ffc members and explicitly those within the spa influenced the negotiations as professional workers they were more willing than the movement in the streets to trust the generals in organization and in rhetoric the spa did not pose itself as a political alternative to bashir s neoliberal autocratic regime the organization was strictly not a political party the seemingly apolitical nature of the spa likely appealed to many people who distrusted political parties though the spa impressively united the resistance to bashir in the ffc it missed the opportunity to reclaim or redefine leftist politics in this moment the mobilization rhetoric of spa derived from sudan s effendiya a nationalist ideology of the small class of sudanese who were educated to fill the ranks of the civil service during colonialism and who were prepared for post colonial rule this framework was too narrow to speak to the diversity of the sudanese people and reimagine a sudan that embraces all across ethnic racial religious lines the dominant slogans of peace freedom and justice and mandaniyaa civilian fail to wed political demands with class demands in a moment ripe for a revolutionary message rather than drawing from alternative frameworks of the working class or the feminist movement the spa appealed to the universal rights and freedoms of citizens using language that is not incompatible with the neoliberal state the failure to centre class demands and implicitly or explicitly raise revolutionary slogans may partially explain why khartoum s peripheral neighbourhoods of poor and displaced people did not join in the protests as enthusiastically as the middle class neighbourhoods turning point and road to constitutional agreement as negotiations unfolded after april the popular movement continued to express itself in the streets demanding civilian rule the security forces and the rsf continued their repressive campaign of intimidation arrests and murder in late may the country participated in a 2 day general strike 3 june marked a turning point in the revolution on this day the last day of ramadan the tmc imposed a countrywide internet blackout and sent in the rsf to clear the khartoum sit in the paramilitary force massacred over 100 people raped dozens and injured over 500 others according to eyewitness mohammed elnaiem started shooting at us and we all started running away from the barricades and running into houses to hide i haven t been brave enough to go outside to rebuild the barricades like some other people have been since then it s terrifying there s gunshots everywhere in my neighborhood there is reports of a sniper in an abandoned building i don t know where specifically so it s really risky they want to terrorize us at home in response the ffc suspended negotiations the spa published a list of immediate demands to be met before talks resume they called for an open ended political general strike from 28 may to 29 may over 80 of the population participated in the strike shutting down most of the country three days after the start of the strike the spa called for it to end the ffc re entered negotiations with the very forces that were responsible for 3 june massacre before they had been brought to justice but in the streets the masses advanced ahead of the leadership of the movement they insisted on retribution for the killing and wounding of protesters the tmc had lost its moral authority and mass demonstrations for civilian rule and justice for 3 june martyrs took place across sudan on 1 july the spa published a 2 week long plan that matched the militancy of the street marches and demonstrations were to culminate in a general strike on 14 july however four days later the ffc and tmc reached a verbal agreement to share power the ffc cancelled protests for the upcoming week and organized demonstrations in support of the deal immediately some of the ffc coalition members publicly condemned the tentative deal a statement from the darfur displaced general coordination ddgc read the aim of this agreement is also to block the realisation of the goals of the revolution to bring down the regime prosecute its criminals achieve freedom peace and justice establish a civilian led government resolve the civil wars in the country and restore the rights of displaced people and refugees the sudan revolutionary front a coalition of armed movements rejected the deal as did the sudanese communist party who withdrew from negotiations and called for popular protests to continue the struggle advances on 4 august the ffc and tmc signed a constitutional declaration that marked the beginning of a 39 month long transitional period until elections in 2022 sudan will be governed by a sovereign council composed of 5 civilian members 5 military members and 1 member chosen jointly a military member will lead for the first 21 months and then a civilian member will lead for the last 18 months the declaration establishes a council of ministers tasked with implementing its mandates during the transitional period the ffc nominated economist abdalla hamdok as prime minister and he will select ministers from a list prepared by the ffc the defence and interior ministers will be appointed by military members of sovereign council the declaration also establishes an appointed transitional legislative council that will be majority civilian with 67 members from the ffc and 33 members from other political forces that were not part of the ffc in a significant victory no fewer than 40 of the council members must be women all potential ministers and legislative council members must be confirmed by the sovereign council and decisions on the sovereign council must be adopted by a two thirds majority this means that the minority of military members can veto decisions in essence nullifying the rule of civilians on the country s highest authority a few days after the signing of the accord the spa announced that it would not take any of the civilian seats on the sovereign council they intend to participate in the legislative council as an independent regulatory authority and watchdog to ensure the mandates of the declaration are carried out during the transitional period the declaration did not include concrete economic reforms specific mandates to improve the rights of women and youth a plan to prosecute those responsible for war crimes nor a rigorous investigation of 3 june massacre the failure to include social and economic reforms leaves many of the movement s central demands unrealized the deal also dodged larger questions of war and peace racism and marginalization and the rights of displaced persons and refugees despite its limitations jubilant crowds gathered in khartoum to celebrate the signing of the deal sara abdelgalil of the spa told the new york times it s a very tough compromise we just hope that we will achieve a civilian led government at the end of the three years and if we fail we will go back to the street ordinary activists expressed similar resolve ramzi al taqi a fruit seller in khartoum told agence france presse if this council does not meet our aspirations and cannot serve our interests we will never hesitate to have another revolution we would topple the council just like we did the former regime conclusion sudan is in a state of acute contradiction as popular forces share power with the very actors that repressed the movement as sudan enters the next phase of its revolution much hinges upon whether the ffc can win over a majority of the rank and file soldiers in support of the people bashir s trial has begun over corruption charges but many question whether he will be held accountable for his greatest crimes some suspect that the military is using the trial to deflect attention away from 3 june massacre newly appointed prime minister hamdok has approved 14 civilian minsters from a list provided by the ffc he reiterated that this is meant to be a government of technocrats rather than politicians among his selections are asmaa abdallah as sudan s first female foreign minister and ibrahim elbadawi a former world bank economist as finance minister hamdok has also reached out to the world bank and imf to discuss sudan s debt many of the problems that led millions of sudanese to revolt decades of repression lack of democracy neoliberal austerity the unrealized rights of refugees have not been resolved bread and fuel queues have already begun to reappear the revolutionary process is not over and as it unfolds the sudanese people who have now felt their power will undoubtedly fight to shape their own destiny in the midst of the 6 april sit in in khartoum a mass movement in algeria overthrew long time autocratic president abdelaziz bouteflika imbuing sudanese protesters with confidence the emergence of these concurrent movements indicates that the conditions that gave rise to the arab spring and protests in burkina faso and senegal will continue to spark resistance assessing and learning from these movements remains an urgent task they raise important questions about the level of trade union and working class involvement the weakness of organizations and political parties the absence of ideology of the main opposition groups and the role of the organized left and its revolutionary wing this article originally appeared on the review of african political economy featured photograph a work by khalid kodi showing a sudanese woman in front of the military hq in
