in the contest for power and resources in history people always try to outdo each other by creating divisions around race ethnicity or faith people do this to enlist group support for otherwise private agenda or whip support for personal disappointment or loss as it presently is sometimes when faith and ethnicity are the same demagogue explores doctrinaire differences as it was in europe in the 17th century where european kings fought a 30 years war dividing themselves into catholics or protestants between 1618 and 1648 europe never emerged significantly as a powerhouse until it overcame that era of darkness only then was it able to march into renaissance enlightenment industrial revolution and democracy ethnically and religiously homogeneous somalia whose war lords divided it along clans has yet to escape from the ruins and darkness of her own division rwanda to the contrary is matching forward having buried the ghost of hatred making development a focus when i was a young student both at a levels and the university it was our aspiration to seek the unity of all of africa into one country in the manner of america as espoused by kwame nkrumah the first prime minister of ghana and sekou toure the first president of guinea and other great nationalists some of our mentors in nigeria such as alao aka bashorun worked as pan africanist in drafting the constitutions of many newly independent african countries in a clime when nigeria s justice akinola aguda served as chief justice of botswana we saw all africans as the same and we perceived any attack on any group of africans as an attack on the rest of us it was in that spirit that on january 6 1988 rotimi ewebiyi olaitan oyerinde chris ayaze sylvester odion and my humble self all students of the university of lagos were arrested and detained after the massive protest we staged alongside nigerian workers and students following prime minister margaret thatcher of britain s visit we were protesting in nigeria against her pro apartheid policy in south africa where we are coming from is of course very far from where we are now where people are demonstrating to break nigeria in the days of yore it was unimaginable for us that there will come a time that advocacy will become fervent that we break nigeria into separate countries nigeria which we considered then as one of the small 52 states of africa just the size of california everything from farming practices pastoralist vs farmers differences in dressing climate and land are being thrown into the discussion to magnify our differences the methods are even regrettably pedestrian in what seems to be an argument that it is needless to save the unity of the country tragically those who have held high offices in nigeria at one point are stoking the current embers of disunity the truth very stubborn truth is that we are the same people more than the magnifying glasses of separatists want us to see nigeria may have diverse languages but the cultures of most nigerian ethnic groups are the same pointing to the same roots in distant history and here is why the cosmogony religious rights history and cultures of most nigerians pre colonial and pre arabic influence are largely the same despite diversity in language the african american scholar chancellor williams has already done justice to this question in his seminar work the destruction of african civilisation great issue of a race williams explained that two major factors account for why africa though account for less than three per cent of global trade is home to the highest numbers of languages and dialects in the world but same culture these factors are first the migration that occurred in prehistoric times because of the dry up desertification of the areas of the sahara which was home to a previously thriving culture and life the second was forced migration owing to various wars of conquest according to professor williams when people flee they go in small bands in different directions carrying the memory of their cultures and cosmogony but often lose their original languages as they travel far in nigeria it is possible to decipher a definite relationship in the pre colonial and pre arabically influenced cultures of western and northern nigeria these are presumed to be cultures whose ruling classes migrated from meriotic sudan ethiopia and egypt the same practices in the hausa bori cult of worship exists in the sango yoruba cult of worship similarly the same practices are found in the amadioha worship circle amongst the igbo who though are associated with the bantustan stock the details of these assumptions should have by now been a subject of a detailed study in archaeology history linguistics using modern technology of historical reconstruction cheikh anta diop who i consider the most outstanding african scholar historian physicist archaeologist and chemist has done some pioneer work on this subject and planned a perspective for historical reconstruction of africa cultures which establishes that africans are essentially the same people not different people and can live together and must ever break from been sliced into tiny groups for easy conquest this was the preoccupation in his books cultural unity of africa africa pre colonial the african origin of civilisation myth or reality civilisation or barbarism and last the economic and cultural basis for a federated african state i recommend these important works for advocates of separatism who constantly repeat the false doctrine that we are different people we cannot live together let everyone go their ways africans everywhere are of the same ancestry all human beings are of the same ancestry and so says the bible in act of apostle 17 26 and hath made of one blood all nations of men for dwelling on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation let us resolve our economic and political challenges in nigeria in the political turf let us keep ethnic division and religious bigotry out of it ethno religious confrontations are conflicts no one can ever win as all are always losers in that field nigeria is a beautiful country the most formidable promise of the african people it started well at independence and her people had learnt to live together peacefully well until the setback of the civil war triggered by the 1966 military coup the fantastic testament of our peaceful co existence and integration includes such occasions as when the mainly christian voters of gboko elected a kanuri muslim man abubakar imam to represent them in the northern state assembly it includes when chief obafemi awolowo campaigned for ernest ikoli an ijaw man in the lagos elections against a fellow ijebu man akinsanya in the early 1960 s right to the 70s easterners like kalu anya served in borno judiciary as well as justice olagunju a yoruba man from offa who trained many jurists in the sokoto division today s setbacks are not conclusive evidence of our inability to live together but challenges we must overcome as even the most advanced countries of the world such as the united states of america united kingdom spain and france still grapple with issues of identity nigerians up till today are still more tolerant of each other than the separatist propaganda wants us to believe even as we write the only seat allocated to kebbi state at the supreme court is occupied by a jurist originally from delta state who practised in the old sokoto state and married from argungu justice amina adamu augie kebbi people do not regard her as a foreigner but as a loyal daughter of kebbi it is time to talk a little more about the prime point in our journey to national integration rather than our low points nigerians can live together peacefully and in prosperity once we regain our minds to do some of the right things including decentralising more powers to the states and local government electing focused leaders with clear vision for economic and social development with character and antecedents that show they can deliver on promises and embarking immediately on a policy of national reconciliation and inclusiveness these are what nigeria needs not division olawepo hashim is a former presidential candidate copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content

the international air transport association iata welcomed the support of those governments around the world that have provided financial relief to airlines and urged other governments to follow suit before more damage is done airlines are fighting for survival in every corner of the world travel restrictions and evaporating demand mean that aside from cargo there is almost no passenger business for airlines it s apocalypse now and there is a small and shrinking window for governments to provide a lifeline of financial support to prevent a liquidity crisis from shuttering the industry said alexandre de juniac iata s director general and ceo according to iata s latest analysis released today annual passenger revenues will fall by 252 billion if severe travel restrictions remain in place for three months that represents a 44 decline compared to 2019 this is well over double iata s previous analysis of a 113 billion revenue hit that was made before countries around the world introduced sweeping travel restrictions it did not seem possible but in a matter of days the crisis facing airlines worsened dramatically we are 100 behind governments in supporting measures to slow the spread of covid 19 but we need them to understand that without urgent relief many airlines will not be around to lead the recovery stage failure to act now will make this crisis longer and more painful some 2 7 million airline jobs are at risk and each of those jobs supports a further 24 in the travel and tourism value chain some governments are already responding to our urgent calls but not enough to make up the 200 billion needed said de juniac in urging more government action de juniac cited examples of state support australia has announced an a 715 million us 430 million aid package comprising

denmark announced 300m in state loan guarantees for the national carrier in addition to this support the european central bank and the united states congress are expected to enact significant measures to aid the airline industry in their respective jurisdictions as part of large packages of broader economic measures this shows that states around the globe recognize the critical role that aviation plays in the modern world but many others have still to act to preserve the important role of this sector airlines are an economic and employment engine this is demonstrated even as passenger operations shrink as airlines continue to deliver cargo that is keeping the economy going and getting relief supplies where they are needed most the ability for airlines to be a catalyst for economic activity will be vital in repairing the economic and social damage that covid 19 is now causing said de juniac iata is calling for

sen josh hawley r mo held up the senate confirmation of one of president biden s nominees because of her history promoting radical critical race theorists hawley s spokeswoman said delivering a speech in june pretty clearly aimed at bolstering his political prospects former vice president mike pence said that critical race theory teaches children as young as kindergarten to be ashamed of their skin color wrong the critical race theory crt movement explain legal scholars richard delgado and jean stefancic is a collection of activists and scholars interested in studying and transforming the relationship among race racism and power its most direct academic origins can be found in the work of the late harvard law professor derrick bell who rigorously challenged mainstream liberal narratives of steady racial progress illustrating how landmark legislation the civil rights act of 1964 the voting rights act of 1965 and the fair housing act of 1968 failed to deliver liberty and justice for black americans advertisement the concept is certainly left leaning and it shakes up the traditional story of america as the unalloyed land of the free but its central contention isn t particularly radical or difficult to grasp far from preaching anti whiteness or black victimhood or rejecting individual rights critical race theorists seek to explain how our laws and institutions colorblind in theory continue to circumscribe the rights of racial minorities in the post jim crow post brown v board era they ask why and how do race and racism continue to play a constitutive role in america what developed as a framework for interrogating racial dynamics in american legal institutions influenced academics in neighboring disciplines notably including sociologist eduardo bonilla silva s conceptualization of color blind racism philosopher charles w mills s notion of a racial contract and education scholar gloria ladson billings s analysis of the racial achievement gap these works helped reinforce the insight that our country s severe racial inequities are deeply embedded in social structures so any serious attempts to rectify our racist history will necessarily involve structural reform diversity seminars are not reparations today elite law schools across the country offer courses in critical race theory yale law regularly hosts a critical race theory conference and ucla law s critical race studies program organizes an annual symposium with speakers from various disciplines contrary to critics who ve portrayed the idea as mere leftist folderol these are scholarly efforts to assess the impact of race in the law and society as an academic school of thought you can take critical race theory or leave it and many do advertisement for some the idea that american justice isn t completely colorblind or that racism can mean more than explicit individual hatred is simply a bridge too far but often rather than constructively engaging critical race theorists core argument many conservatives have preferred to contort the theory in order to claim that it is itself racist applying their trumped up definition to nearly any kind of discussion of racial injustice in america and then they attack that as un american or worse on newsmax tv former bill clinton adviser dick morris suggested that for biracial kids with a white father and a black mother critical race theory might reinforce the oedipal notion all kids have of wanting to kill their father and marry their mother televangelist pat robertson asserted that crt declares people of color have to rise up and overtake their oppressors and instruct their white neighbors how to behave rep mark green r tenn tweeted critical race theory destroys unit cohesion necessary to win in combat and defend this nation some of this traces back to the work of the manhattan institute s christopher rufo whose influence on the right has waxed as he pursues a self declared one man war against critical race theory publishing a raft of articles this year alone in may rufo boasted of his new influence tweeting that his d c trip itinerary included a speech to house republicans and meetings with the staffs of gop sens mitch mcconnell tom cotton and hawley he has suggested that the ideology of the ku klux klan is a simple transposition of critical race theory s basic tenets advertisement the goal seems to be to banish if not to ban all critical discussion of the impact of race in american life today consider rufo s insistence in a recent tweet that any school district material invoking the concepts of whiteness white privilege white fragility oppressor oppressed intersectionality systemic racism spirit murder equity antiracism collective guilt affinity spaces is guilty of teaching critical race theory he s among the culture warriors whose vilifications of critical race theory rarely make an effort to grapple with a straightforward proposition that our facially neutral system of laws can and does produce unjust racial disparities such as those we see in sentencing and in police violence and his crusade has trickled down in december turning point usa s charlie kirk an activist who once toured with donald trump jr defined critical race theory as the belief that racism is in the air it s in our bones it s in our dna the idea in his words that no progress has been made whatsoever on race one that is taking the racism that once existed in the american south and now weaponizing it against people that looked like the people that used to be the terrorists pushing the belief that there are no individuals and trying to destroy western civilization and the most racist thing that is being spread in popular life in america it is no different than the teaching of the kkk share this article share for most the moral panic around critical race theory isn t that intense but the phrase can still be a stand in for those who chafe at even the notion of systemic racism think of the aggrieved letter written by a parent at new york s brearley school and published by polemicist bari weiss ripping the school for adopting critical race theory and shrinking systemic racism to this definition systemic racism properly understood is segregated schools and separate lunch counters it is the interning of japanese and the exterminating of jews we have not had systemic racism against blacks in this country since the civil rights reforms of the 1960s advertisement no critical race theorist denies that there is a debate to be had about the contours of systemic racism none would dispute that debates about systemic or institutional racism have moved beyond law school classrooms but having those discussions isn t planting anti white hatred or resigning people of color to perpetual status as victims of it and teaching the history of racial movements tensions and atrocities and why their impact is still felt today isn t indoctrination it s part of a basic introduction to american history which should take place before a fruitful conversation about the strengths and weaknesses of critical race theory can get off the ground no one on the right can credibly say racism is a thing of the past or america is a colorblind society because that kind of blanket statement rings hollow when the last hundred years have been bookended by the tulsa massacre and the murder of george floyd nor can they flatly submit that difficult conversations about race are out of bounds instead they aim their objections at an academic sounding theory that connotes patriotically incorrect elitism critical race theory has become familiar enough for figures on the right to use it as an almost comically broad catchall in a two minute span on the senate floor hawley said the theory appears to have become the animating ideology of biden s administration and that anti racist scholar ibram x kendi advocates state sanctioned racism but the phrase remains just unfamiliar enough to excuse most of its critics from articulating their specific objections when kendi says the heartbeat of racism is denial instead of offering good faith counterarguments many of his skeptics write him off as an anti white race hustler they re less apt to point out that he devotes a chapter of his book how to be an antiracist to criticizing anti white racism or to note that kendi who acknowledges critical race theory s influence doesn t identify as a critical race theorist advertisement arguably the greatest success of this disinformation campaign has been its ability to convince parents across the country that critical race theory poses a real threat in the classroom as if grade schoolers nationwide are suddenly unpacking the relationship between redlining and today s racial wealth gap loudoun county va parent shawntel cooper s characterization of the theory as a tactic that was used by hitler and the ku klux klan secured her an interview with fox news s tucker carlson tatiana ibrahim a parent in carmel n y accused the school district there of implementing black panther indoctrination teaching our children to go out and murder our police officers and demoralizing students by teaching them communist values she too landed a fox interview some people see it as their duty to defend a stock american narrative against the complicating realities of racism and inequality fair enough but there s a difference between rejecting an analytical framework and wholly misrepresenting it and between intellectual criticism and race baiting demagoguery by this point the campaign against the theory and the phrase isn t even camouflaged in march rufo tweeted we have successfully frozen their brand critical race theory into the public conversation and are steadily driving up negative perceptions we will eventually turn it toxic as we put all of the various cultural insanities under that brand category to win the war against wokeness he wrote in april we have to create persuasive language from now on we should refer to critical race theory in education as state sanctioned racism that s the new weapon in the language war this past week he dialed the idea back in a wall street journal op ed making the narrower case that the battle over critical race theory isn t about some exercise in promoting racial sensitivity or understanding history but rather he says about shunning a radical ideology advertisement it s plain today s attacks on critical race theory aren t meant to rebut its main arguments they re meant to paint it with such broad brushstrokes that any basic effort to reckon with the causes and impact of racism in our society can be demonized and dismissed
the pandemic didn t stop chicagoans from celebrating the fourth of july in 2020 the sky was filled with red and white lights in neighborhoods across the city despite the absence of an official show now as the city has reopened and more people will be out to show their patriotism or simply to celebrate after a year lost to the shutdown there are concerns that even more amateur fireworks shows could lead to lost fingers or worse so far this year there doesn t appear to have been an uptick in illegal fireworks from jan 1 to july 1 there have been just over 5 500 calls regarding fireworks versus over 12 400 calls for the same time period last year according to office of emergency management center data provided by spokeswoman mary may the city is also back to holding its own show the official chicago lakefront show was set for saturday night and officials said the fireworks would be visible along the lakefront from grand avenue to the north to 55th street to the south navy pier will not be launching any fireworks over the holiday weekend but the pier will continue to have a fireworks display on wednesdays and saturdays through sept 4 despite the decrease in illegal fireworks calls there have been problems dr mark grevious chair of plastic and reconstructive surgery at cook county health said his health system has already seen three significant injuries resulting from fireworks a number he considers high before the actual holiday we actually have had more injuries prior to the fourth of july than we typically have he said now we re just beginning to emerge from the throes of the pandemic and that s likely why grevious said many of the children admitted to the hospital for burns came due to holding sparklers which typically burn at 1 800 degrees fahrenheit chicago fire district chief walter schroeder said a third of all emergency room visits of all ages over the fourth of july weekend are caused by sparklers we get adults who are handling these fireworks which are illegal sometimes alcohol plays a part in it they re celebrating and they lose the perspective of the dangers schroeder said it s the thought process that this isn t going to happen to me the fire department is preparing for large crowds over the weekend especially by the beaches schroeder said paramedics will be out on bikes and additional staff will be on duty to deal not only with fireworks but also the shootings that often increase over the holiday weekend please leave fireworks to the professionals if you have to light it leave it alone schroeder said the potential of something happening is too great firework injuries are preventable people who wish to turn in illegal fireworks can take them to a police station to have them disposed schroeder said the chicago police department said in a statement that its primary focus over the weekend remains on preventing and responding to violent crime but officers will continue to respond to all calls of service if residents report suspected illegal possession of fireworks in their neighborhood we will respond and investigate accordingly the statement said phantom fireworks manager joe zaradich smiles as he talks about the merrillville store s fireworks stock on june 28 2021 joe zaradich iv a manager of phantom fireworks in merrillville indiana said sales have increased from last year last year because of the cancellation of the shows we saw an increase as well zaradich said there is a shortage in fireworks because the pandemic caused a slowdown in manufacturing zaradich said his store ordered double what it did last year a third of the store s order has yet to arrive the good thing is that the product we didn t get yet will get here after the fourth of july so we can stock our shelves eli washington chairman of the chesterfield community council said he hears fireworks going off in tuley murray park until 2 or 3 a m it s been going on for the past two or three months he said washington said the council sent an email to the park district and the local police commander the week before the holiday asking them to really step up he said the commander responded and said there would be bike patrols in the area it s so goofy and stupid people are popping it in the middle of the day you can t see nothing when people are popping that stuff in the middle of the afternoon he said we just gotta get back to people respecting their neighbors in other areas of the city illegal fireworks haven t been as much of an issue but remain a concern sandra wortham is president of the nat king cole park council and lives with her family directly across from the chatham neighborhood park her concern is that fireworks may land on someone s roof and spark a fire last year block club chicago and abc 7 reported on a gresham couple whose home of 50 years was destroyed in a blaze that was likely caused by fireworks last year they were definitely out there doing a lot of fireworks she said it s dangerous to the person of course but as a resident and homeowner it s concerning because the sparks can fly onto a roof i don t think they should celebrate it in a way that makes us less safe wortham said she likes to sit outside and watch when people are igniting fireworks just to make sure nothing goes wrong and that someone can act quickly if it does the police and fire department do what they can she said but they re overworked if you look at the priority calls it s shots fired calls and firework calls you know how that goes she said they respond as they can but they have to get there and obviously especially on a holiday weekend they re going to get a lot of calls that aren t related to fireworks and related to actual violent crimes pfry chicagotribune

online mortgage lender that operates the rocket mortgage online platform which allows clients to apply for and service mortgages through the internet or by using rocket s proprietary mobile phone app ninety percent of rocket s revenues are derived from originating closing selling and servicing home mortgages rocket operates two primary segments 1 the direct to consumer segment and 2 the partner network segment in its partner network rocket partners with third parties who utilize its platform to provide their clients with mortgage solutions the partner network has lower operating margins because rocket shares profits with its partners the class period commences on february 25 2021 when rocket issued a press release titled in part rocket companies experiences explosive growth which announced rocket s financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020 rocket reported among other things closed loan origination volume of 107 2 billion and gain on sale margin of 4 41 for the fourth quarter rocket emphasized that it had ncreased gain on sale margin by 100 basis points year over year during the quarter and ncreased gain on sale margin by 127 basis points year over year to 4 46 for the full year period throughout the class period rocket continued to tout its business operations and downplayed the effects of competition on rocket s gain on sale margins the truth was revealed on may 5 2021 when rocket issued a press release announcing its first quarter results and second quarter outlook rocket reported that it was on track to achieve closed loan volume within a range of only 82 5 billion and 87 5 billion and gain on sale margins within a range of only 2 65 to 2 95 for the second quarter of 2021 at the mid point this gain on sale margin estimate equated to a 239 basis point decline year over year and a 94 basis point decline sequentially which represented rocket s lowest quarterly gain on sale margin in two years following this news the price of rocket s class a common stock dropped from 22 80 per share when the market closed on may 5 2021 to 19 01 per share when the market closed on may 6 2021 a nearly 17 decline the complaint alleges that throughout the class period the defendants made false and or misleading statements and or failed to disclose that 1 rocket s gain on sale margins were contracting at the highest rate in two years as a result of increased competition among mortgage lenders an unfavorable shift toward the lower margin partner network operating segment and compression in the price spread between the primary and secondary mortgage markets 2 rocket was engaged in a price war and battle for market share with its primary competitors in the wholesale market which was further compressing margins in rocket s partner network operating segment 3 the adverse trends were accelerating and as a result rocket s gain on sale margins were on track to plummet at least 140 basis points in the first six months of 2021 4 as a result of the above the favorable market conditions that had preceded the class period and allowed rocket to achieve historically high gain on sale margins had vanished as rocket s gain on sale margins had returned to levels not seen since the first quarter of 2019 5 rather than remaining elevated due to surging demand rocket s gain on sale margins had fallen materially below recent historical averages and 6 as a result of the foregoing the defendants positive statements about rocket s business operations and prospects were materially misleading and or lacked a reasonable basis rocket investors may

the goldilocks and no bears market we have goldilocks conditions as stock indices surge to new aths during the seasonally best time of the year the s p is up 6x from the 2009 lows not counting dividends the naz 100 is up 14x from the 2009 lows and with those kinds of gains who cares about dividends the major indices are all up 100 from last year s lows we clearly have a momentum market not a value market the s p tumbled 35 in six weeks in 2020 this year the worst setback has been 4 the fed induced tremor of two weeks ago is ancient history will the fed ever tighten again everybody knows that the greenspan put means that the fed bails out the market every time it falls but who remembers fed chairman bill martin and his assertion that it was the fed s job to be the chaperone who ordered the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming up that was truly a different era i ll bet jay powell remembers that quote but after his experience with saying we re a long way from neutral in october 2018 he probably has no stomach for channelling bill martin however another fomc meeting is scheduled for july 27 28 and jay may feel the market needs a dash of presbyterian tonic bond prices have been trending higher for three months the bond market doesn t seem to be intimidated by the inflation narrative especially when the fed is buying in size every day of the week when interest rates are ultra low people reach for yield in many different ways volatility metrics are near 15 month lows the us dollar has been in rally mode for six weeks currency speculators had been heavily short the usd before the june 16th fomc meeting and their short covering in the days after the meeting provided fuel for the usd rally the market seemed to be braced for a powerful us employment report this friday july 2 but the goldilocks report set up a daily key reversal crude oil continues its relentless rally outside of two days in october 2018 wti crude oil hit its best levels in seven years this week when it traded over 76 a barrel demand keeps rising opec keeps a tight rein on production increases us shale production after several years of astonishing growth is slow to recover capex is forecast to remain low and speculators keep buying the nearby backwardated forward wti curve keeps getting steeper as the demand for crude for immediate delivery as opposed to deferred delivery continues to increase this chart shows that the september 2021 wti contract is trading at a premium of 3 to december 2021 june 2021 was the worst month for gold in years gold dropped 170 from its high at the beginning of june to its low at the end of the month it fell nearly 150 in six days mid month it seemed as though gold was aggressively bid 225 from late march to june 1st on the inflation reflation narrative as the usd weakened still when gold couldn t extend the rally to take out the january 2021 highs speculators began to liquidate that selling was pressuring the market lower when the fed surprise hit and gold collapsed there was a weak bounce back last week and then new lows were made this week the good news is that gold recovered from this week s lows to close higher on the week if gold can rally above 1800 next week then this week s low will look like a false breakout which may be a breath of fresh air for the gold bulls the canadian dollar bounces back after a 3 cent sell off the cad rallied from 68 cents last march to a 6 year high of 83 cents in may june the 15 month rally was broadly in harmony with the pro risk mood that saw stocks and commodities rally while the usd fell following biden s election and the pfizer vaccine announcement last november the cad rallied to its best level in over two years and speculators began to build what grew into a huge net long position in the cad futures market my short term trading i became skeptical of the cad above 83 cents and started trading it from the short side i re shorted it on june 23rd after it had a weak bounce from the tumble it took on the fed surprise and covered that trade for a decent profit friday i had hedged part of that trade by selling otm cad puts i did not cover those puts which expire next friday when i covered the short futures position effectively ending the week net long the cad looking for the cad to either stay flat or rally i bought the euro friday as it recovered from a 3 month low this trade is in line with my long cad position i think the usd rally may take a breather i bought puts last week when gold had a feeble bounce following the fed surprise that trade looked good tuesday with gold down more than 30 at a 2 month low so i stayed with the trade unfortunately for me gold did not make new lows but turned higher and i closed out the trade for a small loss on my radar i think the stock indices are over extended and at risk of a correction but i won t sell a market that s making new highs if they show any signs of weakness i will try to get short with small size this has been a powerful rally i ve got a similar bearish idea for wti for similar reasons i m already positioned net long the cad and the eur for the usd to correct lower if it does i will add more positions it s interesting to see commodity indices led by crude trending higher even as the usd is trending higher i thought commodities were out of step but maybe it s the usd that needs to change best wishes to my american friends for a great independence day holiday but keep the following in mind subscribe you have free access to everything on this site

energy the pleasant news of the petroleum industry bill passage by the national assembly almost drowned the continued concerns and discourse being generated over the propriety or otherwise of the move by the nigeria national petroleum corporation s acquisition of 20per cent stake in dangote refinery and petrochemicals regardless of the heat this historic downstream deal is generating the share purchase move by nnpc may be a good sign that it is ready and equipped to play in the pib space chris paul reports the week ended on two positive notes the passing of the pib by both chambers of the national assembly and the signing of the term sheet between nnpc and dangote refinery since the pib is a process that may actually kick start in the medium term the nnpc dangote deal is of immediate concern and therefore the major focus of this story nigerian state oil company nnpc on tuesday signed the term sheet with dangote group to buy a 20per cent stake in the company s oil refinery under construction in lagos according to the nnpc gmd mele kyari nnpc is talking with banks to borrow on the back of its cash flow to buy the stake in the 650 000 barrel per day bpd refinery worth an estimated 19 billion dangote group had previously revealed nnpc and three other firms had approached it regarding a stake purchase for kyari having a stake in what would be the largest oil refinery in africa is worth the cost however the deal is still a proposition that is subject to cabinet approval constrained by gasoline price caps nnpc which is the sole importer of fuel in the country is being forced to sell the product at a loss that was why he raised the alarm about its revenue security and warned government that its remittances to the government could drop to zero due to fuel subsidy costs although it has not yet deliberated on it union groups in nigeria such as nigeria labor congress nlc have fought against any price increases although kyari is hopeful of a deal to shed the subsidy costs within the coming months he admitted the reality is that we can t afford it but if you don t do something smart you could end up with prices that nigerians can t afford he added of course there is a lot of sense in the nnpc gmd s blunt look at the issue given that as at 2016 nigeria had spent n4 69trillion on petrol import demurrage per annum representing the main source of export value nigeria s oil sector contributes about nine percent of the country s gdp nigeria the first to discover hydrocarbon in the whole african continent is the eleventh largest oil producer worldwide immediate past minister of state for petroleum resources ibe kachikwu said 20 million metric tonnes of premium motor spirit pms also known as petrol valued at n3 35 trillion was imported into nigeria from january to december 2016 between january and march 2021 the import of petrol into nigeria amounted to n688 billion in the last three quarters import value of oil experienced slight increase but the highest value was recorded in the third quarter of 2018 when an estimated n855 billion naira of petrol were exported to nigeria desperate for solutions to save n4 69 trillion yearly from massive importation of petroleum products and be delivered of the refineries challenge nnpc had planned to formally engage a pool of financiers after cost estimates were firmed up in june 2019 as indicated in a document detailing federal government s plans to rehabilitate the refineries nigeria spent n1 34 trillion yearly due to shipping and demurrage caused by inadequate port receipt facilities obviously federal government s plans to make nnpc a net exporter by end of 2019 is not happening for now plans by the president muhammadu buhari administration for the nation s downstream sector kicked off in its first few months in power in a june 2017 video podcast the former minister of state kachikwu told nigerians that nnpc had taken up the responsibility of a last resort importer producing petroleum products in an unstable environment as prices continue to take a big hit the country s target is to cease the importation of petroleum products by 2019 and get advantages in terms of foreign exchange conservation job creation and stabilise the market place in terms of pricing on our refineries we are currently seeking financing and not concession nor sale of the refineries for it s absolutely important to do whatever is needful in order to get the country s refineries upgraded enhanced and get the greenfield refinery builders supported and especially get any individual to co location refinery ownership interest kachikwu added the petroleum ministry also promised creation of an enabling environment for private sector led refineries in other words its plans to have all the four refineries working as a major route to making nigeria self sufficient in domestic production and supply of petroleum products in 2019 have collapsed supporting and creating an enabling environment for the private sector led refineries initiative is the major surviving part of its downstream plans for which dangote refinery has become a highly visible beacon and poster boy by the time it becomes operational the refinery alone will out produce nigeria s three major refineries the kaduna warri and port harcourt refineries with a combined nameplate capacity of 445 000 bpd the locally refined petroleum products will not serve only the nigerian market thus reducing the forex expended on importation of these products beyond serving and supplying the fuel and forex needs of the country the lekki based refinery will also serve international markets earning more forex for the nation the state of health of the forex soul of nigeria would be greatly enhanced in the shortest term possible once the 650 000 barrels per day refinery facility begins to work economic experts have posited that in a matter of months dangote refinery could crash the dollar so dramatically it is not impossible that the dollar falls to 1 n100 barring any unforeseen circumstances dangote refinery may be nigeria s most impactful project in the short term owned by the dangote group the dangote refinery is an oil refinery with the capacity to process about 650 000 barrels per day of crude oil making it the largest single train refinery in the world having invested over 7 billion which is just over 60per cent of his total net worth the group chairman aliko dangote is currently valued at 11 6 billion according to forbes followed by egypt s bashandyoil fossil crude oil refinery which produces 300 000 barrels per day in terms of production capacity the dangote refinery is the largest in africa incidentally both facilities are under construction dangote comes a distant second to paraguana refinery south america s largest refinery considered the world s third largest refinery and located in venezuela its production capacity is 956 000 barrels per day using the nigerian parallel market rate of n500 to 1 dangote refinery 19 billion investment represents n9 5 trillion representing approximately 48per cent of the value the value of dangote refinery is almost half of the equity market capitalisation when weighed on the nigerian stock exchange equity market capitalization crucible although altogether they are more valuable the refinery takes up 72per cent of the total value of the stocks worth over one trillion swoot which includes nestle nigeria airtel nigeria dangote cement bua cement and mtn have a current valuation as of the close of last days of june market at 13 3 trillion dangote refinery is bigger than the market capitalisation of all the top banks put together represented by the acronym fugaz which includes first bank of nigeria united bank of africa guaranty trust bank access bank and zenith bank by 389per cent ranked 30 and displacing omv an austrian multinational integrated oil gas and petrochemical company dangote refinery is the largest oil and gas company in africa with south africa s sasol coming in at second position with a market capitalization of 9 75 billion according to companiesmarketcap com sasol is ranked 44th in the world outperforming all major refineries belonging to well known oil companies like exxonmobil omv royal dutch shell total s a and vitol in europe dangote refinery comes next to jsc antipinsky refinery the only refinery in russia it outperforms the dangote refinery with a capacity of 896 500 barrels per day at 345 000 barrels per day only the chinese sinopec zhenhai refinery comes close to the capacity of the dangote refinery the production capacity of the dangote refinery also outperforms big opec nations refineries like saudi arabia ras tanura refinery saudi arabia s largest refinery controlled by aramco with a production capacity of 550 000 barrels per day is still lower than dangote s refinery but in the united arab emirates uae the dangote refinery s capacity is also second to the ruwais refinery abu dhabi oil refining company which produces 817 000 barrels per day in iran the dangote refinery is higher than abadan refinery which has the largest capacity in that country with 450 000 barrels per day producing at only 605 000 barrels per day the exxonmobil jurong island refinery which is the largest in the singapore is lower in terms of production capacity in north and central america dangote s refinery outperforms all major refineries on the continent even in big oil states like texas owned by motiva enterprises an american company that operates as a fully owned affiliate of saudi aramco port arthur refinery is the refinery that comes close to the capacity of dangote s refinery in texas with a capacity of 636 500 barrels per day dethroning anglo american platinum the world s largest primary producer of platinum accounting for about 38per cent of the world s annual supply which is currently valued at 13 05 billion dangote refinery will be ranked the 5th largest company on the continent surpassing cincinnati financial corporation an american insurance company that offers property and casualty insurance dangote refinery will be ranked 422 in america that being said the refinery will be bigger than some popular and well known companies such as domino s pizza 18 11 billion united airlines 16 91 billion gamestop 15 15 billion american airlines 13 60 billion mcafee 12 03 billion and western union 9 40 billion ranked 34 in the united kingdom uk dangote s refinery is bigger than the likes of easyjet which is currently valued at 5 95 billion in china the refinery will be ranked 92 in the country being more valuable than china s hua xia bank which is currently valued at 14 74 billion in saudi arabia it will be ranked 9 taking the spot from the saudi british bank which is currently valued at 17 25 billion when it commences production dangote refinery will be the largest refinery in africa the fifth largest company by market capitalisation on the continent and the largest single train refinery in the world competing with world refining superpowers in countries such as the united states china and saudi arabia the refinery will put nigeria in the spotlight for crude oil refining group executive director strategy and capital projects dangote industries limited devakumar edwin said the refinery is a strategic win for the nigerian economy with the capacity to create at least 250 000 jobs when it is fully operational with the size name plate the possibilities and opportunities that abound in the dangote refinery without a doubt the 20per cent stake is a major investment by the nnpc since the bottom line is for the nigerian people is to assured of available and affordable supply of petroleum products it is imperative that the national oil company removes all impediments on its way to accomplishing this deal there is a need therefore for the corporation to break as many protocols and procedures to ensure dangote refinery and other private refineries in the country are assisted in whatever way possible applying certain processes that will aid their coming on stream earlier than planned it will make the country wet enough for the product will be cheaper and available forex crisis will be a thing of the past and both government and the governed can have more than enough hard currencies for use most importantly inflation will go down as the cost of foodstuffs will come down considerably all said the 20per cent stake in the dangote refinery deal is an excellent move by the nnpc but it needs to be expedited if possible with the speed of light so part of the strategy is to borrow money from banks to finance the stake the loan must reflect the 20 percent of the 19 billion investment that is building the refinery already the corporation is making progress on securing 1 billion from financial institutions such as the afro exim bank among others however kyari keeps affirming that nigeria s money will not go into the deal but he forgets that in the event that he defaults god forbids it is not aliko dangote or dangote s refinery that will pay or service that debt but nigeria the issue that could arise in future here which may inform the fears of the dangote refinery team could be that a new government after this may come and devise all sorts of regulatory tactics to bully the refinery to pay off the loan on behalf of government in any case must the stake be 20 per cent kyari has said dangote did not come asking them to buy the 20 per cent stake in his refinery according to him the whole idea to acquire that amount of shares is nnpc s whatever the arrangement that needs to be arrived at to set up dangote and other near ready refineries to hit the ground running should be done quickly to save nigerians nigeria and the economy nigerians can no longer wait just as the nigerian economy is anxious to bounce back to life on the platform of this all important deal just as the government has made so many firsts in the development of the country and the economy the pib being the latest feather on that cap acquiring stakes in the dangote and other indigenous refineries should be an opportunity the buhari administration should grab preserve and protect jealously in all of these the issue to consider is the trillions of naira that will be spent on the ever skyrocketing cost of subsidising fuel where will it come from next year it will be too complicated and risky to tell nigerians to pay n256 per liter in these hard times worse still should the downstream sector continue in its state and fuel importation persists there may be no money as kyari had warned to pay into the federation account in other words over 60per cent of revenue will not be going into the federation account but the nnpc has the opportunity of a life time to save the country all the billions of dollar needed to develop other sectors of the economy so it should not allow itself to be sucked into needless or avoidable complications in the bid to get this deal working in any case if the 3 9 billion facility will be an issue the corporation can convert it into crude oil barter arrangement which would become the guarantee that can help the refinery owners source for more money the ongoing crisis in the country made worse by the growing insecurity is more than enough headache for any government adding fuel issues may blow up the whole country and there may be no nation or economy to manage in the event of a conflagration of the crisis brewing in the underbelly of the nigerian state at the moment it only makes sense therefore for nnpc to take the lowest hanging fruit and run with it as things stand today private refineries that are nearing completion and those under construction such as dangote refinery are the low hanging fruits waiting for government to pluck and place the nation on a socio economic redemptive course once buhari assents to the already passed pib this government would have won the elusive upstream regulatory framework gold to its list of unsung or disregarded laurels however come 2023 the upstream gold belt will neither do it nor calm

naked brand group is an underdog that s definitely worth rooting for the narrative surrounding naked brand group nasdaq nakd stock is shifting at least that is from the perspective of short squeeze potential i ll get to that in a minute a man and woman wear plain white underclothes from naked brand nakd source shutterstock now is the time for investors with bullish sentiment regarding its ecommerce transition and divestiture to plant their flag that should be the narrative for nakd stock now and moving forward the company has divested its brick and mortar bendon limited operations advertisement advertisement investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tips the company s current sole operating subsidiary is frederick s of hollywood if it is successful in pivoting its dying mixed retail brick and mortar and ecommerce brand into a pure ecommerce brand it ll be a hero story if it fails it won t so if you like a comeback story like i do nakd stock is worth considering short interest and nakd stock i mentioned that the narrative surrounding naked group brand is shifting early this year in january and february nakd stock was interesting for its short squeeze potential advertisement advertisement it was meme stock fodder and all over r wallstreetbets and other such forums the stock had the potential for a short squeeze because short interest was well above 20 this chart here tracks its short interest levels you can see that they fell from 32 in mid january to 6 6 by the end of may heading into july levels have fallen to 5 6 story continues thus all of the short squeeze to the moon apes are in control rhetoric from that crowd is dissipating the narrative now becomes about naked brand s operational ability to make frederick s of hollywood into an ecommerce force as it divests its bendon limited operations bendon is still part of nakd s future on april 30 naked brand group announced that it had divested itself of bendon limited and its brick and mortar operations usually the word divestiture conjures up the idea that all ties are severed but that isn t always the case when the news was announced naked group was clear that bendon limited is still part of nakd s future advertisement advertisement at that time naked brand group s wholly owned subsidiary foh online corp entered into a management services agreement with bendon pursuant to which bendon will provide various management services to foh online corp the company s recent prospectus pg s 2 provides further clarification about how bendon will help bendon will provide a full range of services to frederick s of hollywood including marketing manufacturing ecommerce customer service website management and every other aspect of running a brand you might imagine the point here is that naked brand group is still tied to bendon limited as it pivots into its ecommerce business focused on rebuilding frederick s of hollywood advertisement advertisement frederick s of hollywood is a legacy brand with a history that dates back to 1946 and naked brand group is the exclusive global online licensee for frederick s of hollywood intimates products sleepwear and loungewear products swimwear and swimwear accessories products and costume products that s what s going on now i d say that it is basically an uninteresting story in many aspects most investors don t really care whether legacy brands die or experience a resurgence to their former glory rooting for the underdog however in my opinion the reason to root for naked brand group lies in the swiftness with which it seized its current opportunity advertisement advertisement the company knew it was in dire straits long before the beginning of this year it knew that the future of retail is in ecommerce rather than physical locations but it didn t have the capital to do anything about it the company pounced on a sudden surge in short interest which spiked its share prices in mid january it then announced a 50 million direct offering of its shares it was successful in selling those shares viola it suddenly had money to do what it knew it needed to the bet now is that it can take that money and revive frederick s of hollywood as an ecommerce champion i don t know if it ll be successful but i like its story advertisement advertisement on the date of publication alex sirois did not have either directly or indirectly any positions in the securities mentioned in this article the opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the investorplace com publishing guidelines more from investorplace the post naked brand group is an underdog that s definitely worth rooting for appeared first on investorplace

leila fadel host we heard dr frederick caution wait wait we re not post pandemic but our own ron elving wants us to think about how far we ve come the last time july fourth arrived he writes this weekend it was hard to find much to celebrate ron elving is npr s senior washington editor and correspondent and he joins us now good morning ron ron elving byline good morning leila fadel so you ve been taking stock we just heard from a part of the country that frankly isn t doing so well what s your feeling about where the country is this independence day weekend compared to july 4 2020 elving sadly that depends on which country you re referring to unfortunately we seem to be more than one country these days in some ways leila more divided than at any time since the civil war with respect to covid we ve got about half the population vaccinated far higher percentages among adults far lower among young people and there s a wide divide among the states really saddens me to listen to dr frederick personally my heart goes out to the people of missouri i went to high school in the kansas city area missouri is also called the show me state leila it s proud of being hard to convince but facts are facts as the doctor said covid is coming back where vaccination rates are low and vaccination rates in missouri are among the lowest under 30 in many rural counties of the state fadel so we got more good economic news this week friday s job numbers beat expectations is the country on solid economic ground elving we do seem to be getting there the jobless rate is still elevated and some employers say it s hard to find people to fill jobs at least at current wages but the trend line is remarkably positive 850 000 is a lot of new jobs in one month fadel yeah elving the stock markets are setting records week after week and people are expecting to be back at work back in school and back on the ballfields this fall fadel the supreme court issued the last batch of the session s big rulings this week and the court sided with the state of arizona in one of them elving the court said arizona could throw out ballots that were mistakenly cast in the wrong precinct and limit the collection of ballots for delivery by others but the larger fear here is that this ruling the way it was worded is a kind of green light to the states that want to tighten restraints on voting in all kinds of ways now the court said even if these measures affect people of color disproportionately which they did that did not necessarily mean it violated constitutional rights now that is quite a departure from the spirit of the voting rights act and the way that act has been read by courts since 1965 including the lower federal courts in this very case so look this decision was 6 3 but it is hard to imagine it would not have been just the opposite 6 3 the other way if the 2016 election had come out differently fadel wow there s going to be a select congressional committee to investigate the january 6 attack on the capitol when trump supporters tried to stop congress and the vice president from certifying the results of the 2020 election what are your hopes for that elving in terms of settling the debate or healing the partisan divide this panel does not offer much hope it would have been much better to have an independent commission but republicans by and large said no to that they said it was time to move on stop talking about january 6 so now we have this version instead it does have a republican liz cheney from wyoming who is going to be part of it but of course she was one of the people who did hold president trump responsible that day and so this will not please many trump supporters but it could bring a wealth of information to light and perhaps in a way that will reach people and reveal the reality of what happened and for that i do have hope fadel that s npr s senior washington editor and correspondent ron elving ron thank you and happy fourth elving thank you leila happy fourth to you soundbite of music transcript provided by npr copyright npr

gatekeepers your ability to acquire funding find business partners network and even retain clients can hinge on signifiers outside your control historically white males over the age of 35 have controlled the levers of entrepreneurship in the united states fortunately the onset of the internet and technology has largely flipped this dynamic on its head young inventors and entrepreneurs from various backgrounds have changed the landscape paving the way for a new generation of diverse business innovators however while these changes have opened the door for young entrepreneurs it hasn t made the path easy particularly for teenagers when i launched my first startup milan farms i was 16 years old in the subsequent years i focused on new businesses including guin records an artist driven hip hop label i co founded with my sister misha though becoming a serial entrepreneur in my youth comes with a lot of sleepless nights it taught me a number of important lessons about myself my businesses and the pursuit of success more than anything i want to help young entrepreneurs make the world a better place for all of us and i hope that i can provide a few pearls of wisdom to make the process just a little bit easier learn and absorb all that you can the prevailing thought process among young entrepreneurs is that innovation should trump all else after all we often dump most of the world s existing problems on boomers and other past generations so why should we listen to what they have to say moreover the vast majority of highly successful entrepreneurs have been industry interrupters they came up with ideas that completely revolutionized antiquated processes and products however innovating does not mean ignoring the voices of generations past on the contrary learning from our elders is one of the only ways that we can figure out new methods of looking at existing problems it s not all about age either to build a successful business you must be willing to absorb knowledge wherever you can find it become a lifelong learner whether you spend hours on youtube listen to other young entrepreneurs take courses read or do your own personal research you should always find ways to learn more in doing so you can approach problems from a vantage point that is simultaneously new and groundbreaking while still grounded in the collective knowledge of both current and past innovators related 5 hard sacrifices you have to make to become a successful teen entrepreneur don t use your age as a crutch it s tempting to use age related barriers as an excuse or crutch when things get tough while this may make failures and setbacks a little less painful it will ultimately make it much harder to overcome them starting a business at any age is difficult particularly when you haven t even finished high school as a result you will likely be encouraged to wait or risk facing insurmountable barriers along the way it s tempting to use age related barriers as an excuse or crutch when things get tough while this may make failures and setbacks a little less painful it will ultimately make it much harder to overcome them starting a business at any age is difficult particularly when you haven t even finished high school as a result you will likely be encouraged to wait or risk facing insurmountable barriers along the way for example when i first started to work on dormzi and guin records i was surrounded by naysayers it wasn t that people didn t want to support me in fact many of them simply wanted to protect me from disappointment nonetheless i had to wade through these voices and trust that i had what it took to run my own business at such a young age this applies to teens who have already taken the plunge into entrepreneurship too you re inevitably going to face an uphill battle particularly with people who think you re too young or inexperienced to run a business while you should certainly listen to skeptics you shouldn t let this mentality affect your drive to succeed and you shouldn t respond emotionally at the end of the day you can t be successful without believing in yourself if you start to believe that you re too young to be successful it will become true therefore never let yourself use your age as an excuse or allow others to make yourself doubt your potential based upon your age use your age as an advantage you have more energy than you likely ever will more drive to build more drive to learn and most likely the least responsibilities you will ever have related 19 year old scottish teen s cancer motivates

the boom was followed by a bust as many pure play 3d printing companies didn t immediately deliver on lofty expectations rumors of the manufacturing technology s demise are clearly premature these days 3d printing is a high growth niche that is steadily reshaping the manufacturing and industrial sectors some estimates point to a doubling in annual revenue from additive manufacturing between 2022 and 2026 even growth investor cathie wood has launched a fund focused on manufacturing tech the 3d printing etf prnt 1 9 via her company ark invest here s what you need to know about 3d printing

terrible market underperformer since then losing three quarters of its value as of spring 2022 however desktop metal could still be a promising investment for the long term as its name implies desktop metal develops 3d printing hardware and accompanying design software for metal and carbon fiber parts the company s smaller systems can handle prototyping and one off parts and larger printers are production grade designed for manufacturing facilities desktop metal serves companies operating in automotive consumer goods and heavy industrial equipment businesses despite a tenuous start as a public company desktop metal was actually increasing revenue at a torrid triple digit pace in 2021 gross profit margins are thin and the company generated a steep net loss but that should improve over time as the business scales its operation desktop metal also has several hundred million dollars in cash and investments to fund its expansion it used some of these funds to acquire additive manufacturing peer exone at the end of 2021 2 stratasys 2 stratasys stratasys was part of the early 2010s 3d printing stock boom and bust but its business has endured sales took a dip early in the

bust period of the early 2010s its business has held steady for much of the past decade after a brief dip during the early days of the pandemic 3d systems is back in growth mode the company develops printers and design software for all sorts of materials and industries medical device makers dental labs semiconductor designers aerospace and automotive manufacturers it claims leadership among independent 3d printing companies as measured by sales as the 3d printing industry expands in the coming years 3d systems thinks it will be able to attract lots of new business with its extensive experience and global reach as an established tech outfit in the manufacturing sector 3d systems offers investors the prospect of more stable growth along with profitability it also has a large net cash position from which it can consolidate its lead in 3d printers and software technology 5 ptc 5 ptc by far the largest company on this list ptc is a longtime technology partner of manufacturing and industrial enterprises fast approaching 2 billion in annualized sales and highly profitable ptc has all the tools needed to digitally transform industrial businesses besides 3d printing computer aided design software ansys is a peer and software partner that also operates in this space ptc specializes in augmented reality industrial iot internet of things and product life cycle management software most of its revenue is subscription based including its creo software that enables 3d printing making for a stable and steadily growing business model that generates ample cash flow ptc puts spare cash to work developing new products for its partners and makes bolt on acquisitions of other software companies that enhance its overall portfolio as a larger company ptc won t be the fastest growing stock in the additive manufacturing and 3d printing space however the company has established itself as a leader in industrial technology and should be a primary beneficiary as the production of manufactured goods gets more efficient the future of 3d printing the future of 3d printing manufacturing technology is making inroads throughout the global economy by reducing the cost of production and localizing and speeding up the time it takes to deliver customer orders this is far from mere hype nevertheless as is the case with all technology investments progress won t go straight up expect twists and turns in these stocks as they develop new methods to design and make products if you decide to invest do so in a measured way maintain a diversified portfolio be wary of stocks benefiting from investor over optimism and always leave spare cash to invest more when there are inevitable dips given enough time years and decades investing in 3d printing could eventually provide a

felipe aros vera is an expert on complex systems he normally focuses on improving things like disaster supply chains and urban transportation if a power station were to go out he could use his expertise to help get it back online as rapidly as possible and with as little disruption as possible an assistant professor of industrial engineering at ohio university he brings to such logistical problems the formidable tools of mathematics and the computing power of one of the world s more powerful computers the ibm watson recently aros vera made a big switch he trained his tools on a completely different kind of complex system human trafficking through an unusual lens he doesn t just study these networks he s focused on how to create the greatest possible damage to them from robust to dead working to destroy networks is a big switch for aros vera his goal was always to make them more robust and more resilient things changed for him when four year ago he heard a lecture on human trafficking before the lecture human trafficking wasn t particularly on his radar in the few times he thought about it at all he assumed this particular crime was probably rare and occurred in faraway countries during that lecture he learned that far from being rare an astonishing 40 million people are enslaved today he also learned that human trafficking not only happens in the united states it was happening in his own town source adobe stock image learning how widespread and evil human trafficking is he wanted to do something about it and then he realized that a key aspect of human trafficking exactly fits his area of professional expertise trafficking is composed of networks his thought process was working with networks is what i do for a living i work to make critical infrastructure such as power lines be stronger more robust and able to recover more quickly what if with the human trafficking networks we did the opposite today aros vera uses supply chain engineering to determine where disruption can cause the greatest damage to a human trafficking network he focuses on determining which nodes to destroy to create the greatest possible damage to figure out how to create damage he needed to analyze sex trafficking networks as supply chains sex trafficking requires a steady supply of victims and this means identifying grooming and acquiring victims distribution of the product which in the case of trafficking means transporting victims from place to place creating a constant demand for illicit sexual service and this often means using the internet for advertising a management system for coordinating this including collecting the payments knowing the structure of human sex trafficking networks aros vera is making use of the ibm watson computer s huge repository of information to fine tune his approach to damaging them one of the ways he doing this is he s developed a risk score for the nodes in a trafficking ring on a scale of t1 to t4 a score of t3 let s law enforcement watch a node closely at t4 law enforcement can do maximum damage to the ring by arresting a person or persons who are part of the t4 node my approach aros vera says is on one end to use mathematical models and on the other end to identify problems on the ground from a prosecution and police department point of view he along with those he s working with are developing a dashboard that is updated whenever there s a human trafficking report in ohio his mathematical models get updated in close to real time law enforcement he explains can rapidly see what is happening and at the right time sweep in make arrests and do maximum damage to that trafficking ring no one approach to attacking human trafficking will by itself put an end to it however by combining powerful computers with high level mathematical models felipe aros vera has given the world a fresh and powerful tool for damaging the trafficking networks for more information contact him at aros ohio edu

the days when the msci em index was dominated by commodity producers in latin america are long gone today companies in china taiwan south korea and india make up three quarters of the index tech in particular dominates information technology stocks are 20 per cent of the msci benchmark however daniel salter of renaissance capital an em and frontier market equity specialist says their true weight is almost twice that much by his calculations including tech companies in sectors such as communications services and consumer discretionary tech stocks make up 38 per cent of the index that compares with less than 5 per cent for energy stocks and 9 per cent for materials nevertheless commodities and em stocks have continued until recently to move in tandem that may simply be a reflection of investors appetite for risk but there are real world reasons too often the driver for both sets of assets has been china the country s resilience to the pandemic it was the only major economy to register growth in 2020 might suggest this narrative was still alive but concerns over shaky finances in parts of china s economy have once again showed up on investors radars advertisement beijing has increased its scrutiny of the country s us17 trillion 22 6 trillion credit market making financial stability once again the priority over economic growth with the world s second biggest economy unlikely to power ahead as before the impetus behind both commodity prices and em stocks has slowed thankfully for commodity producers the us and president joe biden s stimulus spending has stepped in to keep demand on the boil a chinese slowdown would normally be reflected in softer commodity prices says ian beattie fund manager at nedgroup investments but there has been an offsetting boost from the biden stimulus package and the economic reopening in the us and europe a global recovery led by the us and europe should be good for em exporters in general but that prospect is undermined by the associated threat of inflation and rising interest rates you can tell a really positive macro story with the opening of the global economy a return of tourism the potential for a new commodity boom says mary therese barton head of emerging debt at pictet asset management but on the other hand we would probably struggle to find a strong structural growth story she described markets as overshadowed by uncertainty which had been exacerbated by data surprises from the us on employment and inflation everyone is expecting surprises she says but how can we make forecasts when we get this scale of outsized surprises on us data advertisement she is not alone in expecting a bumpy ride ahead simon quijano evans of gemcorp capital a longtime em specialist said investors had been thrown by the quantity of economic data surprises and the confusion caused by unprecedented comparisons with a low base last year many are also coming to terms with the completely new experience of rising inflation at least for those not familiar with the boom and bust ride of ems investors in developed countries quijano evans says appear ready to put the pandemic behind them but the global picture is still uneven with coronavirus case numbers still high in parts of south america and the possibility of new variants a continuing danger until the global vaccine rollout matches that of the rich world the decoupling of commodities and em stocks he says is a pre taste of what is to come i am pretty sure there are going to be a lot of surprises that we are not thinking about now because we have not been faced with this situation before he says many of us thought 2021 was going to be easier than 2020 but dealing with the spillover effects of covid 19 in the real economy will last at least into 2022 financial times

director jerry chandler told the associated press it s been three weeks that we ve been supporting families who are running away from gang violence he said we are working at renewing our stocks but the biggest problem is logistics he said officials are still trying to figure out how to deliver supplies to haiti s southern region which braced for elsa s impact as the storm approached people kept buying food and water i m protecting myself the best that i can civil protection is not going to do that for me said darlene jean pierre 35 as she bought six jugs of water along with vegetables and

triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox those looking to buy a late model car truck or sport utility vehicle may suffer from sticker shock when they see the price of used vehicles which the u s government s consumer price index calculates have risen by about 30 since may 2020 it s all about the inventory there s a high demand and a low inventory said lisa mcintyre executive director of the greater pittsburgh automobile dealers association a trade association representing about 200 dealerships in southwestern pennsylvania when there is not a sufficient number of new vehicles to fill demand or buyers don t want to pay new car prices they turn to used cars pushing prices up mcintyre said a certified pre owned vehicle rose in price from about 10 000 in february to about 11 500 to 11 800 now said jeff dohallow general manager for kenny ross subaru in north huntingdon at nick chevrolet in tarentum sales manager glenn harbison said the dealership saw used car prices rise probably 4 000 or 5 000 more than at the beginning of the year in essence the used car market is exploding harbison said unfortunately for the consumer but it s just the way that the market is the used cars are worth more than they ve ever been said mark smail general manager of the smail auto group a hempfield family business that has been in the auto industry since the 1950s at hillcrest volkswagen in lower burrell general manager bob bordonaro said the dealership placed more money on trade ins just because of what the market is doing we aren t just taking cars and raising prices bordonaro said at choice auto a murrysville used car dealership the prices are significantly higher and are going up said ray murphy finance manager some used vehicles have jumped up from 2 000 to 4 000 he said but that has not prevented 2021 from being extremely busy managers and owners at several dealerships in the region say higher prices haven t deterred buyers because we re selling a lot of certified pre owned vehicles dohallow said the average price for those used vehicles is about 22 500 said umar sheikh an assistant vice president and credit analyst manager at euler hermes north america a research firm sheikh is not optimistic about a quick resolution predicting the imbalance between supply and demand and higher used car prices will linger into the late third quarter or early fourth quarter u s auto sales for the year are expected to hit 15 8 million vehicles based on sales as of june according to analysts from j d power and lmc automotive that sales number is about 2 6 million vehicles higher than during the pandemic restrictions in june 2020 but still fewer than the 17 million vehicles sold on an annualized basis in may 2021 and june 2019 auto industry analysts foresee better sales in the second half of the year pandemic impact the pandemic reduced the demand for vehicles because people were staying at home for work and not going on vacation last year automakers in turn cut back on the assembly line workforce to prevent the spread of covid dohallow said some autoworkers did not want to work for fear of catching the coronavirus thus reducing the number of people available to make vehicles the big three automakers in north america fiat chrysler ford motor co and general motors corp are expected to produce about 750 000 fewer vehicles this year than projected sheikh said with fewer people buying new cars last year and some dealers not permitted to sell new cars because of covid automakers did what seemed to make good economic sense they canceled supply contacts dohallow said that meant the semiconductor chips needed to operate so many functions of the vehicles weren t sitting in the assembly plant s storage room those tiny semiconductor chips did find a home in all the electronics people were buying because they were working from home using devices such as smartphones and laptops smail said contracts that might be filled by auto manufacturers went to the electronics industry he noted the loss of those semiconductor chip supply contacts was exacerbated smail said when a fire struck a japanese chip plant in march that plant according to reuters supplies close to one third of the semiconductor chips used in the auto industry so robert thomasson iii general manager of spitzer toyota in monroeville said that meant there weren t the 200 to 300 chips for each new toyota vehicle and that didn t just affect toyota inventory of new volkswagens is the lowest i ve seen in the last probably 25 years hillcrest s bordonaro said the new car inventory has dropped to 16 when normally the dealership has about 70 new vehicles on the lot bordonaro said the drop in part resulted from the manufacturer temporarily stopping production for u s made vws production recently restarted dealers go shopping smail said they have turned to buying cars from customers who are not even shopping for another vehicle maybe the seller is the senior citizen couple who realize after a year at home they don t need a second car they also may buy a leased vehicle when a motorist s lease is up he noted harbison at nick chevrolet said the dealership is purchasing leased vehicles and used models from owners looking to sell the trade off for higher used car prices is that owners are getting more money for their trade ins or sale of their used vehicle harbison said but thomasson said that market buying used vehicles is gone as of the second quarter added to the difficulty in obtaining used vehicles is the competition from rental car companies that normally stock new vehicles smail said those companies are snatching up the late model vehicles for their fleet when they can t fill their need with new vehicles the biggest hurdle is not selling the cars it s getting the cars choice auto s murphy said choice auto owner kirk rettger said they typically have an inventory of 200 cars but are down to about 150 and to maintain that inventory has meant casting a wider net for used vehicles including bidding on cars from out of state sources rettger said with dealers holding on to certified pre owned vehicles and not sending them to auto auctions that makes it tougher for businesses in the region that only stock used vehicles said thomas barchesky a partner in the family owned superior motors used car sales along route 30 in unity there s none late model cars for us barchesky said smail and thomasson say their dealerships send few used cars to auto auctions those that do go would not qualify as certified pre owned vehicles and would cost too much to repair and refurbish thomasson said a national used car buyer will come to the lot and assess a vehicle set a price shop it on the internet to customers and it could be gone in a few days without ever paying someone to drive it to the auction and some of the cars that are going through the auction are going for retail value rather than wholesale prices leaving little room for a profit said barchesky whose grandfather opened the business in 1964 barchesky said when he goes to the auction he is competing against larger used car dealerships with deeper pockets like blue knob auto sales near duncansville and national buyers like carvana used cars dealers are watching their inventory not wanting to lose money when used car prices eventually drop i don t think the bottom is going to fall out tomorrow said choice auto s rettger dohallow is not optimistic that the shortage of late model used cars coupled with higher prices for existing inventory will rectify itself anytime soon smail predicted the supply and demand for used cars will right itself by the end of the year as more new vehicles become available we re going to be in the used car business in july and august smail said of the dealerships joe napsha is a triblive reporter covering irwin north huntingdon and

there are no fees for customers to use the service instead primarybid gets paid by the issuing companies based on the amount of money that it raises for them the app has faced some technical issues when trying to process high levels of demand which sambasivan acknowledges and refers to as growing pains but that hasn t stopped him from rapidly expanding last month the company announced plans to launch in france it also has its eyes set firmly on the us the 41 year old s global ambitions reflect his own international upbringing he was born to a middle class family in bombay in india spent most of his childhood in singapore went to university in the us and became a british citizen in 2016 he has worked as investment banker at bank of america and credit suisse in both new york and london before launching primarybid in 2016 the founder says that getting any listed companies let alone major ones to include a retail offering was difficult during primarybid s first three years but the huge number of recapitalisations that took place in the midst of the pandemic spurred a wave of new interest the company has been involved in more than 160 deals to date including nearly 70 already this year headcount has jumped from 15 in march 2020 to 130 today and its platform has more than 200 000 subscribers its biggest backers include the london stock exchange group lseg draper esprit fidelity and venture capital firms pentech and outward we re not a confrontational business says sambasivan our whole goal is to make it seamless for the banks to integrate with us it s not a conflict we actually get brought in by the banks he adds that feedback from city fund managers has been positive as getting retail investors involved early in the process helps to build liquidity and allows for quicker price discovery a point which is echoed by other city sources but there are some concerns that the high levels of retail participation in the market over the past year have been driven by pandemic induced boredom increased levels of savings and stimulus in the economy so could primarybid merely be a fad charlie walker head of primary markets at lseg thinks higher levels of retail involvement is here to stay he points out that the uk has comparatively very low levels of retail participation compared to other major markets such as the us in chinese markets for example 90pc of liquidity comes from retail investors so this isn t necessarily a uk trend this is something we re seeing happening around the world he says sambasivan says primarybid is currently ploughing money into growth and its main goal is to break into new markets if we wanted to we could be a profitable company today but our story is not nearly done yet

jacob parr puts on a pair of work gloves and walks around to the backyard of his chesapeake virginia home heading straight for a kiddie pool next to the back fence from afar it doesn t look like much but when parr walks over he reaches into the pool and lifts out a long skinny anchor covered in rust for perhaps 300 odd years the anchor likely was in a suffolk waterway gathering corroding salt but no attention that was until parr a 27 year old hobbyist recently found it using nothing more than a magnet on a rope now virginia archaeologists are interested in preserving the anchor and learning more about how it fits in with the region s maritime history including a ghost fleet of ships they were already studying just a few hundred feet away it all started earlier this year when parr came across the concept of magnet fishing on the video platforms tiktok and youtube it s a blend of treasure hunting and environmentalism proponents say magnet fishers place magnets on ropes and throw them into water to see what sticks parr a local firefighter started magnet fishing in march he finds everything from rusty nails to bicycles and shopping carts he recently pulled up a lime scooter from the elizabeth river at norfolk s waterside the environmentalist side comes from cleaning up the water parr said he never throws items back in he loads up his pickup piles the haul in his backyard and eventually scraps the metal you never know what s down there he said parr and his wife katie were magnet fishing june 13 at constant s wharf along the nansemond river in suffolk in a video on his youtube channel the tidewater magnet thrower he documented the day s finds which included a baby stroller and some old metal that was likely bridge scaffolding at one point he had to jump in the water after some lost equipment but he kept feeling his magnet get stuck on something big he said the magnet he was using theoretically is able to pull up to 1 400 pounds though using it underwater complicates things he felt it attach to something but couldn t quite yank it up so parr added a grappling hook onto the magnet which managed to snag the ring at the top of the anchor what kind of freaking pirate ship is this off of parr said with a laugh in the video while hauling the anchor onto the dock coincidentally his youtube logo already included an anchor now it means so much more he said but at the time parr didn t know just how old the iron relic was or that the waterway now fronted by everyday businesses already was on state archaeologists radar in 2017 suffolk resident and historical society member kermit hobbs went to the nansemond river with a drone during low tide by flying overhead his drone captured the wooden bones of several ships and a team of archaeologists began documenting what they called the nansemond ghost fleet in their resulting report last year the team said it ultimately found remnants from myriad vessels that played a role in the modern industrial development of suffolk including ones with names like a crab scape scow schooner bugeye and more the constant s wharf area was a beehive of activity at its height in the 18th and 19th centuries said brendan burke a member of that team who is an underwater archaeologist for the virginia department of historic resources boats were coming in and out constantly of what was then nansemond county delivering and exporting everything from lumber and textiles to sugar and cutlery there were lots of things changing hands burke said it was not uncommon for things to fall overboard that s an archaeologist s dream he said because it provides a lens into the culture of those eras waterway sites are particularly revealing because everyone passed through regardless of gender race or socioeconomic class he added after parr took the anchor home this month he came across the virginian pilot s article about the ghost fleet and reached out to burke to see if his find might be connected it is burke said in the sense of the general area all being part of maritime history the style of this anchor is very common to the 18th and 19th centuries but it s hard to narrow the time frame burke told the pilot it would have had a wooden crosspiece called a stock he said the ring at the top also indicates a rope anchor line was used instead of the more modern anchor chain those traits are generally associated with the pre civil war era it s possible the anchor was used more recently though unless lost in the water anchors generally last and get reused burke noted someone could ve bought it from a stack of old anchors a neighbor had lying around it s therefore hard to tell whether the anchor was lost in the most recent century or whether it s been buried in the nansemond all along everyone agrees the anchor is a great find but parr and the state differ over what to do next burke plans to go out to chesapeake and take measurements what he d prefer though is for the anchor to be put back in the water at the suffolk site proper conservation of iron artifacts which involves soaking it in electric charged water to draw out corroding chlorides is time consuming and expensive burke said the state would rather the artifacts be left and monitored where they were found alongside any others that are there and can give context to the archaeological site parr however said he doesn t want to risk someone else taking the anchor he s seeking to donate or sell the anchor to an interested museum but needs to figure out logistics and hopes for it to remain local so he could visit in the meantime the anchor s sitting in the kiddie pool before he put it in water it turned bright orange within days parr hopes to build his youtube following keep cleaning the water and find some more neat stuff one man s junk and all that but it ll be hard to beat the anchor he said i have my work cut out for me to find something cooler than this
