article article body reserve bank governor philip lowe s speech on inflation yesterday was drafted well ahead of scott morrison s comments about how the coalition would keep interest rates lower than labor indeed much of the monetary policy content of the speech was a repackaging of lowe s media conference on november 2 and the minutes of the rba board meeting of that day so he can t be accused of being political in his comments nonetheless it pointed to a stark distinction between the adults in the room of economic policymaking in australia and a desperate prime minister looking for a scare campaign morrison s accusation is that labor will somehow force interest rates higher than they should be presumably by spending an even bigger proportion of gdp than the 26 27 morrison is spending or by managing the economy more successfully so that growth picks up quicker but lowe s point is that interest rates will go nowhere until wages growth is up in the 3 range and forces inflation sustainably up above 2 and they ll go nowhere despite the conniptions of bond markets the commentary of inflation hawks and the demands of neoliberals in places like the australian financial review just to make it absolutely clear lowe waited right until the end of the speech and said i would like to repeat a point i made a couple of weeks ago that is the latest data and forecasts do not warrant an increase in the cash rate in 2022 the economy and inflation would have to turn out very differently from our central scenario for the board to consider an increase in interest rates next year how s that for clarity bond bunnies and an implied rebuke of a prime minister warning that rates will go up under labor lowe and the bank are unfazed about current inflation levels he walked through what s driving inflation in australia compared with the rest of the world pointing out commonalities and differences an important point was that the pandemic and its aftermath have posed a fundamental challenge for what has been a default setting in global manufacturing and logistics for decades just in time supply chains that rely on low inventories but time effective distribution these proved vulnerable to the impacts of the pandemic and to the volatility in demand caused by lockdowns and their ending but lowe also explained that that volatility means the current high levels of demand from consumers spending money saved during the pandemic is likely to return to normal as those reserves are exhausted and the shift in consumption during lockdowns from services to goods is likely to revert as well relieving demand side pressures as opposed to the united states and the uk where labour market pressures are driving big wages growth which could well feed into inflation in australia we ve seen no such growth lowe understands something bond markets and the afr do not that as households lockdown savings are exhausted and with no expectation that wages will rise consumers will cut spending again in lowe s view it was likely wages growth needed to be above 3 to get inflation back to the middle of the rba s 2 3 target band we are using wages growth as one of the guideposts in assessing progress towards our goal and whether inflation is sustainably in the target range lowe said even then this by itself does not warrant an increase in the cash rate as i have said much will depend upon the trajectory of the economy and inflation at the time maybe that s what morrison is warning australians about that labor might lift wages growth above 3 for the first time in a decade prompting the rba to finally lift rates this article was first published by crikey
photo above is a stock photo and not associated with this case when your job just isn t satisfying you there are certain things you just cannot do as one eastern iowa man learned the hard way late last year 30 year old jacob stepp started working behind the cash register at a dollar general store in fayette in northeast iowa stepp was working at the store part time and wasn t pleased with the number of hours he was working he was apparently desperate for more work so desperate he d do anything if his boss would put him on the schedule more often according to the iowa capital dispatch on april 1 2021 april fool s day stepp is accused of sending his boss nikki everheart a text he was upset that his hours had been cut and that he was working only one day the next weekend the text allegedly said in part idk what you want from me or want me to do to prove to you i want this job i didn t want to have to ask this but are you cutting my hours because u want something sexual u wouldn t be the first boss i had to f to get more hours had to do the same thing when i worked at another company i m serious nikki i ll do whatever it takes to get at least 3 days a week just name what you want and i ll do it it was foolish alright after receiving the text everheart shot it over to her district manager stepp was out of work before the day was over iowa capital dispatch reports he was fired due to unwelcome sexual advances and unwelcome sexually suggestive texts what surprised me was that after being let go stepp received almost 600 in unemployment from the state of iowa he also got an additional 1 200 from federal pandemic unemployment compensation daniel zeno an administrative law judge ruled during a hearing that what stepp said in that text disqualified him from receiving the benefits judge zeno said mr stepp sexually harassed ms everheart in clear violation of the employer s policy mr stepp s april 1 text message was basic offering sex in exchange for being scheduled at least three days per week sexist and disqualifying misconduct there had been a previous hearing on stepp s unemployment eligibility however dollar general did not take part in that so stepp will keep the 590 in state benefits that s unfortunate but the rules are the rules however the 1 200 in federal pandemic unemployment compensation he received will have to be paid back highest paying jobs in iowa in 2021 these are the top 20 highest paying jobs in the state

thanksgiving has been known as the unofficial start to the holiday shopping season since the first modern thanksgiving day parade in 1924 the term black friday however did not arise until the 1960s when police officers in philadelphia complained about the traffic and congestion caused by holiday shoppers retailers however did not appreciate the negative connotation associated with the name black friday so they changed the meaning of the name to reflect the financial successes of that day traditionally accountants used red ink to show negative amounts and black ink to show positive amounts so retailers used this habit to rebrand black friday the new meaning behind the name is that black friday is the day when retailers finally begin to turn a profit for the year what time do black friday

costs is 96 50 the change will raise a typical home bill starting in january to roughly 126 a month these increases only apply to the supply portion of a customer s electric bill not the distribution expenses to bring the power over wires to homes and businesses cmp only distributes electricity it doesn t generate it for context cmp s residential delivery rate is 11 1 cents per kwh it was last adjusted in august and will be reset again next july advertisement the new supply rate will be in force for one year rate spike triggers debate that duration is triggering a debate over whether the puc s policy of seeking bids only once a year is trading rate stability for a desire to snag the lowest prices on wednesday the office of public advocate which represents consumers on utility issues suggested that this year s negative experience should prompt a larger review of the state s standard offer bidding process these developments come one day after the puc selected standard offer providers for versant power customers in eastern maine that will raise supply rates by more than 88 percent adding 30 a month to a typical bill cmp has roughly 560 000 residential customers in southern and central maine and distributes roughly 78 percent of the state s residential electricity supply in addition to home customers businesses that get their electric supply through the standard offer also face steep rate hikes advertisement for cmp s medium class business customers the new prices will vary by month averaging about 11 cents per kwh more than half of those businesses get power supplied by competitive providers not the standard offer but those that don t will see an average 82 percent increase annually in the supply portion of their bill prices for cmp s large business customers will be indexed to market prices and set in advance of each month during deliberations puc chair philip bartlett lamented the higher prices but said they were the best available at this time as he did on tuesday bartlett blamed the steep rise on high wholesale prices of natural gas which is used to generate half of new england s power and typically sets the market price for electricity in the region dan burgess director of the governor s energy office called the new rates a direct result of new england s over reliance on natural gas to power the electric grid referencing natural gas reliance commissioner patrick scully suggested that as the region transitions to more renewable generation in the coming years namely solar and wind the impact of natural gas will be reduced that will mean less volatility and fewer price swings he said but drew landry maine s acting public advocate said the pending sharp increase has another dimension advertisement current puc policy calls for seeking standard offer bids on an annual basis that has several benefits it coincides with how suppliers set market prices and when wholesale markets are low as they have been the past two years it locks in attractive rates for customers in the coming year but that practice has risk if wholesales prices suddenly soar as they have in 2021 consumers will have to bear the impact over the next year that s what customers face in 2022 the obvious downside of the current process is price stability landry said price stability is one of the core principles of utility ratemaking but there is another strategy to get supply bids energy experts call it laddering in that process the puc would solicit bids more than once a year that way if wholesale prices change suddenly the impact is blended over time and not felt as sharply it s a way to hedge bets consumers may not enjoy the lowest rates all the time but they won t get slammed by record highs either the maine puc operated this way in the past here is a summary from the puc s annual report in 2005 advertisement the puc continued to procure standard offer supply in accordance with the hedging program that began in 2005 the program relies on a laddering structure that allows the puc to secure portions of the required supply at different points in time thereby reducing customer exposure to the volatility of the wholesale market when the hedging program began bids were requested for one third load segments for terms of one two and three years that set the clock for subsequent procurements of one third segments annually as the initial terms expired this technique is used in many states that have restructured electricity markets according to barbara alexander an energy consultant and former consumer assistance division director at the puc maine is an outlier by conducting annual solicitations she said it would be the equivalent of purchasing one stock that looked good for your portfolio and just riding the wave of whatever impacted that stock alexander said as did landry alexander said the current policy sacrifices the stability that many customers count on to pay monthly bills as a consumer advocate who has done work in this field for 30 years i m appalled alexander said for a couple of years we got low prices but now we re going to pay for it asked whether he was concerned that the puc may have chosen one year bids at the peak of the current wholesale price trend bartlett defended the current practice bartlett emphasized the low rates mainers have enjoyed in 2020 and 2021 and that they wouldn t have seen prices as low with hedged bidding he said it was the commission s current view that over time customers get a better deal with one large annual procurement advertisement there s no magic bullet here bartlett said competitor prices likely up too the companies selected to serve standard offer customers in cmp s service area for 2022 weren t immediately identified in recent years they have been subsidiaries of nextera energy new brunswick power and constellation energy in 2021 the power mix these generators provided was dominated by natural gas making up a 70 percent share according to puc disclosure statistics the mix was rounded out by 11 percent hydroelectricity 9 percent oil 4 percent biomass and 6 percent from miscellaneous sources in terms of climate impact this energy mix emitted an average of 885 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour 15 percent above the new england average the puc reported the standard offer increase doesn t affect customers who get their electric supply from competitive energy providers although those contracts also are expected to increase in price most home and small business customers rely on the standard offer roughly 92 percent in versant s service area and 87 percent in cmp s territory according to 2020 puc statistics advertisement during tuesday s versant deliberations scully suggested that electric customers dissatisfied with the standard offer rates might explore the offerings of competitive energy providers those rates which aren t chosen or regulated by the puc might dip a few months from now scully said if wholesale market conditions change that idea also was raised by landry who said it s possible that wholesale electric prices could moderate in the spring after peak demand for natural gas this winter the office of public advocate maintains a web page with some samples of competitive energy provider deals a full listing of retail energy providers is available on the puc website but that strategy also involves risk customers who sign contracts with competitive providers must be aware of the duration and terms as well as possible early termination fees the practices of one large provider electricity maine led to a class action lawsuit and multimillion dollar settlement in 2020 the pending hike in electric supply rates is part of a trend in rising energy prices that are hitting consumers as winter approaches average gasoline prices in maine reached 3 43 a gallon this week according to gasbuddy approaching a 10 year high that s up 15 cents from last month at this time and up 1 29 from a pandemic induced driving lull prior to thanksgiving last year a softening of wholesale petroleum prices however may cause prices at the pump to ease in time for holiday travel

china us woes will spell thai gloom an idle construction site for an evergrande residential project in taiyuan china is pictured on oct 20 last week dmsa a german financial market watchdog reported the group defaulted on interest payments to international investors sparking fears of a financial crisis photo the new york times on nov 10 there was a drama in the international financial market dmsa a german financial market watchdog issued a press release stating that china evergrande group defaulted on interest payments to international investors and was preparing bankruptcy proceedings evergrande group is the second largest real estate developer in china with total outstanding debt of us 89 billion 2 9 trillion baht the company s financial problems have been known for years but no one expected that it would default on international debts as this could tarnish china s economic reputation furthermore it could trigger panic sales of chinese stocks and bonds much like what happened to thailand prior to the asian financial crisis in 1997 investors hoped that the chinese government would step in something like that did actually happen before the market closed evergrande s ceo paid the 148 million interest payment and the company narrowly escaped bankruptcy he got the cash by selling off his two private jets and taking a loan from china construction bank collateralised with his mansion in hong kong whether he did all that by his own will or under some kind of pressure was anybody s guess evergrande s drama is unlikely to end well as there is another interest payment of 255 2 million due on dec 28 which has to be paid by jan 27 i have no idea how the company or the ceo can come up with the funds does he have more luxury items to sell even if they can save the company there is still a total of 8 billion of interest and principal payments that have to be paid next year evergrande is a part of the troubled chinese real estate sector which accounts for 30 of its gdp the boom in china s real estate sector saw an estimated 30 million residential units remain unsold and a further 100 million sold but unoccupied altogether these units which are estimated to be worth around 26 trillion can house 340 million people even in a country of 1 4 billion people where would they find the demand for these units widespread bankruptcy in china s real estate sector and among speculative investors is to be expected the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008 which involved debts of around 10 5 trillion caused a global recession which saw the world s gdp growth dip to minus 1 3 in 2009 if a real estate debt crisis of such magnitude were to happen in china the world economy would not be at peace from china let s cross the pacific ocean to the united states the trouble there is no less severe but it is not from an overheated real estate sector but inflation in october the us inflation rate was at 6 2 the highest since december 1990 the inflation rate in the united states has been rising quickly since the beginning of the year the average annual inflation rate for 2021 would be 4 8 here is the problem a 4 8 inflation rate is far higher than the policy interest rate fed funds rate of 0 25 and lending rate of 3 25 which puts the us economy in a negative interest rate position negative interest rates mean that savers will save less while borrowers will borrow more which would further propel inflation and discourage investment if the current inflation rate were not bad enough the expected inflation for 2022 is even worse an october survey by the federal reserve bank of new york showed that household expectations for inflation over the next 12 months climbed to 5 7 the highest rate since the survey began in 2013 a 5 7 inflation rate and 0 25 fed fund rate do not go well together however policymakers hope that the high inflation rate is temporary owing to global supply chain disruptions from the covid 19 pandemic and pent up demand from the opening up of economies the fed is likely to wait until its jan 25 26 meeting before it makes any move but it might give certain warnings after its december meeting especially if november s inflation rate remains unabated that said i hold the opposing view that the high inflation rate is temporary consumers have yet to see real inflation as producers and wholesalers are still absorbing the rising cost of goods in japan wholesale inflation rose by 8 in october but consumer inflation was less than 1 the situation is similar in china the producer price index rose by 13 5 while the consumer price index increased by just 1 5 in october in a few months we will see producers and wholesalers pass on the higher cost of goods to consumers that is when the vicious cycle of inflation will begin higher priced goods particularly food will trigger demand for higher wages higher wages will in turn raise the costs of production economists term this phenomenon the wage price spiral the only way to stop this spiral is to raise interest rates and push demand down the federal reserve and all central banks in the world the bank of thailand included will have no choice when it comes to dealing with inflation speaking of thailand its october consumer inflation rate is 2 38 which is substantially higher than the bank of thailand s policy interest rate of 0 5 while consumer inflation remains relatively low the producer price index rose by 6 9 in the same month you don t need a phd in economics to guess what future inflation will be like if the risk of a global recession triggered by the real estate debt crisis in china and the global rise of inflation and interest rates do become a reality the prospects that the thai economy will recover sometime next year would remain gloomy first those factors will hurt our exports and foreign tourist receipts which account for 71 of gdp second inflation will hurt the lower income group s purchasing power which could cause a political uprising third rising interest rates would create a higher interest burden for all borrowers government businesses and consumers and fourth the shaky world economy particularly china s could mean massive capital outflows to developing western economies don t panic too much though as this might not happen china being a non market economy might be able to manage its real estate debt and global inflation may really be just temporary those are my christmas wishes anyway
the collaboration involves abb one of the world s leading robotics manufacturers and zume a six year old california based startup that has been pioneering the production of molded pulp compostable packaging made from agricultural waste abb has announced an agreement to collaborate with zume by supplying robotic cells referred to as mfcs or molded fiber cells that will facilitate zume s production of sustainable packaging on a global scale abb robots will automate production enabling the scale and speed required to make zume s compostable packaging a cost effective alternative to single use plastic zume s packaging material which is astm d6868 certified as compostable is made from sustainably harvested plant material left over from agricultural production including bamboo wheat and straw foodservice applications like the bowls used by the cava chain of quick serve restuarants in the u s have led the way for the most part but trays for beef poultry or other protein products are sure to appear in supermarkets before too long plant material uses significantly less water and energy and reduces co₂ emissions when compared to the production and disposal of plastic packaging unlike plastic plant based material is 100 percent biodegradable and simply breaks down after use but making molded pulp packaging at scale has never been a slam dunk there s always been a trade off in molded pulp notes zume founder and ceo alex garden you can do high precision parts slowly or you can do low precision things quickly we are the first to attack that trade off by developing parallel thermoforming machines we arranged the forming machines in a bouquet so that they can operate in parallel this required connecting them with very advanced robotics and materials handling solutions that s where abb came in large industrial robots manipulate large platen sizes transferring from forming a wet process to pressing but we have multiple presses running in parallel and we have an organic sequence among those pieces of equipment so that there s never one machine component in the overall process waiting for another machine to complete its process this is why our effective drop times of molded parts are very short the bottom line is that with these turnkey installations complex parts can be made quickly for more on zume go here one of the challenges facing any robotics supplier attempting to tackle this kind of manufacturing operation is that large masses and inertia must be managed at the same time that some rather delicate picking and placing of finished parts must be done with great accuracy according to sami atiya president abb robotics discrete automation superior motion control technology is what makes the abb irb 6700 robots capable of meeting this challenge we will work with zume to make compostable packaging a cost effective alternative to single use plastic and foam by automating its production process with robotic manufacturing cells says atiya the flexibility repeatability and accuracy of robots can boost the sustainability of a business robotic automation has a clear role supporting the development of a smarter better world and a circular economy expanding on abb s role in the collaboration with zume is marc segura abb group senior vice president managing director consumer segments service robotics our role is to help zume scale its technology so that millions and millions of units can be efficiently produced it s all about standardization and modularity which are the essence of the mfc or molded fiber cell it s a combination of the molding technology of zume two enabling robots and advanced motion controls that govern the process steps between the machines one of the beauties of this approach is that we can copy and paste where the mfc is concerned to create an mfa or molded fiber array and we can deliver this globally so we leverage economies of scale and the global footprint of abb a pilot project has been installed by zume and abb at satia industries limited one of india s largest wood and agro based paper manufacturers satia has built a facility holding 50 mfcs that will process 100 tons of wheat straw daily creating 100 percent compostable packaging for a range of industries our work with zume and abb enables satia industries to meet and exceed the expectations of our clients for high performing affordable and reliable products that are sustainably manufactured and easily composted says dr ajay satia cmd satia industries besides adding significant value to the company we are able to support the planet by providing sustainable solutions to help our customers transition to more modern reliable and customized products compared to those they use today two other installations of zume s turnkey systems are underway one is in the aurangabad india facility of india s parason a leading global supplier of stock preparation systems i e the equipment that processes the raw materials that become the pulp used to make molded fiber packaging the other is in the u s at jefferson enterprise energy jefferson s lufkin tex plant described as the first 100 percent renewable energy powered compostable packaging factory in north america will be powered entirely by on site renewable energy with zero use of fossil fuels at the heart of the new green energy and manufacturing facility will be a 400 ton per day pulp mill that will produce high strength renewable pulp from agricultural waste materials interestingly enough both the jefferson facility in texas and the satia facility in india rely on stock preparation systems supplied by parason zume ceo garden believes the zume abb collaboration will make a big difference in growing the kind of sustainable packaging that can become the foundation of a more circular economy our collective efforts over the next five years could annually sequester as much as 2 million tons of agricultural waste and replace as many as 20 billion pieces of single use plastic each year says garden we ve been on a journey for years now to identify and perfect a model that is a realistic alternative to single use plastic a legitimate path forward at scale if we ve learned anything about getting to price and performance parity it s that it s not one thing it s hundreds of things and i m proud of how far we ve come though it s essential to point out that we never could have gotten this far without the global partnerships we ve formed with satia abb and parason each of us brought something to the table and i think that what we re talking about here today will in 10 years be the new standard go here to see video footage of the container making process now underway at the satia facility in india

experience our new service contracts which include longer terms oil changes and roadside assistance have been well received by the market these new products were designed to keep our customers on the road while centralizing administrative activities to increase efficiencies and productivity at the dealership level added mr williams we have many opportunities for positive interactions with our customers after the sale and the initiatives we have in place are directed at providing legendary service in this high touch business once again we believe that most of our dealerships can support 1 000 or more active customers at some point in the future we ended the quarter with an average of 613 active customers per dealership up 5 in the first six months of fiscal 2022 in recent years we have shifted to focusing on the total cost of ownership for our offering which is in most cases significantly lower than competitive offerings with our lower interest rates and shorter terms said mr williams additionally when considering the work we do and the relationships we form through various touchpoints after the sale we believe we have an obligation to keep customers in the car mart family for life the demand for our offering is high and we can deliver a level of service that we believe cannot be matched we believe our highest and best use of capital is to grow market share from the existing dealership base we will continue to open new dealerships as we move forward and we are very excited to be opening our norman oklahoma dealership in the next couple of weeks we opened our el reno oklahoma location during the second quarter and are very excited about extending our reach in the oklahoma market said mr williams we will also continue to look for acquisition opportunities and believe there are several excellent operators who would like to join our car mart family the cost of operating in our industry continues to increase at a very high rate and we believe we can provide an owner an attractive exit strategy in addition we believe our conservative balance sheet will allow us to increase our available financing for future growth through accessing the securitization market which will facilitate our ability to serve more customers we anticipate participating in that market at some point as we move forward as jeff mentioned revenues increased 29 for the quarter driven by higher sales volumes higher average retail prices and significantly higher interest income interest income increased over 10 million for the quarter as our average finance receivables increased to 929 million gross profit per retail unit sold increased to 6 349 compared to 5 705 from the same period in the prior year even with the significant investments we are making in the areas of associate recruiting training and retention inventory procurement management customer experience and information technology we saw significant leveraging of our cost structure with sg a costs at 14 8 of sales compared to 16 5 for the same prior year quarter said vickie judy cfo total collections were strong and improved 6 8 per average customer principal collections were in line with expectations and reflect an increase in the weighted average contract term of 40 months compared to 35 months for the prior year quarter net charge offs remained relatively stable compared to last year despite the increase in the average retail sales price as our customers continue to perform well and our service levels and the investments we have made to keep customers on the road provide a higher level of service and are most certainly showing up in the numbers our balance sheet is extremely healthy with debt net of cash to receivables of 33 at the end of the quarter our cash flows and the significant availability of debt financing to the automobile finance market will allow us to continue to grow at a rate that we can support our customers at a very high level said vickie judy

elected officials are pushing to ban fossil fuel hookups in new buildings by the end of the year which real estate and construction professionals argue is too hasty the bill would prohibit the use of gas and oil in new construction as well as in major renovation projects within just two years of its passage the de blasio administration supports the measure though not necessarily its timeline at a city council committee on environmental protection hearing ben furnas director of the mayor s office of climate and sustainability said the administration is seeking an aggressive but achievable implementation of the ban the mayor has previously called for a prohibition on gas hookups by 2030 furnas said the administration supports passing a version of the measure before de blasio s term ends dec 31 the real estate board of new york supports the gradual electrification of the city s building stock but argues that the proposed rollout would prove too costly and would rely on dirty electricity the state has mandated that at least 70 percent of new york s electricity come from renewable sources by 2030 and 100 percent by 2040 but there is no guarantee that those goals are met according to the u s energy information administration only 28 percent of new york s electricity was derived from renewables last year rebny supports phasing in the ban to coincide with the completion of offshore wind and other large scale renewable transmission projects the group suggests first applying it to construction of fewer than three stories and single family homes in 2025 then to new buildings with fewer than 10 stories in 2027 followed by all taller projects by 2030 this would help to avoid buildings utilizing inefficient electric systems that would quickly overburden the electric grid the group wrote in prepared testimony rebny also said electric heat pumps have not been adequately tested in large scale buildings and that giving the industry more time would pave the way for ensuring this and other technology can be used widely the new york building and construction trades council also testified against the measure citing similar concerns that lots of new electric heat buildings would overwhelm the city s power grid and the partnership for new york city noted many large new developments that will seek building permits in two years are already far along in design planning and land use approvals some environmentalists however want the measure accelerated not delayed sign up for the undefined newsletter sign up peter sikora who leads new york communities for change s climate and inequality campaign called for shortening the implementation to one year and for defining major renovations as all type one alterations or those that require a new or amended certificate of occupancy new york city faces an existential threat and there is no time to delay he said at wednesday s hearing referring to climate change at one point he held up a sheet of paper with bullshit scrawled on it as a critic of the bill spoke the measure s sponsor brooklyn council member alicka ampry samuel emphasized the need to cut down on dangerous pollutants noting that related health issues are disproportionately high in communities that are often left out of climate change initiatives a study published in science advances found that people of color are disproportionately exposed to harmful air pollution with residential gas combustion and commercial cooking being among the largest sources assembly member emily gallagher who represents northern brooklyn said she planned to push for a statewide version of the measure once the city approved the bill nearly 40 percent of the city s greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to heating air and water in buildings according to rmi a clean energy nonprofit two years ago berkeley california became the first city in the country to ban natural gas hookups in most new construction other cities have followed suit but other states including arizona and texas have barred municipalities from enacting similar bans new york city s bill aligns with other deadlines dreaded by the real estate industry under local law 97 buildings larger than 25 000 square feet must meet new greenhouse gas emission caps starting in 2024 and even stricter limits by 2030 urban green council s chris halfnight also suggested a phased in approach to the gas ban he and others raised concerns that the measure could encourage the use of blended fuels such as a mixture of natural gas and hydrogen to meet the bill s requirements in targeted buildings the measure would forbid the combustion of any substance that emits 50 kilograms or more of carbon dioxide per million british thermal units of energy according to the u s energy information administration natural gas clocks in at more than 53 kilograms and heating oil at more than 70 a blended fuel could be used to get under the threshold without switching to electric heat some developers have voiced support for the bill alloy development has held up its under construction 440 unit building at 100 flatbush as proof that an all electric tower is possible installing a natural gas system in a new building today is a bit like installing a landline telephone a decade ago the technology is approaching the end of its useful life aj pires the president of alloy development said in prepared testimony the future will not and cannot rely on burning natural gas to heat our homes and cook our food

as you re probably aware it s been a good year for the stock market all major stock indexes have been hovering near record highs the s p 500 could quite easily notch six dozen record closes by the end of 2021 that s impressive no doubt still it s not unprecedented historically if you look back at the first ten months of the last seven presidential administrations four of these periods had lower stock market returns as measured by the dow jones industrial average than we ve seen under biden but two had higher returns in fact if one looks back at stock market growth over time it becomes apparent that new record highs are really not that uncommon according to an analysis of data from january 3 1950 to april 22 2015 the s p 500 or what became the s p 500 after a few years there set a new record high on 6 96 of days that s about 25 days per year on average a year like this one where we are set to reach about three times the average for record s p 500 highs is a good year for stocks it s not a huge outlier though fairly frequently slow years for the stock market are followed by significantly better ones or there are several excellent stock market years in a row or there is a year of negative returns followed by a surge year we re not in completely uncharted waters here you sure wouldn t know that though from all the hysterical articles being blasted across the internet lately with warnings from supposedly messianic investors that we re totally screwed legendary investor jeremy grantham who i d never heard of before as someone who writes regularly about these sorts of things told bloomberg last friday when the decline comes it will perhaps be bigger and better than anything previously in u s history really good thing there are zero consequences for making these kinds of apocalyptic predictions in interviews when you turn out to be wrong in a few months everyone just continues to not remember that you are a person there s a whole series of bubbles going on right now richard bernstein an institutional investor hall of famer whatever that is said last month he was at least more circumspect and limited his perception of a market bubble to limited sectors like tech innovation cryptos and that type of thing even actually famous from being portrayed by christian bale in the big short investor michael burry has hopped on the bubble bandwagon saying that the entire asset class of crypto represents the biggest bubble of his career burry has also continued to repeatedly pummel the extremely high valuation of tesla stock which is probably a fair criticism and that s coming from a tesla stockholder who thinks the vehicles are cool it s hard to say what s going to happen with crypto because that s a truly new asset class and no one has all that much experience with it and to be fair some of these analysts have decent points about certain segments of the market if you actually get into the nuances of what they re saying when it comes to the broader stock market though i think it s just easier to get likes and retweets with an article that says someone important thinks doom is upon us so start bottling your urine now because it is going to be the only commodity with any value after the epic impending stock market crash on the other hand articles like this one that say something more like eh the stock market is doing well it ll probably go down a bit here while we work through supply chain and inflation issues but then it will keep generally going up again like normal are not going to do as well when plugged into the fear and sensation based social media algorithms are we in a stock market bubble maybe or maybe we re just in an economy where businesses are doing well because americans sitting on a large pile of cash they ve accumulated over the course of the pandemic are now doing their darndest to spend it my money s on the latter jonathan wolf is a civil litigator and author of your debt free jd affiliate link he has taught legal writing written for a wide variety of publications and made it both his business and his pleasure to be financially and scientifically literate any views he expresses are probably pure gold but are nonetheless solely his own and should not be attributed to any organization with which he is affiliated he wouldn t want to share the credit anyway he can be reached at jon_wolf hotmail com
the legislation would also remove ohio s duty under current law to promptly notify police during a traffic stop if they re carrying a weapon example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video columbus ohio the ohio house passed legislation wednesday allowing ohioans aged 21 and up to carry concealed weapons without undergoing any background check or firearms training under current law ohioans must complete eight hours of training and pass a background check via their local sheriff for a five year concealed carry license the legislation would remove the requirement to seek licensure shortly before approving the bill along party lines republicans swatted down a number of proposals from democrats including one that would have required the attorney general to create a one page brochure detailing ohio s laws regarding the possession and use of weapons there s only one thing you need to read for this bill the second amendment to the u s constitution said rep thomas brinkman r mt lookout one of two lead sponsors the legislation would also remove ohio s duty under current law to promptly notify police during a traffic stop if they re carrying a weapon house bill 227 only requires them to notify officers if they re asked passing permitless carry as the legislation is commonly referred to would forward a steady march of loosening ohio s gun laws ohio s concealed carry program launched in 2004 and required 12 hours of training at the time in 2006 lawmakers passed a bill blocking cities from passing gun control laws stricter than those of the state at large republicans passed a stand your ground bill last year that removes the legal duty to first seek retreat from a confrontation before responding with deadly force in 2021 to date 706 ohioans have died and 1 561 have been injured by firearms according to data from the gun violence archive which compiles data from media law enforcement and government sources we seem to care more about guns than the people who die of gun violence each and every year in this state said rep bride rose sweeney d cleveland over each of the last six years about 3 900 concealed carry permits on average were either suspended revoked or denied according to data from the ohio attorney general republicans emphasized the legislation doesn t change the underlying factors criminal histories or mental incompetence that warrant a disability from possessing a firearm in ohio if you have a disability you still cannot be in possession of a firearm said rep haraz ghanbari r perrysburg however the legislation would remove a point of capture for some of these people who are not allowed to carry a concealed weapon but have sought permission to do so house democrats who control 35 of 99 seats in the chamber tried and failed to amend several other anti gun violence measures into the bill these included closing loopholes that allow gun sales without background checks or allowing families or law enforcement to petition judges to allow the temporary seizure of weapons from people experiencing mental health crises as the bill went through the house anti gun violence activists highlighted studies linking permitless carry laws to increases in violent crime a 2018 working paper for the national bureau of economic research found states with permitless carry laws experience roughly 15 higher rates of violent crime 10 years after adoption than they otherwise would have other research published in the american journal for public health found that permitless carry laws were associated with 11 increases in handgun homicide rates when asked house speaker bob cupp r lima downplayed any link between a permitless carry policy and gun violence noting that other states have adopted the policy i don t know that that has happened in any state that has it he said we re not doing anything novel here we re just kind of catching up twenty one states allow inhabitants residents only in north dakota to carry a concealed weapon without a permit according to a count from the u s concealed carry association this includes neighboring states of west virginia and kentucky
mayor elect eric adams boosted his bitcoin dream for new york city on wednesday saying that he wants to create a cryptocurrency committee to study the controversial currency we re going to turn new york city into a laboratory adams told a gathering of business leaders in brooklyn heights we re going to open and say to the entire tech industry look at everything we do in this city in positioning himself as a central cheerleader for crypto adams has earned praise from tech innovators but also opened himself up to criticism from environmental activists and leading economists bitcoin the world s first cryptocurrency has been linked to illicit activities and condemned as part of a monetary wild west that creates headaches for governments and regulators the creation of bitcoin requires huge amounts of electricity alarming environmentalists and some economists believe bitcoin s surging value will ultimately crash still adams a democrat and professed computer geek has promised to turn new york into a crypto capital part of his broader pitch to make the city s financial sector hum he said he wants to introduce a cyber wallet for municipal workers and to infuse cryptocurrencies into city education mayor elect eric adams joins the founders forum in brooklyn on wednesday nov 17 2021 in a moment of one upmanship with miami mayor francis suarez adams said two weeks ago on twitter that he would receive his first three checks in bitcoin suarez had expressed his intention to take his next paycheck in bitcoin new york city s municipal payroll options appear to preclude such a payment to adams immediately after he takes office jan 1 but his bitcoin bit seemed symbolic less about the details of changing the city s payment options and more about showing that new york is welcoming to digital finance suarez has enhanced miami s profile and his own with his city s pivot toward crypto earlier this year the city hosted the world s largest bitcoin conference and the rollout of a cryptocurrency called miamicoin has generated more than 17 million for the city according to suarez s office adams continued to blast his bitcoin message on wednesday morning at the conference founders forum saying that his twitter post prompted young people in public housing to look into crypto and helped make the topic more accessible that one conversation with 13 million impressions on social media also reached the young people in our inner cities adams said they will never again be afraid of the concept of bitcoin the speech drew a warm response from the crowd which appeared to have a pro bitcoin tilt but progressives may shudder at the rush to bitcoin given its ramifications eswar prasad a professor of trade policy at cornell university said that so called bitcoin mining the creation of the coins with specialized software in the state would be environmentally quite destructive for new york and would confer little in the way of any tangible economic benefits still prasad argued that new york can be a leader in blockchain technology which is used to record bitcoin trades while rejecting bitcoin itself he added that adams may be spreading misinformation about cryptocurrencies relying on bitcoin as a proxy for this technological revolution that is underway in finance is the key mistake that he s making prasad said blockchain technology is cool bitcoin is not evan thies a spokesman for adams said in a statement that the mayor elect wants to see investment and innovation around the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries increase responsibly and equitably in new york while also addressing environmental concerns national leaders have fretted about aspects of the cryptocurrency boom too sen elizabeth warren d mass a progressive said in a letter to treasury secretary janet yellen this summer that an unregulated cryptocurrency market presents growing threats to the american financial system and yellen herself called bitcoin extremely inefficient earlier this year and linked it to illegal finance across the board cryptocurrencies pose regulatory challenges it is not clear whether they should be formally defined as currencies commodities or securities and they can be traded anonymously the securities exchange commission has moved recently to increase regulation bitcoin the most prominent of the cryptocurrencies has had its price swing wildly at times and has been tagged by some as a bubble overall its value has more than tripled over the last year mayor elect eric adams joins the founders forum in brooklyn on wednesday nov 17 2021 after delivering his speech on wednesday adams embraced the regulatory challenges posed by crypto there s nothing better than a major problem that s difficult to solve adams told reporters that s the joy of this that s what a puzzle is let s solve it and he emphasized that his message is not simply about bitcoin but about a broader acceptance of tech innovation he credits compstat a digital statistical log introduced by the nypd in the 1990s with driving crime down in the city joanna coles a business executive and former top editor of cosmopolitan magazine noted adams support for

the tide on global interest rates looks to be turning it is not just the bank of england which is feeling the heat as consumer prices surge to an 11 year high of 4 2 per cent but the federal reserve and the european central bank the combination of pandemic induced fiscal laxity monetary accommodation and bubbles on the markets is radically reshaping the economic landscape in the uk it is hard to see the bank of england resisting pressure for an interest rate rise as soon as december rates rise it is not just the bank of england which is feeling the heat as consumer prices surge to an eleven year high of 4 2 but the federal reserve and the european central bank too what is more surprising is the mood change in the us until now the view at the fed and on wall street is that normalising interest rates from super low levels will wait until the central bank completes its programme of bond buying next year what has changed is the runaway recovery of the g7 s most resilient economy and the outsized inflation it brings with it the us is heading for the fastest growth in a generation retailers sales are booming wages to the lowest paid workers are soaring hiring of new employees is surging and many household bank balances are flush there is impatience about the fed s unwillingness to withdraw the punchbowl morgan stanley boss james gorman who sits on the new york fed board thinks it is time to end the delays and move directly to raise the key federal funds rate which guides all other us borrowing costs from the current near zero level the theory among new york bankers is that the only reason the republican fed chairman jay powell is holding back from raising rates is that he wants to convince president joe biden that he is on side and be reappointed to a second term when the decision is taken within the next few days the irony is that the growth take off is hurting rather than helping the president because the public doesn t like the runaway prices the current dissonance with the fed could make it easier for the president to nominate democrat economist lael brainard the only other candidate interviewed there is also blowback against christine lagarde s money printing and super low interest rate regime at the european central bank ecb german ecb board member isabel schnabel warns that with inflation in the eurozone running at 4 1 per cent the bank must be ready to rein in the cost of living transitory inflation has been ejected from the central bank lexicon taming the prices tiger is again seen as necessary the impact of that on the over exuberant financial markets could be the next serious narrative boarders repelled for too long company boards have been in the thrall of activists who are often armed with nothing more than shares rented from big battalion institutions and complex derivatives many corporate boards are too complacent and agents of change are necessary it would be far better if the activism came from the real owners of the enterprises rather than get rich quick financiers the power company sse may not be that popular in this time of soaring energy costs but it has shown serial nuisance paul singer the red card in the wake of cop26 the decision to invest 12 5billion in renewable capacity by 2026 has to be applauded it is setting an example for the other big energy utilities what is disappointing is that vision gets few rewards and short termism drove the sse share price down by 4 3 per cent in latest trading sse is not the only ftse 100 company keeping the activists at bay chief executive emma walmsley is doing an admirable job of doing it her way at glaxosmithkline with new treatments including a breakthrough in hiv emerging from the pipeline fast and furious valuations now being placed on its consumer health care enterprise when it is split out are much higher than originally envisaged jes staley s stewardship at barclays ended in tawdry fashion and a row over his pay but his relentless pursuit of the investment banking dollar saw off the challenge of new york based activist ed bramson could be a trend digital divide if there was doubt as to where the real power now lies in global commerce the issue has been clarified by amazon s decision to sack the us card giant visa sending its shares skidding the biggest threat to traditional finance are the silicon valley giants they are starting to flex their muscles

accounting principles further the company s definitions of adjusted income information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies management believes that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations while it is not possible to predict future results management believes the adjusted financial information is useful for the assessment of the ongoing operations of the company because the adjusted items are not indicative of the company s ongoing operations due to their size and nature additionally management uses adjusted financial information as key performance measures of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally the adjusted financial information from continuing operations should be read in conjunction with the company s historical financial statements and notes thereto contained in the company s quarterly

plans to file comprehensive form 10 k a that includes restated results for 2020 and 2019 2020 restated net income expected to be in line with previously disclosed estimates 2020 net income lower than previously reported on form 10 k by 2 3 million 2019 net income expected to be lower than previously reported on form 10 k by 2 3 million no expected impact on reported revenue and cash flows for 2020 or 2019 edgewood n y nov 17 2021 globe newswire cpi aerostructures inc cpi aero or company nyse american cvu today provided an update on the restatement of its financial results on june 7 2021 the company announced it needed to restate its full year and quarterly 2020 financial statements due to errors in such financial statements relating to the recording and reporting of inventory costing and related internal controls the inventory costing errors at the time of the june 2021 disclosure the company estimated and disclosed that the inventory costing errors were expected to lower 2020 net income reported in the annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2020 by 1 9 million to 2 3 million the company now estimates that the inventory costing errors are expected to reduce 2020 net income by approximately 2 0 million the correction of the inventory costing errors resulted in the determination that certain contracts were in a loss position and certain inventory items required additional reserves the company reevaluated the sufficiency of its provisions for loss contracts and inventory reserves that it had previously recorded and concluded that increases to these reserves were required the insufficient reserves resulting from such reserve increases are referred to as insufficient reserves it was further determined by management that the appropriate starting point for increasing the insufficient reserves was at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 therefore the company has determined that its 2019 financial results as previously reported in its annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2019 will also be restated considering both the inventory costing errors and the insufficient reserves the company currently estimates that the net income for the years ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 will be approximately 2 3 million and 2 3 million respectively less than the net income reported in the annual report on form 10 k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 and the company s annual report on form 10 k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 the inventory costing errors and the insufficient reserves affect the income reported with respect to the company s product lines for which revenue is recognized when a product ships to customers which accounted for approximately 15 of total 2020 revenue the non poc contracts the inventory costing errors and insufficient reserves did not affect income reported with respect to the company s products for which revenue is recognized over time using percentage of completion accounting the poc contracts the inventory costing errors and the insufficient reserves did not affect either prior reported revenue or cash flow for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 at this time the company has not fully completed its review and the expected financial impact of the inventory costing errors and the insufficient reserves described above is preliminary and subject to change the company expects to restate its annual financial statements as of and for the years ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 and correct its unaudited restated quarterly financial statements as of and for the quarters ended march 31 2020 june 30 2020 and september 30 2020 by amending its annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2020 by filing a comprehensive annual report on

models present creations for giorgio armani s men s spring summer 2022 fashion collection on june 21 2021 during the milan fashion week photo by miguel medina afp photo by miguel medina afp via getty images afp via getty images the pace of the luxury industry is rapidly accelerating due to a tremendous increase in consumer demand that has been ever changing even though the general consumer market seems to be more complex than ever before it pales in comparison when compared to the complexity of luxury goods market the reason being is two fold firstly when it comes to personal tastes the luxury market segmentation can be hard to please furthermore when it comes to staying on top of the latest trends with respect to pop culture and technology the luxury market is willing to listen and learn in the recent past luxury brands have embraced virtual experiences infusing technology into their product design and even collaborations with tech brands for more crossover appeal just last week i met with the usda and the american cotton farmers to discuss the future of maintaining the comparative advantage of one of the finest cottons on the global market today supima cotton i was shocking surprised to learn how the american luxury cotton brand had adopted the use of virtual reality as an integral part of their marketing strategy there s no denying it technology and luxury fashion have united and will continue to move forward together new york ny september 10 a model walks the runway at the supima design competition fashion show during spring 2016 new york fashion week the shows at the gallery skylight at clarkson sq on september 10 2015 in new york city photo by neilson barnard getty images for supima cotton getty take aura for example it is a consortium blockchain pioneered by the lvmh group to track and trace luxury goods from raw materials to the point of sale in order to assure consumers of product history and proof of authenticity now the question remains whether or not forthright luxury brands will move forward with crypto currency and rightly so in the last decade alone cryptocurrency has become one of the most disruptive technologies on the planet securing global acceptance in abundant numbers in fact these days companies such as time warner and wework are accepting bitcoin as a trusted payment standard but the question is will luxury brands be next to lean in to a crypto future let s face it when it comes to the luxury sector isolated living due to the covid 19 pandemic has been nothing short of intriguing for the luxury business during the pandemic a growing number of people turned to fintech solutions as well as cryptocurrency to hedge their bets amidst plummeting stocks more to my point the end of the 2020 brought about a bitcoin rally that was nothing short of historical truth be told that rally ignited the flame for a tremendous increase in cryptocurrency overall but the pivotal moment was when the data proved that the luxury market were a big part of the push in crypto in short it is necessary to understand that younger millennials and gen z feel most positive towards the use of cryptocurrency having discussed this topic with the fashion luxury department chair and data specialist professors at ny s fashion institute of technology we unanimously agreed that for business to survive and prosper the challenges of the modern business world they will be required to understand the new way of doing business such as making developing a cryptocurrency strategy to fit your respective needs paris france october 05 editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house a model walks the runway during the chanel womenswear spring summer 2022 show as part of paris fashion week on october 05 2021 in paris france photo by pascal le segretain getty images getty images clearly a few of them have already gotten the message with several luxury brands announcing pro crypto moves in the last few years in 2018 luxury watchmaker hublot announced a new watch under its big bang line that was all about bitcoin the watch called the meca 10 p2p was created the mark the 10 year anniversary of bitcoin and could only be paid for with bitcoin to be transferred using a code engraved at the edge of the watch which cost approximately 25 000 in 2021 swiss watchmaker hublot announced plans to begin accepting cryptocurrency as payment joining the leagues of fellow watchmakers such as frank muller and norquin who both made similar announcements in 2021 and 2020 respectively and when it comes to luxury crypto interest had not been limited to watchmakers for instance take tjb super yachts announced that they would begin accepting cryptocurrency for the leasing and buying of their superyachts as per the official announcement the major tokens including bitcoin and litecoin on a separate note when it comes to art sotheby s auction house sold a painting by iconic artist banksy titled love is in the air in may 2021 for 12 9 million marking the first time that a physical piece of art was sold by a major auction house for cryptocurrency given the fact that other major auction houses like christie s have auction nfts which are based on the same technology as cryptocurrency this is likely to continue performer chris brown created an nft with athletic sportswear brand nike that generated millions in nft sales cryptocurrencies influence within the luxury sector is not limited only to physical items but seems to be cutting across experiences as well luxury travel agent travala com for example allows its clients to pay for flights hotel stays and travel experiences using a wide selection of cryptocurrencies including its own native ava token by using blockchain fashion brands can digitize track and trace the entire lifecycle of an item with blockchain brands can create an immutable record of all steps in the supply chain capture specific data points such as sustainability certifications and claims and provide open access to this data publicly take scallop a decentralized bank that allows users to open gbp iban accounts within minutes and make use of cryptocurrency for everyday purchases whether with a personal or business account scallop users can spend both fiat currency and cryptocurrency simultaneously through the combination of a bank account a crypto wallet and a virtual debit card to spend cryptocurrency for luxury purchases scallop users do not have to manually withdraw funds or transfer to the retailers but simply select the currency they wish to spend and make a payment as they would a traditional debit card then there is cirus which allows people to earn cryptocurrency with more ease cirus believes that in the future more people worldwide will begin earning cryptocurrency through simple means like monetizing their web data cirus essentially acts as a web monetization tool through its router which opens the gateway to mass adoption and increases demand for crypto newbies to purchase tangible assets like luxury clothing by creating an avenue for more income generation more spending in the luxury sector can be stimulated cryptocurrency is also not the only way that blockchain technology is finding its way into the luxury sector as non fungible tokens nfts are also making a splash when it comes to fashion brands blockchain technology can significantly reduce operating costs in retail fashion by providing better data management tools enhancing supply chain management and reducing the risk of counterfeit markets advancements in data management prompt cost savings and improve trust in outsourcing from everything from overseas suppliers to shipping in short blockchain provides an easy way to integrate data reconciliation across service lines and operations luxury brands are starting to bridge physical and digital worlds through posh art expos that feature nfts and other collectibles dubai recently hosted nft bazl which put on display 4 million worth of diamonds presented by icecap in addition to artwork by a cohort of award winning artists and floyd mayweather s memorabilia attendees and auction bidders had an option to purchase these items using cryptocurrency the first nft bazl was launched earlier this year by a digital investment platform elitium and a canadian digital assets firm gda capital the event attracted some crypto billionaires as well as local art aficionados curious about the new tech while the logistics of accepting cryptocurrency as a means of payment especially given how volatile some of them can be is tricky services have also sprung up to help luxury brands manage their backend one of the biggest barriers for those who want to buy luxury brands is the high price of many of the items sold while there is the option of instalment payments and credit cards these are nowhere are convenient as commodity staking a new purchase option offered by mineplex a crossfi platform and marketplace commodity staking only requires the user to pay a part of the cost of an item in the form of crypto and that amount is staked to earn interest once the interest is accrued it is paid to the merchant and the consumer can receive the item it offers a new more affordable way to buy luxury items and a way that doesn t affect users credit scores this feature allows for saving up to 40 costs paid for credit cards and loan services considering how popular luxury items are among young people with limited earning power this will probably prove popular the luxury sector like many other sectors will take time before cryptocurrency and blockchain technology as a whole is embedded into it the process of accepting cryptocurrency and infusing blockchain into the industry has already started and from all indications will not stop anytime soon

the un nuclear watchdog yesterday reported that iran has again boosted its stock of highly enriched uranium just days before talks are set to resume seeking to revive the 2015 nuclear deal in a report seen by afp the international atomic energy agency iaea estimated iran s stockpile of highly enriched uranium at 2 489 7 kilograms many times in excess of the limit laid down in the 2015 agreement the total amount now includes 113 8kg enriched to 20 percent up from 84 3kg in september and 17 7kg enriched up to 60 percent up from 10kg the report said the document will be discussed during the iaea s board of governors scheduled for next week with diplomats preparing to restart talks in vienna on november 29 over reviving the moribund 2015 nuclear deal between iran and world powers the remaining parties to the deal britain china france germany and russia will join the talks while the united states will participate indirectly iran s acting head of mission to un agencies in vienna mohamed reza ghaebi said the new report shows that the iaea has continued its verification and surveillance activities regarding tehran s engagements quoted by iranian media he said that talks were ongoing to solve some issues between the two parties and called on iaea member states to refrain from making hasty or politically motivated comments a spokesman for iran s atomic agency told fars news agency yesterday that iaea chief rafael grossi would arrive in tehran on monday grossi will meet foreign minister hossein amir abdollahian and iranian atomic energy organisation chief mohamed eslami on tuesday the spokesman added on november 12 grossi described as astonishing his lack of contact with the new iranian government of president ebrahim raisi he said he had hoped to meet iranian officials ahead of the next meeting of the iaea s board of governors scheduled for next week during grossi s last visit to tehran in september he clinched a deal on access to monitoring equipment at iran s nuclear facilities
the covid 19 pandemic continues with more than 5 1 million deaths worldwide and over 29 000 in canada tens of thousands of workers have contracted the deadly virus at work and filed workers compensation claims including a number of worker deaths across canada covid 19 is both an occupational health and safety and public health crisis early responses of governments included lockdown regulations physical distancing and masking mandates as well as physical changes to workplaces as various covid 19 vaccines were rapidly developed and given emergency approval by the leading drug evaluator the fda in the united states health canada also reviewed and approved several vaccines for use in canada the highly effective low risk vaccines became the clear obvious and compelling way through and out of the pandemic starting before the recent federal election prime minister justin trudeau showed leadership in establishing mandatory proof of vaccine mandates for federally civil servants and federally regulated workers similar actions however were not taken by the provinces advertisement this caused many provincially regulated employers to take strong leadership positions on the value of vaccinations of their employees to keep them safe at work hence the wave of business leadership introducing mandatory proof of vaccination policies for workplaces with congregate work settings unions react to mandates union leadership generally deferred or failed to fully support employer vaccine mandates therefore in unionized workplaces anti vaxxers and irrational objections to the covid 19 vaccine found shelter in their unions refusal to support managements unilateral vaccine mandates in the form of court actions and grievance we are now seeing the first decisions of arbitrators covid 19 vaccination policies become widespread in various sectors and a pair of arbitral decisions provide guidance to employers as they navigate these untested legal waters these decisions underscore the challenges to the best practice of mandatory proof of vaccination policies the lack of understanding of the importance of ohs legislation in dealing with the pandemic and the arguments that employers must prepare to deal with when mandatory vaccination policies are challenged guiding legal decisions the first decision in canada was the application for an injunction to temporarily suspend the termination of certain university health network uhn employees who refused to comply with the mandatory covid 19 mandatory policy for health care workers on oct 19 the ontario superior court of justice dissolved an interim injunction it had issued on oct 17 justice sean dunphy held that claims made with respect to the alleged overreach or unreasonableness of the exercise by an employer of the management rights clause in a existing collective agreement are not the proper subject of a claim in the supervisor court of justice and therefore are not subject to the interim relief of an interim or permanent injunction the second decision was paragon protection ltd where arbitrator frederick von veh considered the united food and commercial workers union canada local 333 s ufcw grievance regarding its mandatory vaccination policy on sept 3 paragon introduced its policy which required that all employees be vaccinated by oct 31 2021 failure to do so would result in an employee s removal from a jobsite following which they would either be transferred to another jobsite or placed on an unpaid leave of absence paragon s policy was implemented in part due to the requirements of its clients paragon employs 4 400 security guards who are members of the ufcw bargaining unit and who are distributed to approximately 450 client worksites across ontario paragon submitted that its policy was fully compliant with the collective agreement which expressly required employees to agree to vaccination where third party clients required same paragon also argued that the policy was reasonable in light of the client facing nature of the work its security guard employees perform paragon also argued the policy was necessary in order for it to meet its obligations under the ontario occupational health and safety act ohsa to ensure a safe workplace the arbitrator held that personal preference of an employee to refuse vaccination did not override the scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of the covid 19 vaccinations the arbitrator was careful to underscore that this did not in any way detract from legitimate requests for accommodation pursuant to the human rights code which were appropriately accounted for by the policy the arbitrator also cited paragon s legal obligation under section 25 2 h of the ohsa which obligated the company to take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of its worker overall the arbitrator ordered only minor revisions to the policy as not all employees had access to a family physician the policy had to be amended to allow for other medical professionals to provide support for an employee s request for an exemption contrary outcome in a surprising contrary outcome arbitrator john stout heard the power workers union s pwu grievance alleging that the electrical safety authority s esa mandatory vaccination policy was unreasonable the pwu also alleged that the policy violated the employees privacy rights and right to bodily integrity prior to oct 5 the esa s policy allowed for employees to either disclose their vaccination status or to submit to regular covid 19 testing on oct 5 the esa amended its policy to require mandatory vaccination testing would not be a possible alternative unless an employee had been granted accommodation pursuant to the code the arbitrator accepted that the esa had onerous safety obligations under the ohsa however he also found that safety obligations under the ohsa had to be considered in light of the specific workplace at issue the arbitrator failed to consider the legal obligations of workers under section 28 of the ohsa to ensure that they did not work in a manner that may endanger themselves or another worker to justify mandatory vaccination under threat of discipline or discharge the arbitrator found that an employer must demonstrate real risk or business need in view of the transmissibility and lethality of the covid 19 virus the efficacy of the health canada approved vaccines and the seriousness of the employer s legal risk under the ohsa the arbitrator s decision to set aside the mandatory proof of vaccine policy is remarkable and rather difficult to rationally justify the failure of provincial governments to clearly mandate vaccines as condition of employment under the ohsa with appropriate human rights laws exemptions and privacy protection has created confusion and gives rise to the potential of conflicting arbitration decisions as indicated above arbitrators generally have little experience in reviewing and applying canadian ohs laws and medical science relating to pandemics they have no jurisdiction or experience with the vast number of quasi criminal prosecutions against employers including covid 19 related prosecutions in the courts interestingly the fact that the ontario ohsa prevails over all other statutes as an example was not referenced in either of the above mentioned arbitrations when developing a mandatory proof of vaccine policy or dealing with legal objections to such policies expert ohs legal counsel is required to ensure that all relevant legal and evidentiary considerations are well presented and argued before arbitrators and courts norm keith is a partner with kpmg in canada he was assisted with this commentary by derek klatt an associate with kpmg

in the restaurant mall near mariposa addicted to the business locals who stop in at sea level in redondo have been surprised when they recognized the person who is now running the place michael franks famous for his tenure as co owner at chez melange the sea level job was curious because franks has been vocal about his involvement with south bay food company a catering business that opened last year he s still involved with both and since sea level doesn t do outside catering there s no conflict asked why he did this rather than remain comfortably retired franks said that after a year of enforced relaxation due to covid he felt energized and missed the personal contact don t you wish you loved your job as much as he loves his coming attractions in a recent article we covered the

1960s i first encountered a robot restaurant server yesterday at the california pizza kitchen in the manhattan mall it looks a lot like a small shelving unit on wheels because that s basically what it is radar enables it to move around obstacles and i know about that because i was one i stood in the middle of an aisle and it maneuvered neatly around me rather than running over my foot the company has deployed two of them and the manager was at pains to say that the robots have not displaced any servers she noted that like everybody else the company is having difficulty filling job vacancies the robots only deliver food leaving the servers more time for the more personal job of taking orders the machines have a limited vocabulary of recorded messages like your food has arrived and the people i watched receiving plates seemed amused by the novelty i talked with a pair of human servers and apparently the robots don t have nicknames having too little personality to inspire them despite the cute cat faces on their main screen i asked one robot for a wine recommendation and it said that the power from the outlet in the corner was particularly delicious odds and ends goodboybob

trading is an activity often portrayed as the way to riches by today s online gurus who seek to exploit the public s relatively limited knowledge about this practice however like any other business activity trading financial assets involves adopting a systematic process that starts with learning the basic rules of the tradecraft to then follow a disciplined approach to execute transactions in a cold and heartless way most of those who participate in a day trading community and who have been successful at this endeavor agree that this systematic approach increases the odds of success and in this article we outline some of the steps that traders typically take when assessing potential transactions 1 analyzing the macro environment most early mornings for traders start by taking a look at what is going on at the macro level in the markets this includes analyzing the situation in major global stock indexes or for the most relevant assets within a certain group the macro environment may also involve changes to macroeconomic factors in key latitudes like the united states such as employment interest rates inflation and other similar matters the idea behind this practice is to follow the time tested adage of trading with the trend which emphasizes the importance of not placing trades that go against the direction of the overall market 2 performing technical analysis on the instrument technical analysis is a discipline that involves assessing the price action in a certain financial asset to determine the direction that the price may take in the future technical analysis also tends to evaluate how trading volumes have behaved and the most advanced techniques incorporate information from the market s structure such as bid ask spreads and buy and sell order volumes this analysis is crucial to establish a thesis on what the price of the asset may do in the future it is important to note that ta does not aim to predict what will happen instead it analyzes the most likely scenario based on past data 3 checking the presence of potential catalysts catalysts are events that have the power to start reverse or maintain a price trend these catalysts can come in the form of news changes in the macro environment material changes in the situation of the underlying asset and other similar developments the name comes from the fact that they can be considered a starting point to further validate or invalidate a particular thesis depending on the nature and expected impact of the event 4 defining entry and exit targets once a trader has identified an opportunity the system will demand an entry and exit target the entry target is usually a price at which a buy or sell signal is triggered and that provides a high enough reward to risk ratio meanwhile the exit target is the price at which the trader will feel that the transaction has met his most optimistic scenario for the instrument some traders use trailing stop loss orders to avoid taking profits too early if the price keeps rallying above the exit price in most systems trades are accepted and positions are opened only if they comply with the minimum reward required for the level of risk assumed that is the maximum loss that the trader is willing to take 5 adopting appropriate risk management strategies risk management strategies are even more important than the potential profits that the trader can realize through the operations he is engaged in the reason for this is that inappropriate risk management may lead to rapid and severe losses some of the most relevant risk management techniques include setting stop loss orders for all open positions limit the size of each position to 5 or less of the total portfolio avoid opening highly correlated trades for example buying oil stocks along with oil futures 6 analyzing results the process of dissecting past trades is crucial for traders to understand what has gone wrong or what has worked to keep fine tuning the system to increase its win rate and profits down the line this process starts from top to bottom if one follows the steps outlined before a thorough assessment can be conducted every day to check what happened this test involves asking questions such as was the macro analysis correct was the technical assessment accurate was the position closed earlier than expected were risk management policies followed to the letter bottom line being a profitable trader is not impossible yet it does demand a fair degree of discipline technical expertise and systematic thinking the steps outlined above should paint a clearer picture to beginners of how trading looks like in practice to get rid of the myths and lies that online gurus typically want to push to sell courses
