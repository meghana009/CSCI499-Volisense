the major united states stock market indexes continued their decline last week as worsening macroeconomic conditions increased concerns of a global recession the dow jones industrial average closed at its lowest level in 2022 and major indexes recorded their fifth weekly close in the past six weeks although bitcoin btc has only declined marginally this week it risks closing at the lowest level since 2020 while a new multi year weekly close is a negative sign sellers will have to sustain the lower levels or else it may turn out to be a bear trap the price action of the next few days is likely to witness heightened volatility as both the bulls and the bears battle it out for supremacy crypto market data daily view source coin360 several investors miss opportunities to buy during sharp corrections because they try to catch the bottom traders should rather focus on the projects they like and accumulate the coins in a phased manner lasting a few weeks or months all coins do not bottom at the same time hence it is better to focus on individual cryptocurrencies that show strength while bitcoin is nearing its yearly lows certain altcoins are holding up well let s look at the charts of five cryptocurrencies that look interesting in the near term btc usdt the bitcoin bulls have successfully defended the 18 626 to 17 622 support zone in the past few days but they continue to face strong selling at the 20 day exponential moving average ema of 19 720 this suggests that the bears continue to sell on minor rallies btc usdt daily chart source tradingview the downsloping moving averages indicate that the bears have the upper hand but the positive divergence on the relative strength index rsi suggests that the bearish momentum could be weakening a break and close above the 20 day ema will be the first sign that the bears may be losing their grip the btc tether usdt pair could then rise to the 50 day simple moving average sma of 21 043 and later to 22 799 buyers will have to overcome this barrier to set the stage for a rally to 25 211 conversely if the bears sink the price below the june low of 17 622 the selling could intensify and the pair may resume its downtrend the pair could then plummet to 14 500 btc usdt 4 hour chart source tradingview the bulls are buying the dip below 18 626 but the bears continue to stall the recovery at the 50 sma this has squeezed the price between these two levels but this tight range trading is unlikely to continue for long if the price turns down and sustains below 18 626 the bears may pull the pair to the vital support at 17 622 this level may again witness a strong battle between the bulls and the bears on the upside if the bulls thrust the price above the 50 sma the pair could rise to 20 400 atom usdt cosmos atom has

day ema of 14 22 has flattened out and the rsi is near the midpoint indicating a balance between supply and demand if the price breaks above 15 26 the short term advantage could tilt in favor of the buyers the atom usdt pair could then rise to 17 20 this level may again act as a resistance but if buyers thrust the price above it the pair could pick up momentum and rise to 20 34 and later to 25 contrary to this assumption if the price turns down and breaks below the 50 day sma of 12 90 the advantage could tilt in favor of the bears the pair could then decline to 10 atom usdt 4 hour chart source tradingview the pair has been stuck between 13 45 and 17 for some time buyers aggressively defended the support at 13 45 and are attempting to push the price above the 50 sma if they do that the likelihood of a rally to 16 and thereafter to 17 increases conversely if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20 ema it will suggest that bears continue to sell on rallies that could pull the price to the strong support at 13 45 the sellers will have to sink the pair below 13 to clear the path for a possible drop to 11 50 algo usdt the uncertainty of the range bound action between 0 27 and 0 38 resolved to the upside on sept 23 indicating the start of a new up move if that happens algorand algo could still be in its first leg of the uptrend algo usdt daily chart source tradingview the important level to watch on the downside is 0 38 if the bulls flip this level into support it could increase the likelihood of the start of a new uptrend the algo usdt pair could then rally to 0 45 and later to 0 50 this bullish view could invalidate in the near term if the price slips below 0 38 and re enters the range that could sink the price to the 20 day ema of 0 33 if the price rebounds off this level the bulls will again try to clear the overhead resistance algo usdt 4 hour chart source tradingview the price rose above the overhead resistance at 0 38 but the bulls could not build upon this momentum this shows that the bears have not yet given up and they continue to sell on rallies near 0 41 if thebears pull the price below the 20 ema the pair could drop to 0 36 this is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it could open the doors for a possible drop to the 50 sma on the upside the bulls will have to push the price

resistance at 0 33 conversely if the price turns down and breaks below 0 26 it will suggest that traders may be rushing to the exit the pair could first drop to the 20 day ema of 0 23 and later to the

may be weakening if the bears sink the price below 0 26 the pair could drop to the 50 sma this is a key level for the bulls to defend because if it gives way the pair could drop to 0 22 on the other

downtrend line if this hurdle is cleared the pair could soar to 133 and later to 154 alternatively if the price turns down and breaks below 112 the next stop could be the 20 day ema of 106 a break below this support could pull the pair to 95 qnt usdt 4 hour chart source tradingview the pair picked up momentum after breaking above 112 and reached near the downtrend line this pushed the rsi into the overbought territory which may have tempted the short term traders to book profits the price rebounded off 112 indicating that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips the pair could rise to 121 and thereafter to the downtrend line on the downside a break below 112 could sink the pair to the 50 sma and thereafter to 95 the views and opinions expressed here are solely

cuba as a major hurricane and then become an even stronger category 4 with top winds of 140 miles over warm gulf of mexico waters before striking florida along a stretch of coast including the tampa bay area please treat this storm seriously it s the real deal this is not a drill hillsborough county emergency management director timothy dudley said at a monday news conference on storm preparations in tampa authorities in cuba suspended classes in pinar del rio province and planned evacuations monday as ian approached the island s westernmost provinces cuba also was shutting down its train system ahead of the worst weather cuba is expecting extreme hurricane force winds also life threatening storm surge and heavy rainfall u s national hurricane center senior specialist daniel brown told the associated press early monday at 11 a m edt on monday ian was moving northwest at 13 mph about 240 miles southeast of the western tip of cuba with top sustained winds increasing to 80 mph as the hurricane approached the cayman islands members of the government and opposition were working together to ensure that our people are made as safe as possible the supplies plywood in some cases sandbags are distributed so that they can safely weather this storm premier wayne panton said in a video posted sunday we must prepare for the worst and absolutely pray and hope for the best ian is not expected to spend much time over western cuba and additional strengthening is likely over the southeastern gulf of mexico on tuesday the center said ian is likely to have an expanding wind field and will be slowing down by that time which will have the potential to produce significant wind and storm surge impacts along the west coast of florida a surge of up to 10 feet of ocean water and 10 inches of rain was predicted across the tampa bay area with as much as 15 inches inches in isolated areas that s enough water to inundate low lying coastal communities which is kind of ironic

the technological revolution has made the telecommunications industry one of the leaders in digital transformation due to the impact it is having on all other industries however the increase in competition and technological progress itself has placed them at a major crossroads the telecommunications sector and the so called financial technology institutions fintech have shown their resilience by resisting the adverse conditions of the pandemic and emerging stronger jason simon a fintech specialist explains how telecoms have managed to increase their value thanks to the arrival of fintech over the last few years communications have ensured the continuity of productive educational recreational and cultural activities in several countries financial firms maintained their pace of expansion by bringing products and services closer to users the merger between telecom and fintech may represent a win win scenario for both industries the strategic synergy benefits both parties because they can differentiate themselves in the context of the telecom and fintech industries respectively the latter has consolidated itself as highly competitive explains simon simon believes that telecommunications and fintech companies have many things in common because on the one hand they are intermediaries in their segments finance and communication on the other fintech and telecom can leverage the power of their large customer base to earn higher revenues and expand their business operations the merger of these two industries has a reason according to figures from global market insights the global wallet market will exceed 350 billion by 2026 which telecom could leverage on the other hand according to figures from finnovista and the inter american development bank idb there are more than 112 000 fintechs in the world and they are also growing in value more than a third of them are considered unicorns in simple terms this means that their market value is greater than one billion dollars together they are now worth more than 147 billion there are more reasons why telecoms are fintech s best ally for example the merger of these industries doubly boosts financial inclusion telecom companies can offer financial services to the unbanked population so people with mid range cell phones can have the opportunity to have a digital financial solution both industries can have access to new technologies to provide a better user experience for their customers asserts simon the impact of big data sharing between the two markets has certain effects existing telecom customers provide valuable information such as spending habits which are very useful when offering financial products also fintechs can track customer oriented metrics to improve their services the merger of telecoms with fintechs is beneficial because it brings value to customers telecom companies can reduce the financial burden on customers by providing them with free checking accounts better interest rates and payment for services among others benefits that are already provided by fintechs the alliance between these industries also increases the size of their offerings this is exemplified by samsung which has samsung pay an electronic wallet or orange through orange money which provides payment services to its customers in france in germany t mobile offers payment facilities to its customers who already have a telecom service in this sense telecoms can be the best allies of fintechs because their integration helps to offer a unique differentiated proposition in the digital financial market on the other hand it provides new service opportunities for its users the fintech and telecom sectors have been among the main winners during the pandemic due to the substantial increase in a home office and digital collaborative work which has required remote communication in the last year fintechs have become one of the preferred options for entrepreneurs to apply for loans due to their lower and more competitive interest rates in addition to offering additional benefits on the other hand the need to avoid branches and face to face procedures as well as the increase in ecommerce have boosted the use of digital means of payment as well as the services offered by fintechs about jason simon jason simon is a fintech and digital payments expert who became involved in cryptocurrencies when they were first introduced he enthusiastically follows what is happening in the evolving world of finance excited about the prospects digital currencies offer global consumerism when he s not involved in helping advance the digital payments space he enjoys spending time with his family and improving his community webwireid294682

with the summer rally from the june lows i previously thought the bear market was over i had based my optimism on my observations of past bear markets historically once they recover over 50 from lows they usually don t go back below said lows it turns out that i was wrong even though the summer rally erased more than 50 of the bear market the s p 500 has now gone back and is re testing the june lows and might break down further this is because the u s federal reserve has been much more aggressive in its policy tightening as inflation has spiralled out of control the following chart of the s p 500 is from the start of the covid bear market feb 18 2020 to the writing of this article sept 24 2022 the stock market is undergoing a regime change the stock market is undergoing a regime change stocks depend on bonds there has been a regime change in the market brought about by the federal reserve as can be seen in the chart below for the last 40 years 10 year treasury yields the black line have been falling as one of the many side effects of interest rates being steadily lowered over this period that means the prices of bonds have risen for four decades as bond yields fall the price of bonds goes up and vice versa now this has reversed this is a very big deal since in the u s alone bond markets make up almost 40 trillion in value compared to less than 20 trillion for the domestic stock market the bond market is the dog which wags the stock market tail american stock prices have been built on the assumption of an ever growing bond market advertisement advertisement alarmed by high inflation which is now at forty year highs represented by the blue line in the chart below the u s federal reserve has now embarked on a rapid tightening process it is not only increasing its overnight lending rate called the effective federal fund rate but it is now selling its hoard of longer term bonds it had accumulated in the last decade in order to drive up longer term interest rates like the 10 year treasury bond interest rates black line the latter intervention on the long end of the bond curve is called quantitative tightening or qt and is the reverse of quantitative easing which was the norm for the past decade now it s clear to me that the four decades long bond bull market is over the black line has clearly broken out of the four decade downward trend the stock market is undergoing a regime change the following chart shows the s p 500 blue line as well as the s p 500 dividend yield green earnings yield magenta and the 10 year treasury bond yield black line the stock market is undergoing a regime change the following chart is the same as the one above except its on a log scale on the y axis the log scale enables the viewer to appreciate percentage changes more clearly as it shows the data in relative terms while comparing different scales the stock market is undergoing a regime change from the above chart we can see that the 10 year treasury bond rate is at about the same level as 2011 to 2012 but at that time the s p 500 level was around 1 100 vs 3 700 now so the market has gone up more than three times however earnings yield and dividend yield for the s p 500 are roughly at the same level as before this means that earnings and dividends have also gone up more than three times advertisement advertisement the s p 500 companies are far more profitable than a decade ago the risk of course in that as the recession starts earnings will go down and so will stock prices as stock prices follow earnings bond interest affects the cost of capital and if companies have to pay more for debt there is less for equity holders also bonds are now much more competitive with stock earnings yields see chart below the stock market is undergoing a regime change the dollar keeps rising another important change to note is that the u s dollar as represented by the u s dollar index in the chart below has hit a two decade high the u s dollar index compares usd against a basket of other currencies the increase in interest rates in the u s has attracted a lot of foreign money into the u s this would mean the u s stocks are even more expensive than what their nominal values might indicate the stock market is undergoing a regime change given that the s p 500 companies get 29 of their sales from outside the u s according to goldman sachs nyse gs they are vulnerable to earnings disappointment in light of the strengthening dollar they typically sell their products or services in local currencies then report financial results including those sales in u s dollars this means that there is now a significant headwind for multinational u s companies earnings in the quarters ahead as the value of those foreign earnings has depreciated in usd terms advertisement advertisement takeaways based on the above data i think stock markets are now being driven by the central banks the fed and central banks around the world are focused on fighting inflation inflation is enemy number one markets are currently in drawdown mode as traders unwind leverage and margin margin has become very expensive i think the tightening cycle will likely continue for another six months to a year before the fed will pause to assess the situation however high interest rates are likely to stay for years companies with high debt could get into trouble as interest rates rise my advice is to monitor corporate balance sheets carefully avoid companies with high near term debt maturities profitless companies and companies with high price earnings ratios will continue to get hammered the discount rates used to calculate present values are shooting upwards because risk free interest rates are going up the next tech bubble is not coming any time soon investors have come to their senses and have lost patience with companies that do not have profits and have too much insider stock compensation advertisement advertisement in this environment i think it s better to focus on high quality companies with low debt which have been hammered unfairly due to the general market selloff i also see bonds as doing well in the coming years the fed is trying to land the economy in a difficult environment the chances of a hard landing i e a recession are significant u s assets are expensive compared to non u s assets given the inexorable rise of the u s dollar this is unsustainable and could start to reverse in the next year or so this article first appeared on gurufocus

harring chris hayes strong dollar is a headwind for u s stocks but a tailwind overseas gmo says grantham mayo and van otterloo in a letter to clients says that the dollar s at its highest valuation versus other major developed currencies in more than 35 years and it s our problem the report written by gmo partner ben inker uses a bank for international settlements index measuring the dollar s real effective exchange rate in other words adjusted for inflation unfortunately for the u s an overvalued currency is a negative influence on the performance of equities in that country and today s combination of cheaper stocks and cheaper currencies outside the u s seems a promising backdrop for a reversal of the u s equity dominance of the last decade inker writes gmo has long predicted better performance someday coming from emerging markets but this latest currency realignment makes gmo seemingly more positive on developed economies markets too a cheap currency is a strong equity tailwind in the developed world leaving developed markets like the euro area and japan poised to benefit from their undervalued currencies inker says in developing markets meanwhile the valuation of currencies in the emerging world today are attractive enough that even allowing for some poor decision making they should still be a source of equity market support over the next few years scott schnipper u s

concrete evidence that inflation is slowing before easing up on interest rate increases returning inflation to target will require further tightening of monetary policy collins said in prepared remarks it will be important to see clear and convincing signs that inflation is falling and i will continue to assess the range of incoming data both quantitative and qualitative as inputs to my future policy determinations the fed last week approved its third consecutive 0 75 percentage point interest rate hike in an effort to quell inflation running near its fastest pace since the early 1980s markets are expecting to see another hike of similar proportions at the next meeting in early november echoing comments sunday from atlanta fed president raphael bostic collins thinks the fed can pursue its inflation fighting policy without sinking the economy there are reasons to be somewhat more optimistic about the ability to achieve the necessary slowing of demand without leading to a significant downturn this time around she said household and business balance sheets are considerably stronger than in previous tightening cycles reducing the risk of a significant retrenchment in spending and investment as interest rates rise other fed speakers on tap monday include bostic dallas fed president lorie logan and cleveland s loretta mester jeff cox powell owes american people an apology siegel says wharton professor jeremy siegel criticized the federal reserve on monday saying that the central bank was talking way too tough on inflation now after being too slow to pivot to tighter policy earlier in the cycle honestly i think chairman powell should offer the american people an apology for such poor monetary policy that he has pursued and the fed has pursued over the past few years siegel said siegel said that he thinks the fed is now at risk of causing a recession because it is not allowing the rate hikes it has already implemented to work their way into inflation data the professor added that worker wages appear to be a catch up rather than a driver of inflation jesse pound fed s bostic says he doesn t expect deep deep pain for the economy atlanta federal reserve president raphael bostic is holding out hope that the central bank can bring down runaway inflation without killing the economy in an interview sunday with cbs face the nation bostic acknowledged that raising interest rates will slow the economy and likely cause job losses but he doesn t think that means the economy will sink into a deep recession we need to have slow down there s no question about that he told host margaret brennan but i do think that we re going to do all that we can at the federal reserve to avoid deep deep pain and i think there are some scenarios where that s likely to happen fed chairman jerome powell last month said he expects some pain to coincide with the central bank s tightening efforts which have included five interest rate hikes this year

monday the latest moves come after the british government announced a new mini budget that includes tax cuts and additional spending but those moves could prove to smart long term boockvar said i get the budget blowout of very expensive energy subsidies at the same time taxes will be cut across the board preventing the corporate rate from going up cutting the high top tax rate reducing the stamp

the cost of housing has skyrocketed in colorado since the beginning of the pandemic making colorado unaffordable for many residents proposition 123 aims to solve that problem statewide the real challenge here is we need more supply of housing said mike johnston campaign backer and former member of the colorado senate we ve built 40 fewer units in colorado over the last 10 years than in the decades before that and one of the reasons why prices are going through the roof is because we don t have enough supply the increased cost of housing has affected not just lower income or middle class residents but even upper middle class residents here in the roaring fork valley a signature led proposition 123 or make colorado affordable initiative plans to bridge that gap by using tabor refund money to finance affordable housing throughout the state since 2020 the average rent for a one bedroom house has increased by 30 to live comfortably with quality of life housing advocates say the cost of rent should not exceed more than a third of a person s average monthly income if you re making 40 000 a year as a teacher or a nurse a third of your income would be 12 000 here johnston said that s 1 000 a month according to garfield county economic development demographics 38 of residents are in the low wage earning group 21 700 to 37 800 33 are in the mid wage range 44 000 to 56 800 and 29 are considered high wage earners 58 500 to 96 500 but for much of the middle and working class in the state people are being forced to pay more than half of their monthly income for the lowest rental price points in their area valley impacts the competitive nature of the market combined especially with lack of supply to match demand in the roaring fork valley and garfield county has caused people to be pushed aside and forced out inching people closer to homlessness than they ever expected one local resident who came here from montana heidi eyestone would balance the cost of rent by spending the summers living in her van until around the pandemic when it became more impossible to find housing for a while i tried and then i just kind of gave up the last couple years she said i kind of just got sick of getting my hopes up it s a lot harder to move back in my van when i didn t intend on it property management companies are able to take advantage of the system and deny lease renewal for the sole purpose of hiking rent annually and charging new tenants more we were given notice that we were just not going to be allowed to renew the lease local renter john rogger said they provided zero rhyme or reason he said when his roommate asked the property manager why she snarkily replied that she did not have to give a reason why many solutions have been proposed over the years as solutions for colorado s affordable housing crisis aim to affect the free market like repealing colorado s statewide ban on rent control from 1981 this is focused on guaranteeing that those people under this new measure wouldn t ever have to pay more than 30 of their income to rent or mortgage johnston said the proposal after a couple years of planning a petition with more than 230 000 signatures and support from numerous groups and nonprofits throughout the state proposition 123 was officially placed on the ballot to fund affordable housing across the state without adding additional taxes or affecting the growing economy the initiative would take tabor refund money to fund an estimated 300 million in affordable housing for the state this puts 300 million a year into affordable housing without increasing taxes without cutting other priorities in the general fund and people still get their tax refund said johnston who is president and ceo of gary community ventures this was for people who are tabor purists he said this was exactly what tabor asked us to do tabor didn t say you can never spend money on issues that are a crisis in the state it just said you have to ask the voters for their permission and that s exactly what we re doing people would not lose a tabor check just a small portion the details what the legislative council has said in the blue book was that their projection is in the worst case scenario in a year like this you would still get a 710 tax refund and about 40 would go to housing you re still getting 93 of your tax refund back and that s the worst case scenario johnston said there s a lot of scenarios in which there would be no impact on your tax refund if passed the proposition will allow anyone from development companies to full counties and municipalities to apply for the funding as long as it is used to create more affordable housing for people who live at or below 120 area median income that s about 60 of the state who would be eligible he said anyone who is eligible up to 120 of area median income and that varies from community to community but that s usually somewhere around 100 000 to 120 000 a year of income in garfield county 120 ami is 79 200 for 2022 according to the united states department of housing and urban development glenwood springs and carbondale have a higher ami average i think that s why we have so many people in support and nobody opposes this he said this provides dollars to local municipalities with flexibility for how they want to use them with some of the most innovative financing strategies in the country you know we are doing things that no other state has done before the initiative also requests a 3 increase in affordable housing from current affordable housing stock that will stay at that number for 10 years we think that s completely doable and should be the expectation for taxpayers and committee members who want to see some action on this johnston said garfield county would be required to create 60 to 70 new units per year with the affordable housing stock the county has he said they have a one year timeout all the projects that they ve funded the last three years continue to be funded then they can re apply again in year five so they can still get funding for five out of every six years for projects even if they fall short of the targets he said the model is also built to promote local economic growth while providing affordable housing for local residents by making the colorado housing and financial authority the owner and investor on the project it s actually benefiting the residents who live here and not benefiting out of state investors anymore he said instead of the money being pulled out of colorado and given to wealthy out of state investors those dollars are re invested back into coloradans in the form of reduced rents and in the form of this renter wealth building johnston said the bill was aimed to be a win for all parties in colorado we have the great privilege of having about 200 organizations in support and we have no organized opposition at this point he said we just did a couple of town halls last weekend where for town halls they ll always invite a proponent and an opponent they can never find anyone to come and represent the opponent side because right now no one is opposed to it cballard postindependent com

you didnt about life on and off the hospital ward adam is an obstetrician and gynecologist practicing medicine in a public hospital in a public hospital both medical equipment and staffing are far worse than private hospitals here adam not only have to face endless overtime but also have to fight wits and courage with cunning and demanding patients and have been under enormous pressure for a long time but fortunately in the hospital adam still made some friends such as the fledgling intern shudi ambika mod ornaments adam has a boyfriend harry rory fleck byrne who has been in love for many years although the relationship between the two is stable adam has not disclosed his sexual orientation to his parents let alone introduce harry to them in an accident adams misdiagnosis led to the premature delivery of a baby which became a rope that kept shrinking around his neck causing him to suffocate house officer every doctor makes their career choice aged sixteen two years before they re legally allowed to text a photo of their own genitals a doctor must be psychologically fit for the job able to make decisions under a terrifying amount of pressure able to break bad news to anguished relatives able to deal with death on a daily basis they must have something that cannot be memorized and graded a great doctor must have a huge heart and a distended aorta through which pumps a vast lake of compassion and human kindness senior house officer post one senior house officer is the point at which you decide what to specialize in if you choose general practice you remain in hospital for a couple of years doing things like a e general medicine and paediatrics before moving to the community and being awarded your elbow patches and permanently raise eyebrow i also liked the fact that it was a blend of medicine and surgery my house officer jobs had proved i shouldn t really be majoring in eithers it would give me a chance to work in infertility clinics and labour wards what could be a better more rewarding use of my training than delivering babies and helping couples who couldn t otherwise have them of course the job would be difficulte emotionally when things went wrong not every stork has a happy landing but unfortunately the depth of the lows is the price you pay for the height of the highs i also liked the fact that it was a blend of medicine and surgery in the event it took me months to actually make up my mind commit and apply i think the reason i hesitated was that i hadn t made any significant life decisions since i chose which medical school to go to at the age of eighteen and even that was mosly because i was impressed with the cruly fries in the student s union age twenty five was the first point i actually got to make an active decision in the choose your own adventure book of my life i not only had to learn how to make a decision but also ensure i made the right one senior house officer post two shaolin grandmasters train for a decade or moe in a remote temple waking up at 5 a m and only stopping at midnight submitting themselves to a ife of celibacy devoid of material possessions i couldn t help but feel it didn t sound that bad at least they didn t have to uproot their lives every year to a completely different temple nhs deaneries who are responsible for postgraduate medical training move doctors to different hospitals every six or twelve months to ensure they learn from a broad range of consultants which i guess makes sense unfortunately each deanery cover a fairly large geographicl area and you get randomly allocated to units throughout that region senior house officer post three the money is utterly out of step with the level of responsibility you have literally life and death decisions plus there s the fact you ve been to medical school for six years worked as a doctor for three and started to accure postgraduate qualificaiotns even if you think it s appropriate that yo take home less money per week than a train driver there s still the fact that these working weeks can involve over a hundred hours of unremitting slog meaning the parking meters outsie the hospital are on a better hourly rate registrar post one as a house officer you think your registrar is unimpeachably correct and clever like god maybe or google and you try not to bother them under almost any circumstance a an sho they re your port of call whenever you get stuck and need an answer the safety net of some wise words just a quick bleep away and the before you know it the registrar is you your subconscious ends up making a decision on your behalf either you fail to tune out the bad stuff form work and become permanently distracted and haunted at home or you develop a hardened emotional exoskeleton which apparently isnt considered an ideal quality in a partner registrar post two and then in the second year as registrar he started doing regular locum work he d rather overstretched himself on the mortgage and it felt like a sensible way of making his income do at least a reasonable impression of my outgoings registrar post three eventually there comes a point where yo have to decide what kind of doctor to be not the technical stuff like whether you re into urology or neurology but the more important matter of your bedside manner your stage persona evolves throughout your training but you generally settle on a way of dealing with patients a couple ofyears in and carry it through into your consultant career registrar post four there are two things keeping him there firstly i d worked long and hard to get as far as i had secondly and i realize it might sound a bit worthy it s a privilege to be allowed to play such an important role in people s lives by the time i was six years deep into medicine the shine had definitely rubbed off the surface on more than one occasion my finger had hovered over the metaphorical fuck it button days where things had gone wrong patients had complained schedules had changed at the last minute and my resolve wavered not quite enough to start circling the jobs page of the paper but certainly enough to wonder if i might have any long lost millionaire aunts senior registrar you re practically a consultant that i was now in my thirties still in a career i d signed up for fourteen years earlier based on the very flimsiest of reasons having gone to medical school you might as well finish and become a house officer then you might as well become an sho then you might as well become a registrar then you might as well become a senior registrar and by then you re practically a consultant there almost certainly don t need to be so many different grades i strongly suspect it s designed so that the next step is always just round the corner it s the fifty pound note you chase down the street swept up by another gust of wind the millisecond before your hand makes contact and it definitely works one day i realized as if blinking awake after a serious accident that i was now in my thirties and still in a career i d signed up for fourteen years earlier based on the very flimsiest of reasons i was the highest ranking person in the department after hours knowing that when my bleeper went off it was a problem that both the sho and the registrar had failed to resolve aftermath it s a problem that s baked into the profession you can t wear a black armband every time something goes wrong you can t take a month s compassionate leave it happens too often i d seen babies die before i d dealt with mothers on the brink of death before but this was different it was the first time i was the most senior person on the ward when something terrible happened when i was the person everyone was relying on to sort it all out it was on me and i had failed officially i hadn t been negligent and nobody suggested otherwise medical negligence will always be judged by asking the question would your peers have done anything differently in that situation all my peers would have done exactly the same things and had exactly the same outcome but this wasn t good enough for me i knew that if i d been better super diligent super observant super something i might have gone into that room an hour earlier i might have noticed some subtle changes on the ctg i might have saved the baby s life saved the mother from permanent compromise that might have was inescapable no matter how vigilant he was another tragedy would have happened eventually so in 2016 when the government started waging war on doctors forcing them to work harder than ever for less money than ever i felt huge solidarity with them and when our government repeatedly lied that doctors were simply being greedy that they were in medicine for the money for anything other than the best interests of the patient i was livid because i knew it wasn t true the junior doctors lost that particular battle largely because the government s booming baleful voice drowned out their own reasonable experienced quiet one i realized that every health care professional every single doctor nurse midwife pharmacist physical therapist and paramedic needs to shout about the reality of their work so the next time the health secretary lies that doctors are in it for the money the public will know just how ridiculous that is why would any sane person do that job for anything other than the right reasons because i wouldn t wish it on anyone i have so much respect for those who work on the front line because when it came down to it i certainly couldn t putting this book together six years after quitting medicine i met up with dozens of former colleagues their dispatches from the labor ward tell of an nhs on its knees every one of them spoke of an exodus from medicine when i left i was a glitch in the matrix don t just accept what the politicians feed you think about the toll the job takes on every medical professional at home and at work remember that all of them do an absolutely impossible job to the very best of their abilities your time in the hospital may well hurt them a lot more than it hurts you highlights vs self reflection 1 p 6 it s sink or swim and you have to learn how to swim because otherwise a ton of patients sink with you 2 not every stork has a happy landing but unfortunately the depth of the lows is the price you pay for the height of the highs 3 p 262 but promise me this next time the government asks its pickaxe to the nhs don t just accept what the politicians try to fee you think about the toll the job takes on every healthcare professional at home and at work remember they do an absolutely impossible job to the very best of their abilities your time in hospital may well hurt them a lot more than it hurts you golden sentence conclusion 1 why a

future when it comes to nhs privatization 4 gp surgeries are already privately owned its true that general practices are run as businesses this is because at the founding of the nhs most gps worked as

was a huge proportion of the country s hospital stock war damaged but many doctors were still in army service of those who remained a large proportion was still to be convinced many of them had established practices and were resistant to change between 1945 and the launch of the nhs bevan engaged in furious battle with the british medical association bma the doctors union over the terms of service offered to doctors specifically the issue of whether they should be directly employed on set salaries in 1947 the bma threatened to boycott the new service and the row became increasingly public one letter in the british medical journal described bevan as a complete and uncontrolled dictator and cooperative doctors as quislings after the head of the puppet government in nazi occupied norway for his part bevan accused the bma of engaging in a squalid political conspiracy and organising sabotage of an act of parliament finally a deal was brokered in which gps would retain the power to run their practices as small businesses and consultants could both work for the service and retain their private patients as bevan put it bluntly he stuffed their mouths with gold 4 would you have liked to be a doctor how does this book inform that opinion doctor need to be more smart healthy and good at communication problem soving 1 your subconscious ends up making a decision on your behalf

bloomberg global financial firms still smarting from multi billion dollar losses in russia are now reassessing the risks of doing business in greater china after an escalation of tensions over taiwan lenders including societe generale sa jpmorgan chase co ubs group ag have asked their staff to review contingency plans in the past few months to manage exposures according to people familiar with the matter global insurers meanwhile are backing away from writing new policies to cover firms investing in china and taiwan and costs for political risk coverage have soared more than 60 since russia s invasion of ukraine political risk around potential us sanctions and the likelihood that china would respond by restricting capital flow has kept risk managers busy said mark williams a professor at boston university a sanctions war would significantly increase the cost of doing business and push us banks to rethink their china strategy heated rhetoric between beijing and washington over taiwan has unsettled firms coming just months after russia s war unexpectedly forced the world s largest lenders to exit businesses and stop serving ultra wealthy clients us lawmakers last week ramped up pressure on banks to answer questions on whether they would withdraw from china if it invaded taiwan while financial services executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they view the risk of armed conflict in north asia as low they see tit for tat sanctions between the us and china that disrupt the flow of finance and trade as ever more likely any withdrawal would represent a dramatic about face for wall street firms which have poured billions into china after it opened its finance sector in recent years lenders ranging from goldman sachs group inc to morgan stanley have taken control of joint ventures and sought more banking licenses while adding staff until some recent cuts sparked by a drop deals the combined disclosed exposure of the biggest wall street banks in banks in china was about 57 billion at the end of 2021 those ambitions are now threatened by rising us china tensions last week citigroup inc chief executive officer jane fraser faced a grilling by lawmakers on whether the lender would pull back from china in the event of a taiwan invasion she answered in line with other banks she would seek us government guidance before making a move it s a hypothetical question but it s highly likely that we would have a materially reduced presence if any at all in the country fraser said any pullback in china would only hurt these firms china s global times paper reported last week american politicians want to pile on pressure to coerce top us financial organizations to alienate the chinese market the communist party paper said there is no denying china s financial markets may lose some capital but the us banks may also face the worsening economic woes as a result of the poisonous decision from washington over the past few months firms have been stress testing to see if they can handle the risk of a sudden market plunge examining their exposure across the currency bond and stock trading desks people familiar said while banks often draw up contingency plans without putting them into action the escalating tensions are adding some urgency france s socgen has been assessing headcount in greater china including hong kong driven by nervousness among executives in paris one person said ubs has asked its taiwan based trading desk to assess its contingency plan and see how they can lower exposure to the island according to a person familiar one way would be to reduce foreign exchange trading services for taiwanese clients the person added deutsche bank ag has prepared as well and made plans that would enable it to move some regional assets and staff quickly in case of an emergency surrounding taiwan people familiar with the matter said officials at all the banks declined to comment trading losses top of mind is ensuring staff safety identifying clients who may be sanctioned and looking at plans to mitigate counterparty risk and potential trading losses according to two of the bank executives who asked not to be identified discussing a sensitive issue one banker said staff at their firm had considered the option of liquidating positions on china s financial futures exchange to cut onshore counterparty risk replicating those contracts on other exchanges such as in singapore meanwhile insurers have raised prices by 67 on average for political risk coverage linked to china according to willis towers watson plc businesses that can get insurance face a steep reallocation of pricing which has been very acute for china according to laura burns senior vice president for political risk at london based willis towers watson insurers are underwriting new policies but cautiously and selectively in china and have reduced their capacity for taiwan exposure said nick robson head of credit specialties at broker marsh mclennan cos political risk insurance pays out if a client loses money due to political events such as civil unrest terrorism or war hsbc challenge at hsbc holdings plc the global lender most heavily exposed to china and hong kong calls by its biggest shareholder to carve out the asian business have been driven partly by concern it s susceptible to a decoupling between the us and china ping an insurance group co would back a breakup of hsbc s asia business or just the asia retail operations a person familiar has said the lender which was founded in hong kong and shanghai in 1865 has been increasingly looking to invest in other markets such as india to cushion any financial impact from volatility in some parts of north asia a person familiar has said ceo noel quinn has resisted calls for a breakup the bank declined to comment planning for the spectrum of scenarios is no easy task especially with executives wary of alienating chinese officials on an issue of extreme sensitivity one senior private banker in hong kong who works with wealthy chinese clients at a european bank says the topic is so taboo that bankers are reluctant to hold formal discussions or put plans in writing for fear of it getting back to beijing some of the banks who are the most exposed are the most fearful to plan long term for fear of backlash from china said isaac stone fish founder of strategy risks which specializes in corporate relationships with china banks having a lot of these conversations are doing it outside of china and hong kong russia lessons in some cases executives worry about a situation much like in russia where beijing blocks foreign banks from moving assets or capital abroad as a payback for any us sanctions russian authorities plan to review individual requests on the sale of foreign bank units in the country without instigating a blanket ban on such deals two officials familiar with discussions on the matter have said earlier the government will consider every application and decide to grant permission if it s deemed beneficial for the nation the officials said the interfax news service had earlier cited deputy finance minister aleksey moiseev as saying that a government subcommittee on foreign investments would reject all sales requests from foreign banks to sell their units until the situation has improved european banks including societe generale and unicredit spa have flagged combined hits of almost 10 billion from russia mostly from writing down the value of their operations and setting aside money as a shield against the expected economic ramifications russia has proven to be a template of what you don t want to happen said dale buckner ceo of security services firm global guardian whose clients include banks and private equity firms people are asking the what if questions if there was a blockade if there was shut down of the cyber system if there were naval strikes or an actual war what would happen the first part of the calculus would be to review hard assets and intellectual property in the region understand where a firm s money is parked and who has control if china decided to take over the banking system and deny access he said it s almost impossible to plan for these things said tom kirchmaier professor at the centre of economic performance at the london school of economics while there has been some planning for these scenarios since the financial crisis there no doubt will be some big surprises when theory hits practice updates with deutsche bank in the 13th paragraph 2022 bloomberg l

tier 1 analysis federal officials paved the way for the state to advance to the next phase in the process a tier 2 study would produce an exact location for a third span within the two mile wide selected corridor alternative the next study would also consider a broad range of environmental and traffic impacts associated with construction and operation of a new bridge and the state would be required to identify its funding source there would also be an analysis of how traffic and the environment would be impacted by a decision not to expand capacity the federal highway administration issued its record of decision in tandem with a final environment impact statement on april 14 the mdta released it on thursday many anne arundel and queen anne s residents oppose a third span near the existing crossings they argue that routes 50 and 301 and arterial roads are already jammed with through traffic particularly during the morning and afternoon commutes and on weekends during beach season they complain of being virtual prisoners in their neighborhoods and of emergency vehicles that get delayed in miles long traffic backups in october the anne arundel county council approved a resolution to replace the currents spans with a single bridge with at least eight lanes at the same location council members said that option represented the best solution to maintain forward progress support the investments already made along the us route 50 301 corridor and address the existing and future traffic capacity shortfalls but anne arundel county executive steuart pittman d said on thursday we would have preferred a crossing that would draw traffic to other corridors e must now work to ensure that the next phase of study protects our existing communities and environmentally sensitive areas he said in a statement we must also explore future traffic patterns along the whole route 50 corridor including options for public transit shifts from sprawl development to smart growth and telecommuting we must not build yesterday s bridge tomorrow in reaching their conclusion that corridor 7 is the best option analysts concluded that it would draw more vehicles away from the current crossings than a new bridge further north or south a new bridge near the existing spans would be significantly shorter than neighboring alignments because the bay is narrower there a third span would run approximately four miles roughly one third of the length of the closest alternatives corridor 7 would require a much shorter crossing of the chesapeake bay compared to corridors 6 and 8 which would potentially result in lower impacts to the open water of the bay and other major waterways the study found a longer crossing would require greater impervious surfaces more substantial construction and a greater overall footprint of area impacted in the chesapeake bay and other major water bodies a new bridge would cost between 5 4 billion and 8 9 billion according to the study a bridge tunnel would cost between 8 bill and 13 1 billion traffic is expected to grow as more housing developments go up on the eastern shore though the growth in telework could blunt some of that increase the study s authors said it is too soon to define or to accurately assess the long term impacts of pandemic induced changes in commuting patterns whether maryland moves forward with a tier 2 national environmental policy act nepa analysis is unclear such studies run into the tens of millions of dollars and the hogan administration has yet to commit the necessary funds an mdot spokesperson declined to say on thursday whether maryland will move toward a tier 2 study or leave it to the next administration two years ago gov lawrence j hogan jr r said he would only accept one of the 14 alignments being studied corridor 7 there is only one option i will ever accept adding a third span to our existing bay bridge hogan wrote on twitter while the federal process requires multiple proposals the data is indisputable this option would maximize congestion relief minimize environmental impact a tier 2 study would cost between 35 million and 45 million said james moran chair of the queen anne s board of county commissioners who also favors a single replacement span we want the governor to put that in the budget he said we want no hesitation because the longer this takes the worse things get michael ricci a hogan spokesman said he is pleased with this progress and looks forward to reviewing next steps for moving the project forward moran also wants the state to seek federal funding for construction of the new span jay falstad head of the queen anne s conservation association said the study s acknowledgement that the future of telework remains unclear conflicts with the decision to move toward a third span if it s too soon to define or accurately asses the long term impacts then it s too soon to move forward with a tier 2 review he said a study commissioned by the conservation group and performed by hanover md based akrf concluded that the benefits of a new span would not last long because it would attract new travelers the widening of the bay bridge would temporarily relieve congestion on the bridge itself but not on the highways leading to it unless they were also widened the study s authors concluded the additional traffic attracted to the wider bridge would correspondingly require widening of large stretches of us 50 in the years following the bridge project to avoid new traffic bottlenecks unfortunately the extent and repercussions of this induced traffic demand to roadways beyond the vicinity of the bridge were not considered in the deis republish

other major developed currencies in more than 35 years and it s our problem the report written by gmo partner ben inker uses a bank for international settlements index measuring the dollar s real effective exchange rate in other words adjusted for inflation unfortunately for the u s an overvalued currency is a negative influence on the performance of equities in that country and today s combination of cheaper stocks and cheaper currencies outside the u s seems a promising backdrop for a reversal of the u s equity dominance of the last decade inker writes gmo has long predicted better performance someday coming from emerging markets but this latest currency realignment makes gmo seemingly more positive on developed economies markets too a cheap currency is a strong equity tailwind in the developed world leaving developed markets like the euro area and japan poised to benefit from their undervalued currencies inker says in developing markets meanwhile the valuation of currencies in the emerging world today are attractive enough that even allowing for some poor decision making they should still be a source of equity market support over the next few years scott schnipper u s

job listings from elon musk s texas based tesla company show that tesla plans to deploy thousands of human like or humanoid robots within its factories the robots are being called tesla bot or optimus musk says the number of tesla bots could one day reach millions around the world musk said at a ted talk that robots could be used in homes do household work and care for older people they could even become a friend or adult partner musk also said the robot business may be bigger than tesla s car business musk has been marketing tesla as a company that does much more than just make self driving vehicles at its ai day on september 30 musk said tesla will show an early kind of robot from its project optimus the name for the project comes from a film series about robots called transformers musk said production on the robots could start next year robot experts investors and researchers spoke with reuters about the robot news they said tesla faces doubt among the public that the high cost of general purpose robots would be worth it tesla already has hundreds of robots working in its production of its cars problems robots face humanoid robots have been in development for many years by car companies honda and hyundai s boston dynamics one problem with humanoid robots is that they have trouble with unpredictable situations shaun azimi is the lead of nasa s dexterous robotics team he told reuters self driving cars weren t really proved to be as easy as anyone thought and it s the same way with humanoid robots to some extent he added if something unexpected happens being flexible and robust to those kinds of changes is very difficult at an autonomy event in 2019 musk promised 1 million self driving taxi cars by 2020 tesla has not yet produced any self driving taxis experts say that even if musk s robots show simple abilities it will be hard for him to show the public that robots are as able as humans nancy cooke is a professor in human systems engineering at arizona state university she said that in order for tesla to succeed it will need to show robots doing several unplanned actions she said if he just gets the robot to walk around or he gets the robots to dance that s already been done that s not that impressive tesla did not answer reuters request for comments optimus plans at first musk said optimus will be used to perform boring or dangerous jobs including moving parts around factories musk has said that humanoid robots do not have enough intelligence to operate in the real world without being clearly told what to do but he said tesla can use its knowledge in ai and important robotic parts to develop and mass produce smart less costly humanoid robots tesla plans to employ many new people to work on humanoid robots there are about 20 job listings related to the tesla bot including jobs for designing important robot parts humanoid robots criticism musk and his company have had their own problems with robots in 2018 musk found a robot had difficulties dealing with material that human hands could easily work with he said the costs of having someone keep up the robots was much higher than just having a human put the product together gene munster is a partner at the capital firm loup ventures which holds tesla stocks he said investors are not excited about optimus he added that there is a low possibility that the product will work on a larger scale and he said humanoid robots are much more difficult to make than self driving cars i m gregory stachel hyunjoo jin reported this story for reuters gregory stachel adapted it for voa

inflation it s why your blue cups at he s not are more expensive your dollar is worth less and jerome powell chair of the federal reserve is tightening the market with hopes to strengthen the american dollar i m going to tell you what s happening with runaway inflation what the federal funds rate has to do with it and how to capitalize off of contractionary policy as of august the united states is surviving off an insane inflation rate of 8 3 percent comparative to the target rate of 2 percent most economists pin rising prices to increased demand supply chain straits the war in ukraine and dislocations in the labor market the fed s job is to make the crisis better and clean up afterward we saved the economy and now we are going to have to clean it up dan barkin business journalist and adjunct professor at unc said that s where the federal funds rate comes in federal funds huh federal funds who here s an example let s say an athlete wanted a scooter obviously they d go to the bank of noelle for a loan and said athlete would invest in a scooter consequently increasing productivity in the market but the bank of noelle doesn t have cash on hand so she calls the bank of guskiewicz to borrow some cash or bonds or reserves in general note that banks regularly borrow from each other especially when the federal funds rate is low but wait jerome powell increased the federal funds rate for the fifth consecutive quarter it s now going to cost way more to give out that loan looks like that athlete is going to have to walk thus literally slowing down the market this is called monetary policy it s important to note that the fed isn t red or blue but instead its own entity powell doesn t get political though the federal funds rate doesn t impact people directly it cascades into every aspect of the economy
britain s bond market suffered its biggest daily fall in decades last friday and is expected to slump further as investors choked on the prospect of hundreds of billions of pounds in extra borrowing to fund tax cuts and energy bills finance minister kwasi kwarteng s plans will require an extra 72 billion pounds 79 billion of government borrowing over the next six months alone and a particular concern for investors cement permanent tax cuts costing 45 billion pounds a year the market response was brutal not just among bond investors but for sterling too which sank to a fresh 37 year low against the us dollar below 1 09 down more than 3 per cent on the day the ftse 100 blue chip share index closed down 2pc its lowest close since mid june the proposed tax cuts essential for deregulation that aims to boost britain s long run growth hammer investor confidence today s fiscal announcement constitutes a huge unfunded gamble for the uk economy was the verdict of ben nabarro and jamie searle economist and bond strategist at us bank citi one of the primary dealers in british government debt five year gilt yields which move in the opposite direction to prices rose a massive 50 basis points on the day to a 14 year high of 4 06pc a rise over 15 times their normal daily move and the biggest daily increase since at least 1991 ten year gilt yields jumped 33 basis points to 3 83pc their highest since april 2011 and a yield 1 78 percentage points higher than that offered for equivalent german government bonds the biggest yield premium since the bank of england gained independence in 1997 higher bond yields may appear abstract to those outside financial markets but they directly increase the cost of new government borrowing and indirectly push up interest rates for households and businesses for kwarteng and new prime minister liz truss the tax cuts are essential for a programme of deregulation that aims to boost britain s long run growth by a full percentage point to 2 5pc but to bond investors they bring the prospect of more persistent inflationary pressures at a time when inflation is already near a 40 year high as well as tighter bank of england boe policy markets see boe rates above 5pc by august next year a vertiginous from a rise of 2 25pc now and just 0 1pc in 2021 government borrowing is likely to total 218 billion pounds this financial year and 229 billion pounds in 2023 24 citi predicted and it expects benchmark 10 year british government bond yields to rise to 4 25pc natwest another primary dealer sees 10 year yields rising even higher to 4 5pc the government have announced a pandemic scaled fiscal stimulus but without the offsetting monetary policy stimulus in the form of quantitative easing to absorb all the additional issuance natwest economist ross walker and rates strategist imogen bachra wrote adding to the pressure last week the boe confirmed it planned to reduce its own 838 billion pounds of gilt holdings by 80 billion pounds over the coming year loss of confidence last friday s slump in bond prices and sterling did not come out of the blue sterling and gilt prices have been under pressure all year as has the euro and euro zone debt from fast rising inflation and tighter policy by the us federal reserve which has been less affected economically by russia s invasion of ukraine currencies such as the japanese yen and the swedish crown have fallen more against the dollar so far this year than sterling s 19pc decline however last friday s statement crystallised unease about britain s vulnerability to inflation and post brexit policy direction which had been heightened after ms truss vowed to overturn treasury orthodoxy to boost growth mike riddell senior fixed income portfolio manager at allianz global investors said it was an ominous sign higher yields and expected boe rate hikes had failed to boost sterling that is a strong indication that domestic and overseas investors are losing confidence in the uk s inflation fighting credibility he said citi said a crisis in confidence could cause sterling to fall to parity against the dollar while j p morgan said the outsize scale of last friday s market moves reflects a broader loss of investor confidence in the government s approach deutsche bank said the boe needed to make an emergency rate rise as soon as next week to restore credibility some commentators likened the performance of sterling and gilts to the type of move found more often in emerging markets i don t think the uk is there yet but it is a direction of travel said mike kelly head of multi asset at pinebridge investments in new york a fiscal thrust into a liquidity draining environment explains the weakness in sterling boe policymaker jonathan haskel said last week that he was not worried about sterling s weakness and stressed the importance of well respected policy institutions in preserving investor confidence business lobby groups were more positive about the government s measures than financial markets welcoming the prospect of planning reforms and lower taxes still those business friendly moves failed to shore up uk shares the domestically focused

suppressing an ak 47 is one of those things that sounds both awesome straightforward on paper but can be daunting once you start u s a ammoland com suppressing an ak is one of those things that sounds both awesome and straightforward on paper but can be daunting once you re in the thick of it this isn t to say it s not worth pursuing or incredibly difficult but your efforts might be in vain before you even begin if you don t know a few key aspects of the process thankfully i ve already done the legwork and both failed and succeeded so you don t have to make the same mistakes as me so with that in mind buckle up here are five things you must know before suppressing an ak the goal of suppressing an ak before anything else it s important to set a concrete metric for success and establish a realistic goal for tossing a can on your favorite kalashnikov if your endgame is simply making your soviet slayer look as cool as possible many of these limitations won t truly hold you back on the other hand if you re looking to make a hollywood quiet mouse farting in a library unnoticed carbine you ll likely be very disappointed in the end result because unless you somehow have access to a legit russian vss and some military super heavy subsonic 9x19mm ammo no commercially available configuration will leave you with anything that even approaches the performance of a suppressed pistol caliber carbine that said a pleasantly quiet kalashnikov is 100 possible you ll just need to consider the following piston pop no this isn t a nascar themed sugary beverage but a phenomenon nearly all suppressed aks suffer from for the uninitiated the ak 47 akm uses a long stroke piston driven action to strip a spent casing from the chamber eject it and rechamber a fresh round this means that a long piston not dissimilar to an engine piston uses some of the hot expanding gas launching a projectile from the barrel to drive the bolt and carrier rearward two parts of the ak s design that make the system so reliable are the fact that the gun is over gassed and that it has an automatic gas regulator in the gas block itself by which i mean a few holes upfront that vents some of the hot expanding gas away from the gas tube inside which the piston resides this gas is naturally much hotter than the atmospheric temperatures so when it is released the difference in both pressure and temperature causes the air to essentially rip and sounds like an explosion this occurs just a few inches behind the muzzle and can be very loud to both onlookers and the shooter themself the bad news is that in a stock suppressed ak this is unavoidable the good news is that with an adjustable gas system the shooter can simply dial the internal pressure levels to a point that the majority of the perceived pop is mitigated my personal suggestion is the kns adjustable gas piston it s available for several ak configurations and even first generation galil ace rifles and pistols a thread pitched battle now that we ve covered the performance throttling ak piston next up to bat is the thread pitch more than 90 of all threaded barrels in america fall into one of two thread pitches 1 2 28 and 5 8 24 the first is the common thread pitch for both stand 5 56mm ar 15 barrels and 9mm barrels of american origins yes there are other pitches out there but the majority of american made barrels in either 9mm or 5 56 223 are threaded to a standard 1 2 28 for 30 caliber barrels like 300 blk 308 win and 6 5 creedmoor nearly every american barrel uses a 5 8 24 thread pitch ok what s your point you might be thinking my point is that with a few exceptions all ak barrels are threaded to either 14x1lh for standard akms or m24x1 5 rh for both the ak 74 and ak 100 series this means that a shooter will either have to have their barrel re threaded to a more common pitch or find a suppressor with either an adaptor bad idea tolerance stacking or find a suppressor that features a mount or muzzle device in these pitches the problem with the latter is that the number of suppressors with soviet thread pitch mounts muzzle devices can be counted on one hand so if you ve already got a favorite suppressor you want to use on your ak odds are you ll have to have a smith do some work for you this has the added negative side effect of preventing your ak from using its old muzzle device or any standard ones going forward unless you hate money and ask a smith to read thread every russian brake comp in your possession the good news is that companies like dead air are building suppressors from the ground up for use on aks so the market is growing with each passing day eccentric bores i mean this is the literal sense the bores of ak barrels are occasionally not concentrically rifled meaning the hole in the barrel isn t in the center of the barrel itself this isn t a real issue when utilizing a standard compensator or slant muzzle brake found on nearly all akms but given the tighter tolerances and greater length of a suppressor this can be disastrous after all it only takes a single baffle strike to potentially irreparably damage your expensive suppressor especially if said strike leads to a deflection and the round penetrating a sidewall of your can thankfully preventing this occurrence is a simple matter of checking bore concentricity prior to firing a round through the gun shooters can do this in one of two ways they can either bring it to their gunsmith and have them confirm it or they can purchase an alignment rod to use this rod simply slide it down the barrel flush against the bolt face then visually confirm that the rod is equidistant from all sides of the barrel to be 100 certain that you re good to go install the suppressor and repeat the process if it doesn t touch any side of the suppressor when mounted on the rifle you re golden limited ammo selection while former com bloc firearms have historically had access to inexpensive yet effective ammunition they have substantially fewer domestically produced options here in the united states this is definitely not a coincidence the abundance of cheap ammo made the production of new ammunition not economically viable normally this is a non issue but if you re running a suppressed ak you probably want it to be as quiet as possible and unfortunately the two most popular ak calibers 7 62x39mm and 5 45x39mm are anything but subsonic meaning that even if you manage to get everything inside your gun perfect in terms of sound reduction you ll still hear a supersonic crack as the bullet breaks the sound barrier thankfully a few companies have begun offering subsonic loadings for 7 62x39mm and even silver bear is offering more affordable subsonic ammo though more affordable is very relative since subsonic loadings are still roughly triple the cost of standard velocity steel cased ammunition at the time of this article this will obviously change if suppressing the round becomes more popular but the good news is that even at this increased price point subsonic 7 62x39mm is still much cheaper than nearly every subsonic 300blk loading available currently is suppressing an ak worth it if you re comfortable with the fact that short of a custom built vss your ak will never be the quietest host in the world then yes few guns have access to as reliable magazines and relatively inexpensive ammunition that still hits hard enough out of short barrels to make an effective hunting or self defense weapon not to mention the fact that these are among the most reliable firearms ever built sure they re a little rough around the edges compared to western favorites like the ar 15 but the ak makes a serviceable suppressor host as long as a shooter makes a few concessions plus how

opinion yes it s true prices at the pump have decreased this summer as americans cut back on travel therefore lessening demand and president joe biden drained the u s strategic petroleum reserve spr to help increase supply under mr biden s watch the spr has been exhausted from 640 million barrels to 450 million barrels and now sits at its lowest level since october 1984 u s department of energy data show mr biden s 1 million barrels a day oil release from the country s emergency reserves is scheduled to end next month american consumers can expect gasoline heating oil and diesel fuel to spike soon after the mid term elections the president s desperate spr drawdown is a political ploy that leaves americans vulnerable and hasn t provided any meaningful relief energy prices remain about 70 higher than they were when mr biden took office moreover the reserve is for emergency use only not to be relied upon to win votes in november when u s energy producers were unleashed under president donald j trump and oil prices were at a low mr trump filled the spr with 75 million barrels the only presidents to order emergency drawdowns other than mr biden were during operation desert storm after hurricane katrina and in response to oil disruptions in libya in 2011 these reserves will have to be replaced but by whom and at what cost mr biden has declared war on domestic oil and gas production this april the interior department announced it would raise royalty rates for federal onshore leases and cut the acreage available by 80 in may it canceled offshore lease sales the so called inflation reduction act will increase costs for domestic energy producers and raise taxes democrats are blocking new pipelines from being built and intentionally slowing down the permitting process meanwhile russia is threatening to cut off europe s energy supply causing the u s to send record liquefied national gas and diesel exports to europe further reducing u s stockpiles the global oil supply remains influx as putin rages war with ukraine and the largest oil producing countries in the middle east have so far refused to ramp up production therefore the average cost of home heating is expected to rise in the u s by 17 2 from last winter to 1 202 the highest price in more than a decade the national energy assistance directors association neada said this is as more than 20 million u s households or about 1 in 6 american families has fallen behind on paying their utility bills diesel and heating oil which are distillates made from crude oil are 63 below the five year average in new england and 58 below the same average from maryland to new york according to the department of energy nationwide stocks of heating oil and diesel are at their lowest levels seasonally since 2000 according to the u s energy information administration the northeast is heavily reliant on heating oil to keep homes warm in the winter with 24 of homes in massachusetts dependent on it to more than 60 in maine last week the governors of these two states along with four others met with energy secretary jennifer granholm to voice their concerns about soaring fuel costs heading into the winter yet instead of pleading with the biden administration to end their assault on domestic energy producers and adopt policies to expand production the governors asked for more federal emergency reserves to be released and to waive the jones act the jones act is a law that requires only u s ships that are built domestically and are american staffed can move goods between u s ports none of these solutions are likely to give ailing americans already being crushed by inflation the relief or comfort they need heading into the winter months we will be paying for it david rewcastle a university of new haven analyst and economics professor told usa today last week of the left s endless war on fossil fuels he noted there was no short term solution to rising energy prices this winter maybe this will be a teachable moment he added just not before millions of americans suffer as a result

scientists have discovered a bat in russia carrying a virus that is similar covid 19 washington state university researchers have been studying it pullman wash researchers at washington state university are raising concerns over the discovery of a virus with some of the same characteristics as covid 19 at the same time they hope that the discovery will lead to more progress in vaccine prevention the covid 19 pandemic has done an astronomical amount of damage blamed for more than 6 5 million deaths and counting worldwide while the pandemic is not over it has slowed this year meanwhile researchers are learning more and more about the virus that causes covid 19 there s a focus on finding and studying similar viruses in asia and beyond the good news according to wsu virologist and assistant professor michael letko most of the viruses found outside of asia don t have the ability to use the human receptors or use the human cells letko said this means humans are not currently in danger from them but he and his colleagues have studied two viruses found in russian bats and one of them does raise some red flags the researcher said this virus has some of the same properties as covid 19 and can infect human cells and it has proven to be resistant to current covid 19 vaccines but that alone is not conclusive so we re not necessarily worried about this virus transmitting over to people there are so many factors we don t particularly know what kind of animals these bats are in contact with how prevalent this type of virus is in these animals said letko that said letko believes it is important that researchers continue to investigate to help develop more tools for prevention that may be needed the big take home is we know these viruses now exist and we can now use this information to try to make vaccines and actually there are already groups working to include viruses like this in the vaccines the study authored by letko and others can be found in the journal plos pathogens
an interactive mapping software that will support the prospecting development and management of nature based carbon credit projects worldwide was launched on 22 september at the world economic forum champions for nature event in new york during climate week nyc 2022 the open access platform dubbed the carbon prospecting dashboard was jointly developed by the centre for nature based climate solutions cncs a research centre under the national university of singapore nus faculty of science and st engineering s satellite data and geospatial analytics business st engineering geo insights this first of its kind dashboard supports the preservation of carbon rich natural ecosystems such as tropical forests and mangroves by helping policymakers and investors identify where nature based projects can be developed as potential sources of high quality carbon credits the platform enables users to calculate the estimated yield of carbon credits and their financial return on investment based on user defined assumptions such as project duration costs and carbon prices the platform also allows users to quantify the other positive benefits of projects such as improving food security ensuring clean water supply and conserving key biodiversity areas information on such co benefits can help increase the price transparency of carbon credits and the search for high quality carbon offsets enabling carbon prospecting the carbon prospecting dashboard is a product of recently published peer reviewed studies and ongoing research led by cncs researchers and will help to fill major research and development gaps that have hampered the implementation of nature based climate solutions globally these gaps include uncertainties over where the most promising carbon stocks are located how future increases in carbon prices will enhance the economic prospects of nature protection and where natural ecosystems are benefiting society the most currently the demand for high quality nature based carbon credits outstrips supply carbon is increasingly valued as a commodity and this dashboard helps to shorten the often complicated and costly carbon prospecting process by identifying the most promising carbon project sites to deliver the greatest benefit for the climate biodiversity and people with deforestation being a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions conserving nature through high quality carbon projects can help to turn off the tap of emissions while helping to draw down the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere this dashboard supports governments businesses and civil society to work with nature to address the dual global crises of climate change and biodiversity loss this made in singapore dashboard could be a game changer for nature based climate solutions globally carbon finance has the potential to channel much needed funding to forest and mangrove conservation to tackle climate change and safeguard precious biodiversity however the lack of timely access to reliable data on the costs and benefits of prospective projects has been a major obstacle for many nature based carbon projects to get off the ground with this platform policymakers and investors have the information they need at their fingertips said professor koh lian pin director of nus cncs st engineering brings to this joint effort its geospatial analytics capabilities and experience in providing value added insights to broad industry sectors this cloud based platform for carbon prospecting will position us well in the future development of a digital monitoring reporting and verification platform to expand our nature based carbon solutions toward decarbonisation said mr goh ing nam general manager of st engineering geo insights protecting and restoring forests mangroves and other carbon rich ecosystems is essential if we are to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change carbonprospecting org and the science it is based on comes at a critical time for our planet and helps make protecting nature more accessible more investable and better able to scale at speed said dr m sanjayan chief executive officer of conservation international nature based carbon solutions could solve a third of the climate change problem protecting and managing intact habitat delivers more than just carbon it can also slow the extinction crisis tools like this will make it easier for companies and states to become carbon and nature positive said professor hugh possingham queensland chief scientist in australia to protect biodiversity and stop the deforestation that contributes to so much carbon emissions and global heating we need to know where the forests and their carbon are this vitally important tool provides that information said professor stuart pimm doris duke professor of conservation at duke university

as congress and the obama administration consider changes in financial market regulation much attention is focused on once obscure and still poorly understood financial instruments known as credit default swaps cdss the house agriculture committee has approved legislation that would restrict who may own cdss and where they may be traded the obama administration has proposed requiring that cds contracts be settled through clearinghouses rather than directly between the contracting parties meanwhile in the real world outside of washington the institutions that make and manage cds markets are completing a series of changes that will make global credit markets more transparent efficient and stable everything regulation promises but rarely delivers on march 9 a new clearinghouse began processing cds trades on april 8 cds trading conventions were transformed in a big bang arranged by the international swaps and derivatives association isda the trade association of derivatives dealers in combination these developments make the cds market safer more transparent and more liquid these private sector changes will deliver or facilitate most of the benefits sought through proposed regulation but in a way that will preserve the vitality and utility of a critical national and international credit market these reforms occurred with a nudge from regulators but the private sector execution and likely success of these reforms is a model for further reform of financial regulation cds market developments provide three important regulatory lessons that can be applied across financial markets policymakers should encourage market reforms for market problems markets themselves will often correct deficiencies far more rapidly than regulators this does not mean that regulation has no place it means that regulators can often act most effectively by encouraging private parties to devise market solutions to market problems whenever possible rather than by dictating nonmarket solutions policymakers should consider how existing regulation contributed to market deficiencies instead of automatically assuming that more regulation is required policymakers should carefully review the causes of market disruptions in many cases rationalizing existing regulations will contribute more to market stability than new rules or regulatory bodies can in fact layering new regulations and agencies on the outdated and obviously failed structure that exists today could lead to further market dysfunction overregulation is as dangerous as underregulation but overregulation is harder to identify and fix rules should be flexible to allow for and react to changes in markets markets evolve they cannot be created or run by government although they are shaped by regulation the incentive effects of regulation are too often ignored as a tool and byproduct of regulation congress should facilitate the ongoing market and regulatory evolution of credit derivatives markets rather than reflexively imposing regulation or insisting that markets conform to government jurisdictional categories credit derivatives derivatives are financial instruments that have a value based on the price of something else two common forms of derivatives are futures and options using these products a farmer can plant grain in june and know the price that he will receive for it in september because he has already sold the crop in the futures market similarly an airline can sell tickets six months in advance and know its costs because it has used an option contract to limit the price it will pay for jet fuel financial derivatives which have values related to underlying financial exchanges are similarly useful for instance investors can swap variable payments for fixed income without selling the underlying asset one side of the transaction values predictable payments the other is willing to bear the risk in return for the profit potential of variations in the income stream credit default swaps are financial derivatives that operate like insurance on bonds or other debt one party pays a periodic premium and the other party promises to make good on the debt in the event of a credit event such as missed payments or bankruptcy this type of transaction is valuable because it can reduce the risk faced by bondholders or other creditors credit default swaps credit default swaps were developed as a way for lenders to transfer the risk that a loan would not be repaid without transferring the underlying loan banks can find it difficult or impossible to sell loans because of restrictions in loan agreements concern for a larger relationship with the borrower or the simple lack of a market for individual loans cdss addressed these difficulties by preserving the original loan while transferring the associated repayment risk cdss were also used to facilitate the packaging of multiple loans into securities that are more readily marketable than individual loans a principal reason for the rapid growth in cdss was the adoption of mark to market accounting and capital requirements in the united states and internationally through the basel bank capital requirements under historic value accounting a bank or other regulated entity could buy a bond earn interest and count the principal amount paid for the bond as regulatory capital however bond prices fluctuate in response to changes in interest rates and changes in the borrower s financial status under mark to market accounting these fluctuations must be recognized on a continuing basis a bondholder might be required to post additional capital or suffer a downgrade in its own credit even without any real loss on the bonds this caused a number of bond buyers to switch from traditional bond insurance which covers losses but is not marked to market to cdss which are marked to market because cds values vary inversely with the value of the reference entity s bonds banks can use cdss to smooth out fluctuations in their regulatory capital accounts the use of cdss also grew rapidly because they were adaptable for a variety of uses the market grew quickly to include swaps on a corporation s total debt single names and on broad indexes of corporate debt and other types of securities banks and bondholders are not the only creditors in the marketplace landlords are creditors to tenants suppliers are creditors to customers a landlord can use cdss to protect against the risk of a tenant s failing to pay rent swaps have been written on individual leases but a landlord can also buy a swap on a tenant s overall debt or even on a class of debt such as that of retail merchants and secure a reasonable hedge against a tenant s default companies entering into long term supply contracts with business partners can similarly protect themselves against a partner s failure by using cdss cdss are also used increasingly to assess creditworthiness and credit risk bond rating agencies have been widely discredited in the wake of the market meltdown cdss provide a market measure of a firm s credit risk moreover a creditor who wishes to do so can actually buy a cds to hedge risk a bond rating provides no such guarantee did credit derivatives cause the market crisis some commentators have suggested that cdss were a cause of the recent market crisis dissecting these claims can be difficult because the criticisms are misinformed or inconsistent warren buffett famously described cdss as weapons of financial mass destruction in berkshire hathaway s 2002 annual report however buffett recently admitted that his company has sold at least 251 derivative contracts with a total face value of more than 14 billion buffett says he plans to continue selling cdss because the odds strongly favor making money specific criticisms of cdss fall into four categories the size of the cds market threatens the economy cdss are used to manipulate markets cdss created excessive risk and cdss contributed to the freeze up in credit markets some of these criticisms are simply misinformed in other cases reforms in cds markets such those recently implemented in the private sector rather than more regulation is the most appropriate solution market size new york insurance commissioner eric dinallo one of the loudest critics of cdss argued that the size of the cds market was a threat to the economy by comparing the face value of outstanding cds contracts with the size of the u s private sector debt about a 4 1 ratio regrettably dinallo who ought to know better fundamentally misrepresents the cds market for one thing the cds market encompasses european and international corporate debt and mortgage securities not just u s bonds and includes sovereign debt of the u s and other nations the week dinallo made his charge the largest individual debtor named in outstanding cds contracts was the republic of italy not a u s corporation moreover the face value of cdss is deceptive because the over the counter cds market is largely bilateral when participants want to change their cds investment mix they usually write new contracts rather than buy sell or cancel existing contracts for instance a bank might sell 100 million in protection on a particular type of debt and then later buy 90 million in protection on the same debt to hedge its position the bank would report 190 million in outstanding contracts even thought its net exposure was only 10 million to the extent that the high notional value is perceived as a problem market participants have already begun to address the issue through a series of compression efforts by matching and eliminating offsetting trades within a related series the ongoing migration of trades to the cds clearinghouse will greatly facilitate this effort the need to write offsetting trades to change market positions will be further reduced by the big bang convention changes which will make cdss more standardized and more readily tradable in combination these market developments are likely to reduce the notional to net ratio significantly market manipulation richard fuld former chief executive officer of lehman brothers fingered cds sales as partly responsible for his firm s failure some evidence indicates that non cds transactions short sales of stock may have contributed to lehman s failure however cdss are related to the debt of a corporation not its equity stock moreover cds contracts are often settled for cash rather than through an exchange of debt securities physical settlement making it difficult to posit a causal link between cds trades and the company s failure of course cds trading reflects investors views of a company s health but this is a measure of sentiment not a cause of corporate ills the effect of market psychology on prices is hardly unique to the cds market blaming cdss for corporate debt problems is like blaming the thermometer for the temperature to the extent that market manipulation does occur through cdss or other mechanisms it is already illegal both as common law fraud and under federal securities statutes processing trades through a central clearinghouse that is regulated by the federal reserve and the securities and exchange commission sec will make it easier for regulators to monitor and review trading activity if an investigation is necessary risk allocation insurance giant aig clearly misunderstood and misallocated risks associated with its cds trades however the miscalculation was related to the mortgage backed securities that aig guaranteed through its trades like many mortgage investors aig believed that home prices were unlikely to decline and that any declines would be uncorrelated limited to discrete areas rather than affecting the entire housing market at once cds trading practices that prevailed until recently facilitated aig in taking risky bets on the housing market first prices in the over the counter cds market were not readily available giving aig and similarly situated parties little external feedback about appropriate pricing prices in the over the counter cds market were not readily available giving aig and similarly situated parties little external feedback about appropriate pricing second the prevailing margin practices allowed aig to write cds contracts without posting margins or reserves against losses once more recent market developments have begun to address these problems new cds trading conventions include standard contract dates uniform pricing methods and improved resolution procedures these changes will make the market broader and more liquid providing better pricing information central clearinghouses will collect and enforce margin requirements and scrutinize market positions because each clearinghouse member ultimately stands behind trades made through it members will monitor trading positions to prevent excessive risk concentrations or insufficient margin reserves credit contraction counterparty risk the possibility that a contractual partner will fail to pay what is owed is a significant concern in any financial transaction including garden variety loans and bank deposits the risk that a party may not pay cannot be eliminated cdss allow the risk to be transferred but transferring a risk does not magnify it in september 2008 world financial markets experienced an historic credit freeze the contraction was not limited to cds markets for instance investors withdrew 210 billion from money market funds in a two day period after one fund failed due to overexposure to lehman brothers debt critics charge that uncertainty about cds obligations combined with the long chains of obligations involved in many cds trades may have triggered or intensified this credit crisis compared to public markets such as stock markets the over the counter cds market was opaque because pricing and volume information was not readily available less efficient because of the large volume of contracts and relatively slow settlement process and more subject to counterparty risk large numbers of cds contracts were written on mortgage related debt when the housing market decline triggered claims cds market imperfections arguably contributed to three problems some companies such as aig mispriced products and underestimated risks and had difficulty honoring contracts that they had written the complex opaque nature of the cds market may have contributed to the credit freeze by making lenders less willing to advance funds to borrowers who might be exposed to bad debt such as lehman brothers debt the need for cds protection sellers to find collateral to meet unanticipated claims may have contributed to declines in equity stock markets in summary critics of cdss claim that rather than limiting risk as intended the cds market actually spread risk while these claims are hotly disputed it is important that these criticisms do not refute the beneficial uses of cdss rather they point to imperfections in the market affecting price discovery assurance of payment and collateralization thus improving rather than restricting the cds market is the appropriate remedy for these problems the options for trading financial instruments cdss are bilateral contracts negotiated directly between parties certain brokers and services help to match interested buyers and sellers but final negotiations are typically through one to one telephone or e mail communications until now financial settlements were also made directly between the parties and the result has sometimes been disputes delays and uncertainty proposals to reform the cds market include requirements for central clearing or exchange trading with central clearing arrangements for trades are still made bilaterally over the counter but a financial intermediary handles financial exchanges to complete the contract this service is similar to a real estate escrow arrangement except that it continues through the life of a cds contract typically five years central clearing reduces mistakes disputes and uncertainty in financial transactions exchange trading involves bids and offers to anonymous parties in a widely traded market trades are made between a buyer or seller and a market specialist rather than directly between buyer and seller exchange trading requires a large market with frequent trades for instance most u s stocks are now traded on exchanges but bonds and other less widely traded instruments lack sufficient volume to make exchange trading practical the cds market s imperfections critics have decried the unregulated nature of the cds market yet in considering what if any new regulation is needed it is important to understand that the cds market has evolved like all other markets creating a cds market as a full blown exchange would have been impossible just as the traders who met outdoors on wall street in the 19th century or made small stock trades individually over the telephone in the 1970s could not have created the new york stock exchange or nasdaq stock market in their times in fact the inflexibility of the u s financial regulatory structure is one important reason why the cds market evolved imperfectly while cdss are similar to several other financial products they do not fit neatly into the regulatory structure which was developed largely in the 1930s cdss are similar to insurance but certain cds features such as payments to a party who has not suffered an actual loss would be illegal if offered as insurance cdss are also similar to futures but commodity laws require futures to be traded exclusively on exchanges exchange trading requires standard contracts but some cdss are highly customized making it impossible to trade all cdss on exchanges although they are more standardized today than when they were developed in the 1990s because of these inflexible regulatory requirements cds products were structured and markets developed to avoid existing regulatory categories overly strict regulation backfired by forcing cds market participants wholly outside of the regulatory system rather than attempting to force cdss and other innovative products into the 1930s style regulatory straightjacket policymakers should adapt regulatory schemes to market developments the changing cds market the cds market is changing in two fundamental ways clearinghouses will begin clearing many cds trades and cds dealers have agreed on a series of changes in how cds are priced traded and resolved after credit events that trigger payments central clearing under the aegis of the federal reserve bank of new york cds market participants have been meeting since 2005 to discuss improvements in the cds market structures without regulatory mandates derivatives market participants have moved to improve the efficiency and transparency of their markets by such steps as electronic trading and recordkeeping trade netting and centralized data collection and publication the depository trust and clearing corporation an industry service organization has begun to release weekly reports on cds trade volumes and value these intermediate steps pointed ultimately toward a clearinghouse for cds trades regulators and market participants agree that a central counterparty or clearinghouse for cds transactions will address existing market imperfections a clearinghouse will act as intermediary for all cds transactions largely eliminating counterparty risk of a trading partner or broker being unable to keep its side of a bargain a clearinghouse will reduce gross risk exposure by netting offsetting contracts and will make trade settlement virtually immediate a clearinghouse can publish prices and trade volume making the market more transparent and will provide regulators with information about participants positions and risk exposures finally a clearinghouse will increase liquidity by imposing capital and margin requirements on clearinghouse members and by maintaining its own capital cushion in short a clearinghouse will make the cds market more transparent more liquid and less risky one of the major barriers to establishing a cds clearinghouse was the balkanized u s regulatory framework while the commodity futures modernization act allows any one of three agencies to approve a derivatives clearinghouse the sec s insistence that it should retain authority over clearinghouses approved by other agencies and disparate regulatory standards and aims slowed and frustrated efforts to establish one or more clearinghouses following the market crisis the regulatory agencies worked together in november 2008 they announced a memorandum of understanding in which the federal reserve commodity futures trading commission cftc and sec agreed to cooperate share information and harmonize regulatory requirements for a clearinghouse for credit derivatives final regulatory approvals took several additional months but one european and two american clearinghouses have been approved to clear cds trades on march 9 ice trust operating under regulation of the new york federal reserve bank began clearing some cds trades ice is beginning with widely traded and highly standard cds indexes and will later expand to other types of cdss the fact that market participants have been cooperating to improve operations for several years while regulators are only now collaborating to improve the regulatory process is an important reminder that the private sector is often more willing and able to reform in the face of financial challenges than regulators are regrettably congress is even further behind the curve than regulatory agencies are the house agriculture committee recently approved legislation that would mandate cftc regulation and strip the federal reserve of authority to regulate cds clearing yet major cds dealers are banks which is a powerful argument that fed regulation is appropriate even if cftc regulation were a good idea in the abstract an abrupt shift in the regulatory framework would pull the plug on a four year cooperative public and private sector effort to improve cds markets disrupting a government encouraged private sector effort at the very moment that it is beginning to bear fruit would be disastrous both economically and from a public policy perspective markets would suffer and it would not likely improve the regulatory outcome the obama administration apparently plans to propose requiring central clearing for standardized derivatives contracts the market has matured to a point where such a requirement for many types of cdss is at least feasible even if not necessary however any regulatory structure needs to be flexible enough to allow continuing innovation and experimentation prior to recent market revisions few cdss would have been easily cleared new products should be given an opportunity to develop fully before clearing or similar requirements are imposed exchange trading which the administration plans to encourage is not practical in the near term because the cds market lacks sufficient volume to support anonymous auction trading trading conventions and the big bang beginning on april 8 cds trades fell under new rules that affect pricing trading dates and the determination and settlement of payment obligations the international swaps and derivatives association a trade association of credit derivatives market participants functions in some respects as a private sector regulator of cds markets isda definitions and standard agreements provide the basis for individual cds trades the isda changes are so significant that they are referred to in the industry as the big bang cds prices will now be calculated through a combination of an initial up front payment and a standard coupon the periodic premium of either 1 percent or 5 percent per year depending on creditworthiness this will make cds pricing more consistent and transparent facilitating better price discovery and readier comparisons to related financial products trades will have standard quarterly expiration dates until now parties to swaps sometimes disagreed about whether or not a credit event triggering a payment obligation had occurred disputes about credit events must now be submitted within limited time periods to determinations committees assembled by the isda creation of a regular and objective mechanism for settling disputes should reduce the uncertainties and therefore the costs associated with cds trades finally the new trading conventions specify that the normal method for settling cds obligations after a bankruptcy or missed payment will be to auction the bonds or other debt at issue previously auctions have frequently been used for this purpose on a voluntary basis making auctions standard should make settlement more predictable and pricing more equitable these new trading conventions have been developed by market participants after years of trial and experience they will make cds contracts easier to clear and the market more transparent and efficient continuing standardization could even lead to exchange trading for some categories of cdss however regulators were unlikely to develop these conventions which required years of market development and experimentation by the market participants as policymakers consider whether further regulation of cds markets is needed they should keep in mind that market mechanisms and responses are often the best solutions even to ostensibly regulatory problems what policymakers should do policymakers have focused excessively on alleged market excesses as the cause of the financial crisis and on increased regulation as the appropriate solution while market excesses clearly played a role developments in credit derivatives markets are a reminder that overly complex inflexible and outdated government regulations contributed to market dysfunction the most productive regulatory reforms may not be new or increased regulation but rationalization of regulatory schemes to address modern market needs and practices specifically 1 policymakers should encourage market reforms to market problems the private sector has taken substantial steps to address weaknesses in credit derivatives markets regulators are taking productive steps to encourage and facilitate that reform further regulatory reforms should focus on improving market structures and incentives rather than on increasing government intervention and control of markets rather than simply assuming that more regulation is needed or seeking a comprehensive regulatory system for ideological or theoretical reasons advocates of additional regulation should be required to identify specific market deficiencies and craft targeted responses rather than blanket mandates using the new york fed s credit derivatives effort as an example regulators should consider cooperative discussions with market participants prior to coercive market intervention in the case of credit derivatives regulators and market participants largely agreed about the existence and nature of market defects market participants were able to develop innovative solutions and implement them more quickly than regulators were 2 policymakers should consider how existing regulation contributed to market deficiencies recent improvements in the derivatives market are a reminder that regulatory balkanization and overlap contributed to market imperfections for instance many reform proposals would create new regulatory agencies to address the safety of particular financial products or to promote overall market stability before congress creates a super financial regulator or a safety board it should review the jurisdictions and purposes of existing regulatory agencies to ensure that the government is contributing to not hindering productive reforms of the financial system congress has already ordered a review of regulation of over the counter credit derivatives in the emergency economic stabilization act this review and any subsequent congressional action should focus as much on rationalizing existing regulatory jurisdiction as on imposing new requirements on credit derivatives markets simply creating new regulatory agencies on top of existing bodies would make matters worse 3 rules should be flexible to allow for and react to changes in markets policymakers should keep in mind that markets evolve markets cannot be created by government fiat and they are distorted by government intervention where regulation is necessary it should be flexible enough to allow continued market evolution and to respond to that evolution in appropriate ways sound regulation interacts with markets rather than insisting that markets conform to preconceived government categories and jurisdictions while central clearing for many cds contracts is now feasible regulations should remain sufficiently flexible to allow new or revised credit products to trade and develop in non cleared markets over time successful products will develop sufficient volume and standardization to permit clearing or exchange trading however imposing such requirements on new products when they are initiated would prevent useful experimentation and market evolution those who would disrupt derivatives market improvements by mandating a change in regulatory jurisdiction should be required to meet the high burden of proof that the regulatory disruption is both necessary and likely to improve current arrangements the house agriculture committee s proposal to restrict derivative clearing to cftc regulated clearinghouses fails both prongs of this test conclusion cdss and derivatives more generally play an important and productive role in the economy while the cds market was imperfect arguments for draconian regulation are poorly supported and inconsistent cds market participants have recently taken significant steps to improve the market government should encourage continued market improvements rather than reflexively impose new regulation if regulatory changes are made policymakers should seek to improve the regulatory structure rather than simply creating new agencies or rules

share this massive list of post election firings and layoffs with everyone you can economic collapse nov 9 2012 the victory by barack obama on election night has resulted in a huge wave of firings and layoffs all over america a large number of businesses seem to have suddenly shifted into panic mode the number of layoff announcements that we have seen in the last 48 hours has been absolutely shocking so why is this happening well the truth is that the federal government is absolutely suffocating small businesses all over america with rules regulations and taxes if you have never tried to run a small business then you have no idea how oppressive this system actually is for people that are trying to run small businesses successfully it has steadily gotten worse over the years no matter who has been in the white house and no matter who has controlled congress so we shouldn t put 100 of the blame on obama bush massively expanded government and made things harder on small business people too but what many small business people were looking for on this election day was just a little bit of help many were desperately holding out hope that obamacare would be repealed so that they would not have to get rid of some of their employees many were hoping to get a little bit of relief from the crippling regulations and taxes that are absolutely crushing them but now that barack obama has been given another four years they understand that there is no hope on the horizon and that things are only going to get worse so they are making the hard decisions that they feel are necessary in order to survive in this economic environment and i certainly don t blame them you only want to have employees if you can make a profit on them and in this environment it is getting harder than ever to make a profit on an employee you see the truth is that what you cost your employer goes far beyond your salary or your hourly wage i think many of you would be absolutely shocked if you learned how much it actually costs your employer to employ you and now thanks to obamacare that cost is going to go up even more many businesses are not even feasible at all in this economic environment many small businesses had been holding out hope that somehow this election might turn things around and make it possible for them to keep going but when obama won it was kind of like the straw that broke the camel s back you can t do what the federal government and the state governments are doing to us and expect to have a thriving economy they are choking the life out of us new businesses and small businesses are supposed to be at the heart of our economic system unfortunately the environment that has been created is absolutely killing them this is a recipe for disaster in a previous article i noted that the number of jobs created at new businesses in 2010 in the united states was less than half of what it was back in the year 2000 now we can expect that number to get even worse and we can expect large numbers of small businesses to shrink in size or close their doors completely the following is a list of some of the post election firings and layoffs that we have seen since tuesday night read moremassive list of post election firings and layoffs

the rice probem is raisng eyebrows yet once again because the price of a 25kg long grain parboiled rice has gone up from usd14 to usd20 this means that when nearly all of the employed people can not afford to buy the rice at the previous price and nearly all of the employable people remain unemployed violence oriented poverty is worsening and violence is threatening by togba nah tipoteh witness the violence oriented poverty protests in liberia sierra leone and in other neighboring countries on account of the rising and unaffordable cost of living many people died and got injured during the protests common sense and common duty to country call for taking urgent action to end the violence oriented poverty problem in effect the protests are a continuation of the longstanding struggle for rice and rights while hungry people are concerned about the non affordable price of rice they are also concerned about justice being done for all not just for the rich it took this struggle long years for the expression in front of the temple of justice that said let justice be done to all men to be changed to let justice be done to all to all males and females to all poor and rich when people call for justice to be done to all the powers that be condemn them saying that they are being political but they are being realistic bearing in mind that politics is about power from the holy bible and the holy qu ran we learn that politics is about power and this is why our creator god allah made the supreme sacrifice to give up life of the creator to save lives on earth we have the shining example of madiba mandela who told the court in south africa that he was prepared to die to save the lives of people of all races and all classes so in reality madiba mandela was jailed for twenty seven years but the actions of the people led to his release from prison his action was at once political because it gave power to the oppressed people and realistic because it exposed the inhumanity of the apartheid system amandla ngawaytu this expression means in the zulu language of south africa power to the people and so be it in liberia we say in the kpelle language the most widely spoken liberian language gweh feh kpei ngatee in liberia the powers that be are playing with the lives of the people by thinking that the low level of western schooling of the people means that they are not civilized educated and intelligent and must not participate in national decision making listening to the unschooled but very educated and intelligent women of the township of west point in monrovia liberia they conclude correctly by saying that the problem in liberia is not about money but it is about management some of us spend five years trying to get doctorate degrees about the same problem before comming up with the answer that it took less than one minute for the women of seven sisters in west point to come up with no wonder we find in all of the liberian languages the expression some people know book but they do not have sense let us put some sense into this rice problem in april of the year the president of liberia was seen on lntv the national broadcaster inspecting the npa warehouses walking by much rice to the point that he said there is enough rice and the price of rice would never rise but the price of rice has risen from usd14 to usd20 the rice sellers have appealed to the gol for an increase in the official rice price but the gol has refused citing that there is no more stock of rice so the rice sellers have embarked upon a go slow action refusing to sell rice earlier when the gol said that there was enough rice the sellers held a protest blocking the verhee wrongly called vai town area because they said that they had no access to the rice once again this shortage of rice is artificial and not real because the powers that be have access to the rice let us recall how the powers that be had access to petroleum products when their prices went up then the lprc deputy managing director became the fall guy citing his corrupt practice of holding some petroleum products for the powers that be let us recall also the time of january 18 2019 when all of the commercial banks indicated that they had no liberrian dollars but the gol came up with usd25 million to mop up the excess liberian dollars that the commercial banks said they did not have how does liberia get out of this life threatening rice price problem immediately civil servants could demand that at least a quarter of their salaries should be paid in liberian produced and owned rice because liberians are producing and owninng quality affordable rice the entities that are providing food for schools can now buy liberian produced and owned rice when the usd250 000 000 nearly a quarter of a billion united states dollars amount that is being used to buy imported rice is used to buy liberian rice there will a boost in liberian ownership liberian production employment income generation and poverty will be degenerated

tallahassee fla authorities and residents in florida were keeping a cautious eye on tropical storm ian as it rumbled ominously through the caribbean on sunday likely to become a major hurricane on its path toward the state gov ron desantis has declared a state of emergency throughout florida and urged residents to prepare for the storm to lash large swaths of the state with heavy rains high winds and rising seas forecasters are still unsure of exactly where ian could make landfall with current models plotting it toward florida s west coast or panhandle regions he said we re going to keep monitoring the track of this storm but it really is important to stress the degree of uncertainty that still exists desantis said at a news conference sunday cautioning that even if you re not necessarily right in the eye of the path of the storm there s going to be pretty broad impacts throughout the state the national hurricane center said ian is expected to become a hurricane on monday and reach major hurricane strength tuesday flash and urban flooding is possible in the florida keys and florida peninsula through midweek and then heavy rainfall was possible for north florida the florida panhandle and the southeast united states later this week the agency placed a tropical storm watch over the lower florida keys on sunday evening and has advised floridians to have hurricane plans in place and monitor updates of the storm s evolving path a hurricane warning was in effect sunday for grand cayman and the cuban provinces of isla de juventud pinar del rio and artemisa cuban state media said emergency authorities have met to plan for the storm s arrival and prepare for evacuations though none had been ordered as of sunday the track forecast by the national hurricane center shows a major storm striking the far western part of the island early tuesday close to the country s most famed tobacco fields president joe biden also declared an emergency authorizing the department of homeland security and the federal emergency management agency or fema to coordinate disaster relief and provide assistance to protect lives and property the president postponed a scheduled sept 27 trip to florida because of the storm john cangialosi a senior hurricane specialist at the miami based center said in an interview sunday that it is not clear exactly where ian will hit hardest in florida residents should begin preparations including gathering supplies for potential power outages he said it s a hard thing to say stay tuned but that s the right message right now cangialosi said but for those in florida it s still time to prepare i m not telling you to put up your shutters yet or do anything like that but it s still time to get your supplies local media in florida have reported a consumer rush on water generators and other supplies in some areas where residents moved to stock up on goods ahead of the storm weather blog ian heading towards the united states may become a major hurricane noaa via ap this satellite image provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration shows tropical storm ian over the central caribbean on saturday sept 24 2022 noaa via ap bonus click here to track the storm with the cbs 6 interactive hurricane tracker kevin guthrie director of the florida division of emergency management said the state has begun loading trailers with more than 2 million meals and more than 1 million gallons of water to be ready to be sent into impacted areas he said the state has had frequent communication with local governments and is processing requests for resources georgia gov brian kemp on sunday moved to activate the state operations center to respond to any potential storm damage he told residents to monitor the weather and calmly take precautions if necessary at the kennedy space center nasa kept close watch on ian s projected path while debating whether to move its new moon rocket off the launch pad and into shelter managers already have bumped the test flight from this week to next because of the storm elsewhere powerful post tropical cyclone fiona crashed ashore saturday in nova scotia in the atlantic canada region washing houses into the sea tearing off rooftops and knocking out power to more than 500 000 customers in two provinces
over the last several years congress has passed multi pronged policy initiatives and provided billions of dollars in funding to spur the deployment of advanced nuclear reactors and a sprawling array of projects are now in progress workers painting the dome that once housed idaho national lab s experimental breeder reactor ii facility the structure had been slated for demolition but it was restored three years ago and is now set to house the dome demonstration of operational microreactor experiments testbed which is part of the lab s new national reactor innovation center image credit inl congress has passed a series of bills over the past four years supporting the development and deployment of advanced nuclear reactor designs which are markedly different from those currently in commercial operation energized by billions of dollars in funding through the department of energy a sprawl of experimental efforts and technology demonstration projects are now underway if successful these reactors will serve a range of functions larger models are aimed at reversing the decline of nuclear power in the u s by promising lower construction costs and stronger safety systems while providing baseload power to an increasingly decarbonized grid smaller reactors would provide power for more localized applications and some models are intended to be transportable nasa is also developing specialized reactors for propelling spacecraft and supplying power on the surface of the moon aside from funding reactor projects directly congress is supporting activities such as early stage r d reactor licensing reforms development of specialized uranium fuel supplies and assistance to communities hosting fossil fuel plants that will transition to advanced nuclear power like the similarly multi pronged effort to bolster the u s semiconductor industry through the chips and science act these policies have benefited from bipartisan backing though they have had a smaller public profile demonstration plants moving full steam ahead the most ambitious component of u s efforts to promote advanced reactors is doe s advanced reactor demonstration program ardp which congressional appropriators created in 2019 before it was formally authorized via the energy act of 2020 last year the infrastructure investment and jobs act further cemented the program in place with a special four year 2 5 billion appropriation the funding from the infrastructure law is expected to cover the bulk of doe s contribution to the two full scale demonstration projects it selected for support in october 2020 both projects will generate electricity commercially and are targeting completion toward the end of this decade xe 100 the company x energy is building a 320 megawatt plant in eastern washington comprising four of its xe 100 reactors the xe 100 is cooled by high temperature helium gas and employs triso a pelletized fuel that is designed to resist meltdowns and permit refueling without a shutdown x energy has just completed work on a six year 40 million grant doe awarded in 2015 to develop the company s designs for the xe 100 and triso last month the dow chemical company and x energy announced a preliminary agreement to install an xe 100 at one of dow s gulf coast facilities to provide process heat and power natrium the company terrapower which is backed by microsoft co founder bill gates will build a 345 megawatt reactor called natrium in partnership with ge hitachi natrium employs a liquid sodium coolant and a molten salt energy storage system and it will be sited at a coal power plant in southwest wyoming that is scheduled to be closed down tax credits atop doe s funding for demonstration projects advanced reactors are also eligible for an investment tax credit created by the new inflation reduction act that will reimburse up to 30 of costs for any zero emissions electricity facility that enters service in 2025 or after alternatively companies may elect to receive a credit for electricity produced at such facilities both credits are increased if the facility is located at a contaminated brownfield site or in a community negatively affected by shifts in the fossil fuel industry fossil to nuclear transition the new chips and science act incorporates legislation called the fission for the future act that creates a doe grant program to support communities where advanced nuclear reactors will replace retiring fossil fuel plants the program may make grants to various entities including state and local authorities educational institutions national labs and companies projects eligible for funding include but are not limited to workforce training programs and non electric applications of nuclear power such as generating heat for industrial processes and community wide heating systems the act recommends congress initially appropriate 75 million for the program in fiscal year 2023 rising to 250 million in fiscal year 2027 smaller scale advanced reactors also in pipeline aside from its two marquee projects ardp expects to provide about 600 million over seven years to five reactor development projects that were selected in december 2020 those grants require annual appropriations but congress is supporting them robustly so far ramping up funding to 115 million this fiscal year with a further increase on deck for fiscal year 2023 mcre of the 600 million about 90 million will support the molten chloride reactor experiment a 500 kilowatt reactor that terrapower and southern company will build at doe s idaho national lab to test technologies required for terrapower s molten chloride fast reactor design which is distinct from natrium mcre is expected to be completed in 2025 and will not generate electricity hermes about 300 million is for a triso fueled salt cooled reactor called hermes that the company kairos power plans to build at the site of a former uranium enrichment facility at doe s oak ridge national lab expected to be completed in 2026 hermes will be a 35 megawatt reactor that will not generate electricity serving as a test for a full scale 320 megawatt reactor to be built later bwxt mobile reactor doe is providing the company bwxt with 85 million to develop its design for a transportable triso fueled reactor in june the department of defense awarded bwxt about 300 million to actually deliver a prototype transportable reactor to idaho national lab in 2024 where it will be tested for up to three years operating at between one and five megawatts that reactor would be the first operating advanced microreactor in the u s dod s award represents the final phase of an initiative called project pele which in its earlier phases provided funding for the development of three candidate concepts including 42 million to the bwxt project evinci westinghouse s evinci microreactor was also awarded early stage funding through project pele and is receiving 7 million from doe this spring westinghouse and penn state university announced they would explore installing an evinci reactor on campus as part of a broader r d partnership westinghouse also announced a similar partnership with the saskatchewan research council smr 160 the company holtec is receiving 116 million for work on a small modular reactor that uses a traditional water cooled design holtec is also seeking a 7 4 billion loan from doe to deploy its first reactors and build up its manufacturing capacity oklo microreactor although the startup company oklo has not received funding through doe s new demonstration program idaho national lab announced in february 2020 it will supply uranium fuel for a demonstration reactor the company plans to build on the lab s property planning for university reactors ramps up there are currently 25 research reactors at universities in the u s serving purposes such as training basic research radioisotope production and nuclear energy r d new reactors the chips and science act directs doe to support the construction of up to four new university based reactors specifically citing advanced reactor concepts and medical isotope production as priorities congress would have to provide appropriations for the effort and the act sets a target of 45 million in fiscal year 2023 rising to 140 million in fiscal year 2027 the biden administration has requested the initial amount but it is not yet clear how much congress will in fact provide reactor consortia and renovations new reactors aside the act also directs doe pending appropriations to support consortia that broaden access to reactor facilities for research and training it further instructs doe to fund reactor facility renovations with a focus on projects that support development of advanced nuclear technologies or that convert the reactor to using low enriched uranium fuel abilene christian university reactor backed by private funding acu is already preparing to build a salt cooled research reactor to conduct nuclear energy r d the university is working with the university of texas at austin texas a m university and georgia tech on the project and submitted a construction permit application to the nuclear regulatory commission in august it is the first permit application for a new university research reactor in more than 30 years university of illinois reactor the university of illinois urbana champaign is planning to host a micro modular reactor energy system which is a triso fueled high temperature gas reactor designed by ultra safe nuclear corporation the project aims to support research education and demonstrations of microreactor technology and in august it submitted a regulatory engagement plan to nrc as it prepares to apply for a construction permit space applications of fission power make headway an artist s concept of a fission power system on the surface of mars image credit nasa over the last several years nasa and the defense department have been reviving long dormant efforts to deploy reactors beyond the earth fission powered propulsion holds out the promise of more rapid and maneuverable space vehicles while small scale reactors could provide power to astronauts exploring the surface of the moon and eventually mars nuclear thermal propulsion congress has been directing nasa to support the development of nuclear propulsion since fiscal year 2016 and for the past four appropriations cycles it has provided at least 100 million per year for nuclear thermal propulsion ntp specifically last year nasa awarded contracts through idaho national lab to bwxt general atomics and ultra safe each worth 5 million to develop reactor concepts draco the defense advanced research projects agency has been pursuing a similar ntp effort called project draco demonstration rocket for agile cislunar operations and in may solicited proposals for an in space demonstration that would take place in fiscal year 2026 the project s annual budget is currently 37 million and the administration is seeking an increase to 58 million nuclear electric propulsion although nasa has stated it would like to study nuclear electric propulsion nep as a possible alternative to ntp congress has not yet provided funding for it a national academies report concluded last year that the path forward for nep would be more difficult surface power driving toward a reactor that can provide about 40 kilowatts of power on the lunar surface nasa and the doe s national nuclear security administration tested a prototype called kilopower in 2017 and 2018 congress has not yet specifically funded work on surface power but in june nasa awarded three contracts for concept development each worth 5 million to teams led by lockheed martin westinghouse and a joint venture of x energy and the space exploration startup intuitive machines the biden administration sought to zero out funding for nuclear propulsion in fiscal year 2022 and for fiscal year 2023 is seeking 45 million for all space nuclear technologies of which 30 million is for surface power and 15 million is for propulsion speaking at a senate appropriations hearing in may nasa administrator bill nelson explained the white house has been reluctant to support the efforts for years congress has rescued us on the question of nuclear energy in space as a matter of fact not until this year were we able to get the office of management and budget to agree to put albeit a minor amount it s a symbolic amount for nuclear research in space he said before asking the appropriators to consider pouring on the juice commercialization assistance has hit bumps in 2015 doe established the gateway for accelerated innovation in nuclear gain program to provide small businesses with access to expertise and facilities at national labs in order to spur work on advanced nuclear technologies since then congress has taken various steps to expand doe s and the nuclear regulatory commission s support for commercialization of advanced nuclear reactors national reactor innovation center signed into law in 2018 the nuclear energy innovation capabilities act neica directed doe to set up a center to facilitate companies in testing and demonstrating advanced reactor concepts doe established the center in 2019 at idaho national lab and it is currently working toward constructing two reactor testbed facilities and has already launched a virtual testbed marvel idaho national lab is also building a 100 kilowatt sodium potassium cooled microreactor called marvel microreactor applications research validation and evaluation to provide an in house capability for microreactor r d transformational challenge reactor the tcr project at oak ridge national lab was originally billed as an effort to construct a working microreactor using additive manufacturing methods with the ultimate objective of simplifying reactor construction and component certification now though the project has been wound down without completing a reactor and its work has been assimilated into oak ridge s advanced manufacturing and nuclear materials r d programs versatile test reactor through neica doe was directed to build a user facility called the versatile test reactor that would be used to expose materials and components intended for use in advanced reactors to the high energy neutrons those reactors would employ generally companies have had to turn to russia to access to such capabilities however the preliminary cost range estimate for the facility was 2 6 billion to 5 8 billion and doe reported that it would compete for resources with the natrium demonstration which has a similar design congress then zeroed out funding for it in fiscal year 2022 having already appropriated 210 million the biden administration is requesting 45 million for fiscal year 2023 to keep the project on the back burner but house and senate appropriators have responded by continuing to propose no funding licensing reform because advanced reactors depart from traditional reactor designs licensing them presents a potentially serious obstacle to their deployment to address the issue in 2019 congress passed a bill it developed alongside neica called the nuclear energy innovation and modernization act neima which directed nrc to develop processes to expedite advanced reactor licensing doe has previously sought to facilitate licensing of small modular reactors smrs which have similar designs to traditional but larger scale electricity producing reactors however the first smr company to pass through the regulatory process nuscale has still taken almost six years to finalize its design certification and does not anticipate operating its first reactor until 2029 oklo is the first company to initiate an application for an advanced reactor design but in january nrc denied the application stating the company had not supplied requested information oklo has indicated it plans to resubmit r d expanding aside from supporting the development and deployment of advanced reactors doe has also funded earlier stage r d on related technologies and materials office of nuclear energy programs doe r d on advanced reactors is concentrated in the office of nuclear energy particularly what is now called the advanced reactor technologies program which currently has an annual budget of 59 million the program typically funds early stage reactor concepts and r d on specific issues bearing on the design construction licensing and operation of advanced reactors arpa e over the last several years the advanced research projects agency energy has also funded an array of projects related to advanced reactors including through three dedicated programs meitner modeling enhanced innovations trailblazing energy reinvigoration gemina generating electricity managed by intelligent nuclear assets and onwards optimizing nuclear waste and advanced reactor disposal systems basic research in 2018 doe s basic energy sciences bes program established an energy frontier research center led by brookhaven national lab to study the behavior of molten salts and another led by los alamos national lab on how materials behave in nuclear reactors the chips and science act directs bes to establish a dedicated research thrust in foundational nuclear science that is focused on nuclear materials and related subjects with an annual funding target of 50 million pressure on to develop nuclear fuel supplies commercial reactors generally use low enriched uranium leu fuel which is modestly enriched to increase its content of the rare but highly fissile uranium 235 isotope however many advanced reactors are designed to employ high assay leu fuel which contains a higher proportion of u 235 but still not nearly so much as the highly enriched uranium used in naval reactors and some research reactors should adequate haleu fuel supplies not materialize by the time the reactors are ready for operation their deployment could be significantly hampered haleu supply chains doe can produce a limited supply of haleu by downblending highly enriched uranium from its stocks but supplies can only currently be obtained commercially from russia accordingly through the energy act of 2020 congress backed doe efforts to support the development of domestic commercial supplies centrus plant to help establish commercial haleu fuel supplies in 2019 doe awarded a contract to the company centrus to restart a uranium enrichment facility it owns in ohio while the contract has been controversial the project has proceeded apace and last year the facility successfully obtained an nrc license to produce haleu that can be used to fabricate nuclear fuel x energy triso plant in april x energy submitted a license application to nrc for a facility in tennessee that will fabricate haleu into triso fuel it is poised to be the first u s based fabrication facility for haleu fuel of any sort and x energy anticipates it could start production as early as 2025 funding for haleu to prime the pump for commercial haleu fuel production congress is providing 700 million through the inflation reduction act significantly expanding on funding it was already providing through annual appropriations however although uranium has not yet been subjected to sanctions russia s invasion of ukraine has increased the urgency of developing u s supplies the biden administration is therefore requesting that congress use an upcoming stopgap spending bill to immediately provide 1 5 billion to procure supplies of both leu and haleu fuel so as to address potential future shortfalls in access to russian uranium and fuel services

i ve just read yet another critique slagging off the npp government and gabby asare otchere darko where the author appears not to have even bothered to learn anything about our economic situation there are several of this critique from our compatriots here in ghana but when a foreigner who claims to know it all decides to inflict on us his all knowing misdiagnosis of our situation it calls for public concern now let s acquaint ourselves with the very commentary under my critical examination leading member of the new patriotic party npp gabby otchere darko says pres akufo addo deserves praise for his handling of the economy spoiler alert otchere darko must be on another planet today i measure ghana s inflation at a stunning 81 yr the above commentary is attributed to one steve hanke we are told steve hanke is a professor of applied economics at the john hopkins university in the united states of america this stooge who obviously has no knowledge of mere inflation data kept on banging on about pies the shape of pies the depth of pies the different kind of pies and continue to forecast his own monthly inflation figures for ghana his understanding of our economic situation itself without the corresponding data backing it makes absolute nonsense of his works he had the temerity to describe gabby asare otchere darko as someone coming from another planet over his recent tweet that the government needed to be lauded for its handling of the economy the akufo addo govt and in particular mof deserve the nation s commendation for their handling of the economy in these most challenging times despite slump in revenues bills are being paid including salaries roads being fixed money found for programmes like youstart of course unlike steve hanke who sits far away behind his pc typing hogwash gabby asare otchere darko isn t living on another planet he lives right here in ghana and his experiences are that of our political economy and he has led several conversations on the way forward for ghana s economy it just so happens that a few days ago the akufo addo government announced a commercial programme under youstart that will offer a standardized loan product between ghs100 000 and ghs500 000 00 from pfis to cover working capital requirements business expansion needs and the purchase of equipment or machinery by programme beneficiaries the mou between government and pfis will lead to strengthening the links between education and job market stakeholders providing access to finance skills and markets for our young entrepreneurs and growing the capacity of the private sector to create jobs that s exactly what gabby otchere darko was applauding and commending government for quite clearly nobody in the political mainstream is offering solutions that are remotely up to the task of dealing with our situation and so when gabby commends the finance ministry for their bold and decisive interventions he was actually engaging in what is fair and proper indeed this singular initiative has the potential to create huge numbers of jobs revitalising communities across the country and will incredibly open up our economy yes things may not be rosy as we all expect but the akufo addo government has demonstrated that it is capable of getting us out of the current economic situation the world economic outlook isn t the best currently we re facing a global economic crisis and no one knows what to do about it the us federal reserve lifted its cash rate target range by 75bp to 3 to 3 25 on wednesday us time it also indicated it expected increases of as much as another 125bp this year even as fed chairman jerome powell warned of a possible recession the british pound has fallen to its lowest level in decades against the us dollar amid fears over runaway inflation and recession it is clear from the collapse in global stock markets and sliding cryptocurrency values that there s uncertainty shares in the us where the s p 500 index is down by almost a quarter since january have suffered their worst start to a year for 60 years western governments have dipped into their reserves and when that well of cash has run dry borrowed heavily to maintain a stable outlook for their economies we know that an increase in the cost of borrowing in the uk the eurozone and the us which is what we are now witnessing will do nothing to bring down prices in japan the central bank has come under huge pressure to act after the yen tumbled to its lowest level against the dollar since 1998 you d think the likes of steve hanke might want to research the current happenings around the world before they jump on the bandwagon but clearly not when opinion writers and so called academics engage in desperate pedestrian politics i wish that they would come clear on what exactly they seek to propagate steve hanke s behaviour is so shameful and pathetic ernest kofi owusu bempah bonsu deputy director of communications npp

the speech of philippine president ferdinand marcos jr at the 77th session of the united nations general assembly and his bilateral meeting with united states president joe biden could be the highlight of his recent six day working visit in new york but his talks in other less prominent public activities also provided a peek into his thinking and the priorities of his government for example marcos emphasized the role of agriculture in attaining food security during a talk in front of some members of the filipino community in new york you can encourage your young relatives back home to take college courses related to agriculture if you have idle lands in the philippines ask your families to take care of them and help them develop them for agriculture he said the leader also asked his fellow filipinos to reverse the country s brain drain calling on scientists engineers and technical experts to return home and share their expertise to help the country propel forward his message was consistent in all his meetings with american companies business groups and financial institutions he repeatedly assured his audience that the time to invest in the philippines is no longer just sometime in the future it is now his speech at the new york stock exchange sums up his sales pitch to potential investors first we passed legislation to lower corporate income tax rates and rationalize fiscal incentives second we reduced the minimum paid up capital requirements for foreign retailers and foreign startups bringing in advanced new technology and third we now allow full foreign ownership of companies providing public services such as telecommunications shipping air carriers railways subways airports and toll roads he said marcos was indirectly praising the legacy of former president rodrigo duterte since all the reforms he mentioned were done during the term of his predecessor it shows that his presidency represents continuity and that duterte despite his global disrepute for waging a brutal war on drugs paved the way to boost the interest of big business it was during the open forum at an asia society event that marcos articulated some of his thoughts on foreign policy he explained the country s relationship with china in this way the position that the philippines takes is that we have no territorial conflict with china what we have are china claiming territory that belongs to the philippines he added that he seeks to broaden his government s engagement with china instead of simply focusing on the maritime dispute i have always told my chinese friends and i said let us not make our differences concerning maritime like the baselines the economic zones etc let us not make that the defining element of our relationship he said because if that is the only defining if that will be the defining part of our relationship then we are really at a standstill marcos pushed for a stronger role for the association of southeast asian nations asean in tackling matters related to china and he welcomed the quad and aukus as mechanisms that help prevent destabilizing actions in the region he also rejected the use of nuclear weapons as a form of deterrence and called for the reduction of the global stockpile of this type of armament asked about the anti drug campaign marcos said the focus and methodology will change as he directed law enforcement agencies to prioritize drug prevention and rehabilitation he was less direct when he responded to a question about the pending cases against news website rappler and filipino american nobel laureate maria ressa he simply stated that rappler continues to operate and that he cannot interfere in the affairs of the judiciary marcos highlighted the main points of his un speech when he arrived back in the philippines i addressed global issues that require a united global action such as climate change rising food prices rapid technological change the peaceful resolution of international disputes the need to protect the vulnerable sectors of our society such as migrants and ending all forms of prejudice indeed marcos delivered forceful words when he decried climate injustice and vaccine inequity and when he condemned racism and asian hate but for those who watched the live u n session which took place early in the morning manila time there were some who noticed the irony about honduran president xiomara castro denouncing the dictatorship and human rights abuses in her country right before marcos was called to address his fellow leaders marcos father ruled as dictator for two decades before his ouster from power in 1986 marcos believes his state visit to the u s was a success because of the positive response to his call for unity on a global scale what he didn t mention was that the trip served as a symbolic victory for his family because prior to becoming president this year he could not go back to the u s because he has a standing warrant of arrest for contempt of court in hawaii it also went unmentioned in marcos talks and public engagements that his trip coincided with the 50th anniversary of his father s declaration of martial law in the philippines maybe it was deliberately omitted in his speeches because he would have sounded hypocritical for talking about prosperity and openness while denying the lingering negative impact of martial law on the philippine economy and democracy
