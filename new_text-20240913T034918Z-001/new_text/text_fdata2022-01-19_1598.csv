governor offers workforce housing environmental initiatives tax breaks and state debt reduction in 7 7 billion all in budget photo orca media screen shot click here for the video click here for the budget presentation by timothy mcquiston vermont business magazine governor phil scott today delivered his sixth budget address to the general assembly he called this a unique moment in history owing to circumstance and opportunity unprecedented federal funding from arpa in response to the pandemic plus a 400 million state budget surplus scott said we can take advantage of it or squander it vermont s economic future is in our hands he said like his state of the state address two weeks ago the speech was offered remotely at the pavilion building rather than in a ceremony at the state house scott presented a balanced budget of 7 7 billion of which 2 1 billion is for general fund the total state funded budget is 4 7 billion including te education and transportation funds with another 3 billion in federal funds while vermont has balanced its budgets for 30 years there has typically been angst over how to manage potential deficits either with tax hikes or program cuts or both but because of that unprecedented federal investment and the general fund surplus driving by personal income tax growth there is not a deficit problem this year fiscal year 2023 scott said his budget does not raise taxes even while making historic investments to grow and strengthen the workforce give kids more opportunities and help communities recover and thrive into the future he said the 7 7 billion budget presents a once in a generation opportunity to invest in vermont s future while offering tax relief to hundreds of thousands of vermonters in my 21 years in public life there has never been a more transformative moment said governor scott we have within our grasp the chance to combine good ideas thoughtful legislation and unprecedented financial resources into a better brighter future where there are good jobs affordable homes and every community is thriving where every kid is getting the best education whether they go to the largest school or the smallest where families keep more of what they earn and where a healthy and vibrant economy in all 14 counties allows us to protect the vulnerable and invest in the things we care about most my friends the budget i present to you today was built with these outcomes in mind to make the most of this historic moment many of the initiatives are driven by an ongoing workforce shortage which existed before covid 19 and which is exacerbated by it some of these provide money to communities to work on labor issues locally but much of the governor s initiatives are in tax breaks these tax breaks are targeted in a couple different ways for instance student loans will be fully tax deductible other tax incentives are aimed at the earned income tax credit the child and dependent care credit expanding the social security income tax exemption and removing the tax on military pensions tax credits for nurses 1 000 and families with kids in childcare could see their state tax obligation go to zero depending on their income and other circumstances taxes on pensions and veterans which would go to zero would be more in line with what other states are doing which would make vermont more competitive in recruitment and retention of workers for instance in the us 70 percent of veterans retire from the military between the ages of 35 and 50 they can begin receiving benefits after 20 years of service beginning immediately upon retirement this means they are in the middle of their prime earning years not at the end and become sought after workers much of the workforce initiatives are based on affordability and to help with that scott has proposed a total of 250 million for housing especially for middle income vermonters there is also money to refurbish downtown real estate another aspect of the governor s proposal is to spend down or eliminate some state debt in several of scott s proposals he suggests using one time money from either arpa american rescue plan act of 2021 or the budget surplus for one time budget expenditures while this does not include the state pensions proposal brought to the house last week it has similar goals of reducing long term costs the national credit agencies reduced the state s credit rating two years ago in part because of the state s debt load in combination with things like a stagnant workforce scott s budget adjustment would allow the state to retire 22 million of transportation borrowing call another 20 million in general obligation bonds for capital projects and eliminate a 10 million dollar debt in the property management internal service fund the state can also reduce its dependency on borrowing by setting up a fund to pay cash for certain capital projects instead of putting them on the state s credit card the governor said what seems like relatively small appropriations will save the state millions in interest payments in the long run while also freeing up money for ongoing budgets the legislature must pass the actual budget and the governor then can either make it law or veto it governor scott s fy 2023 budget items see full speech below key budget items supports fiscal year 2023 total general fund uses of 2 07 billion fully funds all state retirement and debt service obligations and maintains or exceeds statutory reserve requirements provides over 48 million in tax relief to low and moderate income families critical occupations military retirees and students makes major investments in workforce training and expansion through education internships and outreach expands early care and learning subsidies for families and launches new initiatives to help those suffering from mental illness and addiction upgrades or replaces legacy software and equipment to deliver better more timely information and services one time property tax rebate the total amount will be determined based on school budget votes this year but the projection is that the surplus will be at least 90 million the rebate checks would be sent to residential taxpayers this calendar year likely later this summer after the budget and yield bills are approved workforce expansion our demographic challenges pre date covid but the pandemic has accelerated the outflow from our labor force our most fundamental challenge is the need for more people in our communities and more workers to fill the tens of thousands of jobs available 1 million to enhance the internship program at the department of labor which will expand the reach of these important opportunities for on the job training and allow more employers to support workers as they learn new skills for a fulfilling career another 1 million to support vsac s advancement grants which help adults enroll in training programs for new jobs without the expense of a college degree 2 7 million to build a regional workforce specialist pilot program in 6 areas throughout vermont barre bennington brattleboro burlington rutland and st johnsbury 10 million for tuition assistance which will lower costs for those working towards jobs in the trades such as cdl drivers plumbers welders and craftsmen as well as nurses an additional 1 5 million to vsac s successful 802 opportunity initiative which has helped nearly 1 500 low income vermonters take classes and get training at the community college of vermont for free the added funds will increase eligibility and help many more people learn new skills for good jobs 10 million of additional support to the university of vermont and 5 million of additional support to vermont state colleges in both cases to help lower tuition for college bound vermonters and to help our universities attract future members of our workforce 6 million into the new worker remote worker grant programs which help offset the cost of relocating to vermont another 8 million over the next 3 years to allow a better and more targeted marketing campaign to potential migrants housing we can t tackle our workforce challenge without also tackling our housing shortage after decades of under building the supply of modest priced homes for sale in vermont is practically non existent this is especially true for middle income families looking for affordable homes that meet their needs 5 million in budget adjustment and another 10 million in the fy23 budget from the american rescue plan act coronavirus state fiscal recovery fund arpa to stand up a program that encourages the construction of homes for middle income vermonters another 70 million in arpa funds for mixed income housing to help middle income families and our more vulnerable populations 20 million in arpa funds in the budget adjustment to the vermont housing improvement program which transitions rundown or vacant units into modern livable homes for vermont families 1 million towards a manufactured housing replacement tax credit which will enable the replacement of older less efficient structures with housing that is more comfortable to live in and less costly to maintain 5 million in the budget adjustment to fund a rental risk mitigation pool which will help expand the pool of available housing by encouraging landlords to offer units to the housing insecure tax and payment relief for workers families and retirees to build our workforce and to attract families to our communities vermont must be competitive when it comes to taxes and the cost of living people need to be able to afford to live here with higher revenues from a recovering economy we have a unique opportunity to make progress that vermonters will notice in their wallets increase the earned income tax credit eitc from 36 of the federal credit to 45 of the federal credit this will tie us for the most generous fully refundable eitc in the country the eitc is regarded as one of the best antipoverty measures that encourages workforce participation and directly benefits lower and moderate income families expand the child and dependent care credit cdcc from 24 of the federal credit for most families to 65 of the federal credit for all families this will have a direct impact on families with children 12 million to expand access to affordable and high quality childcare with changes to our child care financial assistance program we can reduce the burden and cost of missed days on parents and providers while giving families more options for care and for summer and afterschool programs boost the income limit on vermont s social security exemption from 45 000 to 75 000 for single filers most states fully exempt social security income from taxation and by increasing the threshold on exempt income vermont would become more affordable for seniors many of whom are on fixed incomes and face a rising cost of living allow all vermonters repaying student loans to deduct all student loan interest on their taxes this would reduce the state tax burden on vermonters who have invested in their futures and are paying significant amounts of student loan interest fully exempt military families retirement income from state taxes and join the 47 other states that don t tax a military pension at full rates provide a tax credit for nurses including rns lnas lpns and aprns to help address the severe shortage of these health care professionals in vermont provide a tax credit for childcare workers to help make vermont more affordable for those who take care of our kids investing in health and safety the covid pandemic has had an impact on our kids and families which extends far beyond our schools after turning a corner with fewer overdose deaths in 2019 sadly the pandemic has led to increases for the last two years it s more than numbers these are parents and children friends and neighbors we need to do more to prevent these casualties and the addictions that lead to them 8 million to strengthen local substance abuse prevention and recovery efforts expand residential treatment options and increase employment services 25 million in budget adjustment to help hospitals and health care providers respond to the pandemic this includes support to stabilize the system and address staffing needs which will increase in patient beds at long term care facilities while freeing up hospital capacity 2 million to add 4 communities to our successful mobile mental health response pilot in rutland which helps people when and where they are in crisis to this add nearly 1 million to our suicide prevention program because law enforcement officers are often the first to respond to a mental health crisis this budget fully funds mental health professionals in all our state police barracks and the budget provides extra funds to the criminal justice council for the tools to update training and entrance testing for candidates move the funding of e 911 into the general fund to stabilize this critical service and invest 11 million to create a more rational system of regional dispatch centers this is something our small communities have urged us to do for years and our workforce crisis makes it necessary creating economically strong and vibrant communities 5 million to expand granting capacity in the vermont outdoor recreation economic collaborative a successful partnership with communities that receive grants to build and upgrade outdoor equipment and trail networks this work often serves as a magnet for tourism and economic development in our rural areas 6 million more to clean up and revitalize brownfields with benefits to the environment and the economy by cleaning up old industrial sites we re taking vacant contaminated properties and making them safe and usable again an extra 2 million to make a total of 5 million in credits available to the downtown and village center tax credit program this popular initiative always over subscribed has helped communities across the state revitalize their town centers with more housing jobs and economic activity 1 million to support an agricultural payment for ecosystem services program an initiative spearheaded by farmers to promote sustainable farming practices soil health and phosphorous reduction another 200 000 to nofa vt to promote food security and farm viability programs leverage new federal funds in transportation to boost investments in paving traffic and safety projects and road construction we ll also be able to do more for public transit bike and pedestrian projects and make progress on longstanding commitments such as the western corridor upgrades that will bring rail service from burlington to rutland and on to new york city good government sometimes it costs money to save money and if resources allow we should make smart investments that will save us money down the road and improve services to vermonters some of these initiatives don t sound exciting but they can have a large impact on the efficiency and the sustainability of state government 20 million in budget adjustment to retire general obligation bonds which will reduce our debt service costs improve vermont s standing with municipal bond investors and free up general fund money to invest in other priorities 22 million in budget adjustment to retire transportation infrastructure bonds which will have the same benefits to the transportation fund as the above while freeing up transportation fund money to match anticipated federal infrastructure grants coming to vermont 30 million to modernize the state s unemployment insurance mainframe and software which will replace a 50 year old system with cloud based technology and support 15 million to upgrade technology in agencies and departments across state government including the agency of administration public safety transportation labor and natural resources transcript of governor scott s budget address january 18 2022 montpelier vermont madam president madam speaker madam pro tem mr chief justice members of the general assembly and fellow vermonters two weeks ago i shared the optimism i have for the opportunity before us in my 21 years in public life there has never been a more transformative moment we have within our grasp the chance to combine good ideas thoughtful legislation and unprecedented financial resources into a better brighter future where there are good jobs affordable homes and every community is thriving where every kid is getting the best education whether they go to the largest school or the smallest where families keep more of what they earn and where a healthy and vibrant economy in all 14 counties allows us to protect the vulnerable and invest in the things we care about most my friends the budget i present to you today was built with these outcomes in mind and to make the most of this historic moment in total this budget invests a record 7 7 billion without raising taxes and in fact returns money to taxpayers but i want to take some time to talk through what this means because it is probably the most complex budget we have ever built it starts with our usual state funds including 2 billion in the general fund 326 million in our transportation fund and 1 9 billion in the education fund we are in the second year of a two year capital bill so while we will propose a few changes the great work of last year will move forward we also start this year with a 234 million general fund surplus and a more than 90 million surplus in the education fund and that s the easy part then we have the coronavirus capital projects fund the infrastructure investment and jobs act funding esser 1 esser 2 esser 3 and hundreds of millions in other one time federal funding as you know last year we received over 1 billion from the american rescue plan act which i proposed splitting into five major initiatives broadband and cell service housing climate change mitigation water sewer and stormwater infrastructure and economic recovery you worked with me to fund about half of this proposal and although some arpa dollars went to other initiatives last year i will ask you to follow through on the commitment you made to invest what s left in the transformative and tangible infrastructure projects i originally proposed because we have to remember this is one time economic recovery money it is imperative we use it to achieve economic equity from region to region not as a band aid on something we will have to address again next year and not for initiatives that do not make the most of this moment we cannot squander this opportunity or let our legacy be defined by future deficits or higher taxes and that s not just with arpa we need to use these principles through the entire budget because after years of hard work to close large funding gaps we find ourselves at a pivotal time with money to make a real difference if we are going to be successful we must be disciplined that means making decisions we know will give us the best return on investment things like lowering debt and using one time funds for one time expenses to solve urgent needs and long term challenges if we stay focused we will strengthen our fiscal foundation so our economy grows in every county leaving vermont our families and our communities in far better financial shape than we found them for example as i have done every year my budget fully funds our retirement obligations with a total payment of 394 million to reduce long term debt i propose we retire 22 million of transportation borrowing and payoff another 20 million in general obligation bonds for capital projects this will save taxpayers millions in interest payments in the years to come and we will eliminate a 10 million debt in our property management internal service fund something you may not have ever heard of but we have been carrying this deficit since the dean administration we can also reduce our dependency on borrowing by setting up a fund to pay cash for certain capital projects instead of putting it on the public s credit card this would free up money that we now pay in interest in a normal year we might have to choose between addressing deficits and debt or investing to grow the economy and revitalize our communities but that is just not the case this year because even after taking care of the essentials we still have resources to address our desperate need for more people in our communities and more workers to fill the tens of thousands of jobs available in vermont today take a moment to think about the data since february 2020 we have lost 24 000 people from our workforce that 24 000 is larger than the population of every city and town in vermont other than burlington it is bigger than some counties it s greater than the populations of williamstown johnson highgate hartland pownal underhill and hyde park combined 24 000 is more workers than in the construction and lodging sectors put together this is a massive piece of our economy and we all see the now hiring signs reduced hours at local businesses and shortages in healthcare and public safety every sector in every region is feeling the pressure there are 23 000 jobs open in vermont today that s nearly 7 of the jobs in our economy pre pandemic if we don t work to solve this problem now it will be there down the road in the future and it will be much bigger and more complex future governors and legislators will have to make decisions that are regressive like slashing services and raising taxes and fees to balance budgets but if we make it our top priority this session we can take full advantage of the opportunity before us to reverse these trends and secure the brighter future we all want to build let s start by helping more workers with internships and training first i ll add 1 million to the state s internship program assisting employers with wages and supporting workers who are learning new skills for a future career we ll add another 1 million to vsac s advancement grants which help adults enroll in training programs without the expense of a college degree and put people into careers with higher wages like lnas emts line workers and web programmers and we can improve how we connect employers with career and technical education students and others looking for work right now resources are spread across different partners opportunities are missed and positions go unfilled a unified approach using local experts to help navigate the system will put more vermonters into available jobs that s why my budget invests 2 7 million to pilot this workforce network in barre bennington brattleboro burlington rutland and st johnsbury and if it works we should expand it statewide we all know there is an urgent need in healthcare which is why i asked for 15 million in budget adjustment to keep more nurses here and directed 18 million in existing funds to train retain and recruit healthcare and mental health workers you will also see a tax credit for nurses as well as childcare workers in the tax relief package i will talk about in a few minutes but as i have said before if we don t focus on the trades we won t have people to maintain our hospitals transport goods build homes pave roads or do the work we need to support our communities so my budget dedicates 10 million to reduce education costs for those working towards jobs in the trades like cdl drivers plumbers and welders as well as a nursing degree and we are using half a million dollars of federal aid given to the agency of education last year to begin offering courses at some cte centers this will give students the skills they need to enter the electric aviation and electric vehicle sectors setting them up for high paying careers with some of vermont s most innovative employers i know looking beyond our borders to recruit new vermonters is not always a popular conversation but it is a tool we can t ignore remember those 23 000 open positions the truth is we just don t have enough people to fill them and because our workforce is aging more and more vermonters are retiring every day we all know employers need a strong workforce to grow and create jobs which communities need to thrive as i have noted before we don t need more taxes we need more taxpayers so today i am asking you to invest more in the new and remote worker incentive program and to make some changes because the bill passed last year left out in demand workers like nurse practitioners police officers and electricians this program has paid for itself with tax dollars from those who move here plus the money they spend buying homes and cars shopping in stores going to restaurants and more this incentive helps but we need to do more to sell ourselves so i am proposing a regional network to help recruit and relocate workers and families to vermont this will build on accd s stay to stay model which created a partnership of rdcs and local chambers of commerce and they have been quietly bringing in new vermonters for the past three years i have seen the results firsthand when matt and jessica bernhardt bumped into me at the state house while here on vacation from south carolina they told me they loved vermont and one day hoped to live here so we connected them to the relocation team and four months later we had two new residents in warren and a new designer at a local architecture firm but without enough funding or marketing this initiative is not living up to its potential to really move the needle we have got to think bigger so my budget dedicates 8 5 million to this program over the next three years it will put the horsepower of modern marketing behind it so we can welcome more new vermonters across the state to fill our most needed jobs and this is where housing comes in even with all we have invested over the last five years we are still not building enough this is especially true for middle income families looking for affordable homes right now the supply of modestly priced homes for sale is practically non existent as of december the median home price was more than 369 000 as of last week according to the vermont association of realtors there were only 136 homes for sale that a middle income family can afford and only five in chittenden county this is the middle income housing shortage we are talking about here is an example we heard from a teacher in her mid 50s who has been searching for a home near her new job after several months without finding something in her price range and her current lease coming to an end she reached out to us in frustration because she does not feel we have done enough to help vermonters like her and she s right so we must do more using arpa funds between baa and this budget i propose 15 million to encourage the construction of homes for middle income vermonters like this teacher and with another 25 million for vhip we can continue to transform rundown or vacant units into livable homes to see how well this program is working just ask any of the families who have moved from homelessness into newly renovated apartments across the state from brattleboro to bennington springfield to rutland barre to lyndonville and beyond and we should invest another 105 million for affordable mixed income housing we need to put this money to work for working families they are depending on us and with some creativity and these historic resources we can make this happen we also need to compete with other states when it comes to tax burden and costs of living with a surplus in our base budget we can make changes that vermonters will notice in their wallets the 50 million progressive tax relief package i propose includes exempting military families retirement income from state taxes something nearly every other state already does in some way this package will build on the progress we made in 2018 by exempting more retirees from income tax on their social security and further increasing the earned income tax credit which helps low income workers and we can help young workers and families with a student loan interest deduction and an increase to the child and dependent care credit here is what this relief package can do for a retired couple with an adjusted gross income of less than 65 000 including social security and a military pension they will go from owing about 1 000 dollars in state income tax to zero a single early childhood educator making 18 dollars an hour won t have to pay a dime of vermont income tax and no young worker will pay taxes on their student loan interest if you work with me to pass this package we will help tens of thousands of vermonters keep more of what they earn and with a 90 million surplus in the education fund we can provide property taxpayers a rebate on what they overpaid so let s return half of this surplus 45 million to vermonters this year and let s agree on how best to use the other half to equip our tech centers to support more students with more courses and more skills for 21st century jobs because this is the time to get creative to think big and to point students towards trades training and the lucrative careers it leads to on top of the cte initiatives i have already talked about we will use existing federal funds to encourage more students to choose this path and let s use remote learning tools to make it easier for cte students to participate in on the job opportunities during the day better integrating and normalizing trades training and tech ed is an area of tremendous importance to me and to our state and i look forward to working with you on this essential reform of our education system in addition investing more in the university of vermont will strengthen our workforce each year over 1 000 new skilled workers come out of uvm to fill vermont jobs in key areas like nursing agriculture and engineering more than half of them came from other states but decided to stay and i think it s important to note that uvm hasn t raised tuition in three years in order to help students so for the first time in 14 years i am asking to increase uvm s base budget by 10 million our state colleges are equally important to our communities and workforce so it s critical for the system to continue to adapt in our last two budgets we appropriated 183 million to the vermont state colleges they also received more than 40 million in direct payments from the feds this year i dedicated another 5 million to their base budget for a total of more than 41 million to put this in perspective this is 16 million higher than it was in 2017 when my administration proposed the most significant base increase the state colleges had seen in nearly a decade and we should continue the successful 802 opportunity initiative which has already helped nearly 1 500 low income vermonters take classes and get training at ccv for free if we add another 1 5 million we can increase eligibility so that more vermonters can learn the skills they need for good jobs we also need to do more for our kids in their earliest years so let s continue our work to expand access to affordable and high quality childcare with changes to our childcare financial assistance program with an additional 12 million we can reduce the burden of missed days on parents and providers and give families more options for care and for summer and afterschool programs it would also reduce expenses for these families for example two parents making 58 000 a year with two young kids in childcare could save nearly 3 000 a year just imagine what that could mean for these families turning now to prek 12 this has been one of the most turbulent stretches we have faced there is no doubt it has been difficult but we will get through it we are going to continue to help school districts respond to the current environment so we can keep kids in the classroom and i want to thank everyone involved for continuing to put our kids first i know schools are not in recovery mode yet but that time will come very soon and we must be ready to focus fully on reversing social emotional and academic losses fortunately nearly 400 million in federal esser funds have been dedicated to prek 12 which is on top of the nearly 2 billion we invest each year much of this money has gone directly to schools the agency of education is also partnering with them to help students by strengthening mental health services and increasing afterschool and summer camp offerings and this year we will do more to reverse academic losses by providing additional learning resources to schools and families but one size is not going to fit all we need to continue to be nimble and responsive to changes and as with all aspects of our pandemic response we need to work together to apply what we learn to make our education system even better and more resilient for the months and years ahead as i said two weeks ago the impact of pandemic measures necessary before vaccines were available extended far beyond our schools so we also need to stabilize and strengthen the systems that support vermonters health and well being to do that we have included 25 million to support hospitals and providers as we continue to respond to the pandemic helping to stabilize the system and address staffing needs which will increase in patient beds at long term care facilities freeing up hospital capacity last year we piloted a mobile mental health response initiative in rutland which helps people when and where they are in crisis this is making a real difference so we will build on it with nearly 2 million more to serve four additional communities we will also strengthen our suicide prevention program by adding nearly 1 million in funding and with the money in the capital bill we should finish the residential facility in chittenden county by the end of this year my budget also increases investment for child and social services to help prevent kids from entering this system in the first place and to better care for them when they do isolation and other challenges created by the pandemic also affected the opioid crisis after seeing fewer overdose deaths in 2019 sadly we have seen increases for the last two years these are parents and children friends and neighbors we need to do more to prevent these tragedies and the addictions that led to them so i propose 8 million more to strengthen local prevention and recovery efforts expand residential treatment options and increase employment services this work to keep communities healthy is directly connected to keeping them safe law enforcement officers work hard to serve vermonters and often are first to respond when someone is having a mental health crisis and they are essential to ending the opioid epidemic so my budget will continue to place mental health professionals in all our state police barracks we also fund the criminal justice training council s request for tools to modernize entry testing for candidates as well as training we should also support e 911 and move it to the general fund which will stabilize this critical service and with 11 million over three years we can create a more rational system of regional dispatch centers this is something our small communities have urged us to do for years and the fact is our workforce crisis makes it necessary our collaborative work on justice reinvestment has helped strengthen our criminal justice system these efforts have helped to reduce vermont s out of state prison population saving 1 2 million we can invest those savings into domestic violence prevention and intervention improving our data systems as well as testing better models for transitional housing and care for offenders with mental health needs with this work we will continue making progress toward fair and just treatment of all vermonters our efforts to combat climate change and protect our waterways are also essential to public health and safety so i propose a 216 million package to address climate change and community resiliency we will invest in things that reduce emissions and make our communities stronger like electric vehicle infrastructure and incentives weatherization hazard mitigation and system upgrades to ensure we can better manage and store our clean energy these initiatives will make us safer and move us closer to our climate goals in a way that diversifies the green economy importantly rather than overwhelming vermonters with mandates they can t afford we will include them in this work and just like our housing and climate change packages i am asking you to follow through on your commitment to support arpa funded proposals for connectivity water sewer and stormwater infrastructure and economic recovery last year we made progress on our plan to bring high speed internet to those who had been left behind or were underserved but there is much more to do so let s invest another 95 million from arpa and commit 100 million coming from the iija to continue this work and we have a 51 million plan that would install up to 100 cell towers throughout vermont because just like broadband if we want to keep and attract young workers and families wireless service is essential in addition i propose 72 million more for water sewer and stormwater infrastructure i get it for many these initiatives don t sound all that exciting but the fact is they benefit vermont in many ways from clean drinking water to protecting our lakes and rivers to helping some of our smallest communities add much needed housing jobs and services and with this funding we can make a big difference in many small communities the reality is we need to get creative especially in regions that never fully recovered from our last economic crisis and now face an even steeper climb so i propose 30 million to encourage revitalization in the regions that need it most with a new grand list enhancement grant we can use grand list value as a way to target investment to those areas let s also advance an initiative that has been stalled for the last two years finally adding a project based approach to tifs tifs have made a big difference in northwestern vermont so let s give smaller communities the same access as bigger towns and we have to make sure arpa dollars continue to help businesses and non profits survive and recover keeping jobs in our state and supporting the employers vital to our communities as i said in my state of the state our new capital investment grant program received applications far beyond what we had available for funding last year so let s put 50 million more towards it and let s create a 20 million short term loan initiative modeled after the small business administration s paycheck protection program for those businesses and non profits that do not have enough working capital due to the pandemic when you put all these arpa funded initiatives together it can really transform communities bringing economic equity to parts of our state that have been ignored for far too long this is the only way we can build back better and stronger than before and that is exactly what president biden has said he wants this federal money to do and let s do more in the general fund by investing in tried and tested programs that will help all our regions recover and thrive long into the future i think most of us would agree that outdoor recreation is one of our state s biggest advantages this is why i propose putting 5 million into the vermont outdoor recreation economic collaborative so more communities can use these assets to strengthen their local economies vorec s grant program has helped many regions across the state like the waterfront recreation trail in newport or rockingham s trail connection to bellows falls and marketing for poultney s growing trail network our brownfields initiatives are also helping communities as well as the environment which is why for the first time ever we invested 25 million in state funds last year by cleaning up these old industrial sites we are taking vacant contaminated properties and making them safe and usable again to revitalize a region when you look at what has been done like the brownsville butcher pantry or the albany general store it is easy to see what an impact this essential program has made so we should add another 6 million this year our downtown and village center tax credit program has helped communities across the state revitalize with more housing jobs and economic activity and i know the legislature has supported this as well so this year let s not only boost our annual investment to 5 million but let s make the neighborhoods that surround these village centers eligible as well this program has often been the spark to bring downtowns and village centers back to life and with this change we can ignite more growth pushing it out further into these communities finally let s increase funding for municipal planning grants so our smallest communities have the opportunity and the resources to design the future that is right for them with the increase in federal funding for transportation infrastructure we will be able to do a lot more this year by leveraging state dollars to pull down an additional 71 9 million in federal funds my budget includes an increase of 38 3 million for paving for a total of 158 8 million which is the highest investment in paving the state has ever seen it has increases of 37 for traffic and safety projects 38 for road construction and 60 for bridges it invests over 81 million in town programs from bridges and roads to disaster assistance and grants we will also do more for public transit and bike and ped projects in areas like arlington chester moretown royalton and winooski and it will allow us to make progress on long standing commitments like the western corridor upgrades that will bring rail service from burlington to rutland and on to new york city this work is another great example of how we can use these historic federal funds to make major improvements which will have a lasting impact in our communities and on our future now bringing what may be one of the longest budget addresses in history to a close let me conclude by bringing us back to where we started we ve all seen proposals large and small that could make a real difference but they fall by the wayside because we didn t have the resources to fund them that is just not the case today it is not an exaggeration to say that the opportunity before us is truly historic it s once in a lifetime and one i never expected to see happen there is absolutely no doubt that the economic future of our state will be defined by what we do today think about that vermont s economic future is in our hands will we do what we ve always done and keep getting what we ve been getting or will we embrace the vision of prosperity and security for every county every community and every family that s well within our reach today we stand together at an historic intersection of both unexpected circumstance and tremendous opportunity the fact is as citizens elected to lead we are the only people who can deliver on the full potential of this moment this also makes us the only people who could squander it so my fellow vermonters here s my ask of each and every one of you let s do our very best to make sure that every negotiation every decision and every investment withstands the test of time and meets this extraordinary moment because we will not get a second chance january 18 2022 1 pm montpelier www vermont gov
seven is often seen as a lucky number but not this time the consumer price index is up 7 in december from december 2020 that s the highest rate of annual increase in inflation in almost 40 years since june of 1982 even core prices if you exclude volatile items like food and energy even then still the fastest pace of increase in almost 31 years and what today s report tells us i think just validates what millions of households already knew and that is inflation is a problem prices are going up and they re going up pervasively and they re going up at a rate that outpaces growth and household income in many cases food prices are up over 6 energy prices up over 29 and shelter costs which tend to lag already up over 4 year over a year and i think that s the one to watch in the months ahead the federal reserve had what i would describe as a very lazy faire attitude toward inflation in 2021 and only at the end of the year did they really get the memo that this is a problem and as a result we ve seen them pivot very quickly in terms of how they view it and how they plan to address it specifically we will see the feds start to raise short term interest rates they re likely to start that as soon as march and around that time or shortly thereafter they will not only stop buying bonds and adding to their portfolio they will start letting the size of that portfolio shrink letting it run off that has the effect of pulling liquidity out of the system so even though that happens behind the scenes i think that s arguably the more significant item both of those will slow the demand side of the economy over time but they re not going to address nor fix the issues with the supply chain advertisement peloton is hiking prices because of inflation share copy link copy peloton says inflation and supply chain challenges have forced the company to hike the price of its flagship bike just five months after cutting it drastically to boost sagging sales beginning jan 31 customers will be required to pay 250 for delivery and setup for peloton s 1 495 bike a service that the company previously included in the price customers buying peloton s tread treadmills will be charged a 350 fee for delivery and installation starting later this month with these fees the price of the bike in the united states will jump to 1 745 and the peloton tread will soon cost 2 845 peloton also said it will hike the base price of both pieces of equipment for customers in the united kingdom germany and australia although it will continue to include delivery and setup for no extra charge peloton said in a statement that continued constraints are driving up costs a complaint echoed by companies across several industries like many other businesses peloton is being impacted by global economic and supply chain challenges that are affecting the majority if not all businesses worldwide it said even with these increases we believe we still offer the best value in connected fitness and offer consumers various financing options that make peloton accessible to a wide audience the 2 495 price of its higher end bike will remain the same and will continue to include delivery and setup at no extra charge peloton reduced the price of its bike by roughly 20 in august 2021 to jumpstart sales it tried to keep up with the breakneck pace of 2020 when the company s products skyrocketed in popularity as gyms closed and people were forced to work out at home but a massive tread recall gyms reopening and unfortunate cameo on hbo s sex and the city sequel made peloton s 2021 rougher than it had expected peloton revealed in its most recent earnings report that sales of its stationary bikes and treadmills fell 17 those two machines are the company s bread and butter making up 60 of its business peloton shares fell nearly 3 in premarket trading and the stock is down 80 over the past year
the us supreme court today weighed the fate of a painting by camille pissarro looted by the nazis in 1939 and currently on display at a gallery in spain the 1897 painting rue saint honore in the afternoon effect of rain like some other works by the french impressionist is at the heart of a long legal battle with international ramifications the painting now estimated to be worth around 30 million once belonged to lilly cassirer neubauer a member of a prominent german jewish family alamy stock photo alamy stock photo neubauer was forced to hand it over for a pittance to the nazis in 1939 in exchange for the visa which allowed her to leave germany the neubauer family lost track of the painting after world war ii and accepted compensation of 13 000 from the german government in 1958 but did not waive their rights to the artwork the painting changed hands several times in the ensuing decades before ending up with the thyssen bornemisza museum in madrid it was acquired in 1976 by baron hans heinrich thyssen bornemisza heir to the thyssen industrial group from the stephen hahn gallery in new york advertisement claude cassirer neubauer s grandson discovered in 2000 that the painting was on display in madrid and launched legal efforts in spain and california to recover it cassirer died in 2010 at the age of 89 but his children david and ana have pursued the court challenges after suffering defeats in courts in spain and california the supreme court represents their final hope the highest us court will decide whether spanish law or us state law applies in the case under spanish property law a purchaser is not required to return an item if it was not known at the time that it may have had illegal origins and they have possessed it for at least six years at no point were the baron s title to the painting nor his good faith in its acquisition called into question according to a statement by the museum under california law a looted or stolen item cannot be passed on even if it was purchased in good faith the court heard technical arguments today as to which law should apply and is expected to render its decision in several months the nazis are estimated to have plundered some 600 000 artworks in europe according to a us congressional report and courts on both sides of the atlantic have regularly heard cases designed to restore items to their original owners afp 2022

seven is often seen as a lucky number but not this time the consumer price index is up 7 in december from december 2020 that s the highest rate of annual increase in inflation in almost 40 years since june of 1982 even core prices if you exclude volatile items like food and energy even then still the fastest pace of increase in almost 31 years and what today s report tells us i think just validates what millions of households already knew and that is inflation is a problem prices are going up and they re going up pervasively and they re going up at a rate that outpaces growth and household income in many cases food prices are up over 6 energy prices up over 29 and shelter costs which tend to lag already up over 4 year over a year and i think that s the one to watch in the months ahead the federal reserve had what i would describe as a very lazy faire attitude toward inflation in 2021 and only at the end of the year did they really get the memo that this is a problem and as a result we ve seen them pivot very quickly in terms of how they view it and how they plan to address it specifically we will see the feds start to raise short term interest rates they re likely to start that as soon as march and around that time or shortly thereafter they will not only stop buying bonds and adding to their portfolio they will start letting the size of that portfolio shrink letting it run off that has the effect of pulling liquidity out of the system so even though that happens behind the scenes i think that s arguably the more significant item both of those will slow the demand side of the economy over time but they re not going to address nor fix the issues with the supply chain advertisement peloton is hiking prices because of inflation share copy link copy peloton says inflation and supply chain challenges have forced the company to hike the price of its flagship bike just five months after cutting it drastically to boost sagging sales beginning jan 31 customers will be required to pay 250 for delivery and setup for peloton s 1 495 bike a service that the company previously included in the price customers buying peloton s tread treadmills will be charged a 350 fee for delivery and installation starting later this month with these fees the price of the bike in the united states will jump to 1 745 and the peloton tread will soon cost 2 845 peloton also said it will hike the base price of both pieces of equipment for customers in the united kingdom germany and australia although it will continue to include delivery and setup for no extra charge peloton said in a statement that continued constraints are driving up costs a complaint echoed by companies across several industries like many other businesses peloton is being impacted by global economic and supply chain challenges that are affecting the majority if not all businesses worldwide it said even with these increases we believe we still offer the best value in connected fitness and offer consumers various financing options that make peloton accessible to a wide audience the 2 495 price of its higher end bike will remain the same and will continue to include delivery and setup at no extra charge peloton reduced the price of its bike by roughly 20 in august 2021 to jumpstart sales it tried to keep up with the breakneck pace of 2020 when the company s products skyrocketed in popularity as gyms closed and people were forced to work out at home but a massive tread recall gyms reopening and unfortunate cameo on hbo s sex and the city sequel made peloton s 2021 rougher than it had expected peloton revealed in its most recent earnings report that sales of its stationary bikes and treadmills fell 17 those two machines are the company s bread and butter making up 60 of its business peloton shares fell nearly 3 in premarket trading and the stock is down 80 over the past year
speaker krowinski senate president pro tem balint joint statement following governor scott s budget address vermont business magazine today house speaker jill krowinski and senate president pro tem becca balint issued the following statement on governor scott s budget address we are grateful to see that there are many areas of agreement between the governor s proposed budget and our vision for delivering for vermont s working families this session our vision for investing in vermont s future is a reflection of our values and a belief that we can create more equitable communities for all that live and visit our great state our vision is informed by the conversations we had with over 1 400 vermonters this fall as part of the investing in vermont s future public engagement effort today we are pleased to release the final report summarizing those conversations and elevating the insights and priorities of vermonters which will help ensure our work is informed by a broad range of individuals and reflective of what they are experiencing in their day to day lives you can explore these findings at we heard from working vermont families young vermonters the refugee community and others who are desperate for action to address the housing crisis we look forward to building on last year s historic investments in housing and continuing the effort to address the crisis at every level from emergency transitional housing to affordable rentals houses that first time buyers can afford and housing with support services for seniors and people in recovery a key priority for us and one we have worked on together before is extending the deadline for emergency housing and making sure that we are keeping people housed during the coldest days of the years we know that the workforce crisis is impacting all sectors of the economy but that it is particularly difficult among the professions that keep our families and communities running in recognition of this the house appropriations committee doubled the governor s proposal in the budget adjustment to 60m for staff retention related payments to shore up critical provider systems for assisted living residences nursing homes residential care homes home health agencies designated and specialized service agencies substance use treatment providers and recovery centers we look forward to doing similar work to prioritize our frontline care workers in the fy23 budget and we re grateful to see the governor is proposing further funding of some of the critical workforce investments that the legislature built into last year s budget throughout our listening tour vermonters clearly stated that one of the best ways we can invest is to get money directly into the hands of vermonters facing incredible challenges at this moment we applaud the governor for considering progressive tax relief that would help do that we need to dig into the details but at face value his proposal seems to offer a little relief here and a little there the legislature is interested in doing something more significant and focused that will help a broad swath of working families we will be looking into how our state might build on the success of the federal child tax credit to offer direct financial support to struggling families as we know it is an incredibly impactful way to support households another way we can provide support to vermont workers and to all taxpayers is by taking advantage of this moment to ensure the stability of our public pensions system while the governor s budget does not reflect the recent framework agreement from the pension task force we re glad his administration has signaled they are willing to work with us to build this plan into the budget the legislature is ready to invest an additional 200 million to shore up the system this year and increase annual contributions to pension and other retirement benefits such as health care in the future the agreement we ve struck with our hardworking teachers and state employees will protect the public pension system and put it on a path of sustainability additionally these changes are expected to result in reducing the state s unfunded liabilities by 2 billion dollars which is incredibly important for our long term financial picture the pandemic has taken a toll on all of us and we know that so many vermonters are exhausted and looking for support in their day to day lives we have seen the tremendous demand for mental health services with hospital emergency rooms becoming crowded with individuals looking for support in a time of crisis we will look at our continuum of care and find ways to not only invest in our current community health system but look at adding resources in services such as peer support counseling and housing we have also seen the toll of the pandemic reflected in the staggering number of overdose deaths this past year isolation and the temporary pause in services available was incredibly difficult and too many vermonters lives have been lost we will work with service providers and those with lived experience to help inform how we can best support vermonters in crisis we know that there are other investments that need to be made today in order to secure a healthy safer more resilient future we will also be looking to make major investments in fighting climate change and reducing our carbon footprint advancing clean water initiatives and continuing to invest in immediate response to the covid 19 pandemic and our long term recovery we must be diligent to ensure the legislation we pass creates greater equity for all vermonters and communities that welcome and support each other as we grow into the 21st century the house and senate look forward to working with the governor and his administration to deliver a balanced budget that meets the needs of vermont s families we are certain that we can find collaborative solutions to support our families and communities and make investments that will have ripple effects for generations to come vermont house and senate republican leaders react to governor scott s budget address vermont house minority leader pattie mccoy r poultney and vermont senate minority leader randy brock r franklin released the following statement regarding governor phil scott s budget address vermont s greatest challenges are our demographic trends and stagnating workforce said representative mccoy vermont house and senate republicans echo governor scott s focus in his budget address on making investments to both retain existing workers and recruit new workers to our state these initiatives complement new efforts by republicans in the legislature to waive occupational licensing fees and expand licensing recognition for workers moving to vermont hand in hand with attracting workers to vermont is ensuring they can afford to live here long term legislative republicans are encouraged by the governor s proposals for new housing construction using federal dollars robust tax relief measures and targeted loan forgiveness in critical sectors of our economy added senator brock we are eager to partner with the governor in these areas including with legislation to modernize housing regulations and ease the burden of act 250 we cannot forget the fact that younger vermonters have borne a great deal of the burden during the covid 19 pandemic noted representative mccoy governor scott s focus on tuition relief child care affordability and after school programs will improve outcomes for our kids and help working families across our state governor scott s budget address lays the framework for a fiscally responsible path built upon a stronger workforce safe and healthy communities supporting our younger vermonters and improving good governance said senator brock we look forward to working with the governor and his team to advance our shared goals across the finish line this legislative session statement of vermont chamber on governor s budget address the following statement can be attributed to vermont chamber of commerce president betsy bishop we are encouraged by the governor s significant emphasis on workforce development in today s remarks and the commitment to a number of shared priorities to address the biggest challenge facing vermont of the 2022 vermont chamber priorities issued prior to the legislative session each area of investment would play a key role to address vermont s demographic challenge the strong economic future of our state and the viability of our workforce depends on our ability to invest in vermonters and attract a diverse new population many initiatives presented today recognize this dual need investments in childcare and housing particularly in the available stock for the missing middle are vital for vermont to grow and retain our workforce additionally relocation initiatives and the strengthening of trade education are essential efforts to secure a strong future for vermont jack hoffman public asset institute statement on governor phil scott s budget address governor phil scott urged legislators tuesday to make rebuilding vermont s labor force a top priority this session the labor force was down by 24 000 since february 2020 the governor said before laying out a laundry list of investments from both federal and state funds to boost training incentives and job opportunities to attract more workers vermont s labor force had been declining before the pandemic so the governor is right to focus on the problem early in his budget address but the solution to the current labor shortage is not all about workers the governor could have reminded employers that they have a role too we now get monthly data on the number of job openings in vermont but we don t know anything about where those jobs are or how much they pay the state doesn t collect and publish this data but from national data and news reports we have learned that workers are not only seeking higher wages they re tired of dead end jobs workers can clearly benefit from more and better training but they deserve quality jobs opportunities in return we don t think the governor exaggerated when he said there is absolutely no doubt that the economic future of our state will be defined by what we do today more than 10 billion in federal funding to fight covid 19 and stimulate the state economy is at least a once in a generation opportunity but we would like to have heard more about the governor s vision for vermont and its residents that would result from investing all of this federal largesse what are his goals our goals for racial social and economic equity and how will be know if we ve made progress aly richards ceo of let s grow kids let s grow kids is aligned with governor scott on the importance of prioritizing the recovery and growth of vermont s workforce and the essential role of a stable child care system to support our economy gov scott s proposed investments and changes to the child care financial assistance program as well as his proposal for child care tax credits are positive steps towards making child care more affordable and in supporting our early childhood educators but let s be clear we have a lot of work left to solve the child care emergency we are facing as a state currently 71 of vermont child care centers are experiencing staffing shortages and even before the pandemic 65 of vermont s youngest children didn t have access to the care they needed in addition to yesterday s recommendations we must do more to address the workforce crisis that is pushing our child care system to the edge of collapse that will require both short term workforce stabilization dollars to prevent sweeping program closures throughout the state and long term investments from a dedicated revenue source to create a child care system that works for all vermonters we appreciate the governor s focus on workforce and the need to reverse our demographic trend by retaining the workers we have and encouraging thousands more to come to vermont that vision is only possible with a stable child care workforce and a high quality and affordable child care system let s grow kids and our 35 000 supporters throughout the state are ready to roll up our sleeves alongside state lawmakers and gov scott s administration to work towards a vermont in which all children have equitable access to early childhood education families are able to work and thrive and early childhood educators receive wages and benefits that reflect their true value and expertise vsac response to the governor s budget address the vermont student assistance corp vsac thanks governor phil scott for his leadership and support and for recognizing that making a strong commitment to expanding educational and training opportunities in vermont is essential to addressing our state s demographic challenge vermont s workforce development affordable higher education more internships opportunities and renewed emphasis on trades training for vermonters are critical to build the vermont economy of the future said scott giles vsac president ceo initiatives led by vsac including 802 opportunity and advancements grants have proven very successful investing wisely in these programs create huge dividends for vermont families and for the vermont economy vsac highlights workforce recruitment and retention 10 million to reduce education costs for those working towards jobs in the trades like cdl drivers plumbers and welders including 3 million to help students attain a nursing degree

leeba ruth lessin was a giant in the healthcare industry prior to her untimely death in january 2021 leeba lessin last january healthcare lost of one its most original thinkers in leeba lessin from 2006 to 2015 leeba led caremore the pre eminent integrated health plan and provider organization focused on addressing the needs of high cost high need patients for years caremore has been regarded as a model for the future of healthcare many of the current crop of startups focused on improving care for the elderly devoted oak street landmark alignment and others drew inspiration and talent from caremore now part of anthem inc i met leeba in 2014 when she was looking for someone to succeed her when she retired from caremore i had heard of caremore but i hadn t heard of leeba when i first met her it was clear to me that i was in the presence of someone special someone who saw the world with uncommon clarity who operated with an unshakeable moral compass and whose big intellect was only eclipsed by her massive heart when i was offered the opportunity to work with her i left behind an established life on the east coast and moved to california to learn from her and learn from her i did over the course of the next several years leeba became one of my best friends and closest mentors i ve had the privilege to work with many notable healthcare leaders but none have been more influential in my life when leeba told me that she d been diagnosed with the cancer that eventually took her life one of my first thoughts was that she needed to write a book i wanted her thinking to outlive her unfortunately she never had a chance to write that book but before she passed away i promised her that i would share the lessons she d taught me with others carry it all forward she told me in the days preceding her death and so i am here are some of the lessons she taught me in fee for service healthcare everyone profits when patients are sicker leeba was frustrated by the notion that the us healthcare system s profit pools are based upon people being sick when a patient is sick doctors bill for visits hospitals bill for procedures home health vendors bill for in home visits pharmaceutical companies bill for drugs durable medical equipment suppliers bill for their goods whereas some think the way to change profit motives in healthcare is to nationalize the system leeba instead thought the solution lay in long term global capitation arrangements where every party at every point along the healthcare delivery pipeline has an incentive to keep patients healthier on this front leeba was no hypocrite she implemented global capitation arrangements at caremore and demanded a cost consciousness among her team members for leeba saving even pennies was part of the mission capitation is freedom not risk global capitation is the payment model by which healthcare organizations are paid a per person fee to manage all of a patient s healthcare expenses many healthcare organizations refer to accepting global capitation as taking risk because the organization is at risk for all of the medical expenses incurred in order to provide care to the patient the truth is many physicians and hospital systems are uneasy about capitation because they don t want the pressure of assuming financial risk for patient care in leeba s view this framing was all wrong capitation is freedom not risk she used to say capitation enables physicians and health systems to make necessary investments in order to manage costs at caremore when we learned a patient didn t have a refrigerator in which to store insulin we bought her a fridge when patients missed medical appointments because they couldn t find rides to their doctors offices we paid for rides refrigerators and lyfts are much cheaper than untreated diabetes and missed doctors appointments leeba believed that far too many organizations avoid capitation out of fear of risk instead she insisted they should view it instead as the freedom finally to do what s right for patients healthcare should be outbound not inbound the us healthcare system s chassis primarily relies on patients making appointments and visiting their doctors as needed leeba believed that this orientation was mostly backward instead she said that healthcare organizations should be constantly surveilling data and should be proactively reaching out to patients not waiting for them to show up diabetics don t need their hemoglobin a1c checked every six months during primary care appointments they need proactive regular support to ensure that they are eating right exercising regularly and taking medicines as directed frail home bound patients should not have to make heroic efforts to come into the office for a check up teams of physicians and nurse practitioners should visit them in their homes outbound care should be the default said leeba a position she thought would be obvious to any healthcare organization that pursued global capitation all patients shouldn t be treated equally healthcare is increasingly focused on standardization plan benefits clinical programs clinical protocols for leeba at the root of this standardization was a well intentioned if somewhat misguided belief that all patients should be treated equally leeba rejected this idea and believed patients who had more intensive healthcare needs should have access to more intensive interventions some patients might require daily follow ups others weekly others monthly and still others annually healthcare too frequently fails to titrate interventions to the needs of the individual and leeba believed incorporating this kind of variability was a key design principle for the healthcare system of the future jargon is the enemy leeba hated jargon her most hated phrase was value based care she was a fan of plain speak and believed that jargon as much as anything else gets in the way of our ability to move towards healthcare that is high in quality and low in cost population health and social determinants of health two common darlings of the healthcare reform set should just be referred to as doing the right thing for patients top of license should just be making the best use of the team the invention of terminology might serve academics and industry pundits but it does little to serve patients full disclosure i had to thoroughly deprogram myself when i went to work with leeba you can only manage what you can measure another reason leeba disdained what is frequently referred to as value based care is that so much of what passes for it is disconnected from clinicians daily reality it s not just a meaningless piece of jargon it s also an abstraction leeba insisted on creating metrics that could be evaluated on a daily basis and that enabled clinicians to measure whether they were successful in keeping patients healthy for instance at caremore we operated with the daily discipline of measuring our inpatient bed days meaning the number of patients who were in the hospital on any given day if we were successful at managing patients chronic diseases we were successful in keeping them out of the hospital and their bed days were low if we weren t then the bed days were high and so too were healthcare costs the numbers don t lie leeba would say adding characteristically only expect what you plan to inspect you can t change without changing leeba was frustrated by how many healthcare leaders and organizations wanted to drive change innovation and transformation but then got stuck in the usual cycles of incrementalism and consensus building to leeba many who were in positions to drive change were not leaders but instead corporate politicians who were less interested in doing the right thing than they were in going along to get along people at other health systems whose reform efforts often were bogged down in pilot programs would ask leeba how caremore was able to continuously innovate to improve care you can t change without changing leeba would tell them which is to say real change requires real trade offs and not just talk too many healthcare organizations are stuck because while they say they want to change they don t want to make the sacrifices that are necessary to bring about true reform you can t change something until you know something when i first started at caremore leeba advised me to get to know this organization before you try to change this organization it is a lesson i repeat almost daily to new recruits too often in the rush to make a difference new leaders opine on things without a full appreciation of the complexities of what is happening or an understanding of why things are structured the way they are to leeba shoot first aim later leadership was incredibly common and also at the root of how ineffective many leaders are in their roles take the time and invest in understanding she d counsel and make change that is informed by an understanding of people and history as opposed to thoughtlessly implementing change for change s sake most employees at healthcare companies don t care about the stock price too many leaders at healthcare organizations lead conversations with employees with references to the stock price without realizing that most employees are not concerned with it most employees of private companies don t have any material amount of stock and could care less about whether it went up or down yesterday mostly they are concerned about whether the company is doing well enough that they will continue to be employed and whether the company supports them in helping patients i will always remember leeba s last trip to a caremore care center when she was ceo a receptionist asked if they could have a fish tank for the waiting room of the care center without thinking much she said yes when we walked out of the care center she told me that the fish tank was a modest investment that would make employees feel visible valued and heard the fish tank was installed a week later there are some things you only learn how to do once you do them when i asked leeba why she was willing the hand the reigns of caremore the company into which she d poured so much of her time and energy to me a 35 year old first time ceo she told me that there are some things you can only learn how to do once you do them when leeba was 20 years old and just out of college she was the first in her family to attend she was hired to be the secretary of a local medical society in santa barbara california when the ceo of the group was fired eight weeks later the physicians made leeba the leader of the group she had so quickly grasped the nature of the work and impressed the doctors with whom she worked that they committed to supporting her despite her inexperience leeba made a career of giving people like me a shot before others did because she herself had been given an opportunity early and made the most of it she made unconventional personnel choices like this throughout her career and was rewarded richly for them it s an example i ve followed with similar results leeba taught me and many others important lessons about healthcare leadership and life those of us who knew her miss her every day but every single one of us is better for having known her as we near the one year anniversary of her death i m working with others to honor her memory in a way that seems fitting considering how much she taught me and others we are sponsoring an internship in leeba s honor at the national academy of social insurance so that young people with a passion for improving the lives of others can begin their own journey toward learning understanding and driving change
updated jan 19 1 a m et air cargo carriers say customers will face significant shipping delays and costs if big telecommunications companies rollout new 5g wireless service without taking steps to mitigate potential interference with safety instruments on aircraft on tuesday at t and verizon under pressure from the white house announced they will delay deployment of 5g service at towers near some airports the developments followed an airline industry warning the day prior that turning on cellular towers near airports would wreak havoc on travel and shipping that depend on aviation more than 5 400 cargo flights per year face delays diversions or cancellations if federal aviation administration directives last month to prohibit landings in low visibility conditions at airports ringed by cellular towers remain in place because of the 5g startup according to an economic impact statement from airlines for america a4a the impact analysis was based on a survey of the airline group s members which include cargo airlines atlas air nasdaq aaww fedex express nyse fdx and ups nyse ups the all cargo carriers estimate the directives will cost them 400 million annually because of disruptions to time sensitive operations the directives would disrupt about 345 000 passenger flights and cost passenger carriers 1 7 billion in additional operating costs per year a4a said the group added that its estimates are conservative and that the cascading effect of delays on network operations extra efforts to restore service and lost productivity could easily double the impact estimates and exacerbate crew shortages as pilots run up against daily duty limits united airlines nasdaq ual canceled many overseas flights wednesday because of uncertainty about whether its planes could come back and land emirates air india japan airlines and all nippon airways have cancelled flights to select u s cities too as a precaution in response to boeing instructions freight brokers said they were monitoring bookings in case airlines alter their schedules or substitute aircraft without warning for now faa restrictions are in effect and will apply when the cloud cover drops below 200 feet delta air lines nyse dal said it is planning for the possibility of weather related cancellations caused by the deployment of 5g service near dozens of airports start wednesday airline customers rely on airlines to transport time sensitive perishable products such as pharmaceuticals vaccines organs critical supply chain parts and many other high value items the lack of serious mitigations on the part of 5g telecom companies to address interference issues will significantly disrupt and harm the economy at a time when supply chains are already stretched thin the airline lobbying group said in a blog post steve alterman president of the cargo airline association agreed that the 5g implementation needs a pause so the faa the federal communications commission airlines aircraft and altimeter manufacturers and the telecom companies can work out a solution for all elements to coexist the impact on the cargo sector would be dramatic and potentially devastating he told american shipper to the extent services are disrupted due to 5g interference the ripple effects through the economy will be significant the cargo airline association represents abx air and kalitta air in addition to atlas fedex and ups cargo containers ring a ups freighter at dallas fort worth international airport photo jim allen freightwaves in early 2021 the fcc auctioned spectrum in the c band adjacent to frequency used by radio altimeters which is critical for safe landing in poor weather conditions at t and verizon which spent 80 billion for those signals grudgingly agreed in early january to postpone turning them on until jan 19 and also to weaken or fade the signal around some airports for six months it s an approach phone companies have used in about 40 other countries the telecoms say that will give the faa and plane manufacturers time to determine if interference is theoretical or real t mobile s nationwide 5g network does not use the c band spectrum the faa is concerned about the radio altimeter informs aircraft how high they are above land or water when visibility is low the instrument must detect faint signals off the ground to measure altitude much like radar and overlapping signals could degrade its function if the altimeter is unable to sufficiently deflect them according to the faa now the agency is discovering that certain airplane types are more impacted than others by the radio altimeter interference last week the faa notified operators of boeing 787s that they need to allow for longer stopping distance when landing at airports where 5g service is deployed because a compromised radio altimeter can slow the start of thrust reversers and speedbrakes other systems that may be affected by 5g interference include the autopilot flight direction auto throttle system collision avoidance system and ground proximity warning system boeing also issued guidance to airlines operating the 737 max that performance at takeoff and landing could be impaired and to reduce either cargo or passenger weight on sunday the faa gave the green light to about 45 of the u s commercial fleet to perform low visibility landings at many airports where 5g will be deployed saying the boeing and airbus planes have altimeters that coexist with the c band signals the combination of aircraft and altimeter approvals opens up runways at up to 48 of the 88 airports most directly affected by the 5g interference but a4a on monday asked the biden administration to immediately intervene to prevent significant operational disruptions saying the potential harms are worse than originally anticipated in part because most of the 50 large airports identified by the faa for relief will still be subject to flight restrictions putting 1 100 flights at risk of delay those airports handle the bulk of travel and shipment volumes it noted the airline group said the new information about impacts to other safety and navigation systems means that there are huge swaths of the operating fleet that may need to be indefinitely grounded including many widebody aircraft used in international service cargo owners and logistics companies heavily rely on twin aisle passenger jets and widebody freighters to deliver imports and exports it specifically asked the white house to require a 2 mile buffer around airport runways a4a president nicholas calio expressed appreciation for at t and verizon s willingness to pause 5g deployment but said the group has not seen details of the agreement yet the air line pilots association said it will feel comfortable until a permanent fix is found reps peter defazio d oregon and rick larson d washington who respectively chair the transportation and infrastructure committee and the aviation subcommittee also welcomed the agreement by at t and verizon to delay 5g implementation the reality is that u s national airspace is the most complex in the world and is not subject to many of the mandatory mitigations seen in other countries it s time for the faa airlines manufacturers the telecom industry and airports to work together on a schedule to implement long term measures at affected airports so that the laudable goal of implementing 5g technologies can coexist with the aviation sector without disruption they said in an interview on cnn defazio blamed the last minute timeout on fcc chairman ajit pai a trump appointee for ignoring warnings not to sell the c band close to the radio altimeter frequency and the telecom carriers for not providing data about their deployment until the wednesday before christmas every other country on earth has regulated the telecoms they make them point their signals away from flight paths they make them operate at lower power they have exclusion zones here the chairman said it s a wild west free for all and the industry says we can put these towers where we want and it s proprietary information where they are so we re having trouble walking our way through this in japan 5g cell towers close to airports operate at 5 of normal strength daniel elwell the acting faa administrator during the trump administration concurred that telecom companies have not been forthcoming with information such as station locations and their power regulators and the two industries will now work airport by airport through mitigation strategies they can take how long that will take is unclear click here

the numbers are unbelievably staggering the world s 10 richest men more than doubled their fortunes from us 700 billion to us 1 5 trillion at a rate of us 15 000 per second or us 1 3 billion a day according to a new study from oxfam international these phenomenal changes in fortunes took place during the first two years of a covid 19 pandemic that has seen the incomes of 99 percent of humanity fall and over 160 million more people forced into poverty 60 million more than the figures released by the world bank in 2020 if these ten men were to lose 99 999 percent of their wealth tomorrow they would still be richer than 99 percent of all the people on this planet said oxfam international s executive director gabriela bucher they now have six times more wealth than the poorest 3 1 billion people it has never been so important to start righting the violent wrongs of this obscene inequality by clawing back elites power and extreme wealth including through taxation getting that money back into the real economy and to save lives she said according to forbes magazine the 10 richest people as of 30 november 2021 who have seen their fortunes grow include elon musk jeff bezos bernard arnault family bill gates larry ellison larry page sergey brin mark zuckerberg steve ballmer and warren buffet pandemic hit the poorest people the pandemic has hit the poorest people women and racialized and marginalized groups the hardest for example in the us 3 4 million black americans would be alive today if their life expectancy was the same as white people this is directly linked to historical racism and colonialism according to the study titled inequality kills released january 17 ahead of the world economic forum s wef online davos agenda the report finds that a new billionaire is created every 26 hours while inequality is contributing to the death of at least 21 000 people each day or one person every four seconds other findings include the pandemic has set gender parity back from 99 years to now 135 years 252 men have more wealth than all 1 billion women and girls in africa and latin america and the caribbean combined during the second wave of the pandemic in england people of bangladeshi origin were five times more likely to die of covid 19 than the white british population black people in brazil are 1 5 times more likely to die from covid 19 than white people inequality between countries is expected to rise for the first time in a generation the proportion of people with covid 19 who die from the virus in developing countries is roughly double that in rich countries asked for his comments ben phillips author of how to fight inequality told ips the new report confirms four vital truths about inequality are now proven beyond doubt firstly inequality kills inequality is not just inefficient and unfair as the data shows it is deadly secondly inequality is spiralling the driving cause is neoliberalism but it has now been supercharged by the pandemic thirdly inequality is a political choice the rise in inequality is not inevitable governments can reduce inequality if they decide to do so fourthly policy makers will only shift if we make them do so a reversal in inequality depends on us ordinary citizens organising to push our leaders to make them do their job and put in place the policies that will deliver a fairer safer world tackling inequality striking a hopeful note phillips said though the crisis has made inequality even worse and even harder to bear he said the crisis also paradoxically has generated an opportunity for transformational shift to tackle inequality if we seize this moment we know the policy mix needed get the vaccine to everyone by sharing the rights and recipes drop the debt expand public services like free health and education raise up ordinary people s wages and worker s rights tackle discrimination put money in the hands of ordinary people and properly tax and restrain the economic and political power of big corporations and the super rich change depends on ordinary people phillips said the myths of equal opportunity and rising tides have been busted but the truth alone will not set us free left to itself the rigged economy will continue to worsen inequality left to themselves politicians will allow it even enable it to do so only pressure from below can secure a reversal of rising inequality the good news is that around the world frustration is increasingly being channelled into a resurgence of organising that has potential to shift the balance of power unions community organisations women s groups progressive faith organisations and social movements are standing up and standing together this is the source of hope this is our chance if enough people join in inequality defines this moment but need not be our fate declared phillips pandemic windfalls according to the oxfam report billionaires wealth has risen more since covid 19 began than it has in the last 14 years at us 5 trillion dollars this is the biggest surge in billionaire wealth since records began a one off 99 percent tax on the ten richest men s pandemic windfalls for example could pay to make enough vaccines for the world to provide universal healthcare and social protection fund climate adaptation and reduce gender based violence in over 80 countries l all this while still leaving these men us 8 billion better off than they were before the pandemic billionaires have had a terrific pandemic central banks pumped trillions of dollars into financial markets to save the economy yet much of that has ended up lining the pockets of billionaires riding a stock market boom vaccines were meant to end this pandemic yet rich governments allowed pharma billionaires and monopolies to cut off the supply to billions of people the result is that every kind of inequality imaginable risks rising the predictability of it is sickening the consequences of it kill said bucher extreme inequality is a form of economic violence where policies and political decisions that perpetuate the wealth and power of a privileged few results in direct harm to the vast majority of ordinary people across the world and the planet itself oxfam recommends that governments urgently claw back the gains made by billionaires by taxing this huge new wealth made since the start of the pandemic through permanent wealth and capital taxes invest the trillions that could be raised by these taxes toward progressive spending on universal healthcare and social protection climate change adaptation and gender based violence prevention and programming tackle sexist and racist laws that discriminate against women and racialized people and create new gender equal laws to uproot violence and discrimination all sectors of society must urgently define policies that will ensure women racialized and other oppressed groups are represented in all decision making spaces end laws that undermine the rights of workers to unionize and strike and set up stronger legal standards to protect them and rich governments must immediately waive intellectual property rules over covid 19 vaccine technologies to allow more countries to produce safe and effective vaccines to usher in the end of the pandemic antonia kirkland global lead for legal equality access to justice at equality now told ips the socio economic fallout of covid 19 has disproportionately impacted women compounding pre existing inequalities in the home and workplace women have been more likely to shoulder an even greater burden of responsibility for unpaid childcare and household chores in comparison to men women have lost paid work and had to take on more unpaid work and of particular concern is how mothers have been pushed out of the workforce because of a lack of affordable childcare options the expectations put on mothers in particular to take on the lion s share of childcare and manage their children s remote schooling forced many women to reduce their working hours be furloughed or drop out of the labor force altogether unequal pay because of gender discrimination means women in heterosexual family households have been more likely to leave employment if their spouse or partner brings in more income she said the unprecedented disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic should be seized upon as a catalyst for positive change and business recovery planning needs to prioritize attracting and retaining women within the workplace this includes fostering flexible inclusive working policies and practices and supportive hiring and promotion processes that benefit women and families as this startling report inequality kills shows income inequality and gender inequality are intimately linked and to stop covid related inequality from killing women and other vulnerable people and instead put both gender and income equality first all states must get rid of all discriminatory laws sexist laws and gender stereotypes during the pandemic have perpetuated economic violence against women and exacerbated physical domestic violence kirkland declared download the inequality kills report and summary and the methodology document outlining how oxfam calculated the statistics in the report oxfam s calculations are based on the most up to date and comprehensive data sources available figures on the very richest in society come from the forbes 2021 billionaires list figures on the share of wealth come from the credit suisse research institute s global wealth databook 2021 figures on the incomes of the 99 percent are from the world bank inter press service

nearly every health expert will be quick to tell you that it s a good idea to load up your shopping cart with more vegetables and fruits their unique nutritional stew of fiber antioxidants vitamins and minerals is key to lasting health but sometimes fresh options in the produce aisle don t look so fresh and are expensive especially when out of season locally that s when it s time to spin your wheels towards the frozen food department for the unsung subzero heroes of the supermarket certainly fruits and veggies don t always have to be fresh to be best there s a common misconception that frozen fruits and veggies are not as healthy as their fresh counterparts but new york city dietitian deborah malkoff cohen says this is not necessarily true fruits and vegetables are picked when they are at their peak ripeness and flash frozen to retain all of their nutrients antioxidants and flavor and this occurs shortly after harvesting so think of the process as mother nature s pause button many vegetables undergo blanching in hot water for a short time before freezing to inactivate enzymes that degrade color smell flavor and nutritional value for some items like green peas and peaches frozen retains a much more appetizing vibrant color than canned contrast this with fresh out of season produce fated for long haul shipping which are generally picked before ripe and in turn fall short of their full nutritive and flavor potential plus long haul transport from farm to fork and lengthy storage times can further degrade nutrition and taste produce sold fresh that is grown far away can be ripened with ethylene gas to reach peak ripeness once they get to their destination notes malkoff cohen you can buy a lot of frozen veggies and fruits well in advance and use them as desired in the weeks to come stock adobe com to this point an analysis of frozen and fresh stored fruits and vegetables published in the journal of food composition and analysis found that in many cases items like broccoli green beans corn and blueberries retained higher levels of vitamin c beta carotene and folate when in frozen form compared to fresh as these nutrients are diminished during days of refrigerator storage cup for cup malkoff cohen calls out frozen spinach for having notably higher amounts of fiber iron folate and calcium than its fresh counterpart overall a study in the journal nutrients shows that people who sneak more frozen fruits and vegetables into their diets take in higher amounts of must have nutrients like fiber calcium and potassium still malkoff cohen recommends opting for fresh produce when they are in season especially if they are locally grown or from a nearby farm stand for some dishes like stir fries and salads sometimes you just want the crunchy texture of fresh cooking the frozen fare busy schedules can make it a challenge to prep and cook fresh produce all of the time malkoff cohen explains that buying frozen which are often already chopped pitted or peeled for you can make healthy eating more convenient simply toss a few cups of frozen broccoli florets into a soup stir some pitted deep freeze cherries into a pot of simmering oatmeal toss thawed corn kernels in a bean salad and whip up a smoothie with cubed frozen mango with a quick heat in the microwave pre chopped frozen vegetable mixes can be your answer to an ultra quick side dish the variety of fruits and vegetables you eat can increase tremendously when you add in frozen types says malkoff cohen and that is a pathway to eating a more nutritionally diverse diet but preparation matters when it comes to the nutrition on your plate when you grab that bag of frozen cauliflower and start preparing dinner boiling runs the risk of leeching out water soluble nutrients like vitamin c and folate malkoff cohen suggests steaming microwaving roasting and stir frying as less destructive cooking methods if you re looking to cut back on food waste and its added cost to you and the environment you don t have to worry about eating your frozen raspberries before white fuzz takes over space permitting you can buy a lot more frozen veggies and fruits well in advance and use them as desired in the weeks to come in contrast the clock is ticking as soon as you bring fresh spinach and strawberries home before they spoil and these days there are more exciting options than ever ranging from deep freeze dragon fruit to jazz up your next smoothie to frozen cauliflower rice that adds a low calorie veggie serving to tonight s dinner stir fry once frozen

two years to the week after the first covid 19 cases in this country were confirmed it s increasingly clear who the biggest economic winners have been the tech giants that benefitted from the shift to remote work such as amazon and microsoft are the most obvious ones but the list also includes major wall street banks and large financial firms last friday jpmorgan chase the biggest bank in the country announced that it had made a post tax profit of 48 3 billion in 2021 nearly fifty billion dollars that s about thirty five per cent more than the thirty six billion dollars that jpmorgan chase made in 2019 the year before the pandemic which was itself a record figure even jamie dimon the bank s ebullient chairman surely can t have expected such a spectacular rebound from the first quarter of 2020 when amid the initial onslaught of the pandemic the bank ordered most of its employees to work from home and its profits plunged by almost seventy per cent compared with the same period a year earlier we don t know exactly what the future will hold dimon said in an april 2020 letter to shareholders but at a minimum we assume that it will include a bad recession combined with some kind of financial stress similar to the global financial crisis of 2008 in unveiling the bank s latest profit report on friday jeremy barnum the bank s chief financial officer said what stands out is the stability of both revenues and returns through a very volatile period the term stability was a big understatement jpmorgan chase has never had it so good and right now that s the rule rather than the exception on wall street on tuesday goldman sachs announced record post tax profits of 21 6 billion for 2021 the past twelve months have been such a stellar period for the firm that according to bloomberg news it is preparing to give some of its most senior employees two year end bonuses the first one would be a regular annual bonus for top performers at goldman these payments can amount to many millions of dollars the second bonus would be awarded on top of the first one according to bloomberg it would be a one off payout recognizing the wall street titan s roaring success through the pandemic in other words it would be a one time covid bonus or more accurately a covid federal reserve bonus it s hard to exaggerate the extent to which the current wall street bonanza is a product of the stimulative policies that the fed and congress introduced to lessen the pain of the pandemic as covid 19 cases mounted between the middle of february 2020 and the middle of the following month the dow jones industrial average fell roughly ten thousand points or about a third after the fed announced its emergency measures interest rate cuts large scale purchases of financial assets and a range of emergency lending programs the stock market rebounded and that was a design feature not a fluke in pumping more than a hundred billion dollars a month into the bond markets the fed aimed to stabilize things and encourage risk taking the stock market went up pretty much in a straight line until last month when jerome powell the fed chair indicated that the central bank was preparing to change course and fight inflation for wall street firms buoyant financial markets are like rocket fuel with its corporate clients eager to raise cheap capital and make acquisitions jpmorgan chase s investment banking revenues jumped by almost forty per cent in 2021 compared with the previous year fees from asset management which are also very sensitive to the market rose sixteen per cent another factor boosting the firm s results a wave of loan defaults that dimon and other bankers worried about early in the pandemic never materialized after congress in 2020 and 2021 allocated trillions of dollars to bolster the finances of households and businesses americans for the most part were able to keep servicing their debts lately jpmorgan chase and other banks have begun releasing some of the money that they had set aside to cover bad loans the way bank accounting works these maneuvers raise reported profits to be sure the gains from revved up financial markets aren t confined to wall street traders and dealmakers virtually anybody who owns stocks has seen their portfolio rise in value since the start of the pandemic the problem is that most american households have little or no money invested in the market because financial wealth is distributed incredibly unequally just how lopsided is stock ownership in the third quarter of 2021 according to figures from the fed the top one per cent of households owned 21 6 trillion of stocks either directly or through mutual funds the next richest nine per cent owned 14 1 trillion and the bottom fifty per cent half the country owned just three hundred billion a fuller accounting would include other components of wealth such as real estate which has also increased in value since the pandemic began nonfinancial wealth is distributed a bit more equally than financial wealth but not nearly enough to offset the over all imbalance taking all forms of wealth together and again relying on fed estimates the top one per cent of households had 43 9 trillion of wealth in the third quarter of last year and the bottom fifty per cent had 3 4 trillion the bottom line is that most americans have missed out on the asset price boom created by the policy response to the pandemic or have participated in it to a very limited extent and the gains have been concentrated at the top what s the solution since much of the rise in profits that wall street firms have enjoyed looks like an unearned windfall one possibility would be to introduce a windfall tax on those profits and use the revenues to finance additional federal spending or reduce the budget deficit during the first and second world wars congress levied corporate taxes of this nature on the grounds that some businesses such as military contractors were making excessive profits is the fight against the pandemic so different another option would be to adopt a one off version of the annual wealth tax on billionaires that senator ron wyden proposed last fall during discussions about joe biden s build back better plan the aim here would be to tax some of the pandemic generated windfalls that some of the very richest people in the country have enjoyed getting this congress to pass any such proposal would be a mighty challenge of course but hey you never know last month senator joe manchin reportedly told the white house that he would accept some version of a wealth tax as part of a reduced spending package perhaps the biden administration keen to rescue some elements of the build back better bill should remind manchin of this or direct his attention to what s been happening on wall street
but wood s faith in lazar s view stands in stark contrast to both market movements and the views of several other high profile investors as wood was tweeting oaktree co founder howard marks was expressing his concerns about inflation and the fed s inevitable reaction i am worried about inflation inflation is excessive marks said in a bloomberg tv interview higher inflation means higher interest rates higher interest means lower asset prices david rubenstein co founder of us private equity giant the carlyle group went further telling an event in new york that markets are due for a correction typically defined as a drop of more than 10 per cent and rising rates are the likely trigger now that s hardly an outlandish suggestion given the s p 500 is down 4 6 per cent since the start of the year and the nasdaq is now down 7 8 per cent but the correction rubenstein sees will start when the fed actually starts raising he too sees inflation falling in the back half of the year but only to somewhere between 3 per cent and 4 per cent but that s still double what we ve had and a lot of people are nervous about it it won t be quite as bad as it was in the 70s but it s not going to be 2 per cent for a while in the space of a few hours on tuesday night marks wood and rubenstein neatly illustrated the divergence of views in the market on inflation rates and how asset prices react advertisement markets are built on differences of opinions of course and it s natural that a period like this would see a range of views given how rare periods of rising inflation and interest rates have been but what s particularly fascinating is that amid these myriad predictions professional investors remain bullish and are moving in a pack while the latest bank of america survey suggests investors are braced for three fed hikes in 2022 chief investment strategist michael hartnett says bullishness about global re opening is clearly trumping fears that higher rates will derail markets there is some repositioning to take inflation into account with shifts from growth into value the net allocation to banks rose a staggering 21 per cent during the previous month while exposure to tech plunged to the lowest levels since 2008 and into commodities which are seeing the highest allocation in the 20 year history of the survey but there are few concerns about a recession emerging or covid 19 proving a tail risk for wall street given all the talk about inflation and the skittishness on global markets the bullishness described in the survey is a reminder that for many investors equities remain the best bet in what is still a low return world but as wood knows the key is which stocks to hold
the government has purchased more than 500 million rapid covid 19 tests for americans you now can order up to four free tests per household on covidtests gov update 09 06 2022 ordering through the free at home covid 19 test program was suspended as of friday sept 2 according to usps the biden administration says congress hasn t provided additional funding to continue to fund the distribution of tests for more information on other free covid 19 testing options please visit covid gov tests previous reporting as the omicron variant of covid 19 continues to spread rapidly across the united states the white house is implementing its plans to help americans battle the highly transmissible variant by improving access to free testing weeks after facing backlash after white house press secretary jen psaki laughed at the idea of mailing tests to americans in a dec 21 speech president joe biden said the federal government planned to purchase 500 million at home rapid covid 19 tests that would be delivered free of charge to every american who requests them since then the department of defense dod has awarded contracts to several manufacturers to increase test production then in a jan 13 twitter post biden announced that his team would purchase an additional 500 million tests bringing the total count to 1 billion upon completion of the second order now many people online are wondering how to request the free tests the question can you order free at home covid 19 tests from the federal government the sources the answer yes you can now order free at home covid 19 tests from the federal government the website went live on jan 18 a day earlier than the government originally announced what we found when are tests available on jan 14 the white house announced the launch of covidtests gov the test ordering website an online statement said the site would go live on jan 19 however the website was accepting requests for tests on jan 18 a day before its formal launch date white house press secretary jen psaki said during a jan 18 press briefing this was because the site was in a beta testing phase covidtests gov is in the beta phase right now which is a standard part of the process typically as it s tested in the early stages of being rolled out psaki said the testing site was fully functional on jan 18 and orders for tests were being processed how can i order tests covidtests gov redirects visitors to an order form on the u s postal service s website where you can order a total of four rapid antigen at home covid 19 tests per household online to order the free tests all you need to do is enter your name and a residential mailing address the tests are expected to ship within seven to 12 days and will be delivered by the usps with no additional shipping costs according to the website once your order has shipped you will receive an email with an estimated delivery date and a tracking number you will then be able to track the status of your delivery on usps com according to the agency what brand of tests will i receive according to covidtests gov all of the free tests distributed as part of this program are fda authorized at home rapid antigen tests you will not be able to choose the brand you order as part of this program what if i can t access the websites for individuals unable to access covidtests gov or those who need additional support placing an order you can call 1 800 232 0233 tty 1 888 720 7489 how else can i get tests along with the launch of covidtests gov the biden administration has made other free testing options available to americans as of jan 15 private insurance companies are required to cover the costs of eight at home covid 19 tests for insured individuals based on a new policy the government has also opened 18 federal free testing sites in areas that were in need of additional testing capacity including new york new jersey pennsylvania nevada and washington d c and 20 additional sites are set to open soon there are also now over 20 000 free testing sites open across the country according to the white house the biden administration has also arranged for it to be easier for americans to find free testing sites near them on google biden says it s as easy as entering covid test near me in the google search bar then you ll be able to find a number of different locations nearby where you can get tested
seven is often seen as a lucky number but not this time the consumer price index is up 7 in december from december 2020 that s the highest rate of annual increase in inflation in almost 40 years since june of 1982 even core prices if you exclude volatile items like food and energy even then still the fastest pace of increase in almost 31 years and what today s report tells us i think just validates what millions of households already knew and that is inflation is a problem prices are going up and they re going up pervasively and they re going up at a rate that outpaces growth and household income in many cases food prices are up over 6 energy prices up over 29 and shelter costs which tend to lag already up over 4 year over a year and i think that s the one to watch in the months ahead the federal reserve had what i would describe as a very lazy faire attitude toward inflation in 2021 and only at the end of the year did they really get the memo that this is a problem and as a result we ve seen them pivot very quickly in terms of how they view it and how they plan to address it specifically we will see the feds start to raise short term interest rates they re likely to start that as soon as march and around that time or shortly thereafter they will not only stop buying bonds and adding to their portfolio they will start letting the size of that portfolio shrink letting it run off that has the effect of pulling liquidity out of the system so even though that happens behind the scenes i think that s arguably the more significant item both of those will slow the demand side of the economy over time but they re not going to address nor fix the issues with the supply chain advertisement peloton is hiking prices because of inflation share copy link copy peloton says inflation and supply chain challenges have forced the company to hike the price of its flagship bike just five months after cutting it drastically to boost sagging sales beginning jan 31 customers will be required to pay 250 for delivery and setup for peloton s 1 495 bike a service that the company previously included in the price customers buying peloton s tread treadmills will be charged a 350 fee for delivery and installation starting later this month with these fees the price of the bike in the united states will jump to 1 745 and the peloton tread will soon cost 2 845 peloton also said it will hike the base price of both pieces of equipment for customers in the united kingdom germany and australia although it will continue to include delivery and setup for no extra charge peloton said in a statement that continued constraints are driving up costs a complaint echoed by companies across several industries like many other businesses peloton is being impacted by global economic and supply chain challenges that are affecting the majority if not all businesses worldwide it said even with these increases we believe we still offer the best value in connected fitness and offer consumers various financing options that make peloton accessible to a wide audience the 2 495 price of its higher end bike will remain the same and will continue to include delivery and setup at no extra charge peloton reduced the price of its bike by roughly 20 in august 2021 to jumpstart sales it tried to keep up with the breakneck pace of 2020 when the company s products skyrocketed in popularity as gyms closed and people were forced to work out at home but a massive tread recall gyms reopening and unfortunate cameo on hbo s sex and the city sequel made peloton s 2021 rougher than it had expected peloton revealed in its most recent earnings report that sales of its stationary bikes and treadmills fell 17 those two machines are the company s bread and butter making up 60 of its business peloton shares fell nearly 3 in premarket trading and the stock is down 80 over the past year

adobe stock tongpatong electrical engineering graduate and bedford resident emily bayuk builds a brand to encourage curiosity and growth in the stem fields emily bayuk first noticed the gender gap in stem while sitting in her high school ap physics class she was one of three girls in the class while there were 20 boys in attendance after her teacher turned mentor encouraged her to pursue electrical engineering further bayuk was inspired her to create her brand the stem diaries the stem diaries aim to help young women grow their love of stem while acting as a resource for topics ranging from choosing a college major to finding a mentor we caught up with emily to chat about her journey and what s on the horizon for the stem diaries westchester magazine how did you come up with the idea to start the stem diaries this combination education and lifestyle brand for girls looking to get into engineering emily bayuk so it actually started back in high school my senior year we had this scholarship contest called tingley that is run within fox lane high school and the purpose of this scholarship contest is to create a resource for students to learn about a topic at the time i was really into bullet journaling which is just like a fun aesthetically pleasing way to journal and i was also super super interested in circuits so i decided to merge those two and create a book that was handwritten and helps you to build which i initially called the fundamentals of circuits made easy i ended up not winning the scholarship contest but while i was in college and doing research the summer before my junior year i showed one of my professors and he asked me if i had thought about publishing it advertisement so long story short i published my first book and then fast forward to my senior year of college i ended up writing and illustrating another book in a similar fashion as my first one i thought i should really call this the the fundamentals of circuits part two conversions because no one is going to like that really long title it s also not about circuits it s about energy conversion so i ended up coming up with the title system for the book series and using the word diary instead then that year covid hit and i thought it was smart to make an instagram about it to really keep people engaged do more connecting stem to the world and making it more fun for kids and hopefully inspire more girls like myself i started making videos and posts about stem and tying in my lifestyle it evolved from explainer videos originally to now how stem affects our daily lives view this post on instagram a post shared by emily bayuk stem lifestyle thestemdiaries wm any plans to publish any more books eb yes i have a third one that i wrote and so it s going to come out probably early next year hopefully around february wm when would you say your interest in electrical engineering and circuits and how everything works really began eb that was my junior year of high school so i took physics my junior year of high school and in class we had a little mini unit on circuits i liked that it was pretty much figuring out a puzzle and there s something i really enjoyed about it so i went to my teacher like mr lead like teach me more about circuits because he was an electrical engineer and a big circuit guy too he was the one that said to me if i really enjoyed circuits maybe i should consider becoming an electrical engineer wm what was your experience going to college at bucknell university for not only just engineering but electrical engineering i know that that s a very male dominated field eb i was one of three girls in my electrical engineering class there were like thirteen of us in total so it s like a very tightly knit group of kids we all did our homework together after school i was really lucky i ve never felt like my gender defined who i was as an engineer or like people judged me because of my gender and going into the field of engineering view this post on instagram a post shared by emily bayuk stem lifestyle thestemdiaries wm now that you ve graduated what pushed you into the job and into the area that you re doing now advertisement eb now i m doing cybersecurity consulting at accenture so i m helping them protect their products and stuff from hackers i first got interested in cybersecurity when i completed an externship with morgan stanley s cyber security team my sophomore year at bucknell that was just like a one day job shadow to meet as many people as you can in cybersecurity i love that it was fast paced and it was new and there was just so much going on again the puzzles like figuring out how to hack the system and stuff like that i enjoyed everything about that experience and after that i knew i wanted to do cybersecurity going into my senior year of bucknell i worked as a machine learning software developer for booz allen hamilton it solidified my love for cybersecurity so the second half of my internship they gave me this challenge it s called capture the flag which is pretty much like it s like a hacking challenge you have to hack the system and then at the end you get a flag the secret message is the flag pretty much from there i ended up at accenture and i couldn t be happier with it wm as far as the stem diaries goes you have so many resources for girls to get into this you have blog you have books so is there anything you re looking to expand on or any areas of science that you re looking to add more to eb i would say the next step is going i know this is like a very generic word to cool places i want to show the stem behind these places that people visit all the time and showing like here s a cool place and it s related to stem there s also adding new blog posts about life and science like how to make the perfect cup of coffee according to science i m going to go into a coffee shop and film and learn how to make their coffee and then relate it back to science view this post on instagram a post shared by emily bayuk stem lifestyle thestemdiaries wm i can t imagine your workload as an engineering major at bucknell but the fact that you were able to crank out these guides and all these books and stuff how were you able to find that work life balance eb yeah i feel like to me it never really feels like i m working the stem diaries is fun for me to work on in my free time it s like oh i have 10 minutes in between class let me just like work on this quick or before i went to bed at school and i would work on it a lot after i finished my homework it s almost like a hobby in a way if i have free time that s what i want to work on wm what s your suggestion for any girls wondering not only what college major they should choose but what direction they should go in within stem eb talk to adults or even other students who are majoring in something that you re interested in and just learn about their experience and if it s something that you would be interested in pursue it and also knowing that there s going to be good days where you re going to get good grades and then there are going to be the days where you failed tests and that s okay just go with the flow and move on and don t give up because i feel like engineering is definitely one of the harder classes in terms of getting good grades i know at school i got a 30 on the test once and of course it was curved because everyone was around there but just to know it s okay and keep pushing forward and it ll all work out view this post on instagram a post shared by emily bayuk stem lifestyle thestemdiaries wm i feel like it s one thing to love science but to build a brand about young girls loving science and providing them resources about where to take their passion is such a needed niche you ve really built a place for budding engineers and mathematicians to find comradery and kind of form a tribe around it s so important eb yeah so talking about a tribe it s been such a cool experience with my instagram there s a whole community of stem women on instagram and everyone s just so supportive i actually met up with a woman who was in the industry and followed us and she was so cool i really like connecting with her and she s awesome so that was really cool to meet her in real life wm any plans to maybe do a meetup or an event in the future eb oh yeah we ve been talking about that me and few other women in new york i know they have one event in california a lot but we re trying to schedule one for new york which will be super fun follow along with emily s

cleveland oh accesswire january 18 2022 innovest global inc otc pink ivst a diversified industrials company continues corporate and operational milestones and goals for 2022 sales have increased after the decline in 2020 overhead that scaled to accommodate previous rapid growth has been reduced by over 70 percent since the contraction period in advance of new planned growth and existing operations are strong and profitable a brief company history current status and 2022 plan follow innovest was founded in 2017 with plans to acquire operating companies integrate them and create value for shareholders by streamlining and growing those companies by doing so a platform company which would have a solid business foundation and could scale meaningfully would result despite limited capitalization the company grew quickly executing multiple acquisitions and beginning with just 50 thousand in sales for 2017 reaching 40 million in sales for 2019 with growing gross profits significant prospects for organic growth and was on track with its business plans and goals during 2020 covid 19 disrupted ordinary operations prompting cuts and the effects of the disruptions were amplified in the curtainwall commercial construction segment that business had inherited an eight figure contract on acquisition which had unknown risks due to the fact that the prior owner had passed away prior to acquisition while the structure insulated the parent company innovest s direct exposure to those risks the success of that business required either the success of the inherited project or success in securing additional such projects prior to covid 19 several such large projects were in the pipeline for the subsidiary but were ultimately put on hold by potential clients due to the pandemic as a result of this and other factors as well as other impacted subsidiaries the decision was made to cut costs focus on unaffected subsidiaries and limit the pursuit of other new acquisitions until the business climate stabilized also during 2020 innovest exited biotechnology to focus solely on industrial businesses by spinning off its stemvax therapeutics subsidiary to novaccess global this exit resulted in an improvement to innovest s balance sheet from a zero dollar illiquid asset of stemvax to 7 5 million shares of xsnx worth over 3 million on innovest s most recently reported quarter during 2021 this plan to focus on the present climate parameters was executed to ensure the sustainability of the company in contrast to previous years which focused on growth and overhead structures to accommodate that growth the 2022 plan was begun including items which will continue to improve the balance sheet significantly grow the company and provide direct value to shareholders by actions more fully described below 2021 also marked the addition of gpc capital as a principal entering 2022 the company has a lean overhead structure and two profitable subsidiaries one is a commercial energy brokerage business operating throughout the usa the other is a domestic call center service business clients as customer service and business to business sales which is pci compliant and adheres to hipaa for its healthcare clients all of the agents are usa based overhead cuts were primarily achieved from elimination of executive level compensation positions which were previously in place to pursue new acquisitions integrate acquisitions and operate as a centralized management structure the present decentralized adjustment allowed the company to make reductions to overhead of over 70 percent while only seeing headcount decline from approximately 100 to approximately 70 over 90 percent of employees presently on payroll are either billed to clients or directly sell this has stabilized the company from experiencing losses during the growth years to approximately breaking even from subsidiary profits despite a significant decline in revenue due to the previously described events current status developments and 2022 milestones board of directors per the aforementioned strategic changes the 2022 board will be appointed during the first quarter presently pursuant to requirements of nevada law and the company s bylaws the company has a single director shaheed bailey a principal of gpc capital officers mr bailey is interim ceo and interim cfo ali manov is the chief operating officer reporting status current reporting status ie removal of yield sign with otc markets is expected by the first week in february liabilities innovest will definitively close non operating subsidiaries which is expected to be reflected on the second or third quarter 2022 reports resulting in a reduction of approximately 20 million in liabilities on innovest s books contributed from these subsidiaries and the innovest balance sheet having more assets than liabilities other liabilities will be more fully described and detailed in the company s annual report dividend as originally disclosed innovest has approved the distribution of the 7 5 million xsnx shares to innovest s shareholders as a free trading stock dividend this distribution requires novaccess to first register those shares novaccess has represented that it has prioritized the registration capitalization the company will continue to capitalize efforts by operations and will pay down existing debt and fund growth by efficiently and incrementally raising capital until such time that a significant equity capital raise would not detrimentally dilute common shareholders

the bureau of ocean energy management made minor boundary adjustments in its new york bight wind lease areas to reduce conflicts with the scallop fleet that s just a small start toward reducing the impact of wind development on the nation s seafood industry new bedford port officials say the 480 000 acre wind lease offering the first of the biden administration and biggest to date has brought on a wave of proposals from both the fishing and wind power industries for how they could co exist six lease areas outlined by boem in a final offering notice jan 12 include a westward shift of 2 5 miles to the hudson south wind energy area and a reduction of the so called central bight area the modest adjustment responds to requests last year from the scallop industry and the east coast s highest earning fishing port now also a base for offshore wind developers it could be a baby step toward better avoidance of conflicts between the biden administration s aggressive push to open more ocean spaces to wind energy development and urgent warnings from the fishing industry and some ocean environmental advocates that regulators need to build more foresight and safeguards into the permitting process those tweaks in the new york bight auction plan came as a surprise said new bedford mayor jon mitchell we didn t know that had happened until we actually dug into it said mitchell who wrote to boem during 2021 in support of the fisheries survival fund recommendation to move the southwest boundary of hudson south by five miles aimed at giving a buffer zone between turbine arrays and scallop grounds the overarching lesson from yesterday s announcement is the importance of staying engaged and offering pragmatic solutions that are responsive to the concerns of both wind proponents and fishing interests mitchell said in a jan 13 statement i appreciate the willingness of director amanda lefton and the boem team to listen and adjust their approach based on the strength of the case we have made to them i think that it s gotten better mitchell said in an interview with national fisherman the rapport with lefton and her agency has slowly improved he said and there are a number of policies that need to be hammered out for mitigation mitchell s hopeful response came amid a surge of recommendations for mitigating the effects of building wind turbines around fishing grounds funding research and monitoring and compensating fishermen for lost income the fisheries survival fund and responsible offshore development alliance both well established coalitions of fishing interests presented well detailed recommendations to boem for dealing with those issues the american clean power association an influential group in the renewable energy sector likewise came out with its own proposals topping the fishing advocates priority lists are how federal regulators must start by avoiding conflicts at the start of planning to be clear fsf also supports a comprehensive compensation plan that addresses direct and indirect losses to scallop fishermen from offshore wind development interference the fisheries survival fund proposal states up front but our priority is and has always been to avoid and mitigate such losses from the outset the group s detailed proposal harkens back to the scallop fleet s historic crisis of the late 1990s when dwindling scallop stocks and yields threatened its very existence working together back then fishermen scientists and government managers regrouped and rebuilt the fishery instituting a system of rotational fishing area openings and closings that allow shellfish to replenish and assure future potential the atlantic sea scallop fishery is well positioned for the future beyond its historical successes and the immense collection of data obtained from rsa funded research set aside research activities over the past two decades the fishery has a bright outlook according to the fund statement many active fishermen come from families who have been a part of the scallop fishery for generations and each year young captains are entering this lucrative industry indeed the scallop fishery generates over 500 million per year in ex vessel value and the forecasted value of the fishery barring impacts from climate change and offshore wind development is on an upward trend commitments by all concerned to proactive and adaptive mitigation strategies will help ensure the fishery s sustainability and the benefits it provides coastal fishing communities and the nation as a whole we ve been talking and having meetings on the new york bight for four or five years said andrew minkiewicz of kelley drye warren a washington d c law firm that works with the fisheries survival fund and assembled a 15 page presentation to boem jan 7 the scallop fleet s discussions with boem have brought some progress but not enough he said the request for a five mile shift on the hudson south boundary was based on the best scientific information we had for buffering scallop beds from turbine areas said minkiewicz it was a principled ask not just a random number said minkiewicz boem s decision splitting the distance down to half at 2 5 miles seemed petty he added you can t tell me that out of thousands of acres offered for auction that two and a half miles is going to make a difference a top theme in fishing advocates proposals is the need for broad regional measures to mitigate the impacts of wind power developments across long reaches the response from boem officials has been the agency does not have the authority to require such wide measures but finding a path for that approach could make wind power planning more consistent and efficient said minkiewicz on the same day the new york bight auction plan was announced boem and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration said they had a new agreement to formalize how the agencies will work together on wind power planning noaa s national marine fisheries service and regional fishery management councils have been working to share more data to help boem said minkiewicz but it s still opaque and it s frustrating he added there has been some incremental improvement boem officials have worked on guidelines for avoiding conflicts but guidelines alone cannot achieve strong oversight stressed the responsible offshore development alliance strong mitigation requirements must be standardized to protect marine resources and existing uses of the outer continental shelf the most important step for boem to take immediately is to implement effective processes to mitigate fisheries impacts during offshore wind planning and project design the group said in its jan 7 recommendations to the agency developed over months of consultations among its members these must be supported by regulations and strong federal oversight rather than deferring to developers voluntary measures to accommodate fishing safety and resiliency boem is charged with regulating offshore energy developers not advising them said patrice mccarron executive director of the maine lobstermen s association in a statement accompanying release of the document the burden of proof must shift to the developers to prove they are not causing unmitigable harm before development is allowed to proceed we are not the ones applying for permits and leasing offshore areas as such the burden of proof should not lie with us said leigh habegger executive director of the seafood harvesters of america financial compensation is a key part of impact mitigation but industry members continue to recommend that it should only be the final step of the process after all possible actions have been taken to avoid and minimize risk according to roda fishing organizations are concerned that boem s process to develop guidelines for impact fees can only result in voluntary developer administered funding which will not produce fair results nor be configurable to address cumulative effects boem should follow a mitigation hierarchy as outlined by the national environmental policy act to evaluate whether a project has taken effective actions to in sequential order avoid minimize mitigate and compensate for impacts according to roda if boem were to carry out its process properly and in such a way that it prevented interference with commercial fisheries there would be no need for mitigation and compensation which is associated with harm and a failure to prevent interference with reasonable uses said meghan lapp fisheries liaison of seafreeze shoreside and seafreeze ltd narragansett r i where fishermen say they would be permanently displaced by current offshore wind development plans much of fishermen s concerns center on how the biden administration s and wind developers fast growing expansion plans will alter ocean conditions over wider areas cumulative impacts of multiple offshore wind projects across a region will produce more severe impacts to biological resources fishing and supporting communities than merely the additive effects of single projects according to roda boem s absence of a programmatic approach to offshore wind planning has resulted in excessive demands for meetings and public comments but little actual understanding of the environmental and socioeconomic effects of large scale offshore wind development improving understanding of cumulative effects is prerequisite to their mitigation mayor mitchell said new bedford is trying to push on that relationship between developers regulators and fishermen as the biggest u s east coast port it is also home to the first dedicated offshore wind port for supporting turbine construction off southern new england it s more a sense of resignation that needs to be overcome among some fishermen for better relations between them boem and wind developers said mitchell we re trying to get to the point where each industry knows it has to give up something to the other the offshore wind industry had a lot to learn about the commercial fishing industry in the northwest atlantic said mitchell in the wind industry s original home waters of northern europe there have been compensation systems that pay fishermen for loss of access to turbine areas that s not feasible in u s waters considering the diversity and economics of this nation s fishing industry said mitchell to boem s credit the agency leadership is trying to understand the economics of every fishery he said wind developers too are coming around to that understanding he says the american clean power association s recommendations stress establishment of a federal fisheries compensation program we propose general principles that provide clarity predictability and optionality for both industries in a federal compensation fund the group stated to support the fishing industry as it deals with the impacts of climate change and potential changes that may occur from offshore wind development acp fisheries working group believes there is a regulatory solution that can establish the appropriate mechanisms for a federal compensation program the fund could be funded with a substantial portion of federal lease revenues acquired through upcoming auctions and or operating fees to seed a compensation fund specifically geared towards fishermen the group says along with reducing future potential wind energy areas to preserve fishing grounds the group says compensation is an important final step in the effort to avoid minimize and mitigate potential adverse effects from offshore wind development and for the fishing and offshore wind industries to successfully coexist such compensatory mitigation could cover costs from adapting to fishing within offshore wind farms including navigation system upgrades new vessels fishing equipment gear modification or gear upgrades insurance premiums or training and loss of fishing revenue to the extent there is documented loss of use of the area we believe this will help identify and mitigate concerns from fishermen as we foster a working relationship with the commercial and recreational fishing industries operating near these critical clean energy projects acp said in a statement accompanying release of the document by seeking to minimize disruption of fishing activities during all phases of development and maximize ease of access and safe navigation for fishing activities during wind farm operations we believe the offshore wind industry and fishing industry can coexist

photo by alex wong getty images getty images in a december 23 2021 wall street journal op ed ex democratic vice presidential candidate and ex connecticut senator joe lieberman advocated for a return in the senate to regular order regular order is the slow deliberative process of debating bills through committees and including the minority in the debate it s the 150 year normal in the senate days later democratic senator joe manchin w va used a similar logic to torpedo the overarching partisan build back better bill shortly thereafter the federal reserve indicated they would exit their unprecedented money printing game more quickly than anticipated and begin returning short term interest rates and their swollen balance sheet to more normal levels are we headed toward regular order and normality in the economy and the markets in so many ways looking through our rear view mirror 2021 was anything but normal or regular covid raged on and off and then on again we had a peculiar attempt at a coup yet still peacefully changed governments as consumers we spent like drunken sailors but supplies of everything including labor couldn t keep up and we created generationally high inflation while all of these in aggregate may have signaled turmoil the s p 500 went up for another year without a 10 correction trillions of freshly printed dollars gave us the means to buy goods when services were unavailable we so overbought that the supply chains weakened by covid outages buckled to keep up inflation followed and is taking root what we didn t spend we invested in etfs spacs meme stocks and junk bonds practically every risk market went to and beyond its most expensive red line institutionally there was a chase on for private equity record amounts invested at all time high valuations and the next disruptor vc bet generally the story included a hockey stick return 10x forward revenues and nirvana shortly thereafter is this a new normal we think not so what happens if the new religion in washington of regular order starts to stick the federal government seems gridlocked again and that means unconscionable deficit spending could be crashing back toward normal this behavior is referred to as a fiscal cliff and it is rapidly approaching now that the build back better plan has been shelved it doesn t mean that we are a balanced budget government far from it however on a rate of change basis it will be quite a tightening relative to 2021 style largesse normal gridlock equals normal budget deficits the federal reserve board our central economic and market governor is also hastening back to normal unlike any other non war period 2021 will be remembered by fed watchers as the feeding the fire year well after the economy started booming labor markets recovered and while inflation reared its ugly head the fed kept hitting the print button at the rate of 1 trillion per year finally late in the fourth quarter the inflation induced painful screams coming from the 40 of the population who don t own tangible assets caused the fed to begin a rapid tapering of money printing by march 2022 we expect the fed to be done printing and begin raising interest rates that is what a normal fed would do what does regular order portend for portfolios in equities the backdrop is much tougher in 2021 there was little benefit from diversifying portfolios with other asset classes we enter 2022 at near all time highs for the s p500 and with near all time high valuations as well all financial markets have been beneficiaries of fed money printing and as that slows and then stops by the second half of 2022 the financial markets will compete with inflation and the real economy for available liquidity if earnings somehow remain robust and interest rates can remain absurdly low equities can have some more upside the margin of safety is shrinking and i believe it is time to reduce equities especially those that are overvalued and non earning historically the stock market does not get into serious trouble until the fed is forced to significantly raise short term interest rates to slow inflation we know this pattern well but also know that the fed has almost never started this far behind asset management is risk management and we see risks for equities in 2022 we feel that those that return to the regular order caution about equity markets will be winners normal in the bond market seems to depend on your birth year anyone whose career started in 2008 or later expects bond investors to accept essentially zero for short term rates and something less than inflation for long term rates that is far from normal over the past several hundred years currently real interest rates nominal yields minus current inflation are at 30 to 40 year lows for the benchmark 10 year government bond perhaps that is why 2021 was one of the worst years in government bond market history even after the bad year value is hard to find and by april the bond market will have to fend for itself as the fed will be gone nonetheless government bonds continue to be decent hedges against equity volatility our primary concern and so we hold some government bonds as equity hedges that pay their way we consider it quite possible that the fed may start raising interest rates contemporaneously with a slow down in the economy and a slowing of inflation during the second quarter government bonds could perform well at that point our other major hedging asset in our portfolios is precious metals aka hard currency after a spectacular 2020 these assets meandered and closed slightly lower for 2021 we continue to see significant upside and excellent hedging characteristics for gold as we head into 2022 we are buyers on dips and pessimism until the fed stops tightening monetary conditions if at that time the fed has not rooted out core inflation and they subsequently turn on the printing presses again we are buyers with both hands more normal times will tell i am rewriting the apocryphal chinese phrase may you live in interesting times to let s hope we do not get too much regular order happy new year

by fu xiaoqiang china daily updated 2022 01 19 07 50 aerial photo taken on may 5 2021 shows the colombo port city in colombo sri lanka despite some us and indian media outlets attempts to hype up the so called sri lankan debt crisis blaming china for it the fact remains that their claims are untenable fabricated by the us led west and india to mislead global public opinion and defame china especially demonize the china proposed belt and road initiative true sri lanka has a relatively high debt but it s not facing a debt crisis sri lanka s foreign debt of 35 billion accounts for about 75 percent of its gdp while that of many western countries exceeds 100 percent of their gdp also sri lanka s foreign debt repayment is expected to peak this year perhaps that s why some media outlets have been hyping up the sri lankan debt crisis the foreign debt repayment problem sri lanka faces is more due to its excessive borrowing over the years and improper debt structure arrangement in addition the terrorist attacks in 2019 and the covid 19 pandemic outbreak in 2020 increased the country s trade deficit and reduced its tourism revenue further aggravating its foreign exchange shortage since sri lanka needs to repay 60 percent of the debt in us dollars the shrinking foreign exchange reserves down to 1 6 billion has increased its debt repayment pressure this means sri lanka is facing a shortage of foreign exchange not a debt crisis when state councilor and foreign minister wang yi visited the island country recently sri lankan president gotabaya rajapaksa said he hoped china would help the country revive its economy and ease its difficulties but the west twisted the statement to claim china is the cause of sri lanka s debt problem in fact china has been helping sri lanka to boost its economic and social development and will continue to do so but the united states and india are using sri lanka s shortage of foreign exchange to concoct horror stories about its debt standard poor s recently lowered sri lanka s credit rating from ccc to ccc claiming that sri lanka risks defaulting on sovereign credit which in turn prompted the media to spread the so called debt crisis story besides western economies not china and its belt and road initiative are the main creditors of sri lanka as 54 percent of the country s external loans came from the international capital market sri lanka s debt to china about 3 38 billion in loans accounts for about 10 percent of the country s total foreign debt in us dollars china is sri lanka s fourth largest creditor after international financial institutions the asian development bank and japan claiming china s loan terms are opaque the western media say china is leading sri lanka into a debt trap before accusing china of practicing opaque loan policies developed countries should make their own loan accounts public so the international community can see how and for what purposes their aid and loans to developing countries are being used the debt problems of many developing countries including sri lanka can be attributed mainly to the west dominated financial markets and local elites the west and india unable to accept the reality of a rising china and its growing global influence have fabricated the debt trap theory and are slandering the belt and road initiative and trying to soil china s international image so the us led west can continue exploiting developing countries and the us can maintain its global financial monopoly the college of william and mary in the us released a report in october 2021 saying china has given huge high interest loans to low and middle income countries under the belt and road framework with 42 countries having public debt exposure to china exceeding 10 percent of their gdp and being unaware of the hidden debt problem they face many such reports disguised as academic research have been and are being prepared to spread lies against china and as soon as such reports are issued some western media outlets immediately present them as new evidence to question the belt and road initiative no developing country has been caught in a debt trap by joining the belt and road initiative the hidden debt rhetoric is even more untenable reflecting the usual tricks of the us led west that evidence is not important what important is charging someone with a crime the belt and road initiative is an opportunity rather than a trap for countries developing countries need to take loans from foreign sources to boost their development by building infrastructure improving the investment environment and creating jobs and such loans are good debt because they can help those countries achieve sustainable development many railways highways ports power stations and other projects built under this framework have helped people in many countries to increase their incomes according to a world bank report the joint construction of the belt and road is likely to lift about 7 6 million people out of extreme poverty and 32 million people out of moderate poverty in different countries by 2030 it means the belt and road initiative conforms to the historical trend of solidarity cooperation and common development it is hypocritical of western countries which have controlled the economic lifeline of developing countries since the industrial revolution and pushed them into poverty to claim that they care about the debt problem of developing countries their aim is not to safeguard the interests of developing countries but to ensure china s influence does not spread because if china were to have its rightful say in global affairs no country would have to listen to the west s diktats and suffer exploitation instead of playing tricks and spreading rumors against china the us led west and india are welcome to compete with china in good faith in the fields of trade and investment because if sri lanka is indeed in a debt crisis the us led west is to blame for that the author is vice president of the china institutes of contemporary international relations the views don t necessarily reflect those of china daily if you have a specific expertise

seven is often seen as a lucky number but not this time the consumer price index is up 7 in december from december 2020 that s the highest rate of annual increase in inflation in almost 40 years since june of 1982 even core prices if you exclude volatile items like food and energy even then still the fastest pace of increase in almost 31 years and what today s report tells us i think just validates what millions of households already knew and that is inflation is a problem prices are going up and they re going up pervasively and they re going up at a rate that outpaces growth and household income in many cases food prices are up over 6 energy prices up over 29 and shelter costs which tend to lag already up over 4 year over a year and i think that s the one to watch in the months ahead the federal reserve had what i would describe as a very lazy faire attitude toward inflation in 2021 and only at the end of the year did they really get the memo that this is a problem and as a result we ve seen them pivot very quickly in terms of how they view it and how they plan to address it specifically we will see the feds start to raise short term interest rates they re likely to start that as soon as march and around that time or shortly thereafter they will not only stop buying bonds and adding to their portfolio they will start letting the size of that portfolio shrink letting it run off that has the effect of pulling liquidity out of the system so even though that happens behind the scenes i think that s arguably the more significant item both of those will slow the demand side of the economy over time but they re not going to address nor fix the issues with the supply chain advertisement peloton is hiking prices because of inflation share copy link copy peloton says inflation and supply chain challenges have forced the company to hike the price of its flagship bike just five months after cutting it drastically to boost sagging sales beginning jan 31 customers will be required to pay 250 for delivery and setup for peloton s 1 495 bike a service that the company previously included in the price customers buying peloton s tread treadmills will be charged a 350 fee for delivery and installation starting later this month with these fees the price of the bike in the united states will jump to 1 745 and the peloton tread will soon cost 2 845 peloton also said it will hike the base price of both pieces of equipment for customers in the united kingdom germany and australia although it will continue to include delivery and setup for no extra charge peloton said in a statement that continued constraints are driving up costs a complaint echoed by companies across several industries like many other businesses peloton is being impacted by global economic and supply chain challenges that are affecting the majority if not all businesses worldwide it said even with these increases we believe we still offer the best value in connected fitness and offer consumers various financing options that make peloton accessible to a wide audience the 2 495 price of its higher end bike will remain the same and will continue to include delivery and setup at no extra charge peloton reduced the price of its bike by roughly 20 in august 2021 to jumpstart sales it tried to keep up with the breakneck pace of 2020 when the company s products skyrocketed in popularity as gyms closed and people were forced to work out at home but a massive tread recall gyms reopening and unfortunate cameo on hbo s sex and the city sequel made peloton s 2021 rougher than it had expected peloton revealed in its most recent earnings report that sales of its stationary bikes and treadmills fell 17 those two machines are the company s bread and butter making up 60 of its business peloton shares fell nearly 3 in premarket trading and the stock is down 80 over the past year
background and development on december 7 2021 the financial crimes enforcement network fincen published a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm for the corporate transparency act the cta fincen announced that this nprm would be the first of three proposed rules which are designed to finalize the regulations under the cta the cta was initially passed on january 1 2021 to enhance corporate transparency in the united states by requiring that certain entities formed or registered to do business in the country provide certain beneficial ownership information to the united states government as further discussed in one of our earlier publications fincen is charged with collecting this information and storing it in a secure database an entity that falls under the definition of a reporting company must submit to fincen information about itself all of its beneficial owner s and company applicant s this article highlights the analysis based on the first nprm for entities to determine if they must report and if so when and how much information they should report if entities fail to timely comply with the cta monetary fines and criminal charges may be imposed entities required to report reporting companies when analyzing whether the cta applies the first question an entity doing business in the united states must ask itself is whether it falls under the broad definition of a reporting company a reporting company includes any domestic corporation limited liability company or other similar entities which are created by filing a document with a secretary of state or similar office under state or tribal law a reporting company also includes any corporation limited liability company or other similar entities which are formed under the law of a foreign country and are registered to do business in the united states by filing a document with a secretary of state or similar office under state or tribal law while the nprm does not define other similar entity the phrase does seem to reflect fincen s interpretation that it captures any entity that is created or is registered to do business in the united states by filing a document with a secretary of state or similar office generally fincen believes the proposed definition of domestic reporting company would likely include limited liability partnerships limited liability limited partnerships business trusts e g statutory trusts or massachusetts trusts and most limited partnerships because such entities appear typically to be created by a filing with a secretary of state or similar office exempt entities if an entity falls under the broad definition of a reporting company it must next ask whether it may be excluded from the reporting requirements by meeting any of the 23 exemptions proposed by the cta and nprm these exemptions generally aim to exclude any company that is already subject to heavy state or federal regulation the nprm clarified the requirements necessary for an entity to fall under the exemption for large operating companies an entity falls into this category and therefore is not a reporting company if it 1 employs more than 20 employees on a full time basis in the united states 2 filed in the previous year federal income tax returns in the united states demonstrating more than 5 000 000 in gross receipts or sales in the aggregate including the receipts or sales of other entities owned by the entity and through which the entity operates and 3 has an operating presence at a physical office within the united states the nprm clarified that an employee employed on a full time basis includes anyone employed an average of at least 30 service hours per week or 130 service hours per month with adaptations for non hourly employees the nprm also clarifies that the 5 000 000 in gross sales does not include gross receipts or sales from sources outside the united states and an operating presence in a physical workspace owned or leased by the entity as a genuine working office of the entity along with large operating companies the cta includes 22 other exemptions which generally exclude the following from the definition of a reporting company any entity broker or dealer registered with the securities and exchange commission 501 c non profits any entity that exercises governmental authority on behalf of the united states banks a money transmitting business registered with fincen insurance companies or state licensed insurance produces futures commission merchants public accounting firms certain public utilities including financial market utilities pooled investment vehicles and certain inactive entities an inactive entity includes any entity that was in existence on or before january 1 2020 is not engaged in active business is not owned by a foreign person has not experienced any change in ownership in the preceding 12 month period has not in the preceding 12 month period sent or received an amount greater than 1 000 and does not hold any assets whether in the united states or abroad including but not limited to any ownership interest in any entity the cta does not require beneficial ownership reporting for any entity in which the ownership interests are wholly owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an exempt entity fincen has the authority under the cta to add more exemptions but did not choose to do so in this nprm when reports are due if an entity finds that it meets the requirements of any of the 23 exemptions then it is not required to file any information with fincen under the cta fincen did invite public comment under the nprm on whether it should permit exempt entities to voluntarily file an exemption certificate if an exempt entity no longer meets the exemption criteria it must file a report with fincen within 30 calendar days after the date it no longer qualifies as exempt those entities that qualify as reporting companies and are formed or registered to do business in the united states before the effective date of the cta will have 30 days from the effective date to file their beneficial ownership report with fincen any reporting company that is formed or registered to do business in the united states on or after the effective date of the cta will have 14 days from the date of formation or qualification to file its report with fincen the cta authorizes fincen to determine the effective date of the cta but fincen did not propose an effective date in the nprm instead fincen is currently seeking public comment on the timing of the effective date and any potential factors to be considered if a reporting company realizes that it filed any inaccurate information with fincen it has 14 days after such realization to file a report to correct the information the cta also includes a safe harbor for companies that correct inaccurate information they inadvertently filed if the corrected report filed within 14 days of realization was also filed within 90 days after the date that the inaccurate report was filed a reporting company must also provide an update to fincen within 30 days of any change to its beneficial ownership information the cta therefore creates an ongoing obligation for a reporting company to monitor the identity of its beneficial owners information required for reports reporting company information under the cta a reporting company must report certain information about itself its beneficial owner s and its company applicant s to ensure that reporting companies can be identified from the beneficial ownership information report fincen proposes that each reporting company report its name any alternative names through which the company is engaged in business d b a names its business street address its jurisdiction of formation or registration as well as a unique identification number the unique identification number must be a tin including an employer identification number ein or where a reporting company has not yet been issued a tin a dun bradstreet data universal numbering system duns number or a legal entity identifier lei beneficial ownership and company applicant information the cta also requires each reporting company to submit to fincen a report identifying each beneficial owner of the reporting company and each company applicant by 1 full legal name 2 date of birth 3 current residential or business street address and 4 unique identifying number from an acceptable identification document or if already obtained a fincen identifier the nprm indicates that identifying photographs or documents would also be submitted to fincen to verify the identifying number however as with the other rules fincen welcomes comments on the proposed collection of a scanned copy of an identification document an individual or a reporting company may obtain a fincen identifier from fincen by reporting the information required of such person or entity under the cta the individual or entity can then use its fincen identifier instead of the information usually required for beneficial ownership information reports for any future reports filed with fincen beneficial owner definition the cta defines a beneficial owner with respect to a reporting company as any individual who directly or indirectly through any contract arrangement understanding relationship or otherwise i exercises substantial control over the entity or ii owns or controls not less than 25 of the ownership interests of the entity fincen expects that a reporting company would identify at least one beneficial owner under that definition regardless of whether 1 any individual satisfies the ownership component or 2 exclusions to the definition of beneficial owner apply the nprm set forth the following three specific indicators of substantial control 1 service as a senior officer of a reporting company 2 authority over the appointment or removal of any senior officer or a dominant majority of the board of directors or similar body of a reporting company or 3 direction determination or decision of or substantial influence over important matters of a reporting company a person who meets any of these three indicators is most likely a beneficial owner however the ordinary execution of day to day managerial decisions with respect to one part of a reporting company s assets or employees typically should not in isolation cause the decision maker to be considered in substantial control of a reporting company and therefore a beneficial owner the nprm provides that ownership interests would include both equity in the reporting company and other types of interests such as capital or profit interests including partnership interests or convertible instruments warrants or rights or other options or privileges to acquire equity capital or other interests in a reporting company the nprm identifies ways in which an individual may own or control interest including direct or indirect ownership the nprm also specifies that an individual may directly or indirectly own or control an ownership interest in a reporting company through a trust or similar arrangement an individual s ownership interests of the reporting company shall include all ownership interests of any class or type and the percentage of such ownership interests that an individual owns or controls shall be determined by aggregating all of the individual s ownership interests in comparison to the undiluted ownership interests of the company the nprm describes five exceptions to the definition of beneficial owners that are included in the cta these exceptions relate to minor children nominees or other intermediaries employees inheritors and creditors company applicant definition under the cta a company applicant is defined as any individual who files a document that creates a domestic reporting company or who first registers a foreign reporting company with a secretary of state or similar office in the united states the proposed definition of a company applicant would also include any individual who directs or controls the filing of such a document by another person the additional requirement regarding directing or controlling the filing is designed to ensure that the reporting company provides information on individuals that are responsible for the decision to form a reporting company given that in many cases the company applicant may be an employee of a business formation service or law firm or an associate agent or family member who is filing the document on behalf of another individual fincen believes that the burden of this reporting requirement is minimal because the identity of any individual that meets the definition of company applicant both the person submitting the report and the person directing it should be readily available to reporting companies however fincen welcomes comments on this proposal for company applicants that provide a business service as a corporate or formation agent the reporting company would need to report the business address of any company applicant that files a document in the ordinary course of such individual s business consequences of inaccurate reports the cta makes it unlawful for any person to willfully provide or attempt to provide false or fraudulent beneficial ownership information to fincen or to willfully fail to report complete or updated beneficial ownership information to fincen the cta imposes civil and criminal penalties for any person who willfully violates its beneficial ownership information reporting obligation such person shall be liable for a civil penalty of up to 500 for each day a violation continues or has not been remedied and may be fined up to 10 000 and imprisoned for up to two years or both for a criminal violation the nprm clarifies certain terms used in the violations provision of the cta the term person includes any individual reporting company or other entity the term beneficial ownership information includes any information provided to fincen under the cta and a person provides or attempts to provide beneficial ownership information to fincen if such person does so directly or indirectly including by providing such information to another person for purposes of a report or application under the cta while only reporting companies are directly required to file reports or applications with fincen beneficial owners or company applicants who provide false information about themselves to those reporting companies can also be held liable next steps the cta once effective will completely change the landscape of entity formation and qualification in the united states an entity must first determine whether it is exempt or qualifies as a reporting company if a reporting company the entity must next identify any individuals that might be beneficial owners or company applicants of the reporting company once those individuals are identified the reporting company must submit a report identifying the four pieces of information for each individual as well as identifying information about the reporting company itself the willful failure to meet this reporting obligation may result in civil or criminal penalties attorneys and other agents should pay close attention to the reporting obligations and deadlines required by the cta attorneys and other agents should consider whether an entity they represent may be a reporting entity and whether the engagement would classify such attorney or other agent as a company applicant while the reporting companies are the only ones directly obligated to report to fincen attorneys and other agents that prepare reports for reporting companies may be exposed to liability if the reports submitted contain inaccurate information attorneys and other agents working on behalf of reporting companies should consider putting procedures in place to ensure the beneficial ownership information reports inevitably submitted to fincen contain accurate and up to date information while the nprm filled in some open gaps regarding the procedures related to the cta it still posed 40 questions to the public to further shape the proposed rules the notice and comment period for this nprm will close on february 7 2022 fincen also announced that the next two nprms will propose rules which will be open to public comment for the i implementation of the cta s protocols for access to and disclosure of beneficial information from fincen s secure database and ii revisions to fincen s current regulation concerning customer due diligence requirements for financial institutions the cdd rule to make the requirements of the cdd rule consistent with and non repetitive to the cta while companies have been given more guidance on how the cta will affect their obligations it will be necessary to stay up to date on the cta once the rules from each of the nprms become final and the effective date for the cta is set

speaker 1 00 00 a trip to the grocery store recently is looking a lot like the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020 where some shelves are empty and our favorite products are out of stock but why are we seeing this happen a second time around nearly two years later and not only are shelves empty but we are also seeing an increase in some food prices as well joining me to talk about the current supply chain shortages and why there s a spike in food prices is sdsu business lecture miro koic miro welcome speaker 2 00 30 thank you jade so speaker 1 00 31 why do you think we re seeing empty shelves at grocery stores a second time around speaker 2 00 36 well there are a lot of factors uh that are contributing to this especially now so the supply chain disruptions that kind of started this summer that carried over through the holiday shopping period are still with us obviously in the winter winter weather is not good um and we re seeing a lot of disruptive storms not just in the united states but in countries around the world that grow important crops like coffee uh so coffee prices for example apple might be increased substantially the aron variant of the coronavirus has been devastating uh not only for the sheer numbers but because it requires people to be absent whether on food production lines or at the grocery store so it really strains the labor pool and clearly the labor shortages due to the great resign has been a a factor in hollowing out employees at the supermarket level in the supermarkets which used to provide a pretty good standard of living for a lot of um individuals as they re unionized uh are are becoming a little more of a challenging place to work and make ends meet in higher cost market so all of that combined means there s less food and fewer workers in stores and fewer truckers delivering product to the stores we speaker 1 01 49 know meat poultry and eggs they re up by 12 5 how does the current supply shortage play a role in inflation speaker 2 01 56 well i think the the bigger issue is you know it s always a question of supply and demand what we saw is that amer uh for the last two years had been eating at home a lot more which puts a lot of strain on the supply chain so for example you know the average weekly grocery bill in 2019 was about 114 it was 160 during the first year of the pandemic and it was over 145 last year a little bit less than in the first year of the pandemic where more people just stayed home but still it s a 27 increase in the amount of groceries people are buying and if you have supply chain disruptions that means those shelves become bare much faster you know on average most grocery stores have an out of stock on items that can range from five to 10 10 if they re not well managed 5 if they re fairly well managed speaker 2 02 48 so when consumers walk into a store most of the shelves look full but now that outta stock ratio is over 15 which in some cases it seems like a lot of shelves are empty and and it s not a good look for the groceries uh chain and and consumers then there s a whole issue of psychology around well if things are missing i need to buy more things so i can store them for the future especially non perishables so that becomes a major issue and so that means also that when there s a less product available groceries can charge more because you know consumers will pay a premium for what is available uh whether it s meat or or poultry or eggs which you know rose faster than the inflation rate um in 2021 speaker 1 03 32 california senate bill 7 87 went into effect the first of this year which requires pigs calves a and hns raise for food to have room to move and lay down at farms they gotta be free range you know the law bands the sale of products from facilities that don t meet the guidelines has this law played a role in the food supply shortage we re seeing now speaker 2 03 53 it will play a bit of a role not a huge role because you know depending on the farm if they can export that product to states that don t require the same constraints it might create short term constraints in the state of california i think a lot of farmers have been moving to anticipate the need for the requirements that this bill put on on farmers um so you know are they a hundred percent there no uh will it impact grocery prices in the short term yeah and and it s unfortunate because um it has a you know good intent uh the timing with everything else that s going on uh just is a bad time and so we may see in california some of these prices a little bit higher for probably a few weeks longer than they ll start to calm down in the rest of the country speaker 1 04 38 how have labor shortages affected food supplies at grocery speaker 2 04 42 stores labor shortages have been interesting you know there s three sectors that have really not recovered since the pandemic most other sectors are within a couple of percent of where they were from an employment perspective hospitality which is the worst sector at the moment which includes restaurants bars hotels and retail and trucking are the two other sectors that are behind so in the retail sector five to 7 below where we were pre pandemic which includes grocery stores truckers a lot of truckers are kind of baby boomers or gen x they re a little bit older there s a lot that have retired early and that combination has really put a strain on grocery chains so for example in some parts of the country grocery chains are operating with as few as 50 of the workers that they normally have and because of the coronavirus in particular you know the absentee level at a grocery store tends to be somewhere in the two to 3 range on average normally but right now we re it s pushing seven to 10 or more depending if there s a you know particular outbreak in a specific store that means that there s fewer people to stock the shelves so sometimes there may be inventory in the store it s just not enough people to be able to bring that on the shelves and merchandise it so it could be sold to consumers so labor shortages combined with weather combined with the virus have really kind of reached havoc on on the supermarkets when do you think speaker 1 06 11 stores will go back to being fully stocked or at least more stocked speaker 2 06 15 i think as the only coronavirus kind of uh plateaus a couple things are gonna happen you know fewer people will be sick so that means getting the the employee base in the store becomes important to have fully stock shells i think manufacturers in some key areas you know are ramping up production and they will you know meet demand relatively quickly most you know consumer companies uh we sell products in the grocery stores have taken price increases in the last year of anywhere from three to 5 and you know they re eager not to hurt their brands by their brands being outta stock so i think that fundamentally what we re gonna see is we re gonna start seeing the market coming back to normal at a national level sometime toward the end of the february is the more harsh winter storms start to decline and then uh we ll see it probably in california uh sometime in the late first quarter into second quarter uh where we should at least see more full shelves and maybe a a plant towing of the price increases all right speaker 1 07 16 i ve been speaking with the sdsu business lecture mur coic mural thank you so much speaker 2 07 22 thanks jade have a great day

currently available chronic kidney disease therapies can slow the condition s progression but they can t stop the decline in organ function regenerative medicine company prokidney is offering the potential for a different outcome tissue repair the biotech is conducting a pivotal test of its cell therapy and it has agreed to a merger deal that takes the company public and infuses it with 825 million to support its clinical trial plans sponsored post behavioral health interoperability and econsent meeting the demands of cms final rule compliance in a webinar on april 16 at 1pm et aneesh chopra will moderate a discussion with executives from docusign velatura and behavioral health providers on econsent health information exchange and compliance with the cms final rule on interoperability prokidney a biotech that maintains operations in winston salem north carolina and palo alto california announced tuesday that it is merging with social capital suvretta holdings corp iii a special purpose acquisition company or spac the merger has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies when the transaction closes the combined company will operate under the prokidney name and trade on the nasdaq under the stock symbol prok chronic kidney disease ckd can result from a variety of conditions including diabetes and hypertension regardless of the cause the disorder leads to steadily worsening kidney function over time when patients reach the point of kidney failure they need either regular dialysis or a kidney transplant most of the ckd therapies available are small molecules designed to address some aspect of kidney function astrazeneca drug farxiga and invokana from johnson johnson both belong to a class of class of diabetes medicines known as sglt2 inhibitors these drugs prevent kidneys from reabsorbing glucose back into the blood in ckd these drugs reduce the risk of worsening renal function a relatively new bayer drug works in a different way blocking a receptor whose overactivation is associated with the inflammation and scarring that develops from ckd that bayer drug kerendia won its fda approval last july the experimental chronic kidney disease treatment of prokidney is autologous meaning it s made from a patient s own cells the personalized therapy is made from a biopsy of a patient s diseased kidney from that small sample prokidney identifies and isolates three key types of progenitor cells cells that have the capability to differentiate into other types of cells these cells are multiplied in a lab and suspended on a hydrogel scaffold this formulation is then injected into the patient s kidney where it migrates to the injured portions of the organ to promote the generation of new structures in nephrons the urine producing units of the kidneys prokidney calls its experimental treatment renal autologous cell therapy or react sponsored content a deep dive into specialty pharma a specialty drug is a class of prescription medications used to treat complex chronic or rare medical conditions although this classification was originally intended to define the treatment of rare also termed orphan diseases affecting fewer than 200 000 people in the us more recently specialty drugs have emerged as the cornerstone of treatment for chronic and complex diseases such as cancer autoimmune conditions diabetes hepatitis c and hiv aids so far react has been tested in a phase 2 study enrolling 81 diabetic patients with ckd according to preliminary results outlined in a social capital suvretta investor presentation about half of the patients who received the prokidney cell therapy showed improvement in kidney filtration rate more than 80 of those responders are projected to never progress to end stage renal disease or renal replacement therapy which includes dialysis by contrast more than two thirds of the study participants who received the standard of care are projected to progress to end stage renal disease and dialysis the prokidney cell therapy has been safe so far with no adverse effects reported from repeat injections of react based on the positive mid stage data prokidney this month began a phase 3 clinical trial the study is a randomized clinical trial that includes a control arm in which participants will be given sham injections the 1 000 to 1 500 study participants will be between 30 and 80 years old with type 2 diabetes and moderate to severe ckd the fda has given react a regenerative medicine advanced therapy rmat designation which permits regular interaction with the fda throughout the pivotal study prokidney expects a primary analysis of data will occur in 2025 the spac merger is structured to infuse prokidney with about 825 million that sum breaks down to 250 million from social capital suvretta as well as 575 million from entities that have agreed to purchase shares of the combined company at 10 per share this additional private investment will include contributions from social capital prokidney s earlier investors suvretta capital affiliate averill and other undisclosed institutional investors and family offices prokidney s existing shareholders will be eligible to receive up to 17 5 million additional shares depending on the future stock performance of the company those shareholders and prokidney s management have also agreed to lock up 50 of their shares until five years or regulatory marketing authorization for react whichever comes first in the merger announcement prokidney said that while the phase 3 study is ongoing the company will build manufacturing capabilities to support a potential commercial launch in late 2025 to mid 2026 at the outset the company expects it would be able to supply react to 20 000 patients annually following the launch the company will build additional manufacturing facilities that could serve an additional 40 000 to 45 000 patients per year prokidney is led by founder and ceo tim bertram whose career includes stints at smithkline beecham pfizer and tengion a winston salem based biotech that was developing regenerative therapies for the bladder and kidneys tengion reached early clinical testing but was unable to find a partner to finance further development of those programs in 2014 running low on cash the company filed for bankruptcy protection and liquidated its assets

jericho s investment highlights differentiated deal flow and public investor access to early stage high growth hydrogen related companies newtown pa and vancouver bc accesswire january 18 2022 jericho energy ventures tsxv jev frankfurt jlm0 otc pink jroof jericho or jev or the company is pleased to announce it has led a seed series fundraising round for supercritical solutions ltd supercritical a company focused on developing its new class of water electrolyzer for the production of low cost clean hydrogen jericho s usd 1 78 million lead investment is joined by chris sacca s lowercarbon capital and new energy technology for a total commitment of usd 3 6 million which supercritical intends to use to support ongoing development of its disruptive electrolyzer technology existing investors include global mining company anglo american and deep science ventures an underappreciated and fundamental flaw in electrolyzer design is the inability to output hydrogen at the pressures required for storage transportation and most end use cases this is due to a number of factors including the sensitivity of most electrolyzers membranes to high pressures as a result expensive and maintenance intensive compressors are required to be co located with almost all electrolyzers increasing the true cost and complexity of clean hydrogen supercritical has developed a new class of electrolyzer who s proprietary membraneless design enables it to exploit the benefits of supercritical water outputting gases at over 200 bar of pressure this delivers a step change in efficiency for the production of hydrogen and eliminates expensive hydrogen compressors in most applications supercritical s technology takes direct aim at decarbonizing industrial hydrogen use cases already a 120 billion market today hydrogen for use in ammonia production and hydrocarbon refining requires pressures of 70 230 bar with most gaseous storage applications ranging from 350 700 bar big picture hydrogen is a required molecule for our global net zero ambition that s why over 70 countries have outlined hydrogen roadmaps for their decarbonization goals to utilize hydrogen as a fuel feedstock and store of energy bank of america¹ estimates that hydrogen could inhabit 24 of total global energy needs by 2050 creating as much as 11 trillion in investment opportunities over the next few decades clean hydrogen is produced by splitting water h2o via renewable supplies of electricity in an electrolyzer while the market for hydrogen is expected to grow 8x by 2050 with 1 of hydrogen production currently clean electrolyzer markets have the capacity to grow 800x based only on replacing the current carbon emitting hydrogen production used in industrial applications e g ammonia and refining increasing applications to include heating gas biofuels or in mobile or stationary power drives a further potential growth 1000x 4000x larger than current demand according to a november 2021 report by jefferies equity research² current industrial hydrogen demand equates to 550 1800gw of electrolysis while global total electrolyzer capacity is estimated at only 3gw today why is this technology disruptive to the hydrogen ecosystem today s electrolyzers largely use a traditional membrane based architecture and output hydrogen in the 10 40 bar pressure range however the set of applications for low pressure hydrogen is limited almost every hydrogen storage transportation or application modality requires expensive multi stage gaseous compression which can represent 1 1 50 kg or upwards of 25 of the delivered cost of clean hydrogen for example in the generation of ammonia nh3 a 70 billion market representing 55 of today s hydrogen utilization 200 bar pressure hydrogen is required at the input of the haber bosch conversion process similar 200 250 bar pressures are seen throughout industry and 300 700 bar pressures are common in storage and transportation applications takeaway due to its low volumetric density read it takes up a lot of space the storage transportation and utilization of hydrogen are nearly universally combined with compression for higher pressures fully eliminating or significantly reducing the need for costly and fault prone gaseous compression is critical to achieving the lowest cost of pressurized clean hydrogen for most applicable use cases supercritical s electrolyzer is the only technology to solve this how does the technology actually work supercritical s unique electrolyzer design is able to tolerate and exploit the benefits of electrolysis of water under thermodynamic supercritical conditions that is water at high temperature and pressure importantly the bonds between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms of water are weakened and as such require less electrical energy i e lower cost to split the bonds and free hydrogen atoms this is important because 70 80 of the levelized cost of generated hydrogen is operating expenses primarily driven by the cost of electricity the challenge traditional electrolyzers face operating at supercritical conditions is that their membranes or diaphragms would disintegrate and their physical structure would fail under these relatively high pressures and temperatures resulting in failure of the electrolyzer takeaway supercritical s innovative design enables the pressurization and heating of the feed water the performance of electrolysis with reduced electrical energy while separating the gases and recovering both the oxygen and hydrogen at high pressure a video highlighting supercritical s breakthrough technology can be viewed here don t just take our word for it other groups are taking notice supercritical has already won multiple government grants and accolades with

yes but u s health officials say early data suggests they may be less sensitive at picking it up government recommendations for using at home tests haven t changed people should continue to use them when a quick result is important the bottom line is the tests still detect covid 19 whether it is delta or alpha or omicron says dr emily volk president of the college of american pathologists government scientists have been checking to make sure the rapid tests still work as each new variant comes along and this week the food and drug administration said preliminary research indicates they detect omicron but may have reduced sensitivity the agency noted it s still studying how the tests perform with the variant which was first detected in late november dr anthony fauci the top u s infectious disease expert said the fda wanted to be totally transparent by noting the sensitivity might come down a bit but that the tests remain important there are many good uses for at home tests volk says combined with vaccination they can make you more comfortable about gathering with family and friends if you ve been exposed to a person who tested positive but you don t have symptoms a rapid test five days later can give a good indication of whether you caught the virus it can also help if you re not sure whether your runny nose or sore throat is covid 19 but consider the context when looking at results if you feel sick after going out to a nightclub in an area with high infection rates for example you should look at a negative result from an at home test with a little more skepticism volk says following up with a pcr test is a good idea she says those tests are more accurate and are done at testing sites and hospitals
seven is often seen as a lucky number but not this time the consumer price index is up 7 in december from december 2020 that s the highest rate of annual increase in inflation in almost 40 years since june of 1982 even core prices if you exclude volatile items like food and energy even then still the fastest pace of increase in almost 31 years and what today s report tells us i think just validates what millions of households already knew and that is inflation is a problem prices are going up and they re going up pervasively and they re going up at a rate that outpaces growth and household income in many cases food prices are up over 6 energy prices up over 29 and shelter costs which tend to lag already up over 4 year over a year and i think that s the one to watch in the months ahead the federal reserve had what i would describe as a very lazy faire attitude toward inflation in 2021 and only at the end of the year did they really get the memo that this is a problem and as a result we ve seen them pivot very quickly in terms of how they view it and how they plan to address it specifically we will see the feds start to raise short term interest rates they re likely to start that as soon as march and around that time or shortly thereafter they will not only stop buying bonds and adding to their portfolio they will start letting the size of that portfolio shrink letting it run off that has the effect of pulling liquidity out of the system so even though that happens behind the scenes i think that s arguably the more significant item both of those will slow the demand side of the economy over time but they re not going to address nor fix the issues with the supply chain advertisement peloton is hiking prices because of inflation share copy link copy peloton says inflation and supply chain challenges have forced the company to hike the price of its flagship bike just five months after cutting it drastically to boost sagging sales beginning jan 31 customers will be required to pay 250 for delivery and setup for peloton s 1 495 bike a service that the company previously included in the price customers buying peloton s tread treadmills will be charged a 350 fee for delivery and installation starting later this month with these fees the price of the bike in the united states will jump to 1 745 and the peloton tread will soon cost 2 845 peloton also said it will hike the base price of both pieces of equipment for customers in the united kingdom germany and australia although it will continue to include delivery and setup for no extra charge peloton said in a statement that continued constraints are driving up costs a complaint echoed by companies across several industries like many other businesses peloton is being impacted by global economic and supply chain challenges that are affecting the majority if not all businesses worldwide it said even with these increases we believe we still offer the best value in connected fitness and offer consumers various financing options that make peloton accessible to a wide audience the 2 495 price of its higher end bike will remain the same and will continue to include delivery and setup at no extra charge peloton reduced the price of its bike by roughly 20 in august 2021 to jumpstart sales it tried to keep up with the breakneck pace of 2020 when the company s products skyrocketed in popularity as gyms closed and people were forced to work out at home but a massive tread recall gyms reopening and unfortunate cameo on hbo s sex and the city sequel made peloton s 2021 rougher than it had expected peloton revealed in its most recent earnings report that sales of its stationary bikes and treadmills fell 17 those two machines are the company s bread and butter making up 60 of its business peloton shares fell nearly 3 in premarket trading and the stock is down 80 over the past year

follow us today it s fair to say that the covid 19 pandemic has been disastrous for many global industries but especially for car companies because of the way they ve been strangled by parts shortages and idling factories gm alone saw revenues decrease by 40 last year and the general s not alone in its misery thanks to a shortage of semiconductor microchips the global auto industry is estimated to have lost a colossal 210 billion in 2021 chip shortages and covid when covid hit and the car industry had to slow right down demand for chips skyrocketed from the electronics sector with people around the world forced to stay home there was a huge uptick in sales of phones tvs computers games and other home electronics that use chips from manufacturers that also supply the auto industry by the time auto manufacturers were ready to being building cars again in the summer of 2020 most of the world s microchip production as well as future production contracts were spoken for by the more lucrative electronics industry there was also a factory fire at renesas electronics in japan which hit ford particularly hard it would be six months before the factory returned to pre fire production levels of course it goes without saying that covid forcing the closure of chip factories in the major productions areas of china taiwan and south korea only made the precious chips more scarce another issue for the auto industry was the fact that vehicles were being designed as if there were an unlimited number of chips available leading to many of the tiny but vital components being used for small individual purposes in a vehicle from brakes and transmission control to adjusting the lumbar support in a power seat future designs will rely less on individual chips controlling every little function dealer markups the upshot of all these supply problems and covid shutdowns is fewer vehicles for customers to buy and as a result of the high demand and low stock volumes the much despised practice of dealer mark ups such mark ups have always existed because the dealer buys the vehicle from the manufacturer and then needs to turn a profit but covid and the resulting chip shortage have seen mark ups soar to dizzying new heights with fewer units to sell and more people wanting to buy dealers across the industry have been adding eye watering mark ups to the price of new vehicles lucid s direct sales model is the antidote to this problem video creator jon rettinger who provided lucid fans with videos of the over the air updates received by his lucid air dream edition was actually trying to buy a mercedes eqs and had one reserved at a dealership when he received a call informing him that there would be a 50 000 mark up on the vehicle s 119 000 msrp he said no thanks and headed over to lucid to buy direct from the manufacturer and avoid such price hikes here s a story i was originally going to get a mercedesbenzusa eqs 580 even had one reserved and ready for pickup the dealer called to inform me there was a 50k not a typo markup on the car i passed infer what you will about the dealer model protecting consumers jon rettinger jon4lakers december 29 2021 guess who hates the direct sales model if you said car dealers you d be right dealers have been part of the buying process for decades and can be a powerful political force when they want to be by putting pressure on state lawmakers some dealers organizations have been able to outlaw direct sales entirely while others make it possible though a hassle for the manufacturer tesla took a lot of heat from legislators and dealers unions when it became the poster child for direct sales though this has eased somewhat since rivian also sells vehicles direct to consumer whether you re for or against the direct sales model for vehicles it s undeniable that a 50 000 mark up would be enough to push all but the most fanatically dedicated customers away from a company and into the arms of a rival that doesn t hit them with similar mark ups with evs growing ever more favored as the personal transport of the future and the newer ev companies selling direct to customer legacy manufacturers will need to do something about the situation or risk falling behind to the new kids on the block for now as mr rettinger was told by a mercedes rep when he reached out to inform the company of the outrageous price hike manufacturers are legally powerless to dictate a dealer s price for their vehicles images by lucid motors licensed by cc by 2 0 james walker is an automotive journalist at torque news focusing on lucid motors if it s got wheels he s interested in it and he s very excited to see what kind of cars the ev revolution brings us whether it s fast slow new or old james wants to have a look around it and share it in print and on video ideally with some twisty roads involved you can connect with james on twitter instagram and linkedin

joe biden one year how is he doing so far published 19 january 2022 share close panel copy link about sharing related topics coronavirus image source epa when he took office as the 46th us president joe biden declared that his ascension was the triumph not of a candidate but of a cause the cause of democracy speaking to a divided country in the midst of a pandemic just weeks after the capitol riot he vowed to bring back unity and do great things we can right wrongs we can put people to work in good jobs we can teach our children in safe schools we can overcome this deadly virus he said a year into his presidency we take a look at what progress mr biden has made his standing with the american public and what it all means for the president going forward with analysis from the bbc s north america correspondent anthony zurcher how are his approval ratings despite a bitter presidential race mr biden began his term with 56 of the country approving of his performance according to realclearpolitics and having won more than 80 million votes more than any other president but in his first year he has had a startling slide in fortunes his star began to fall at the time of a widely criticised withdrawal of us troops from afghanistan and as the delta variant advanced since then his approval ratings have fallen further as he has struggled to deliver on his biggest campaign promises to tame the pandemic and restore prosperity for working families compared with other recent presidents only donald trump has had a more disappointing first year his approval rating fell from 45 on his inauguration day to 35 a year later according to historical trends by gallup mr biden s former boss barack obama began at a high of nearly 70 when he took office and ended close to 50 a year later george w bush began his first term in a similar position to mr biden with approval around 60 but that rose to nearly 90 after 9 11 anthony zurcher it s hard to say that the honeymoon is over for joe biden because he never really had one his ratings started modestly positive without the kind of big inaugural bump most presidents not named donald trump receive now his numbers are in the danger zone for first term presidents hoping to win re election a reflection of near universal republican dislike and a majority of independents who are souring on him has he got the pandemic under control president biden who says he carries a card in his pocket with the number of americans killed by the virus has made it clear that tackling the pandemic is his top priority the main pillars of his covid plan rested on a widespread vaccination campaign and a massive increase in testing in his first year he has expanded vaccine availability and currently about 75 of the us has had at least one dose and 63 are fully vaccinated children as young as 5 have been eligible for the vaccine since november 80 million booster doses have been administered to help protect against omicron and free at home rapid tests have just become available to order this week but the rise of variants and continued opposition to vaccines by some mean the pandemic is far from over over the course of the year the us has undergone three major waves of the virus and more than 850 000 americans have died from covid the highest recorded national death toll from the global pandemic anthony zurcher mr biden declared in a july speech that the us could celebrate independence from the covid 19 pandemic that may sit next to george w bush s iraq war mission accomplished banner in the hall of premature presidential victory declarations while the white house will get credit for enacting a massive pandemic relief bill in may its inability to prepare for the challenges presented by the delta and omicron variants have turned what seemed like looming success into a long hard slog how has the us economy fared under his watch for many americans the number one issue facing the country is the economy when mr biden took office the pandemic had slowed job growth and the us had faced unemployment woes due to lockdown employment rebounded somewhat over the last year with 6 4 million jobs added though total employment remains lower than its pre pandemic level jobless claims have dropped to a near 50 year low but other economic headwinds have arisen instead millions of americans have quit their jobs though this shows confidence in the job market some industries now face a labour shortage contributing to global supply chain problems and fuelling rocketing inflation consumer prices were up 7 from december 2020 21 the biggest increase since the 1980s anthony zurcher mr biden took office as the us economy was beginning to emerge from a year of pandemic lockdowns the good news for him was falling unemployment a booming stock market and record setting growth the bad news is that the velocity of the rebound led to supply chain struggles and inflation levels not seen in decades if the economy can shake those negative aspects off his record will look good but the problems have not been as transitory as the administration promised has he delivered on immigration reforms one of mr biden s promises while running for office was to end the separation of migrant families and detention of children at the border a trump era policy that angered the left the president kept his word on ending the so called zero tolerance policy and the number of minors held in detention centres has plummeted but since he took office the us has seen an influx of migrants that has created new challenges in 2021 there were almost 2 million encounters between migrants and us border officers including 165 000 involving minors long term reforms remain elusive mr biden s plan to offer legal status to an estimated 11 million undocumented people in the us has stalled in congress and he failed to overturn a trump era policy that made migrants wait in mexico while their asylum cases were heard in the us meanwhile he has defended the use of a trump policy that lets the government automatically expel undocumented asylum seekers in order to stop the spread of covid 19 he used the so called title 42 policy to kick 4 000 haitians out of texas drawing widespread condemnation anthony zurcher there was always going to be an uptick in undocumented border crossings after the pandemic depressed migration levels for much of 2020 what was somewhat unexpected was that mr biden s immigration reforms the ones he delivered on super charged the migratory crisis swamping us border facilities unprepared for the surge the result is that few people have been satisfied with the outcomes what are his accomplishments mr biden was able to achieve some early successes passing a 1 9tn pandemic relief bill in march he also got the us to rejoin the paris climate agreement delivered 100 million jabs for 50 million people in 100 days and reversed the ban on transgender people in the military despite opposition from republicans and a fractured democratic caucus he managed to pass a 1tn infrastructure bill in november a longer term accomplishment may be his prolific appointment of judges he has named more in his first year than any president since ronald reagan however mr biden was dealt a major blow this week when members of his own party made it clear they wouldn t help him push his voting reforms through congress it wasn t the first time senators kyrsten sinema and joe manchin moderate democrats in key swing states have also held back his social spending bill and climate agenda
by david shepardson washington reuters at t nyse and verizon communications nyse on tuesday agreed to temporarily defer turning on some wireless towers near key airports to avert a significant disruption to u s flights as they roll out 5g service that will bring faster wireless service to tens of millions of people president joe biden hailed the agreement saying it will avoid potentially devastating disruptions to passenger travel cargo operations and our economic recovery while allowing more than 90 of wireless tower deployment to occur as scheduled late tuesday the federal aviation administration updated its list of airports that planes with approved radio altimeter equipment could use to include major airports like new york s jfk and laguardia los angeles chicago s o hare and midway san francisco and seattle the faa was also expected to update its list of airbus and boeing nyse planes with the approved equipment in the coming hours the updates should dramatically lessen the impact of the nearly 1 500 notices of 5g restrictions that the faa had issued airlines and the faa warned that new restrictions as a result of 5g service which verizon and at t are to launch on wednesday would still prompt some flight disruptions delta air lines nyse said while the wireless moves were a positive development some flight restrictions may remain united airlines told customers on a flight from denver to houston that a three hour delay was a result of the new 5g systems according to a notice on its website it also suggested customers with any concerns reach out to the federal communications commission the faa has warned that 5g wireless interference could affect sensitive airplane instruments such as radio altimeters and significantly hamper low visibility operations the faa said it anticipated there will be some impacts due to the limitations of some radio altimeters verizon will temporarily not turn on about 500 towers near airports sources told reuters or less than 10 of their planned deployment while the carriers and the administration work on a permanent solution sources briefed on the matter said details of the agreement including the length of the pause were not disclosed both verizon and at t will launch 5g elsewhere in the country federal communications commission chair jessica rosenworcel said in a statement that the faa has a process in place to assess altimeter performance in the 5g environment and resolve any remaining concerns it is essential that the faa now complete this process with both care and speed airlines for america a passenger and cargo trade group said the pause provides the opportunity to ensure all stakeholders consumers and the u s economy are served in the long run this is the third time that at t and verizon agreed to delay deployment of the new c band 5g wireless service the companies in november postponed deployment by 30 days until jan 5 and then agreed to delay deployment until jan 19 nearly all but a handful of the impacted sites are verizon towers officials said still the faa and airlines must grapple with how to resolve the concerns permanently especially since at t and verizon earlier agreed to take some measures to reduce interference for six months despite the agreement major foreign carriers including air india and japan s biggest airline ana holdings said they had canceled some u s bound flights because of possible 5g interference ana said on its website it had canceled some boeing 777 flights after boeing announced flight restrictions on all airlines operating the boeing 777 aircraft boeing did not immediately comment airlines are likely to cancel some additional flights in the coming hours as they wait for formal guidance from the faa on the announcements from verizon and at t they warned monday of catastrophic impacts airlines had raised concerns that the issue could prevent them from flying boeing 777s and other widebody jets to many key airports the chief executives of major u s passenger and cargo carriers on monday said the new 5g service could render a significant number of widebody aircraft unusable could potentially strand tens of thousands of americans overseas and cause chaos for u s flights the airlines asked that 5g be implemented everywhere in the country except within the approximate 2 miles 3 2 km of airport runways at some key airports verizon s rollout plan is much more aggressive than at t s it is significantly impacted by the biden administration request to delay using some towers near airport runways at t and verizon won significant c band spectrum in an 80 billion auction last year verizon chief executive hans vestberg told employees on jan 4 the carrier saw no aviation safety issue with 5g and had resisted prior delays officials told reuters

corvallis ore ktvz hatchery raised steelhead trout have offspring that are good at gaining size under hatchery conditions but don t survive as well in streams as steelhead whose parents are wild fish new research by oregon state university shows the results published in plos one suggest that it may be possible to change rearing methods to produce hatchery fish that are more like wild steelhead which could help them survive better and also allay concerns about them mixing with wild populations said osu scientist michael blouin who led the study steelhead hatcheries provide fish for harvest and to supplement wild stocks of an iconic species that s ecologically culturally and recreationally significant like salmon steelhead oncorhynchus mykiss are anadromous meaning they travel to the ocean as smolts and return to their natal streams to spawn hatcheries raise eggs and juvenile fish for about a year and then release them to go to sea it is well established that hatchery fish make better brood stock than wild fish producing more fish that return for harvest blouin said on the other hand hatchery fish produce fewer returning offspring when both spawn in the wild this tradeoff appears to happen because hatcheries are inadvertently favoring genes that promote growth in the hatchery environment at a cost to survival in the wild he said the new research suggests there may be a way to modify hatchery conditions so they don t accidentally select for traits valuable to juveniles in a fish raising environment at the expense of traits that will be needed after release in evolutionary biology selection refers to the process of beneficial genes being passed on to improve a species chance of survival in a particular environment the scientists hypothesis was that genes favored in the hatchery are disfavored in the wild causing the tradeoff blouin professor of integrative biology and collaborators at oregon state the oregon department of fish and wildlife and the abernathy fish technology center looked at multiple full sibling families of steelhead that were spawned either by two wild parents or two first generation hatchery raised parents all of the families offspring were grown together under hatchery conditions and under seminatural conditions in artificial streams blouin said families of hatchery raised parents grew significantly faster in the hatchery but had significantly lower survival in the streams that the tradeoff was apparent after just one generation of selection suggests that the traits involved are under very strong selection salmon trout and steelhead raised in hatcheries regularly have lower fitness the number of adult offspring that survive to return from the sea than wild fish when both spawn in the wild he said the bigger a hatchery smolt is at time of release the better its odds of surviving in the ocean blouin said a hatchery environment has no predators lots of calorie dense food and is very crowded but a natural stream is a low food predator filled environment behaviors or physiological traits that allow some juvenile fish to take advantage of the hatchery and grow quickly might make them prone to starvation or being eaten by predators in the wild as part of the same study the researchers looked at whether reducing the fat content of trout feed to make it more like a wild diet might reduce the inadvertent selection in the hatchery but found no evidence that particular modification would have an effect researchers are now focused on testing whether other changes to standard hatchery rearing methods could be used to make hatchery fish more like wild fish he said collaborators on this project include madeleine wrey stephanie bollmann and claudio fuentes of the oregon state college of science james skaar of the odfw and ronald twibell of the abernathy fish technology center the bonneville power administration and the oregon department of fish and wildlife supported this research

cleveland oh accesswire january 18 2022 innovest global inc otc pink ivst a diversified industrials company continues corporate and operational milestones and goals for 2022 sales have increased after the decline in 2020 overhead that scaled to accommodate previous rapid growth has been reduced by over 70 percent since the contraction period in advance of new planned growth and existing operations are strong and profitable a brief company history current status and 2022 plan follow innovest was founded in 2017 with plans to acquire operating companies integrate them and create value for shareholders by streamlining and growing those companies by doing so a platform company which would have a solid business foundation and could scale meaningfully would result despite limited capitalization the company grew quickly executing multiple acquisitions and beginning with just 50 thousand in sales for 2017 reaching 40 million in sales for 2019 with growing gross profits significant prospects for organic growth and was on track with its business plans and goals during 2020 covid 19 disrupted ordinary operations prompting cuts and the effects of the disruptions were amplified in the curtainwall commercial construction segment that business had inherited an eight figure contract on acquisition which had unknown risks due to the fact that the prior owner had passed away prior to acquisition while the structure insulated the parent company innovest s direct exposure to those risks the success of that business required either the success of the inherited project or success in securing additional such projects prior to covid 19 several such large projects were in the pipeline for the subsidiary but were ultimately put on hold by potential clients due to the pandemic as a result of this and other factors as well as other impacted subsidiaries the decision was made to cut costs focus on unaffected subsidiaries and limit the pursuit of other new acquisitions until the business climate stabilized also during 2020 innovest exited biotechnology to focus solely on industrial businesses by spinning off its stemvax therapeutics subsidiary to novaccess global this exit resulted in an improvement to innovest s balance sheet from a zero dollar illiquid asset of stemvax to 7 5 million shares of xsnx worth over 3 million on innovest s most recently reported quarter during 2021 this plan to focus on the present climate parameters was executed to ensure the sustainability of the company in contrast to previous years which focused on growth and overhead structures to accommodate that growth the 2022 plan was begun including items which will continue to improve the balance sheet significantly grow the company and provide direct value to shareholders by actions more fully described below 2021 also marked the addition of gpc capital as a principal entering 2022 the company has a lean overhead structure and two profitable subsidiaries one is a commercial energy brokerage business operating throughout the usa the other is a domestic call center service business clients as customer service and business to business sales which is pci compliant and adheres to hipaa for its healthcare clients all of the agents are usa based overhead cuts were primarily achieved from elimination of executive level compensation positions which were previously in place to pursue new acquisitions integrate acquisitions and operate as a centralized management structure the present decentralized adjustment allowed the company to make reductions to overhead of over 70 percent while only seeing headcount decline from approximately 100 to approximately 70 over 90 percent of employees presently on payroll are either billed to clients or directly sell this has stabilized the company from experiencing losses during the growth years to approximately breaking even from subsidiary profits despite a significant decline in revenue due to the previously described events current status developments and 2022 milestones board of directors per the aforementioned strategic changes the 2022 board will be appointed during the first quarter presently pursuant to requirements of nevada law and the company s bylaws the company has a single director shaheed bailey a principal of gpc capital officers mr bailey is interim ceo and interim cfo ali manov is the chief operating officer reporting status current reporting status ie removal of yield sign with otc markets is expected by the first week in february liabilities innovest will definitively close non operating subsidiaries which is expected to be reflected on the second or third quarter 2022 reports resulting in a reduction of approximately 20 million in liabilities on innovest s books contributed from these subsidiaries and the innovest balance sheet having more assets than liabilities other liabilities will be more fully described and detailed in the company s annual report dividend as originally disclosed innovest has approved the distribution of the 7 5 million xsnx shares to innovest s shareholders as a free trading stock dividend this distribution requires novaccess to first register those shares novaccess has represented that it has prioritized the registration capitalization the company will continue to capitalize efforts by operations and will pay down existing debt and fund growth by efficiently and incrementally raising capital until such time that a significant equity capital raise would not detrimentally dilute common shareholders growth innovest plans to execute one meaningful acquisition in the second half of 2022 once other initiatives are accomplished when combined with the above activities this is expected to achieve the

seven is often seen as a lucky number but not this time the consumer price index is up 7 in december from december 2020 that s the highest rate of annual increase in inflation in almost 40 years since june of 1982 even core prices if you exclude volatile items like food and energy even then still the fastest pace of increase in almost 31 years and what today s report tells us i think just validates what millions of households already knew and that is inflation is a problem prices are going up and they re going up pervasively and they re going up at a rate that outpaces growth and household income in many cases food prices are up over 6 energy prices up over 29 and shelter costs which tend to lag already up over 4 year over a year and i think that s the one to watch in the months ahead the federal reserve had what i would describe as a very lazy faire attitude toward inflation in 2021 and only at the end of the year did they really get the memo that this is a problem and as a result we ve seen them pivot very quickly in terms of how they view it and how they plan to address it specifically we will see the feds start to raise short term interest rates they re likely to start that as soon as march and around that time or shortly thereafter they will not only stop buying bonds and adding to their portfolio they will start letting the size of that portfolio shrink letting it run off that has the effect of pulling liquidity out of the system so even though that happens behind the scenes i think that s arguably the more significant item both of those will slow the demand side of the economy over time but they re not going to address nor fix the issues with the supply chain advertisement peloton is hiking prices because of inflation share copy link copy peloton says inflation and supply chain challenges have forced the company to hike the price of its flagship bike just five months after cutting it drastically to boost sagging sales beginning jan 31 customers will be required to pay 250 for delivery and setup for peloton s 1 495 bike a service that the company previously included in the price customers buying peloton s tread treadmills will be charged a 350 fee for delivery and installation starting later this month with these fees the price of the bike in the united states will jump to 1 745 and the peloton tread will soon cost 2 845 peloton also said it will hike the base price of both pieces of equipment for customers in the united kingdom germany and australia although it will continue to include delivery and setup for no extra charge peloton said in a statement that continued constraints are driving up costs a complaint echoed by companies across several industries like many other businesses peloton is being impacted by global economic and supply chain challenges that are affecting the majority if not all businesses worldwide it said even with these increases we believe we still offer the best value in connected fitness and offer consumers various financing options that make peloton accessible to a wide audience the 2 495 price of its higher end bike will remain the same and will continue to include delivery and setup at no extra charge peloton reduced the price of its bike by roughly 20 in august 2021 to jumpstart sales it tried to keep up with the breakneck pace of 2020 when the company s products skyrocketed in popularity as gyms closed and people were forced to work out at home but a massive tread recall gyms reopening and unfortunate cameo on hbo s sex and the city sequel made peloton s 2021 rougher than it had expected peloton revealed in its most recent earnings report that sales of its stationary bikes and treadmills fell 17 those two machines are the company s bread and butter making up 60 of its business peloton shares fell nearly 3 in premarket trading and the stock is down 80 over the past year

the decline in 2020 overhead that scaled to accommodate previous rapid growth has been reduced by over 70 percent since the contraction period in advance of new planned growth and existing operations are strong and profitable a brief company history current status and 2022 plan follow innovest was founded in 2017 with plans to acquire operating companies integrate them and create value for shareholders by streamlining and growing those companies by doing so a platform company which would have a solid business foundation and could scale meaningfully would result despite limited capitalization the company grew quickly executing multiple acquisitions and beginning with just 50 thousand in sales for 2017 reaching 40 million in sales for 2019 with growing gross profits significant prospects for organic growth and was on track with its business plans and goals during 2020 covid 19 disrupted ordinary operations prompting cuts and the effects of the disruptions were amplified in the curtainwall commercial construction segment that business had inherited an eight figure contract on acquisition which had unknown risks due to the fact that the prior owner had passed away prior to acquisition while the structure insulated the parent company innovest s direct exposure to those risks the success of that business required either the success of the inherited project or success in securing additional such projects prior to covid 19 several such large projects were in the pipeline for the subsidiary but were ultimately put on hold by potential clients due to the pandemic as a result of this and other factors as well as other impacted subsidiaries the decision was made to cut costs focus on unaffected subsidiaries and limit the pursuit of other new acquisitions until the business climate stabilized also during 2020 innovest exited biotechnology to focus solely on industrial businesses by spinning off its stemvax therapeutics subsidiary to novaccess global this exit resulted in an improvement to innovest s balance sheet from a zero dollar illiquid asset of stemvax to 7 5 million shares of xsnx worth over 3 million on innovest s most recently reported quarter during 2021 this plan to focus on the present climate parameters was executed to ensure the sustainability of the company in contrast to previous years which focused on

subsidiaries one is a commercial energy brokerage business operating throughout the usa the other is a domestic call center service business clients as customer service and business to business sales which is pci compliant and adheres to hipaa for its healthcare clients all of the agents are usa based overhead cuts were primarily achieved from elimination of executive level compensation positions which were previously in place to pursue new acquisitions integrate acquisitions and operate as a centralized management structure the present decentralized adjustment allowed the company to make reductions to overhead of over 70 percent while only seeing headcount decline from approximately 100 to approximately 70 over 90 percent of employees presently on payroll are either billed to clients or directly sell this has stabilized the company from experiencing losses during the growth years to approximately breaking even from subsidiary profits despite a significant decline in revenue due to

innovest s books contributed from these subsidiaries and the innovest balance sheet having more assets than liabilities other liabilities will be more fully described and detailed in the company s annual report dividend as originally disclosed innovest has approved the distribution of the 7 5 million xsnx shares to innovest s shareholders as a free trading stock dividend this distribution

jericho s investment highlights differentiated deal flow and public investor access to early stage high growth hydrogen related companies newtown pa and vancouver bc accesswire january 18 2022 jericho energy ventures tsxv jev frankfurt jlm0 otc pink jroof jericho or jev or the company is pleased to announce it has led a seed series fundraising round for supercritical solutions ltd supercritical a company focused on developing its new class of water electrolyzer for the production of low cost clean hydrogen jericho s usd 1 78 million lead investment is joined by chris sacca s lowercarbon capital and new energy technology for a total commitment of usd 3 6 million which supercritical intends to use to support ongoing development of its disruptive electrolyzer technology existing investors include global mining company anglo american and deep science ventures an underappreciated and fundamental flaw in electrolyzer design is the inability to output hydrogen at the pressures required for storage transportation and most end use cases this is due to a number of factors including the sensitivity of most electrolyzers membranes to high pressures as a result expensive and maintenance intensive compressors are required to be co located with almost all electrolyzers increasing the true cost and complexity of clean hydrogen supercritical has developed a new class of electrolyzer who s proprietary membraneless design enables it to exploit the benefits of supercritical water outputting gases at over 200 bar of pressure this delivers a step change in efficiency for the production of hydrogen and eliminates expensive hydrogen compressors in most applications supercritical s technology takes direct aim at decarbonizing industrial hydrogen use cases already a 120 billion market today hydrogen for use in ammonia production and hydrocarbon refining requires pressures of 70 230 bar with most gaseous storage applications ranging from 350 700 bar big picture hydrogen is a required molecule for our global net zero ambition that s why over 70 countries have outlined hydrogen roadmaps for their decarbonization goals to utilize hydrogen as a fuel feedstock and store of energy bank of america¹ estimates that hydrogen could inhabit 24 of total global energy needs by 2050 creating as much as 11 trillion in investment opportunities over the next few decades clean hydrogen is produced by splitting water h2o via renewable supplies of electricity in an electrolyzer while the market for hydrogen is expected to grow 8x by 2050 with 1 of hydrogen production currently clean electrolyzer markets have the capacity to grow 800x based only on replacing the current carbon emitting hydrogen production used in industrial applications e g ammonia and refining increasing applications to include heating gas biofuels or in mobile or stationary power drives a further potential growth 1000x 4000x larger than current demand according to a november 2021 report by jefferies equity research² current industrial hydrogen demand equates to 550 1800gw of electrolysis while global total electrolyzer capacity is estimated at only 3gw today why is this technology disruptive to the hydrogen ecosystem today s electrolyzers largely use a traditional membrane based architecture and output hydrogen in the 10 40 bar pressure range however the set of applications for low pressure hydrogen is limited almost every hydrogen storage transportation or application modality requires expensive multi stage gaseous compression which can represent 1 1 50 kg or upwards of 25 of the delivered cost of clean hydrogen for example in the generation of ammonia nh3 a 70 billion market representing 55 of today s hydrogen utilization 200 bar pressure hydrogen is required at the input of the haber bosch conversion process similar 200 250 bar pressures are seen throughout industry and 300 700 bar pressures are common in storage and transportation applications takeaway due to its low volumetric density read it takes up a lot of space the storage transportation and utilization of hydrogen are nearly universally combined with compression for higher pressures fully eliminating or significantly reducing the need for costly and fault prone gaseous compression is critical to achieving the lowest cost of pressurized clean hydrogen for most applicable use cases supercritical s electrolyzer is the only technology to solve this how does the technology actually work supercritical s unique electrolyzer design is able to tolerate and exploit the benefits of electrolysis of water under thermodynamic supercritical conditions that is water at high temperature and pressure importantly the bonds between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms of water are weakened and as such require less electrical energy i e lower cost to split the bonds and free hydrogen atoms this is important because 70 80 of the levelized cost of generated hydrogen is operating expenses primarily driven by the cost of electricity the challenge traditional electrolyzers face operating at supercritical conditions is that their membranes or diaphragms would disintegrate and their physical structure would fail under these relatively high pressures and temperatures resulting in failure of the electrolyzer takeaway supercritical s innovative design enables the pressurization and heating of the feed water the performance of electrolysis with reduced electrical energy while separating the gases and recovering both the oxygen and hydrogen at high pressure a video highlighting supercritical s breakthrough technology can be viewed here don t just take our word for it other groups are taking notice supercritical has already won multiple government grants and accolades with

energy ventures tsxv jev frankfurt jlm0 otc pink jroof jericho or jev or the company is pleased to announce it has led a seed series fundraising round for supercritical solutions ltd supercritical a

capital and new energy technology for a total commitment of usd 3 6 million which supercritical intends to use to support ongoing development of its disruptive electrolyzer technology existing investors include global mining company anglo american and deep science ventures an underappreciated and fundamental flaw in electrolyzer design is the inability to output hydrogen at the pressures required for storage transportation and most end use cases this is due to a number of factors including the sensitivity of most electrolyzers membranes to high pressures as a result expensive and maintenance intensive compressors are required to be co located with almost all electrolyzers increasing the true cost and complexity of clean hydrogen supercritical has developed a new class of electrolyzer who s proprietary membraneless design enables it to exploit the benefits of supercritical water outputting gases at over 200 bar of pressure this delivers a step change in efficiency for the production of hydrogen and eliminates expensive hydrogen compressors in most applications supercritical s technology takes direct aim at decarbonizing industrial hydrogen use cases already a 120 billion market today hydrogen for use in ammonia production and hydrocarbon refining requires pressures of 70 230 bar with most gaseous storage applications ranging from 350 700 bar big picture

and store of energy bank of america¹ estimates that hydrogen could inhabit 24 of total global energy needs by 2050 creating as much as 11 trillion in investment opportunities over the next few decades clean hydrogen is produced by splitting water h2o via renewable supplies of electricity in an electrolyzer while the market for hydrogen is expected to grow 8x by 2050 with 1 of hydrogen production currently clean electrolyzer markets have the capacity to grow 800x based only on replacing the current carbon emitting hydrogen production used in industrial applications e g ammonia and refining

aerial photo taken on may 5 2021 shows the colombo port city in colombo sri lanka despite some us and indian media outlets attempts to hype up the so called sri lankan debt crisis blaming china for it the fact remains that their claims are untenable fabricated by the us led west and india to mislead global public opinion and defame china especially demonize the china proposed belt and road initiative true sri lanka has a relatively high debt but it s not facing a debt crisis sri lanka s foreign debt of 35 billion accounts for about 75 percent of its gdp while that of many western countries exceeds 100 percent of their gdp also sri lanka s foreign debt repayment is expected to peak this year perhaps that s why some media outlets have been hyping up the sri lankan debt crisis the foreign debt repayment problem sri lanka faces is more due to its excessive borrowing over the years and improper debt structure arrangement in addition the terrorist attacks in 2019 and the covid 19 pandemic outbreak in 2020 increased the country s trade deficit and reduced its tourism revenue further aggravating its foreign exchange shortage since sri lanka needs to repay 60 percent of the debt in us dollars the shrinking foreign exchange reserves down to 1 6 billion has increased its debt repayment pressure this means sri lanka is facing a shortage of foreign exchange not a debt crisis when state councilor and foreign minister wang yi visited the island country recently sri lankan president gotabaya rajapaksa said he hoped china would help the country revive its economy and ease its difficulties but the west twisted the statement to claim china is the cause of sri lanka s debt problem in fact china has been helping sri lanka to boost its economic and social development and will continue to do so but the united states and india are using sri lanka s shortage of foreign exchange to concoct horror stories about its debt standard poor s recently lowered sri lanka s credit rating from ccc to ccc claiming that sri lanka risks defaulting on sovereign credit which in turn prompted the media to spread the so called debt crisis story besides western economies not china and its belt and road initiative are the main creditors of sri lanka as 54 percent of the country s external loans came from the international capital market sri lanka s debt to china about 3 38 billion in loans accounts for about 10 percent of the country s total foreign debt in us dollars china is sri lanka s fourth largest creditor after international financial institutions the asian development bank and japan claiming china s loan terms are opaque the western media say china is leading sri lanka into a debt trap before accusing china of practicing opaque loan policies developed countries should make their own loan accounts public so the international community can see how and for what purposes their aid and loans to developing countries are being used the debt problems of many developing countries including sri lanka can be attributed mainly to the west dominated financial markets and local elites the west and india unable to accept the reality of a rising china and its growing global influence have fabricated the debt trap theory and are slandering the belt and road initiative and trying to soil china s international image so the us led west can continue exploiting developing countries and the us can maintain its global financial monopoly the college of william and mary in the us released a report in october 2021 saying china has given huge high interest loans to low and middle income countries under the belt and road framework with 42 countries having public debt exposure to china exceeding 10 percent of their gdp and being unaware of the hidden debt problem they face many such reports disguised as academic research have been and are being prepared to spread lies against china and as soon as such reports are issued some western media outlets immediately present them as new evidence to question the belt and road initiative no developing country has been caught in a debt trap by joining the belt and road initiative the hidden debt rhetoric is even more untenable reflecting the usual tricks of the us led west that evidence is not important what important is charging someone with a crime the belt and road initiative is an opportunity rather than a trap for countries developing countries need to take loans from foreign sources to boost their development by building infrastructure improving the investment environment and creating jobs and such loans are good debt because they can help those countries achieve sustainable development many railways highways ports power stations and other projects built under this framework have helped people in many countries to increase their incomes according to a world bank report the joint construction of the belt and road is likely to lift about 7 6 million people out of extreme poverty and 32 million people out of moderate poverty in different countries by 2030 it means the belt and road initiative conforms to the historical trend of solidarity cooperation and common development it is hypocritical of western countries which have controlled the economic lifeline of developing countries since the industrial revolution and pushed them into poverty to claim that they care about the debt problem of developing countries their aim is not to safeguard the interests of developing countries but to ensure china s influence does not spread because if china were to have its rightful say in global affairs no country would have to listen to the west s diktats and suffer exploitation instead of playing tricks and spreading rumors against china the us led west and india are welcome to compete with china in good faith in the fields of trade and investment because if sri lanka is indeed in a debt crisis the us led west is to blame for that the author is vice president of the china

to manipulate the election the 59 year old insists again without evidence unvaccinated against covid 19 she says she doesn t believe media reports only relying on mainstream journalism for weather or sports biden s covid response she maintains is separating people dividing people like when he says the unvaccinated is the problem that s not true at all she fumes that divides people local level friction i think it would have been worse if trump had been reelected says melarie wheat a 37 year old member of the mormon church so i don t think that joe biden has necessarily made us more united

file they have also been allowed to curb the rights of transgender youth and minority voting access manson says without a strong response from biden there is right now an overall frustration with biden among people on the left she says because he keeps using rhetoric about how democracy is in peril and i think we re waiting for that bold action and we haven t seen it yet the 44 year old campaigner voices frustration that democrats have been too delicate and too afraid of upsetting people and sort of walking on eggshells being moderate and being milquetoast is not getting them the

governments worldwide are easing quarantine rules reviewing coronavirus curbs and dialling back pandemic era emergency support as they bid to launch their economies back into some version of normality the moves motivated by the lower severity of the omicron variant and the need to keep workers in work and the global recovery on track have generated a whiff of optimism that has lifted oil and stock prices health experts say the variant s rapid spread may yet herald a turning point in the pandemic however they add much depends on how authorities manage ongoing vaccination rollouts and balance other health measures still needed while persuading their citizens not to throw caution to the wind we are taking a big step and that also means we re taking a big risk dutch prime minister mark rutte said last week before stores hairdressers and gyms reopened in a partial lifting of a lockdown despite record numbers of new cases that lockdown was already something of a rarity with most western countries well past that stage and focussed on how to safely open up further around half a dozen have cut quarantine times from 10 to five days citing omicron s faster infection cycle as grounds to loosen rules that have led to a wave of worker absences hitting businesses britain and israel have eased requirements for follow up pcr tests after a lateral flow result as omicron s soaring infection rates overload laboratories local media say britain could announce further easing of restrictions later this month omicron s ability to rifle quickly through a population without causing a proportionate rise in hospitalisations and deaths even prompted spain s prime minister to suggest it be treated akin to an endemic illness like flu living with the virus while few are using that specific word policymakers whose priority now is to wean economies off the cheap money fuelling inflation have started to depict the coronavirus as something businesses and households must learn to live with what we are seeing is an economy that functions right through these waves of covid u s federal reserve chairman jerome powell said last week if the experts are right and omicron is going to go through really quickly and peak perhaps within a month and come down after that i think it is likely you will see lower hiring and perhaps a pause in growth but it should be short lived such a scenario would facilitate the fed s full on turn towards normalising policy this year with as many as three interest rate hikes other central banks also looking to wind back stimulus share that view it omicron is proving very contagious but less deadly so economies will live with it one european central bank policymaker told reuters adding the bank s baseline scenario assumed a continued resolution of the health crisis in 2022 similarly the bank of japan while listing omicron as a risk is seen sticking to its view that the local economy will pursue a recovery driven by robust exports and massive state spending if that upbeat outlook materialises governments would also be able to start winding back the emergency fiscal support which according to the international monetary fund led to the largest one year surge in global debt since world war ii in october the fund forecast global economic growth of 4 9 this year while underscoring uncertainty posed by the coronavirus it postponed the release of its latest outlook to jan 25 to factor in latest omicron developments keep on vaccinating the rosy economic picture is also predicated on vaccination campaigns at sufficient levels to limit serious illness that means ramping up access to shots in the developing world as wealthier countries focus on the boosters that widespread evidence including hard data from italy and germany shows offer significant protection against the risk of hospitalisation intensive care and death dutch covid 19 hospitalisations for instance while off all time pandemic peaks around 2 000 remain above 900 that is impacting workplace absences and acute care for other conditions and the government is hoping to quickly increase a booster shot coverage rate of around 50 of adults relatively low by euro zone standards another fly in the ointment for any early return to normal may prove to be china s resolve to pursue a strict covid zero strategy likely to lead to shutdowns hitting supply chains and therefore its trade partners and while the belief that the global recovery can live with omicron may be expedient it may yet run up against the hard facts of epidemiology lawrence young professor of molecular oncology university of warwick said u s and japanese studies showing that more than 30 of cases remain highly infectious after five days suggest moves to relax quarantine rules could backfire this is a policy decision based on the need to get people back to work he said returning people after five days risks highly infectious people returning to work or school he and other experts said those risks could be mitigated by strict enforcement of lateral flow testing mask wearing and contact limiting a tricky health message for authorities perceived to be easing up on some rules there s a big sense that we re coming out of all of this said young but i think it s an interesting dangerous period if people are too complacent about it source reuters
