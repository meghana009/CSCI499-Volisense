some of the largest energy saving initiatives ever undertaken in the region the ambitious energy efficiency upgrades including an overhaul of the facility s lighting and hvac systems are expected to save hundreds of thousands of dollars and millions of kilowatt hours making the facility significantly more sustainable not only will these energy efficiency upgrades lessen the impact that the convention center has on the environment they will also improve the experience our guests have when they visit the facility said linda baynham director of sustainability at the noenmcc these upgrades improve the client experience while reducing environmental cost we will continue to pursue energy saving opportunities that support our mission of delivering results for our internal and external customers part of its five year capital improvement plan the facility upgrades represent a major step forward in the convention center s plan to achieve leed certification the most widely used green building rating system in the world among several other initiatives the noenmcc completed the following energy efficiency projects replaced over 4 000 light fixtures with leds in the 1 million sq ft exhibit hall installed over 40 miles of new wiring retrofitted more than 2 000 light fixtures replaced four 1 200 ton water cooled chillers with new high efficiency systems rebuilt the facility s

today with that i ll now turn the call over to sam sam hazen chief executive officer good morning and thank you for joining our call the covid 19 pandemic continued to influence our results in the first quarter with the american surge which slowed in the middle of the quarter more significantly the challenging labor market pressured margins as the cost of labor increased more than we expected as compared to the first quarter of the prior year in the face of these challenges however we had a number of positive volume and revenue indicators that were encouraging compared to the first quarter prior year same facility admissions increased 2 during the quarter we provided care to approximately 49 000 covid 19 in patients which represented approximately 10 of total admissions consistent with prior year non covid admissions grew 2 2 this growth occurred in february and march in patient surgeries grew approximately 1 and across our in patient business acuity levels and payer mix continued to be strong outpatient volumes also rebounded strongly in the quarter same facility emergency room visits grew 15 same facility outpatient surgeries grew nearly 7 and outpatient cardiac related procedures grew by approximately 7 we continue to believe that overall demand for healthcare remains strong in our markets across most categories with favorable population trends and other contributing factors that developed during the pandemic driving it total revenues grew 6 9 compared to the first quarter of 2021 same facility in patient revenues grew 5 4 and same facility outpatient revenues grew 10 6 they will provide more color on our revenues in his comments i realize that our bottom line financial results were not what we expected but these top line metrics were positives diluted earnings per share excluding gains on sales of facilities were 4 12 which was down 0 02 from the prior year in the quarter we experienced higher levels of contract labor expenses than planned as compared to the fourth quarter we saw modest improvements in certain contract labor metrics we expect further improvements in the remainder of the year as we align the workforce appropriately by reducing both the utilization of contract labor and the associated hourly rates for these contracts in some situations the challenges in the labor market also constrained our capacity preventing us from delivering hospital services to certain patients by the end of the quarter we were able to overcome some of these capacity constraints and for the most part our transfer centers were able to operate normally and move more patients to the proper setting in our networks it is important to understand we are doing what we absolutely have to do to take care of our patients and we will always do that this past quarter our teams continue to show up and deliver on our promise to provide high quality care to patients who need our services i want to thank them for their commitment and hard work during these challenging times we do however have numerous initiatives underway around retention recruitment capacity management and new care models that we believe will help offset some of these labor pressures however we now believe improvement in our labor costs will be slower than originally anticipated this factor primarily influenced our revised outlook for 2022 we will continue to invest in our people in our relationships and in our networks we believe these investments are appropriate and should help us address the long term opportunities for growth that exist in our markets at the end of the quarter we had approximately 2500 facilities or sites of care and hca healthcare networks this represents a 15 increase over last year recently we published our annual impact report for 2021 which highlights the tremendous impact our colleagues had on the patients and communities we serve you can find the details on our website before i turn the call over to bill let me in my comments with this over the past few years we have demonstrated an ability to adjust effectively to whatever our realities are and i m confident we will do it again with that i ll turn the call over to bill thank you bill rutherford chief financial officer ok thank you sam and good morning everyone i will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter then addressed our 2022 updated guidance first let me provide a little more commentary on our revenues in the quarter we are encouraged with certain trends we saw in our non covid activity during the quarter same facility non covid admissions grew 2 2 versus the prior year and our non covid revenue per admission grew 2 4 as a result of maintaining our acuity levels and a slightly favorable pay remix as compared to the prior year within our covid activity our same facility common admissions were slightly above last year and represented approximately 10 of our total admissions but we did see lower acuity and intensity with the omicron variant this year our covid in patient revenue per admission was down approximately 15 from the first quarter of last year which resulted in approximately 150 million less covid revenue this year compared to the first quarter of last year let me transitioned to discussing cash flow and balance sheet metrics our cash flow from operations was 1 345 billion as compared to 2 billion in the first quarter of 2021 we did pay 344 million of deferred payroll taxes from 2020 during this quarter representing 50 of the total amount deferred capital spending was 860 million as compared to 650 million in the prior year period and we completed just over 2 1 billion of share repurchases during the quarter our debt to adjusted ebitda ratio at the end of the quarter was slightly below the low end of our target range and we had just under 7 9 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter we plan to use approximately 2 6 billion of this amount to redeem our 2023 bonds in the second quarter finally i will mention as noted in our release this morning during march of this year cms approved the direct repayment portion of the texas waiver program as a result we recognized 385 million of revenue and 160 million of additional provider tax assessments related to this portion of the program from the period september 1st 21 through march 31st 2022 of these amounts approximately 244 million of the revenue and 90 million of the provider tax assessments related to the september or december of 21 period as noted in a release this morning we are adjusting our full year 2022 guidance as follows we expect revenues to range between 59 5 billion and 61 5 billion we expect net income attributable to hca healthcare to range between 4 95 billion to 5 34 billion we expect full year adjusted ebitda to range between 11 8 billion and 12 4 billion we expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between 16 40 and 17 60 and we expect capital spending to remain at 4 2 billion for the year so let me provide some additional commentary on our adjusted guidance and three primary areas that we have considered first our cost of labor was higher than anticipated in the first quarter primarily due to the utilization and cost of contract labor we now believe the disruption in the labor market and the pressure this places on labor cost inflation will be slower to moderate than we originally anticipated second as i previously discussed we saw reduced acuity and revenue from omicron covid patients in the quarter and the slower acuity has been factored into our guidance as well and lastly we made assumption around increased inflationary pressures and expect that to have greater impact on us going forward including for professional fees energy procurement costs utilities and other purchase services so let me close with a brief discussion on some of the initiatives we have underway to respond to these current market dynamics we ve spoken in the past of our resiliency efforts which now include three main focus serious first is around staffing and capacity as sam mentioned in his comments we have teams working on and focused on multiple workstreams in this category these workstreams stand around investing in and enhancing employee recruitment and retention efforts and enhancing capacity management through new case management models and technology solutions in addition we are exploring new delivery models through our care transformation initiatives all of these are focused on supporting our care teams and easing some of the current labor pressures second we have our original resiliency programs that are continuing many of these are advancing efficiencies through our next generation of shared services examples of these include a consolidation and alignment of laboratory operations facility management environmental and food and nutrition support areas and in the third major effort underway as an initiative around advancing our capability to benchmark key performance metrics across the organization this is intended to identify variation and opportunity to share best practices across several areas such as supply utilization provider support costs discretionary spending and other similar cost areas many of these were factored into our original planning assumptions and we remain focused on these efforts to help offset some of the contract labor and inflationary cost pressures we are experiencing so with that i ll turn the call over to frank to open it up for q a frank morgan vice president investor relations thank you bill as a reminder please limit yourself to one question so that we might give us as many possible in the queue an opportunity to ask a question emma you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question questions answers operator thank you your first question today comes from the line of a j rice with credit suisse your line is now open a j rice credit suisse analyst thanks hi everyone maybe just try to drill down a little bit more on that i know within the range you ve changed your outlook for ebidta by about 650 million at the high end 750 million at the low end there s a lot of moving parts in the first quarter with what s happening with texas supplemental payments can you tell us how much of that adjustment was due to what you saw in the first quarter and how much is you re changing in your thinking for the rest of the year and particularly maybe just drill down on the labor comments about maybe what you were thinking before versus what you re thinking today in terms of use of contract labor rates and so forth if there s anything that can be shared there bill rutherford chief financial officer a j this is bill let me give that a shot so you know as we re looking forward and we re trying to take what we saw in the first quarter to make some assumptions and revision of our assumptions going forward let s talk about the three areas and first as i mentioned the pressure on the labor cost and what we re seeing is it s higher than we originally planned it s primarily related to the use of contract labor but we re also adjusting our base wages to be responsive to the market as well as i would think about it our original plan was to kind of manage our overall cost per fte somewhere between a 3 and 3 5 level what we saw in the first quarter is our cost per fte was about 1 5 higher than we expected so as we forecast this going forward for the balance of the year it could have a 4 to 500 million impact so we factor that into our guidance the second areas regarding the omicron variant are less security and revenue not only that we saw in the first quarter but to extend that we continue to see some covid at a reduced level than what we saw in the first quarter we factor that in and then lastly as i mentioned just some inflationary increases above what we originally anticipated so i think the way i would characterize it approximately two thirds of all a revision i would apply to kind of our wage and inflationary cost pressures and a third of that due to the revenue acuity primarily to the covid patients a j rice credit suisse analyst ok thanks a lot frank morgan vice president investor relations yup to my next question operator your next question comes from the line of pito chickering with deutsche bank your line is now open pito chickering deutsche bank analyst hey good morning guys i take my questions embedded on the guidance reductions can you walk us through the contract labor percent of nursing hours in fourth quarter and first quarter and how you assume that rolls off throughout the year and then the same question on the rates for contract labor and just because stocks had a big move to any chance you guys can give us sort of a range for how we should be modeling to ebitda bill rutherford chief financial officer i ll think let me give it a shot at that i think we talked about on our fourth quarter call our contract labor as a percent of nursing hours was around 11 and first quarter is about that level too we were 11 4 specifically in the fourth quarter about 11 6 in the second quarter we are experiencing elevated cost per hour of that contract labor principally we believe related to the covid surges our plans going forward or to continue to reduce the utilization of that contract labor and eventually moderate the average hourly rate that we re having to spend for that contract labor but we think that moderation will be slower than we originally anticipated so that s what s based on our assumptions and it s basically influenced with what we saw in the fourth quarter sam hazen chief executive officer and let me let me add to that pito this is sam i think as we have gone through two years of up and down periods with surges short cycle normal period surges no other short cycle nor normal period we saw in the surges an acceleration in both turnover and the use of contract labor as i mentioned on my prepared comments we do what we got to do to take care of our patients what we re anticipating is no more significant surges as we move through the rest of this year and that gives us some opportunity and some level of confidence that we can moderate the use of contract labor in some of our other initiatives should provide support recruitment some of our retention efforts and so forth giving us an opportunity to wean ourselves off the high levels of contract labor and we saw that in the short cycles to a certain degree but we never were able to sustain it simply because it was just that a short cycle so as we go through the rest of this year we think the cycle will be longer with respect to no surge and that ll give us an opportunity to gain some traction with some of these initiatives our teams are working diligently across the facilities to make this happen and again i m confident just as we ve done in the past that we can make these adjustments over time and get us to where we need to be frank morgan vice president investor relations ok next question operator your next question comes from the line of justin lake with wolfe research your line is open justin lake wolfe research analyst thanks good morning first just a quick follow up on pito s question can you give us a number as to where you expect to end the year on contract labor as a percentage and just to confirm that does that in the operating expense or other operating if that was the line item that looks like it was a bit off and then my my actual question is if you take a step back right there was a huge improvement in margins during covid they looked like they took a step back here i m just curious do you think this is a sustainable margin or a sustainable ebitda level to kind of think about jumping off for next year or do you think some of those improvements could help you close the gaap versus where you were when you when you started the year originally bill rutherford chief financial officer justin this is bill let me start with the first part of that without giving us specific numbers you ve heard us talk about we expect to decrease the utilization you know if i look before you would we would be hovering around 9 to 10 of hours i don t know exactly there s so many uncertainties but we expect it to sequentially improve going forward that does come through the stpb line not the other operating you did mentioned the other offering that was primarily influenced with the provider tax assessments that i mentioned in my prepared remarks sam hazen chief executive officer this is sam justin with respect to the margins in the first quarter i think the margins in the first quarter were clearly pressured as we ve indicated here with somewhat unprecedented levels of cost on the labor side we yet again those costs were driven in some respects by the surge that we were reacting to and in that pressured them in a very significant way i do believe over time we can recover some of that lost margin as we continue to appropriately align our workforce with more permanent workforce or more efficient workforce coming from the contract labor category as setting a target we don t necessarily have a target for contract labor obviously in 2019 we were maybe half of what we re running today somewhere in that zone i don t know if that s realistic in the short run but i m hopeful in the intermediate run with the number of initiatives that we have plus our galen college of nursing expansion program that we can start to get back to those kind of levels but i do think the first quarter was uniquely pressured from a margin standpoint simply because of the elevated levels of contract labor and the cost thereof frank morgan vice president investor relations ok next question operator your next question comes from the line of kevin fischbeck with bank of america your line is open kevin fischbeck bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks just wanted maybe follow up on that question there i think last quarter you were talking about something like a 20 to 21 margin as kind of ultimately being sustainable is that the right way to think about it or have some of these things changed your view and it sounds like for the most part you talked about recapturing like you re talking about cost savings is there anything on the rate side that is part of that equation and if so you know does that take a couple of years to play out or is that something that we can think about more normalized margins as soon as next year thanks bill rutherford chief financial officer ok if you look at our guys i think it would apply you know close to those 20 margin levels obviously we ve had to adjust some of our thinking given kind of these inflationary cost pressures that we re seeing so we re doing everything we can to operate the company as efficiently as possible there s a lot of variables that we know go into margin volume acuity payor mix continuing to manage our cost structures appropriately so i would use that 19 to 20 level in the short run and over time we re going to continue to find ways to continue to operate efficiently sam hazen chief executive officer on the payor contracts we are having more discussions obviously the payers understand the inflationary pressures that providers have and there s early discussions it doesn t change our revenue mix in the 2022 period because we re largely contracted for 2022 but as we move into 2023 and 2024 kevin we have opportunities to utilize our payer contracts to get some relief from the inflationary pressures and as we further our discussions with those commercial payers optimistic that we can gain some escalators that are more in line with the inflationary pressures of today versus the inflationary pressures of the past frank morgan vice president investor relations ok next question operator your next question comes from the line of securities your line is open unknown speaker thanks bill what are you assuming in your algorithm this year for the guidance around covid and non covid i think you were assuming non covid was going to be 2 to 3 of the total how is that shifted and is there anything that you can share on how non covid either in patient outpatient or anything is tracking through april that might just give us a sense of the run rate thanks bill rutherford chief financial officer i can t say april with this point but we said in our prepared remarks is up 2 2 and that was really in february and march and february and march we were seeing 4 5 to 5 potentially in those levels so again that s why i said we re encouraged by those trends i don t think really what we saw in the fourth quarter really and broad terms affect our volume outlook we still see good volume demand in the marketplace so originally we said 2 to 3 volume growth would still be in between that maybe 3 to 5 of our total admissions and i think right now i think that s mostly in line with our current expectations frank morgan vice president investor relations ok next question operator your next question comes from the line of ben hendrix with rbc capital markets your line is open ben hendrix rbc capital markets analyst just a real quick follow up on a comment you made just a second ago sam about improving efficiency of contract labor we ve always kind of characterized this as kind of the labor backdrop as the contract being the contradictory piece and wage inflation being more permanent is that can we read that kind of improving efficiency comment is maybe your expectation that contract labor utilization at higher rates is more of a permanent construct now going forward in the labor market sam hazen chief executive officer well i think it s higher than it was in 2019 i don t think it will be higher than it was in the fourth quarter or the first quarter i think rates will naturally come down as the surges subside and as a workforce is aligned with more permanent staff and so forth and and so we re dealing in the first quarter in the fourth quarter and a little bit in the third quarter as well very high cost per hour for contract labor and we do not believe that is sustainable and and so we re anticipating improvements in that additionally i think we will see reductions in the number of contract labor personnel that we use again as our initiatives gain traction we ve invested heavily in our recruiting function and really improved the candidate experience inside of that we have some improving retention efforts efforts in compensation programs that we think are going to support that component of our set of initiatives so all of that leads us to believe that we can get the cost per fte down from where it was in the fourth quarter in the first quarter and so that s our thinking frank morgan vice president investor relations ok thank you ben next question operator your next question comes from the line of ann hynes with mizuho your line is open ann hynes mizuho securities analyst hi good morning can you tell us when i look at in patient admissions and adjusted admissions versus 2019 they re still down about 3 can you tell us what s embedded in guidance for 2022 versus the 2019 based baseline trends thanks bill rutherford chief financial officer hey and this is bill so as i mentioned before i still believe we ll end up seeing 2 to 3 admissions for the full year 22 you re right we are down a little on 19 i d have to take a moment to see what that represents and i think about 1 is what i think that would be our 21 number versus the baseline 19 would be down about 1 sam hazen chief executive officer let me color that in a little bit more bill if i may please i think a couple of things when it comes to our same store 2019 versus our same store 2021 our uninsured volumes are down 11 from 2019 so that s a very significant point the second point i would say is we ve had a fairly significant shift of orthopedic total joint surgeries go from in patient to outpatient from 2019 to 2022 again that s put pressure on the admissions our surgeries were actually up over 2019 and then again with our emergency room visits if you look at the categories that are the pain categories we re slightly up but our uninsured activities were way down so i think you ve got to look at the components of the business and understand the different components and so the mix slightly better shift in patient to outpatient which we ve talked about over the last couple of years and that influences the 2022 to 2019 comparisons frank morgan vice president investor relations ok thank you ann next question operator your next question comes from the line of gary taylor with cowen your line is open gary taylor cowen and company analyst hey good morning what i did think about seasonality of revenue in ebitda if you can hear do we go back to sort of pre covid and think about first quarter fourth quarter ebidta or is being higher or do we think about j j and some of the other device companies have said all time high cancelations in january things really started improving in march and april and obviously you ve got some anticipation that labor costs could ease a bit sequentially so are we back to normal ebitda seasonality yet or is the year still more complex and can you help us at all bill rutherford chief financial officer but i think a couple of things gary i thank you for that question the the seasonality we talked about this in the fourth quarter call was really difficult for us to discern because again we were weaning ourselves off the delta variant and then ramping up on the omicron variant i think the seasonality again with our volume is a bit uncertain to us right now my sense is this could be a more normal period on seasonality for volume in 2022 than any that we ve had over the last two years obviously but the seasonality on our costs as we ve indicated i think are going to be different and they re going to be different because we re at a high watermark on labor cost per fte in the first quarter and typically our costs would go up seasonally but we think as we work through the initiatives and in the alignment of our workforce we ll have a different pattern to our costs in 2022 than what we ve had in previous years and then hopefully 2023 gets back to normal so that s how we re thinking about it obviously there s still much to come here for us to understand in fact if that does play out but that s our thinking at this point frank morgan vice president investor relations thank you gary next question operator your next question comes from the line of brian tanquilut with jefferies your line is open brian tanquilut jefferies analyst hey good morning sam just to follow up some questions on labor right so one question we re getting asked is why now you guys have done a great job managing through labor over the last year and a half and maybe any color you can share on what you re thinking in terms of turnover on your nurses and then i guess for for bill to follow up to that as you called out acuity as a driver of the revenue guidance cut but as we pulled back and temp staff is there going to be an impact on labor or on volumes that we should be thinking about thanks sam hazen chief executive officer so the first half of last year our costs were not in what i call an elevated state from labor and we mentioned this on our third quarter call we also mentioned it again on the fourth quarter call and now we re mentioning it on the first quarter calls we re working ourselves out of some comparisons number one but our cost of labor were dramatically disrupted in the delta variant for a couple of reasons one we jumped our census from the second quarter to the third quarter by 8 5 we had record census levels in the company in the third quarter not for the third quarter but forever and that forced us to respond to those patients in an appropriate way the market the labor market was being tremendously impacted during the summer of 2021 and we had to use more contract labor at that time than we had in previous periods well that s continued into the fourth quarter and into the first quarter again we think some of that is influenced significantly by the surges so that s part of what we occurred as bill alluded to at the delta variant was the most intense revenue per patient population that we had so the third quarter covered a lot of that cost because the revenue intensity of the delta patients was quite high the fourth quarter had a blend of delta and omicron and it still was higher than the first quarter and so the labor costs really haven t changed per fte in the in three quarters i m considering that to be a good thing and i m also considering it to be the opportunity because we re using too much contract labor and it s still at elevated outsized rates and so our rate trend has continued in the quarter to be reduced i think our contract labor cost per hour in the first quarter was down 5 from the fourth quarter and within the quarter within the first quarter it was better each month month over month again it gives us some confidence that the assumptions we re making for the remainder of the year are reasonable so that s part of why doesn t look like we manage through it in historical ways our productivity is at a very efficient level when it comes to employees per patient so we re managing on that front as well as we possibly can and as again we get these other underlying initiatives into a normal period hopefully of no covid surges we re going to gain ground on the pressure that we ve experienced over the past three quarters frank morgan vice president investor relations thank you unknown speaker we re right here at a follow up question to say i think sam mentioned too in his comments there there s always the potential where the labor pressures could affect your volume well we ve seen that as in covid surges as we ve managed through transfers bill rutherford chief financial officer again i think as sam alluded in his comments at the end of the quarter we were really back to our normal levels but we re continuing to manage through that dynamic frank morgan vice president investor relations ok thank you next question operator your next question comes from the line of scott fidel with stephens your line is now open scott fidel stephens inc analyst hi thanks so we just had the medicare ipps proposed contract for 2023 and certainly had a couple of different moving pieces and that so i thought it d be helpful if you can give us the gross versus net sort of projection for your rates from that proposal and then just more broadly how you feel about cms as sort of factoring in this inflationary pressure and ultimately if you think that cms well start to factor that more accurately as we look out maybe to 24 beyond thanks bill rutherford chief financial officer scott this is bill i mean obviously we re still assessing it but i think on first blush we saw kind of the gross increase we saw would be hovering just under 2 and that s pretty consistent with what we ve seen but i think to your point it does get that it out when we see the delay in the sequestration cuts out there so we ll still assess that so it may move it closer to flat net net all in but we re seeing at the top line just under 2 growth on that and so we ll see how the final rule comes out as we go through comments sam hazen chief executive officer yeah and in forward years typically it takes a little bit for the wage index to be adjusted to reflect what s going on in the industry so i think as 21 and 22 start to get baked into the formula for inflation around the wage indexes of the hospital industry it will start to influence the reimbursement in slightly different ways frank morgan vice president investor relations thanks for the question scott next question operator your next question comes from the line of andrew mok with ubs your line is now open andrew mok ubs analyst hi good morning just wanted to follow up on the revenue commentary can you take us through the components of the lower revenue guidance in more detail maybe help bucket the 500 million decline between volume acuity and mix and are there any other government related items that you would call out in that revenue decline thanks bill rutherford chief financial officer yeah andrew this is bill i would tell you it s principally related to the drop in the covid acuity that i mentioned in my comments and you know we re estimating it to be approximately 150 million in the quarter you know covid obviously was higher at 10 of our admissions and we expect in the full year but if you run that out i would say the vast majority of that revenue decline would be due to the lower acuity that we re seeing with the omicron variant and expect to see going forward and outside of that there s no other really major item that i would call out just the have and flow of of kind of normal volume patterns frank morgan vice president investor relations thank you next question operator your next question comes from the line of stephen baxter with wells fargo your line is open stephen baxter wells fargo securities analyst yeah hi thanks just want to ask another one on the labor market so i m sure part of your process around this issue involves a great degree of competitive intelligence about what s going on in your markets i was hoping you could share a little about what you re seeing from your local market competitors and whether they re strategies around you know contract labor or employee labor force or even maybe potentially putting certain service lines on pause or maybe exacerbating some of the pressures you re feeling i guess big picture do you think they re being as disciplined as you are and if not how should we think about the longer term implications of that thank you sam hazen chief executive officer so from a competitive standpoint i mean obviously our wage programs have to be competitive and that means different things in different circumstances and we have made adjustments to our compensation programs really starting back in the third quarter of 21 to respond to some of the market dynamics we continue to be very fluid in in that particular area of our business in responding to the different circumstances from one market to the other i would say that we think we re in a pretty good spot we haven t seen any unusual maneuvers broadly we are fortunate again to have competitors that tend to be only local and in one market or two markets at the most so we don t see sort of patterns that permeate all 43 markets for hca healthcare and so that s a positive on that front but we haven t seen anything unique yet from the competitive landscape with contract labor and so forth but i ve got to believe that they are facing many of the same challenges as we do and i believe over time we ve been able to use our operating discipline use our systems use the learnings that we have across the company to create advantage for us and i believe we will continue to do that frank morgan vice president investor relations thank you stephen next question operator your next question comes from the line of joshua raskin with nephron research your line is open joshua raskin nephron research analyst hi thanks and good morning appreciate your taking the question quick follow up on contract labor how long are those typical contracts in place and then my real question are you having any issues with discharges post acute discharges is that impacting length of stay driving up cost and obviously the same drg the same payment bill rutherford chief financial officer yeah joshua bill typically those contracts range around 13 weeks and so it takes time to adjust but given the size they re always flowing through our system on there and relative to post acute and discharge planning i would say yes i think that s part of our case management initiatives that i spoke to and in my prepared comments i think the supply and demand dynamics in post acute whether it be skilled nursing or other post acute settings from time to time can cause a backup in our discharges and and that s why we re trying to advance and utilize some technologies advance a common organizational structure around case management so we can continue to focus on that and improve that like to stay when patients are ready to go home and there s appropriate levels of discharges but there is a dynamic out there there s no doubt about it but i think we re focusing a lot of effort and energy and resources to try to continue to improve in that area frank morgan vice president investor relations thank you josh next question operator your next question comes from the line of jason cassorla with citi your line is now open jason cassorla citi analyst great thanks i just want to go back to your comments around the initiatives for retention recruitment capacity management and new care models can you just help in terms of what is different with these initiatives today and maybe compared to perhaps how you utilized these initiatives back in three q 21 when labor was picking up is it just more intensity there or are you leveraging incremental levers that maybe weren t considered a preview utilized that back then and then if possible can you help quantify the offset of these programs or initiatives related to the 4 to 500 million net pressure regarding the higher wages and costs with the revised guidance thanks bill rutherford chief financial officer yeah i ll start with sam comment i think it s a mix of both escalating existing initiatives new ones one i ll give an example on sandwich necessarily around recruitment we ve increased our investment in recruiter significantly and that s been our a really intentional effort same around retention we re putting common retention strategies across the organization on there and then the case management that i mentioned in my comments we recently approved an effort to really align organizationally around our case management strategies and we re investing in new technologies to give us better predictive assessments of patients needs at discharge so it s a combination of accelerating and emphasizing existing efforts as well as implementing new ones and it s kind of touches all bases if you will between recruitment retention capacity management and new care models as we can bring new support staff to support the care teams whether it be through patient care tax through patient safety attendance and the like so we ve got a number of initiatives to try to just as i said in my comments continue to support the team and it is those pressures i would say in our guidance you know and our original guys we had already factored in you know some impact of those and we re going to continue to focus on those to try to i think counter some of the market pressures that we are seeing frank morgan vice president investor relations ok thank you for the question next caller operator your next question comes from the line of jamie perse with goldman sachs your line is now open jamie perse goldman sachs analyst hey good morning guys a question on volumes but last year the timing of the covid wave was pretty similar to what it looked like this year really nice acceleration to q2 last year in terms of volumes across the board what do you see now in terms of volumes and last year experienced a good proxy for how we should be thinking about the acceleration into to two q and then just one quick follow up can you guys give us what percent of your managed care contracts are in place for 2023 sam hazen chief executive officer february and march which were obviously highlights post on a crime surge behaved similarly to the holiday surge that occurred at the end of 2020 and on into the first part of 2021 again we had solid non covid admission growth in february and march as bill alluded to in the mid single digits so we re encouraged by that there s nothing to suggest that the patterns will be different but again we re learning obviously as we go through these patterns and we re hopeful that we won t have any more surges and we ll be able to judge some of these patterns more effectively with respect to our payer contracts we re about 50 contracted for 2023 and about 30 contracted for 2024 again those capacities in each of those years give us opportunities to adjust some of the inflationary expectations to the realities that we have today frank morgan vice president investor relations thanks for the question next question operator your next question comes from the line of sarah james with barclays your line is now open sarah james barclays analyst thank you so you ve been talking about the majority of the pressure being on temp labor but i was hoping you could unpack that a little bit are you talking about two thirds one third temp labor two kind of the longer tailed items like wage inflation and bonuses or a more extreme split and you guys are in a unique position earning in nursing school so are you seeing any shift in what field students are selecting and how is that influencing your strategy sam hazen chief executive officer i don t know bill if we if i have the split right in front of me and to be able to answer the first question but let me speak to the second question and we can get back to you on that first question with a little bit more specificity if we can it s still early for us with the galen college of nursing programs and expansions but just looking at some of the new schools that we ve opened in austin texas nashville tennessee parts of south carolina the enrollment in a couple of those situations is record level enrollment in nursing program in the galen college of nursing so we ve seen a really robust initial enrollment that gives us confidence we also believe that we have an opportunity to integrate those students into our organization to support current needs as well as hopefully create synergy as they graduate the program and want to come to work for hca healthcare so we re really encouraged by the prospects but again that s more intermediate run kind of a gain although there will be some short run with nurse extras and rotations and so forth that we can utilize hopefully effectively to support current day needs but the the initial enrollment in a number of these new schools would suggest that there s still a reasonable supply of students who want to go into nursing schools unknown speaker i think you ll have an answer to the second question sam hazen chief executive officer well no i don t have an answer sir we ll have to get back with you i think our overall labor market is a combination of the temporary labor and some of the base wage inflation i can t split it for you exactly we ll get back with you on that but it s a combination of both sarah james barclays analyst ok sam hazen chief executive officer yeah go ahead sarah james barclays analyst just to clarify on the nursing school i was trying to understand like the structural shift that s going on if you re graduating nurses are selecting one feels like and it s surgical versus home health versus like if you re seeing just like a structural shift and we re graduating nurses are going sam hazen chief executive officer no we re not frank morgan vice president investor relations ok thank you for the questions here next question operator your next question comes from the line of matt borsch with bmo capital markets your line is now open matt borsch bmo capital markets analyst thanks for squeezing me in question of topic for the quarter but there is i ve been following this closely but there s been obviously an ongoing dialog around compliance with the price transparency regulations and i know there s a lot of complexity to the implementation but can you just address where from your standpoint you are with that and you know what when you would expect to get if not already to full compliance on that sam hazen chief executive officer well i was going to say we believe we are compliant with the cms rules which are tremendously complex and in many ways difficult to implement because of the variations that exist from one commercial contract to another and from one market to another so we have through our an internal process established a program that we believe in cms is is validated in certain circumstances is compliant and we continue to try to refine those presentations in ways that again satisfied cms is evolving interpretation as well as our ability to adjust some of our postings to meet the evolving requirements matt borsch bmo capital markets analyst ok i look at it thank you very much i turn it back over to emma operator your last question today comes from the line of ben hendrix with rbc capital markets your line is now open ben hendrix rbc capital markets analyst hey guys thank you very much for the

florida governor ron desantis is doing something with disney that s dividing the right and invigorating the left but only in a mildly amusing way his decision to revoke disney s special privileges by not renewing the reedy creek agreement has conservatives aligning in some pretty weird ways over the notion that desantis is misusing government power and retaliating for political speech he doesn t like advertisement former trump legal team member jenna ellis is taking the same line that the establishment conservatives over at national review are taking in criticizing desantis move meanwhile conservatives who liked trump s figthing style see desantis as a bit of hero who refuses to bow to what are surely highly questionable political positions by an incredibly powerful corporation that appears to be operating outside the wishes of shareholders then there s the left who would prefer that children be educated on sexual transitioning at a very young age they re kind of gloating over the conservative rift but it smells a bit of desperation as they cling to standards that are frankly morally repugnant they re not very popular at the moment what with their guy failing pretty dramatically in the white house what s interesting and lost in most of the debate is the question of what s happening to schoolchildren in america today the desantis critics on the right are talking about government overreach and tax burdens and loss of revenue the left is talking about their feelings again the desantis defenders seem to be the only ones talking about how the children and the nation s future are worth the fight against this present darkness even if it leads to uncomfortable intraparty discussions advertisement however the drama plays out it s good to remember that desantis is not a stupid man nor a stupid politician from the wsj disney largely funds the reedy creek district which had about 150 million in revenue last year it also carries close to 1 billion in debt the mayor of orange county warned thursday that if the district goes then upkeep will fall to the county s budgets putting an undue burden on the rest of the taxpayers the headaches look large enough that it s difficult not to wonder about the bill s effective date it dissolves the reedy creek district on june 1 2023 time for disney and mr desantis to make up disney and desantis will likely work toward striking some kind of a deal because the era of woke boardrooms may be short lived if netflix and twitter and indeed disney itself are harbingers of what embracing those policies leads to a quick look at the worth of their individual stocks should scare companies straight there s likely to be later protesting on the part of some of these corporations that they felt bullied to adopt the new woke standards in this age of cancel culture that s a fair enough defense but isn t really enough to justify confusing and gaslighting children advertisement how much americans will ultimately be willing to forgive them remains to be seen i talk about all that today on the show there s also a brief review of the very funny killing it trailer below and a bit more on musk s moves to prove he s serious dip your toe in if you dare the show lives on spotify and you can also find me at iheartradio apple podcasts fcb radio s spreaker and deezer

the rate you actually receive can vary based on a number of factors why do mortgage rates fluctuate here are some of the most common reasons why mortgage rates move frequently employment patterns the employment rate is an indicator of demand for mortgages when more people are unemployed fewer people will be looking to get a mortgage and buy a home and that lower demand will push interest rates down when the employment rate improves demand for mortgages will likely keep pace and as demand for mortgages rises so will mortgage interest rates the bond market because bonds are a lower risk type of investment demand for bonds can increase when investors are wary of other investment vehicles or fearful of the overall state of the economy increased demand for bonds causes their price to rise and their earnings called their yield to fall when bond yields fall consumer interest rates generally do as well including mortgage interest rates when investors feel more confident about the economy demand for bonds declines bond prices drop and yields rise and interest rates tend to follow federal reserve system the fed as it s commonly called is the united states central bank but it doesn t actually set mortgage rates rather multiple things the fed does influence mortgage rates for example while mortgage rates don t mirror the fed funds rate the rate banks apply when borrowing lending money to each other overnight they do tend to follow it if that rate rises mortgage rates typically rise in tandem global economy global banking systems and economies are closely interconnected when

cheeks the weight of history blood memory and personal journey colliding on the banks of the whiteshell river it was a profound moment for me because for the first time i really felt connected to the land says kc adams standing in the colourful kitchen of her winnipeg home i knew that i was on the right path i also felt connected to the ancestors because i picked it up and realized that a woman had made this 300 400 years ago maybe even more and i m the first one to touch it again since it disappeared adams a nêhiyaw anishinaabe and british multimedia artist has found hundreds of pottery shards or more accurately sherds the name for ceramic fragments in the years since discovering that first piece during a water gathering near the bannock point petroforms her summer days are often spent combing the banks of local waterways looking for bits of pots once used for cooking storage and ceremony vessels that were buried along lakes rivers and streams generations ago find their way to the surface through flooding and erosion adams keeps what she finds in a chapman s ice cream pail filled with plastic baggies each one labelled with a place name lockport nutimik wanipigow the sherds serve as design inspiration for her own clay vessels these are punctates she says pointing to a series of round divots near the lip of a sherd in her collection she opens a leather pouch filled with found objects and demonstrates how a tool made of deer bone can be used to create the look and this is a fish bone that i found on the beach sometimes i ll use it as decoration she sets down the pouch and returns to the stove where bacon fat is coming to temperature in a reddish brown pot the smell of salty fat signalling the beginnings of a hearty stew the handmade cookware sits in stark contrast to adams stainless steel range two pieces of technology from two very different eras working seamlessly together bison and wild rice stew by kc adams ingredients 45 60 ml 3 4 tbsp grease oil 250 ml 1

cup diced small potatoes optional salt and pepper for flavour click to read more ingredients 45 60 ml 3 4 tbsp grease oil 250 ml 1 cup wild rice 1 litre 4 cups vegetable or beef bison moose elk stock 1 2 onion chopped 1 package of ground bison 250 ml 1 cup green beans frozen or fresh 125 ml 1 2 cup corn frozen or fresh 125 ml 1 2 cup diced small potatoes optional salt and pepper for flavour directions rinse your wild rice twice and then add 500 ml 2 cups nibi water in a bowl and let sit for 30 minutes while your rice is sitting add 45 ml 3 tbsp grease to a heated clay vessel and swirl the fat around to prepare and seal the vessel add onions and cook until they are tender add the bison and brown slightly remove from heat and pour into a bowl to add later drain the rice and add it to the vessel pour in 500 ml 2 cups of stock and bring to a boil using medium heat high heat if you are using a metal pot add the vegetables the remaining stock and the meat bring it to a boil and it will be ready to eat add salt and pepper to taste close the pot is made from manitoba clay and granite rocks retired from sweat ceremonies the crushed granite tempers the clay ensuring it can withstand the heat of cooking it also adds an extra layer of meaning i love that the energy that was part of that ceremony is now in my vessel adams says it s comforting and beautiful she adds ground bison to the stew and gets to work chopping vegetables a bowl of wild rice is soaking on the nearby countertop the vessel which bears a thunderbird design was made by coiling and smoothing together ropes of clay as the contents cook the fat seeps through the porous material creating a dark ring where the clay is thinner than its surroundings the pot and the stew have a symbiotic relationship each meal adds a little more seasoning to the pot s interior while the unglazed walls help flavour future dishes clay has been an important part of adams life and art practice since 2015 when she started learning how to make blackduck pottery a thin durable form of stoneware developed and used by indigenous potters in the region pre contact remnants have been found in areas now known as manitoba saskatchewan ontario and parts of the northern united states it s a method adams adopted after travelling to minnesota for a workshop with grant goltz an experimental archeologist who has found ways to recreate blackduck pottery mikaela mackenzie winnipeg free press kc adams strives to follow a diet that reclaims traditional foods during the cross border exchange she learned how to harvest clay from the land shape vessels using shells and a woven bag and fire pots over an open flame you re going into partnership with the land and the water and you re becoming connected to it adams says of the process my ancestors had done it and this was my first time experiencing it it felt incredible making pottery has given her a tangible connection to the past it s an understanding that has also worked its way into her diet the stew is now bubbling away on the stovetop to the pot adams has added the wild rice stock onions asparagus and corn although the vegetables can change depending on what s in the kitchen the recipe and ingredients are a form of reclamation eating a food philosophy she s been following for the last two years as a way to improve her health and push back against the colonial food system mikaela mackenzie winnipeg free press the recipe for bison and wild rice stew is very adaptable depending on what is seasonally available it s kind of a resistance to the foods that have been introduced to us and that have caused a lot of harms she says pointing to the high prevalence of diabetes among first nations communities as an example a 2019 paper from the national collaborating centre for indigenous health explains how disproportionate diabetes rates are rooted in colonization which among many things has forced people off the land and away from traditional nutrient rich food sources diabetes runs in the family and adams has turned to reclamation eating to avoid her own diagnosis i ve seen my mom struggle with it for the past 25 years she says i don t want to live my life like that she keeps a handwritten list of ingredients posted next to the fridge barley cabbage pumpkin beans elk turkey pickerel strawberries sunflower seeds and a dozen other items that could have been consumed locally or obtained through trade hundreds of years ago it s a list built on historical research and modern approximation industrial agriculture and a global supply chain have changed the kind of produce available in manitoba and it can be difficult to source wild meat without a hunter in the family mikaela mackenzie winnipeg free press adams combs the banks of waterways to find shards of clay vessels known as sherds for adams reclamation eating isn t all or nothing it can be expensive and time consuming to eat this way but she feels better when she does physically and spiritually it s nourishing our spirit and our bodies and our culture as well she says it s really taking back some of the foods that we used to eat and recognizing that we no longer have access and sometimes even the knowledge of what we used to eat family recipes and food traditions are just a few examples of knowledge that has been severed by government attempts to stamp out indigenous culture through the residential school system and the 60s scoop adams grandmother is a residential school survivor she refused to teach her daughter cree because it was beaten out of her by institution staff mikaela mackenzie winnipeg free press tools for making and decorating handmade clay vessels include pieces of bone it was just easier to try and assimilate but it leaves a void growing up i always felt like there was something i was missing out on adams says knowledge systems are so important and that s why they constantly need to be transferred and passed on to the next generation as an adult she has dedicated her life to learning about and reclaiming her culture she does so publicly with art that interrogates stereotypes and workshops that teach others about indigenous technology and she does so privately with handmade cookware and self taught recipes steeped in history eva wasney freepress mb ca twitter evawasney mikaela

get free access to sa premium click here to find out more â imaginima istock via getty images vanguard s total international stock index fund etf nasdaq vxus remains a strong buy ex u s equity in general has garnered a sour reputation over the last decade but there is a bull case amid the worrisome recent performance fund management at its best vxus is a massively diversified fund that stakes ownership in over 7 800 businesses across the globe guided by tracking the ftse global all cap ex u s index as far as safe bets go the average investor will be hard pressed to find any fund more secure for their money investing in vxus grants exposure to stocks across 46 countries stocks from many of which are inaccessible via u s markets directly a noteworthy number of these stocks are worth paying attention to if not for their business fundamentals but for their rapid growth vxus holds formidable companies such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co ltd tsm and asml holding n v asml which are up over 200 and 350 over the last 5 years respectively with returns comparable to those of apple aapl hundreds of these ex u s businesses are driving global corporate profits catering to billions of consumers from all corners of earth after all ex u s industries represent roughly 40 of the free float adjusted market cap weighted global market and these are companies investors lack exposure to in typical s p 500 or total u s stock market etfs bear in mind that the companies which own name brands such as toyota tm shell shel louis vuitton otcpk lvmuy samsung otcpk ssnlf and fan favorite nintendo otcpk ntdoy are based outside of the u s samsung and toyota are even in its top 10 holdings among other household names as indicated in vanguard s table below interestingly the top 10 holdings don t even account for 10 of the total net assets compare this to an s p 500 index fund where the top 10 assets constitute a whopping 30 of net fund assets for typical long term investors who wish to avoid uncompensated risks and are wary of holding a significant portion of their retirement accounts in any one company vxus s extreme diversification might be desirable top 10 holdings of vxus vanguard group as an ex u s stock etf vxus is notable in that it does not shy away from emerging market assets vxus holds roughly 25 of its assets in this risky asset class the underlying index is important because not every international index treats emerging markets the same way and choosing an international fund among the sea of potential funds can be tricky for comparison take two of vxus s competitors the ishares core msci total international stock etf ixus and the schwab international equity etf schf while ixus s asset allocation is close to that of vxus by tracking the similar enough msci acwi ex u s imi index schf foregoes comparable emerging market exposure by tracking the ftse developed ex u s index despite having international equity in the name vxus also beats out ixus s roughly 4 200 holdings while the diversification benefit of holding those extra few thousand companies is probably minimal it is clear that vanguard is giving you all the international equity exposure they can get their hands on all the way down to their choice of index other differences in asset allocation are provided by portfolio visualizer in the table below asset allocation breakdown of three international equity funds vxus ixus and schf portfolio visualizer investors seeking exposure to over 7 800 companies would expect to pay significant custodial fees for the privilege but they would be mistaken in fact vanguard even recently lowered expense ratios for this fund from dirt cheap to even cheaper investors have an opportunity to benefit from vanguard s half century of fund management expertise for pennies on 1000 invested this combination of quality and price is something that struggles to be rivaled against by even the most elite etfs the expense ratio of 0 07 as is the case with many vanguard funds remains orders of magnitude below the industry average of 0 41 vanguard remains a trailblazer for giving the retail investor their fair share of market returns and they carry on the tradition with vxus for those unfamiliar with expense ratios these 34 basis points exponentially compounding over an investing lifetime can mean the difference between an early retirement and an extra decade of service vanguard etfs also do not distribute capital gains making vxus more tax efficient than funds that do distribute these gains for investors worried about purchasing assets at desirable prices it is true that shares of vxus are traded like shares of any other stock instead of being purchased at the nav of the underlying stocks at the end of a trading day vxus share prices are determined by the market however shares of vxus are liquid enough that this is largely insignificant investors have already taken notice of the tremendous value this etf has to offer with a turnover rate under 8 investors are generally complacent holding their money here total assets of vanguard s total international stock index fund of which vxus is the etf share class recently exceeded 386 billion among all funds this is amusingly neck at neck with the total fund assets of the legendary spdr s p 500 etf trust spy a decade of lackluster performance a stellar surface assessment of vxus however does not explain its mediocre market trailing performance as of late it is no secret that international equity has been dismissed over the last decade as investors are quick to point towards astronomical u s market returns as the opportunity cost of investing internationally after all while the s p 500 using spy as a proxy boasted a compounding annual growth rate of nearly 15 over the last 10 years vxus did not even graze 6 in the same time period indeed this means that while spy could have doubled your money twice since the subprime mortgage crisis vxus would not even have doubled your money once even after the covid 19 flash crash vxus s recovery has not been nearly as stellar as that of spy in many ways this makes sense geopolitical conflict including literal wars are adversely affecting international markets and even shutting them down outright this happened as recently as late february concerns about emerging market stability for example with recent volatility in the chinese markets due to government intervention that dragged mega cap stocks down to single digit p e multiples does not instill confidence either furthermore given that the u s is handling inflation remarkably well in light of some international currency crises the elephant in the room concerning the turkish lira it can be extremely tempting to hang onto the relative power of the u s dollar and invest exclusively in u s equity to be fair investors with portfolios long on 100 u s markets are in good company with some of the best investors of all time successful u s centric investors such as the late vanguard founder jack bogle have even discouraged investors from investing overseas that said our hero mr bogle admits he s in the minority and suggests investors to think for themselves why you should invest in vxus anyway as is the case with all negatives there is light at the end of the tunnel the fact that the s p 500 has outperformed vxus is not significant on the time scale markets operate on we also know that past performance does not predict future results and if we have learned anything from our predecessors we know that oftentimes the opposite is true reversion to the mean plays do happen and they are happening right now ray dalio of bridgewater associates for example has a long position on emerging markets via a number of etfs and while that is certainly incurring tremendous risk and probably inadvisable for retail investors vxus allows us to hedge 75 of that risk with developed market equity other investing legends such as charlie munger and mohnish pabrai have entered multi million dollar positions on the emerging market powerhouse company alibaba which further suggests that the big dogs are already seeking opportunities overseas there are also arguments that u s equity is overvalued these arguments are well founded the historical average p e ratio of the s p 500 hovers around 16x over the last century and a half but currently this market index has a multiple well over 20x the shiller cape another popular metric that tracks market expensiveness has even reached levels comparable to the dot com bubble as a reminder the dot com bubble was a disaster on the economic policy end there are speculations that quantitative easing and rampant inflation are eventually going to spell doom for the u s economy the list goes on and on for investors who are uneasy about the current economic situation in the u s exposure to a slightly uncorrelated asset class that in theory generates comparable risk adjusted returns namely via the affordable vxus may make sleeping at night a bit easier subscribers to modern portfolio theory may want to secure a fraction of their portfolios dedicated to ex u s equity anyway regardless of personal sentiment conventional wisdom recommends investors allocate 20 of their equity overseas for those especially concerned about currency stability vxus also partially acts as a currency hedge for those who worry that the usd rate of inflation will exceed the global average vxus notably boasts a relatively consistent 3 dividend yield for investors who shy away from modern day treasury bond yields and rising interest rates threatening the bond market vxus can potentially serve as a hybrid investment that seeks the risk premium of stocks while securing fixed income while some foreign taxes are withheld for u s citizens these are often recoverable in your tax refund vxus is one of the funds where investors are eligible for a foreign tax credit due to its high allocation to ex u s assets aggressively oriented dividend growth investors may also be interested in vxus because of its reasonable dividend yield that has historically exceeded that of the s p 500 certainly 3 is already beating out some treasury bonds perhaps the biggest reason to invest in vxus is that the market is pessimistic about it and this has been priced in shares are trading at almost 12x earnings which places this fund at value levels growth has outperformed value in recent years but nobel laureates have shown us that value ought to beat out growth in the long run in addition to its apparent value status vxus is one of the few international funds that seeks exposure to small cap equity occasionally index funds will gloss over small caps because of liquidity risks and thus forfeit any small cap premia all things considered it seems unlikely that returns will be this low forever see for example the portfolio visualizer figure below charting the progress of 10 000 over the 20 year period spanning january 2002 to april 2022 using the oldest share classes of vxus in blue and the vanguard total stock market index fund etf vti in red sometimes the u s markets are higher and sometimes the ex u s markets are higher if history is any guide ex u s markets are bound to recover from their current slump just as the u s markets recovered around 2015 us and ex us stocks have taken turns outperforming each other over the last 20 years portfolio visualizer as a basic reversion to the mean play the return to trading at 16x earnings constitutes an immediate 33 return with increasing globalization and free trade we should expect valuations to soar even higher u s stocks have already benefited from this for example with corporate profit margins rising in the years following the north american free trade agreement and china s inclusion into the world trade organization increasing valuations even partially explain recent u s overperformance as the two started occurring at roughly the same time there is no reason to believe that similar economic catalysts for foreign companies will not present themselves in the future and thus improve their profit margins overseas as well investing in vxus can be thought of as a value play and value plays are often scary because they tend to deal with struggling businesses that need to entice investors with high dividend yields after all there s a reason why these stocks are cheaper than others and it s not because investors are eager to throw their money at them that said this is where money gets multiplied everyone has fantasies about purchasing bitcoin early or stocking up on tsla when it was at 50 share how do we know that vxus isn t at similarly attractive prices the ramp up back to the equity yield this fund deserves won t be quick that is the price we pay for diversification but if we are to believe in the siegel constant then now is a great time to enjoy the ride take your risk and earn your reward the past is bleak the present is bleaker and the future is uncertain the world is feeling its way through the tribulations of novel and unforeseen global events it is in moments like this where market risk is palpable and where your risk premium is truly earned and deserved after all humans have always found a way past troubles and stock markets have always recovered i don t know what the future holds but i m betting on success
