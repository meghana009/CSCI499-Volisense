global markets will go into overdrive next week with two central bank meetings and a landslide of data coming up the rba will probably reverse its tapering plans amid extended lockdowns in australia whereas the bank of england might strike a slightly more optimistic tone of course the main event will be the us jobs report which will determine how quickly the fed dials back stimulus dollar braces for payrolls fears that the federal reserve might announce a slowdown of its massive asset purchases in august subsided this week after chairman powell stressed that the labor market still hasn t recovered properly the dollar moved lower in the aftermath as real us yields fell to new record lows with the markets clearly pricing out the risk of an imminent taper that said the overall message wasn t so dovish the fed highlighted that the economy has made progress towards its goals and powell even said we are clearly on a path to a very strong labor market he also dismissed the delta variant as being a major risk and suggested that inflation might head even higher in the near term before cooling later on the bottom line is that august may be too early for a tapering announcement but september is still in play the fed can examine another two employment reports by then to make sure the labor market is strong and congress could deliver another round of spending on infrastructure ultimately this argues for a stronger dollar especially against the euro and yen as neither the ecb nor the boj will follow the fed anytime soon considering all this the upcoming us employment report on friday will be absolutely critical for how the dollar performs nonfarm payrolls are expected to clock in at 926k in july pushing the unemployment rate down two clicks to 5 7 it seems like many people are returning to the jobs market now that the generous unemployment benefits have started to expire the us economy is still missing some 6 7 million jobs to recover completely however many people decided to retire once the pandemic hit around 3 million by some estimates therefore america might only be missing around 4 million jobs for a full recovery which means we might be back at full employment by the end of the year at this pace ahead of friday s jobs numbers the ism manufacturing pmi will hit the markets on monday before the services index is released wednesday rba to put tapering plans on ice the reserve bank of australia meets on tuesday and it might be forced to abandon its plans to trim asset purchases just four weeks ago the rba said it would slow down its purchases of government bonds as the economy was much stronger than it had expected things have changed dramatically since then with much of australia trapped in a lockdown to fight the delta variant the economy is headed for a contraction this quarter that will cost many jobs canceling out much of the earlier progress in the recovery hence the rba will probably strike a very cautious tone next week policymakers have long stressed that bond purchases can always be increased again if the economy weakens and now would be a great time to demonstrate this flexibility if the central bank indeed abandons its taper plans and signals that bond purchases won t slow down after all that could hammer the aussie lower boe neutral with an optimistic flavor on thursday the central bank torch will pass to the bank of england a couple of boe officials made headlines recently after they called for withdrawing some stimulus inflation is already running hot and they fear that unless the bank takes its foot off the accelerator soon this could start to infect inflation expectations and become more permanent if enough people expect higher inflation moving forward then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy because people take actions based on that however the rest of the committee doesn t really share this view most members have been adamant that withdrawing stimulus too early would be an even bigger risk as it could hurt the recovery especially now that the government is phasing out its job supporting programs as such the most likely conclusion is the boe signaling that the economy is doing better but that it is too early to withdraw any stimulus for now saunders and ramsden might dissent calling for an immediate withdrawal the pound has staged a phenomenal comeback in recent days and the outlook remains bright the uk enjoys one of the highest vaccination rates globally and the boe will probably be among the first central banks to raise interest rates this cycle markets are currently pricing in a 15bps rate increase for june next year which seems reasonable loonie and kiwi turn to jobs data beyond america employment data will also be released in new zealand and canada this will be the last major data point before the reserve bank of new zealand meets in mid august where markets are pricing in a 55 probability for a rate increase as such this dataset will shape market expectations ahead of this meeting driving the kiwi as traders position accordingly forecasts point to a solid report with the unemployment rate set to fall further if that s the case markets could become more confident about an immediate rate hike breathing some life back into the kiwi in canada jobs numbers for july will hit the markets on friday the bank of canada trimmed its asset purchases once again at its last meeting encouraged by a strong economy and widespread vaccinations the bank remains on track to end its qe program completely by year end coupled with high oil prices the outlook for the loonie seems bright chinese pmis and ecb minutes over in china the manufacturing and services pmis for july will be in the spotlight on monday and wednesday respectively the economy seems to be losing steam so these will be closely watched finally in europe it s a relatively quiet week retail sales for june are out on wednesday before the minutes of the latest ecb meeting on thursday markets don t pay much attention to either but the minutes could be interesting as this was the meeting when the ecb committed to negative rates for longer
like many new pandemic pet owners nia morgan knew her puppy zorro had grown very attached to her due to all the time she spent at home with him so she was understandably hesitant about leaving him for the first time with a sitter she d hired through rover a popular platform for booking dog and cat sitters morgan took what she thought were adequate steps to ensure her timid then 9 month old poodle mix would be in good hands during an upcoming trip she interviewed a rover sitter and did a trial run dropping zorro and a friend s dog off together with the sitter for the day zorro s temperament was good said morgan after picking up her dog which made her feel comfortable enough to book the same sitter for a five day trip one day after she left the sitter said her phone had broken and she was using her computer to send updates through the platform morgan said she wasn t sent photos of zorro something that is typically common for sitters to do but she had been satisfied with the in depth messages the sitter was providing the evening before morgan was set to return home to chicago the sitter messaged her that zorro got loose while she was at her boyfriend s house more than an hour away from her home according to correspondence viewed by cnn business morgan would soon discover through a post from the local animal control s facebook page that zorro had gone missing at the beginning of the stay according to a police report the local animal control received two calls reporting a loose dog on the first day of zorro s stay one came from a man who claimed his girlfriend s dog had gotten loose describing a dog similar to zorro the sitter waited four days to notify morgan all while providing false updates according to correspondence viewed by cnn business four months later morgan is still searching for zorro mostly she feels with little support from rover which initially included amber alert robocalls flyers and a 100 contribution toward a reward for finding zorro we feel terribly that some pet parents believe we ve fallen short of our obligation to them said rover spokesperson dave rosenbaum in a statement for this story we ll continue to work hard to live up to our community s expectations more than 2 million pet parents have turned to rover s network of trusted sitters and dog walkers to book services including boarding house sitting and day care according to the company now it is set to ride a wave of pandemic pet demand to a wall street debut but as with other sharing economy platforms which largely rely on independent contractors with limited amounts of vetting there can be a dark side cnn business spoke with six pet owners who said their dogs have gone missing or died while in the care of a sitter they found on rover s platform since the start of the pandemic all of them said they turned to the platform because it was a recognizable name in the industry and they felt more comfortable after reading positive reviews of their respective sitters on the site one pet owner said her sitter remained on the platform for months after her dogs were lost while in the sitter s care rover declined to comment on this claim another owner whose dog was found dead with no explanation said the sitter whose care he was in remains live on the platform rover said it is reviewing this matter it s unclear how many owners have experienced such incidents rosenbaum told cnn business the company tracks these incidents but does not currently disclose numbers however there have been stories over the years of dogs who were lost abused or found dead while in the care of rover sitters often reported on by local news outlets cnn business has not independently confirmed these accounts others don t make it to the press at all in some cases potentially due to the company s efforts to tie some payouts to non disclosure agreements which can effectively silence people from going public with their stories additionally when signing up to use rover customers agree to bring any claims against the company to individual arbitration a process that keeps issues out of court and prevents people from banding together to pursue combined cases such as a class action lawsuit unless they explicitly opt out of the agreement with a written notice as a team motivated by a shared love of pets we re committed to helping people access quality pet care so it weighs heavily on our hearts if someone has a negative experience rosenbaum said in a statement to cnn business over 40 million services have been booked through the platform with 97 of reviewed stays receiving 5 stars but even one negative experience is too many we work every day to improve the platform so that every experience on rover is a positive one rosenbaum told cnn business that it raised its standard reward for a lost dog from 100 to 500 in early july to address the effects of rising pandemic puppy adoptions and pent up travel demand at times rover increases the amount or applies other resources if we believe doing so could materially increase the likelihood of quickly reuniting a pet with their family he said that change came late for owners like morgan and elizabeth snell whose terrier mix tony went missing in greenville south carolina on july 4 after cnn business asked whether rover would offer the 500 amount to pet owners whose dogs are still missing and specifically mentioned morgan s zorro the company offered morgan the 500 amount snell said she was offered the larger contribution after her story was featured on local news this update would have been proactively communicated to the pet parent irrespective of press coverage rosenbaum said pandemic dog sitting boom founded in seattle in 2011 rover is part of a cohort of startups that emerged over the last decade uber and lyft chief among them that created marketplaces to connect individuals in need of a particular service with individuals who can provide such a service on a gig by gig basis the company dominated the sharing economy pet market even as it faced competition from wag a rival startup that raised an eye popping 300 million only to stumble as cnn business previously reported wag s leadership had struggled to handle fundamental issues facing its business including growth customer service and the safety of pets rover weathered the pandemic and arguably emerged stronger this year thanks to all the people who added canines to their homes and then needed pet walking and sitting services as the country reopened rover has increasingly eaten away at wag s market share holding 95 of the u s share of sales compared to wag s 5 in june 2021 according to data from bloomberg second measure now rover expects to begin trading on the nasdaq next month through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company which will value the combined company at 1 63 billion and help it continue to expand but amid the boom in business there have also been new reports of missing or killed dogs while in the care of a rover sitter in an sec filing from nebula caravel the company rover is merging with to go public one of its risk factors is an acknowledgment that rover cannot guarantee the safety of pets pet care providers pet parents and third parties like other on demand companies rover requires pet sitters to pass at least a basic background check which references a sex offender registry terrorist watchlist and the national criminal database which has its own limitations including the fact not all records are digitized rover says that sitter profiles are reviewed and approved by the company applicants also take a basic six question safety quiz according to rover s site sitters who apply for rover will receive approval or be notified that information provided is incomplete within 24 48 hours but some customers question the thoroughness of the background checks annette leturia dropped off her two dogs 2 year old togo and nearly 4 year old liam with a rover sitter in houston texas in late june for what was supposed to be a week long vacation only to return early after the sitter told her togo was found dead on the bathroom floor afterward leturia said she had an independent background check done on the sitter which turned up troubling charges for grand theft and fraud she said she still has no closure on what happened to togo in the meantime based on screenshots viewed by cnn business the sitter appears to be pet sitting on the platform when asked about this rosenbaum said we have asked our team to review the specifics of this incident and take further action if appropriate morgan zorro s owner also said she discovered her sitter had past criminal charges rosenbaum pointed out that cases can change between an initial charge and a final ruling in the interest of accuracy and fairness we must make decisions based on what is legally available to our background check provider and reported to us he said rover said sitters can choose to apply for a standard 25 or an enhanced 35 background check and pet owners can choose to only hire providers with enhanced checks the company also said it promotes meet and greets with sitters as well as meeting with multiple potential sitters prior to booking there is otherwise minimal vetting training or oversight because workers are treated by the company as independent contractors rather than employees a classification that could be jeopardized if the company asserted more control over sitters this factor is a standard complaint about the business model that worries some whether you re talking about ride share or grocery delivery there are lots of complaints about poor service because these platforms have decided to go down this route of using independent contractors they actually can t really train people to do a good job or to screen people maybe the way you d really want them to do it said miriam cherry a law professor at saint louis university school of law who has studied corporate social responsibility and the gig economy it is not a good model if you really care about wanting absolute good quality knowing you re covered if something goes wrong with a pet she added if

advertisement don t want to see this remove ads in a separate complaint filed thursday the securities and exchange commission said milton sold a version of nikola not as it was an early stage company with a novel idea to commercialize yet to be proven products and technology but rather as a trail blazing company that had already achieved many groundbreaking and game changing milestones trevor milton is innocent his lawyers said in a statement this is a new low in the government s efforts to criminalize lawful business conduct every executive in america should be horrified that milton would plead not guilty despite his company already publishing its own investigation and findings of misstatements is not a surprise over the course of 2020 milton spoke freely about the company s share price and his predictions for the startup over the course of 2020 helped put spacs back on the map social media use was a mainstay of milton s tenure after a short seller s report in september he issued a long series of instagram posts berating the author and other critics of the company he appealed to investors in an instagram video to exercise warrants milton was often combative on twitter with those who questioned his statements and the company s potential before deleting his social media accounts on sept 23 nikola said in a statement that it has cooperated with the investigation today s government actions are against mr milton individually and not against the company it said advertisement don t want to see this remove ads shares of the startup closed down 15 on thursday to 12 03 the biggest drop since jan 28 the stock is down 21 year to date through thursday s close nikola s sudden rise and dramatic fall kicked off a trend other startups including lordstown motors corp and canoo inc have gone down similar paths merging with special purpose acquisition companies and then struggling to hold up to scrutiny after going public dramatic fall nikola went public through a reverse merger with a blank check company in june in a deal that made milton into a billionaire several times over at one point the company s shares ballooned to almost 80 apiece giving it a market capitalization greater than ford motor co despite not generating any meaningful revenue advertisement don t want to see this remove ads days after the startup s shares debuted bloomberg news reported that milton had exaggerated the capability of the company s debut truck the nikola one that story got the attention of an activist investor at hindenburg research which published a detailed report in september accusing milton and nikola of deception nikola initially denied the claims by hindenburg which was betting against its shares but milton resigned later that month and in february the company said an internal review of claims about its technology concluded the startup and its founder made several inaccurate statements hindenburg congratulated investigators for holding milton accountable for his statements in a tweet after he was charged advertisement don t want to see this remove ads the fallout from the accusations has forced nikola to curtail its ambitions a deal with general motors co to build a pickup collapsed and an electric garbage truck program with republic services inc was cancelled nikola s market capitalization has plunged from almost 29 billion in june last year to about 5 billion currently milton is the company s largest shareholder with stake of around 20 of the company directly according to data compiled by bloomberg he also owns additional shares through a joint entity called t m residual with mark russell nikola s current chief executive officer social media usage the sec says milton was intensely focused on the company s stock price calling and texting senior executives to do something on days when the shares were falling he also tracked the daily number of new robinhood users who held nikola stock according to the complaint gurbir grewal the sec s head of enforcement said thursday the case was about the obligations of corporate officers to provide complete and accurate information about their companies operations corporate officers cannot say whatever they want on social media in violation of federal securities laws he said around the time of the merger milton tweeted about a battery powered pickup called the badger a truck the company had said in regulatory filings may not make it to production because it lacked a manufacturing partner milton also used his social media presence and appearances in interviews to announce new initiatives and changes before informing the company the sec alleges for example on june 25 2020 milton sent a series of tweets from his personal account in which he claimed that nikola would offer a drinking fountain in the badger this information came as a complete surprise to nikola s designers engineers and marketing personnel when informed of the tweets one engineer questioned whether this a joke a marketing employee wrote that his head is fuzzy and a designer texted hhhhh what among the false and misleading statements milton made according to the federal indictment that the company had a fully functioning semi truck prototype known as the nikola one despite the fact that milton knew that the prototype was inoperable that nikola had engineered and built an electric and hydrogen powered pickup truck the badger from the ground up using nikola s parts and technology which he knew was not true that nikola was producing hydrogen and was doing so at a reduced cost when no hydrogen was being produced at all by nikola at any cost that nikola had developed batteries and other important components in house when they were buying them from third parties that reservations for nikola s vehicles were binding orders representing billions in revenue when they were actually able to be canceled at any time and were for a truck nikola had no intent to produce in the near term production progress beyond nikola s technology milton and other executives statements contained discrepancies and exaggerations about the company s progress toward production in july 2020 milton tweeted that construction would start on the company s coolidge arizona plant just days after groundbreaking this followed a comment by mark duchesne nikola s head of global manufacturing who told reporters on july 22 that construction would start the following day however this would not have been possible because nikola only held a temporary use permit that allowed for limited ground clearing and safety measures to facilitate the groundbreaking event it did not have the required permits to start construction bloomberg reported in a similar stretching of words milton told a podcast that month that its european partner iveco was already producing vehicle prototypes that were coming off the assembly line right now in ulm germany this was echoed by the company s chief executive officer russell on an aug 4 on an earnings call where he stated that the prototypes were coming off the end of the facility at this point while prototypes were being made in germany bloomberg reported in september that the assembly line was not in fact operable and the facility was still under construction two months after milton s original statement the prototypes were being built by hand in a nearby workshop on the site not on the assembly line on thursday nikola sent out an invitation to its opening ceremony for the ulm facility on sept 15 ev startup scrutiny nikola was among the first ev startups that attracted attention from investors last year as possible rivals to market leader tesla inc but not the last to draw scrutiny from regulators lordstown s boasts about non binding orders gave way to another attack by hindenburg research which leveled accusations similar to the ones aimed at nikola that lordstown had misled investors its founder stepped down in june and the company confirmed this month that it is being probed by the justice department and the sec canoo rattled the market in march by announcing a hard pivot in its business plans to de emphasize parts of its original pitch to investors its co founder and ceo resigned in april and in may the company disclosed an sec investigation

my earliest experience in government and politics came when i was a senior in high school responding to rumors in the rural community where i lived with my parents that vote buying was going on i did a research paper at the encouragement of my government class teacher who knew of my intense interest in politics to learn whether vote buying was taking place i made an inquiry to the then secretary of the state board of elections as to whether i could secure vote totals along with the absentee votes cast for all the jurisdictions in the 1950s much to my surprise he responded with the numbers and i charted votes cast in total along with the absentee votes cast what i found was what i had been told in rural page county where i lived and several counties in far southwest virginia the percentage of absentee votes cast in years when local officials were elected would be about one third in other jurisdictions including more urban and suburban areas absentee votes would account for only one to two percent what was happening was that political workers in these counties apparently of both parties would go out to backroads and mountain hollows with absentee ballots for which they would approach voters with agreeing to pay their poll taxes that were required to vote at the time and promising who knows what others favors the answer i received when i inquired of leaders of both parties as to why this illegal practice continued was that both sides were doing it and there was no one left to enforce the law the poll tax requiring voters to pay a tax three years in a row at least six months before the election was instituted in the 1902 constitution with the avowed purpose of cleaning up elections translated to mean keeping black citizens and poor whites from voting along with the blank sheet voter registration and literacy test the number of registered voters was cut in half the reform of the voting system had met its intended purpose of ensuring without fraud that only the right people voted fortunately these abuses of the electoral system were eliminated by a federal constitutional amendment and court decisions with the outcome of the virginia elections in 2019 a more progressive general assembly and governor were elected who further modernized the electoral registration and voting system to make virginia a leader in election reform we have the most open and accessible system of government among the states for the dozens of people who emailed me with few emails coming from my constituents asking that i seek a forensic investigation of the outcome of the 2020 election in virginia i want to be clear that i will not seek such an investigation president biden won clearly nationwide and he won by a landslide in virginia there is no credible evidence of fraud or irregularities the entire election process in virginia is monitored by persons of both parties the big lie is just that those who propose election changes to enhance their chances of winning are the ones who are creating the fraud ken plum is a member of the virginia house of delegates

like many new pandemic pet owners nia morgan knew her puppy zorro had grown very attached to her due to all the time she spent at home with him so she was understandably hesitant about leaving him for the first time with a sitter she d hired through rover a popular platform for booking dog and cat sitters morgan took what she thought were adequate steps to ensure her timid then 9 month old poodle mix would be in good hands during an upcoming trip she interviewed a rover sitter and did a trial run dropping zorro and a friend s dog off together with the sitter for the day zorro s temperament was good said morgan after picking up her dog which made her feel comfortable enough to book the same sitter for a five day trip one day after she left the sitter said her phone had broken and she was using her computer to send updates through the platform morgan said she wasn t sent photos of zorro something that is typically common for sitters to do but she had been satisfied with the in depth messages the sitter was providing the evening before morgan was set to return home to chicago the sitter messaged her that zorro got loose while she was at her boyfriend s house more than an hour away from her home according to correspondence viewed by cnn business morgan would soon discover through a post from the local animal control s facebook page that zorro had gone missing at the beginning of the stay according to a police report the local animal control received two calls reporting a loose dog on the first day of zorro s stay one came from a man who claimed his girlfriend s dog had gotten loose describing a dog similar to zorro the sitter waited four days to notify morgan all while providing false updates according to correspondence viewed by cnn business four months later morgan is still searching for zorro mostly she feels with little support from rover which initially included amber alert robocalls flyers and a 100 contribution toward a reward for finding zorro we feel terribly that some pet parents believe we ve fallen short of our obligation to them said rover spokesperson dave rosenbaum in a statement for this story we ll continue to work hard to live up to our community s expectations more than 2 million pet parents have turned to rover s network of trusted sitters and dog walkers to book services including boarding house sitting and day care according to the company now it is set to ride a wave of pandemic pet demand to a wall street debut but as with other sharing economy platforms which largely rely on independent contractors with limited amounts of vetting there can be a dark side cnn business spoke with six pet owners who said their dogs have gone missing or died while in the care of a sitter they found on rover s platform since the start of the pandemic all of them said they turned to the platform because it was a recognizable name in the industry and they felt more comfortable after reading positive reviews of their respective sitters on the site one pet owner said her sitter remained on the platform for months after her dogs were lost while in the sitter s care rover declined to comment on this claim another owner whose dog was found dead with no explanation said the sitter whose care he was in remains live on the platform rover said it is reviewing this matter it s unclear how many owners have experienced such incidents rosenbaum told cnn business the company tracks these incidents but does not currently disclose numbers however there have been stories over the years of dogs who were lost abused or found dead while in the care of rover sitters often reported on by local news outlets cnn business has not independently confirmed these accounts others don t make it to the press at all in some cases potentially due to the company s efforts to tie some payouts to non disclosure agreements which can effectively silence people from going public with their stories additionally when signing up to use rover customers agree to bring any claims against the company to individual arbitration a process that keeps issues out of court and prevents people from banding together to pursue combined cases such as a class action lawsuit unless they explicitly opt out of the agreement with a written notice as a team motivated by a shared love of pets we re committed to helping people access quality pet care so it weighs heavily on our hearts if someone has a negative experience rosenbaum said in a statement to cnn business over 40 million services have been booked through the platform with 97 of reviewed stays receiving 5 stars but even one negative experience is too many we work every day to improve the platform so that every experience on rover is a positive one rosenbaum told cnn business that it raised its standard reward for a lost dog from 100 to 500 in early july to address the effects of rising pandemic puppy adoptions and pent up travel demand at times rover increases the amount or applies other resources if we believe doing so could materially increase the likelihood of quickly reuniting a pet with their family he said that change came late for owners like morgan and elizabeth snell whose terrier mix tony went missing in greenville south carolina on july 4 after cnn business asked whether rover would offer the 500 amount to pet owners whose dogs are still missing and specifically mentioned morgan s zorro the company offered morgan the 500 amount snell said she was offered the larger contribution after her story was featured on local news this update would have been proactively communicated to the pet parent irrespective of press coverage rosenbaum said pandemic dog sitting boom founded in seattle in 2011 rover is part of a cohort of startups that emerged over the last decade uber and lyft chief among them that created marketplaces to connect individuals in need of a particular service with individuals who can provide such a service on a gig by gig basis the company dominated the sharing economy pet market even as it faced competition from wag a rival startup that raised an eye popping 300 million only to stumble as cnn business previously reported wag s leadership had struggled to handle fundamental issues facing its business including growth customer service and the safety of pets rover weathered the pandemic and arguably emerged stronger this year thanks to all the people who added canines to their homes and then needed pet walking and sitting services as the country reopened rover has increasingly eaten away at wag s market share holding 95 of the u s share of sales compared to wag s 5 in june 2021 according to data from bloomberg second measure now rover expects to begin trading on the nasdaq next month through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company which will value the combined company at 1 63 billion and help it continue to expand but amid the boom in business there have also been new reports of missing or killed dogs while in the care of a rover sitter in an sec filing from nebula caravel the company rover is merging with to go public one of its risk factors is an acknowledgment that rover cannot guarantee the safety of pets pet care providers pet parents and third parties like other on demand companies rover requires pet sitters to pass at least a basic background check which references a sex offender registry terrorist watchlist and the national criminal database which has its own limitations including the fact not all records are digitized rover says that sitter profiles are reviewed and approved by the company applicants also take a basic six question safety quiz according to rover s site sitters who apply for rover will receive approval or be notified that information provided is incomplete within 24 48 hours but some customers question the thoroughness of the background checks annette leturia dropped off her two dogs 2 year old togo and nearly 4 year old liam with a rover sitter in houston texas in late june for what was supposed to be a week long vacation only to return early after the sitter told her togo was found dead on the bathroom floor afterward leturia said she had an independent background check done on the sitter which turned up troubling charges for grand theft and fraud she said she still has no closure on what happened to togo in the meantime based on screenshots viewed by cnn business the sitter appears to be pet sitting on the platform when asked about this rosenbaum said we have asked our team to review the specifics of this incident and take further action if appropriate morgan zorro s owner also said she discovered her sitter had past criminal charges rosenbaum pointed out that cases can change between an initial charge and a final ruling in the interest of accuracy and fairness we must make decisions based on what is legally available to our background check provider and reported to us he said rover said sitters can choose to apply for a standard 25 or an enhanced 35 background check and pet owners can choose to only hire providers with enhanced checks the company also said it promotes meet and greets with sitters as well as meeting with multiple potential sitters prior to booking there is otherwise minimal vetting training or oversight because workers are treated by the company as independent contractors rather than employees a classification that could be jeopardized if the company asserted more control over sitters this factor is a standard complaint about the business model that worries some whether you re talking about ride share or grocery delivery there are lots of complaints about poor service because these platforms have decided to go down this route of using independent contractors they actually can t really train people to do a good job or to screen people maybe the way you d really want them to do it said miriam cherry a law professor at saint louis university school of law who has studied corporate social responsibility and the gig economy it is not a good model if you really care about wanting absolute good quality knowing you re covered if something goes wrong with a pet she added if

like many new pandemic pet owners nia morgan knew her puppy zorro had grown very attached to her due to all the time she spent at home with him so she was understandably hesitant about leaving him for the first time with a sitter she d hired through rover a popular platform for booking dog and cat sitters morgan took what she thought were adequate steps to ensure her timid then 9 month old poodle mix would be in good hands during an upcoming trip she interviewed a rover sitter and did a trial run dropping zorro and a friend s dog off together with the sitter for the day zorro s temperament was good said morgan after picking up her dog which made her feel comfortable enough to book the same sitter for a five day trip one day after she left the sitter said her phone had broken and she was using her computer to send updates through the platform morgan said she wasn t sent photos of zorro something that is typically common for sitters to do but she had been satisfied with the in depth messages the sitter was providing the evening before morgan was set to return home to chicago the sitter messaged her that zorro got loose while she was at her boyfriend s house more than an hour away from her home according to correspondence viewed by cnn business morgan would soon discover through a post from the local animal control s facebook page that zorro had gone missing at the beginning of the stay according to a police report the local animal control received two calls reporting a loose dog on the first day of zorro s stay one came from a man who claimed his girlfriend s dog had gotten loose describing a dog similar to zorro the sitter waited four days to notify morgan all while providing false updates according to correspondence viewed by cnn business four months later morgan is still searching for zorro mostly she feels with little support from rover which initially included amber alert robocalls flyers and a 100 contribution toward a reward for finding zorro we feel terribly that some pet parents believe we ve fallen short of our obligation to them said rover spokesperson dave rosenbaum in a statement for this story we ll continue to work hard to live up to our community s expectations more than 2 million pet parents have turned to rover s network of trusted sitters and dog walkers to book services including boarding house sitting and day care according to the company now it is set to ride a wave of pandemic pet demand to a wall street debut but as with other sharing economy platforms which largely rely on independent contractors with limited amounts of vetting there can be a dark side cnn business spoke with six pet owners who said their dogs have gone missing or died while in the care of a sitter they found on rover s platform since the start of the pandemic all of them said they turned to the platform because it was a recognizable name in the industry and they felt more comfortable after reading positive reviews of their respective sitters on the site one pet owner said her sitter remained on the platform for months after her dogs were lost while in the sitter s care rover declined to comment on this claim another owner whose dog was found dead with no explanation said the sitter whose care he was in remains live on the platform rover said it is reviewing this matter it s unclear how many owners have experienced such incidents rosenbaum told cnn business the company tracks these incidents but does not currently disclose numbers however there have been stories over the years of dogs who were lost abused or found dead while in the care of rover sitters often reported on by local news outlets cnn business has not independently confirmed these accounts others don t make it to the press at all in some cases potentially due to the company s efforts to tie some payouts to non disclosure agreements which can effectively silence people from going public with their stories additionally when signing up to use rover customers agree to bring any claims against the company to individual arbitration a process that keeps issues out of court and prevents people from banding together to pursue combined cases such as a class action lawsuit unless they explicitly opt out of the agreement with a written notice as a team motivated by a shared love of pets we re committed to helping people access quality pet care so it weighs heavily on our hearts if someone has a negative experience rosenbaum said in a statement to cnn business over 40 million services have been booked through the platform with 97 of reviewed stays receiving 5 stars but even one negative experience is too many we work every day to improve the platform so that every experience on rover is a positive one rosenbaum told cnn business that it raised its standard reward for a lost dog from 100 to 500 in early july to address the effects of rising pandemic puppy adoptions and pent up travel demand at times rover increases the amount or applies other resources if we believe doing so could materially increase the likelihood of quickly reuniting a pet with their family he said that change came late for owners like morgan and elizabeth snell whose terrier mix tony went missing in greenville south carolina on july 4 after cnn business asked whether rover would offer the 500 amount to pet owners whose dogs are still missing and specifically mentioned morgan s zorro the company offered morgan the 500 amount snell said she was offered the larger contribution after her story was featured on local news this update would have been proactively communicated to the pet parent irrespective of press coverage rosenbaum said pandemic dog sitting boom founded in seattle in 2011 rover is part of a cohort of startups that emerged over the last decade uber and lyft chief among them that created marketplaces to connect individuals in need of a particular service with individuals who can provide such a service on a gig by gig basis the company dominated the sharing economy pet market even as it faced competition from wag a rival startup that raised an eye popping 300 million only to stumble as cnn business previously reported wag s leadership had struggled to handle fundamental issues facing its business including growth customer service and the safety of pets rover weathered the pandemic and arguably emerged stronger this year thanks to all the people who added canines to their homes and then needed pet walking and sitting services as the country reopened rover has increasingly eaten away at wag s market share holding 95 of the u s share of sales compared to wag s 5 in june 2021 according to data from bloomberg second measure now rover expects to begin trading on the nasdaq next month through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company which will value the combined company at 1 63 billion and help it continue to expand but amid the boom in business there have also been new reports of missing or killed dogs while in the care of a rover sitter in an sec filing from nebula caravel the company rover is merging with to go public one of its risk factors is an acknowledgment that rover cannot guarantee the safety of pets pet care providers pet parents and third parties like other on demand companies rover requires pet sitters to pass at least a basic background check which references a sex offender registry terrorist watchlist and the national criminal database which has its own limitations including the fact not all records are digitized rover says that sitter profiles are reviewed and approved by the company applicants also take a basic six question safety quiz according to rover s site sitters who apply for rover will receive approval or be notified that information provided is incomplete within 24 48 hours but some customers question the thoroughness of the background checks annette leturia dropped off her two dogs 2 year old togo and nearly 4 year old liam with a rover sitter in houston texas in late june for what was supposed to be a week long vacation only to return early after the sitter told her togo was found dead on the bathroom floor afterward leturia said she had an independent background check done on the sitter which turned up troubling charges for grand theft and fraud she said she still has no closure on what happened to togo in the meantime based on screenshots viewed by cnn business the sitter appears to be pet sitting on the platform when asked about this rosenbaum said we have asked our team to review the specifics of this incident and take further action if appropriate morgan zorro s owner also said she discovered her sitter had past criminal charges rosenbaum pointed out that cases can change between an initial charge and a final ruling in the interest of accuracy and fairness we must make decisions based on what is legally available to our background check provider and reported to us he said rover said sitters can choose to apply for a standard 25 or an enhanced 35 background check and pet owners can choose to only hire providers with enhanced checks the company also said it promotes meet and greets with sitters as well as meeting with multiple potential sitters prior to booking there is otherwise minimal vetting training or oversight because workers are treated by the company as independent contractors rather than employees a classification that could be jeopardized if the company asserted more control over sitters this factor is a standard complaint about the business model that worries some whether you re talking about ride share or grocery delivery there are lots of complaints about poor service because these platforms have decided to go down this route of using independent contractors they actually can t really train people to do a good job or to screen people maybe the way you d really want them to do it said miriam cherry a law professor at saint louis university school of law who has studied corporate social responsibility and the gig economy it is not a good model if you really care about wanting absolute good quality knowing you re covered if something goes wrong with a pet she added if

and there weren t many destinations downtown where kids were welcome steele explains i had no intention of starting another business we were going through a pandemic and i knew nothing about bookselling i didn t even know where i d get the books but i wanted a place for families we didn t need another bar or restaurant the learning curve has been steep but steele has embraced it joining

hosting events in the 1 200 sq ft space in which she spotlights colorful picture books by displaying them face out in the front area while middle grade and ya titles are shelved in a back area designed to look like a classic library she is already planning something even more ambitious than a reading or storytime a street festival featuring children s authors including rena rosen and amy logan face painting live music and food vendors despite owning another retail business steele describes her entry into bookselling as a humbling experience disclosing that if she had known how little she knew about the industry before she signed the lease she never would have done it it s been harder to learn than the typical retail experience she admits but everyone has been so supportive i have customers who i believe will show up and i have this other community of booksellers and publishers reps who will help me the wandering jellyfish bookshop niwot colo opening date july 31 2021 beginning when she was a student at the university of colorado children s writer and illustrator carissa mina kept her eye on a 112 year old historic building outside of boulder in downtown niwot that she envisioned as the perfect space for a children s bookstore the minute that building became available in april i jumped on it she says i ve been waiting five years for this mina asked fellow children s lit enthusiast jerilyn patterson to partner with her and the two are launching the wandering jellyfish bookshop on august 14 the 620 sq ft retail space holds 1 400 books there is also a 450 sq ft area in which writing and illustrating workshops are planned two of the first things mina and patterson did after signing the lease were joining the aba and signing up for paz associates online training courses for prospective booksellers they also hired donna paz and mark kaufman as consultants donna and mark introduced us to some veteran booksellers that we talked to as well patterson explains the bookstore co owners note that their volunteer work with the society of children s book writers and illustrators eased the transition providing them with some knowledge of how the industry works launching a business during the pandemic didn t faze either woman we both felt like we wanted and needed some personal connection patterson says we d been online for so long this bookstore is the perfect marriage between what we both love children s books and getting books out into the community return to the main feature
using the us and uk as reference points consider the numbers after the financial crisis 2007 2008 us a loss of 8 trillion borne by the stock market and a 10 per cent peak of unemployment in 2009 9 8 trillion were lost by americans because of plummeting house values and a decrease in the worth of retirement accounts uk the eventual cost of bailing out the banking industry stood at 137bn 878 remained the amount in real terms that savers have earned from a hypothetical 1 000 placed in a savings account in 2007 08 yes they have lost money because of ultralow interest rates take a look around now and it seems that the financial crisis of 2007 08 is fast becoming a fading memory financial liquidity was indeed the order of the day for the covid 19 pandemic but in doing so excessively central banks more than any other entity have perhaps sown the seed of another asset collapse in the future consider without negating their importance and when all the pomp and show is taken away the actions performed by central banks can be simplified to these two one controlling borrowing rates two managing the money supply in the economy in response to the pandemic central banks everywhere used these two levers aggressively as they should have at the start because of the catastrophic nature of potential economic devastation interest rates were slashed close to zero and debt was bought to inject more money into circulation the consequence of the two actions even cheaper debt the imf estimates that in 2020 central banks provided trillions in monetary support one look at the balance sheet of major central banks confirms this notion european central bank 6 5 trillion us federal reserve 7 trillion bank of japan 650 trillion therefore the interventionist nature of a loose monetary policy is clear to see and the underlying strategy even clearer make debt cheapest to encourage investment and deter saving the policy objective easy cash forces companies to invest and hire to get the real economy moving based on job growth and consumer confidence the problem investors chase higher returns around the world and move towards the highest yield i e away from safe assets the result overinflated asset bubbles pop fiscal stability is conceded and all before the real economy can benefit from the cheap and abundant cash financial liquidity was the order of the day for the pandemic but in doing so excessively central banks have perhaps sown the seed of another asset collapse if that wasn t enough governments across the world joined in with an expansionary fiscal policy underpinned by massive spending and handouts the imf suggests that world governments have spent around 12 trillion in stimulus and grants in the us the federal housing administration not only provides discretionary loans for first time home buyers but also gives homeownership vouchers in the uk the ministry of housing runs a scheme where the uk government guarantees and pays 20 per cent of the deposit on a new build house if the first time buyer can furnish five per cent of the deposit additionally the local lenders are being asked to provide mortgage products with only a five per cent deposit or in some extreme cases a 0 per cent deposit i recall ironically that providing 100 per cent mortgages prospective buyers needing to pay no deposit was one of the reasons cited for the financial crisis 2007 08 the confluence of the two interventionist endeavours a loose monetary policy and an expansionary fiscal policy means that asset bubbles are already in the making one glance over the property markets across the world proves that point while it is true that the cost of not doing something was great it may be true that overdoing it generates an equally opposite and extreme scenario which consequently leads to a bigger fall i guess that central banks and governments have to walk that tight rope but for now central banks know what they are doing basically lowering the return of safe assets to increase demand for risky ones as per alicia garcía herrero chief economist for asia pacific at the french investment bank natixis and who has previously worked for the imf and the european central bank all while the real economy and 90 per cent of the world consumers don t get any benefit out of this at all jerome jean haegeli the group chief economist at the swiss re institute in zurich suggests that central banks are in a global liquidity trap the liquidity bazooka buys time and pushes up asset prices but has zero value in improving economic trend growth like a black hole once you are in it it is extremely difficult to get out that s where we are in central banking we are in a liquidity black hole policymakers will soon need to wake up and stave off a potential and catastrophic bust that can again ruin people economies and countries this is because while there is less risk to growth now there is more risk to financial stability and asset bubbles the party can come crashing down before we can say in stimulus we trust the writer is director programmes for an international ict organization based in the uk and writes on corporate strategy socio economic and geopolitical issues
ottawa canada reports from canada say canadian prime minister justin trudeau will schedule snap elections in september two years ahead of schedule trudeau believes he can strengthen his party s hold on power due to the success of high vaccination rates and a post pandemic rebound which he hopes will translate to increased votes the 49 year old trudeau would face his third election as prime minister trudeau s liberal party won a majority in 2015 however in 2019 elections he lost enough seats to force his party to form a coalition government to regain a majority the liberals would need to win another 15 seats in the 338 seat house of commons to be able to govern on their own a september vote would be an election of inches not giant steps we re looking at 15 seats or so according to allan tupper professor of political science at university of british columbia at vancouver as quoted by reuters failure would be not to win a majority and repeat the status quo tupper said trudeau however is gambling with his own future analysts believe that if trudeau and the liberals do not receive a majority of seats party members might seek a new leader of note the opposition conservative party remains behind the liberals in the polls polling suggests the liberals could win a majority in september as canadians return to a life free of covid and the economy is boosted by billions of government dollars current polling show the liberals winning 34 percent of the vote in september which would not allow them to form a majority government however trudeau is betting on winning a greater majority of votes in early 2021 45 percent of adults said the covid 19 response by the canadian government was by far the top issue for voters by the third quarter however it had fallen to the ninth most important issue according to a july 16 angus reid poll in canada covid 19 case numbers have fallen as have hospitalizations and deaths also vaccination levels are among the highest in the world

our conference call this morning to discuss the results of balchem corporation for the quarter ending june 30 2021 my name is martin bengtsson chief financial officer and hosting this call with me is ted harris our chairman ceo and president following the advice of our counsel auditors and the sec at this time i would like to read our forward looking statement this release does contain or likely will contain forward looking statements which reflect balchem s expectation or belief concerning future events that involve risks and uncertainties we can give no assurance that the expectations reflected in forward looking statements will prove correct and various factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations including risks and factors identified in balchem s form 10 k forward looking statements are qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements i will now turn the call over to ted harris chairman ceo and president theodore l harris chairman chief executive officer and president thanks martin good morning and welcome to our conference call this morning we reported strong second quarter results with record sales in all three of our business segments solid consolidated earnings growth and strong free cash flow our revenues of 202 4 million were up 16 7 and our adjusted earnings from operations were 41 1 million up 14 6 versus the prior year quarter our second quarter net income of 22 7 million an increase of 7 6 resulted in earnings per share of 0 70 on a gaap basis on an adjusted basis our second quarter non gaap net earnings were 30 4 million an increase of 10 3 resulting in earnings per share of 0 93 on a non gaap basis and we continue to deliver strong cash flows cash flows from operations were 35 8 million for the second quarter of 2021 with quarterly free cash flow of 28 4 million before passing the call back to martin to cover the detailed financial results i would like to update you on a few items in may our verona missouri plant experienced a flash flood as a result of very localized storms in the southwest part of the state the plant was shut down for several weeks as we repaired affected equipment cleaned the site and safely restarted activities all three of our business segments provide products and services out of the verona missouri site so each of the segments was affected by the temporary site shutdown to a varying degree the negative direct financial impact to the quarter was approximately 3 8 million primarily due to the write off of damaged inventory and the costs associated with external service providers used for the cleanup efforts we also expect an additional spend of approximately 1 5 million to impact the third quarter customer requirements were largely satisfied through inventory on hand and by leveraging alternate and redundant manufacturing capabilities across our supply chain the manufacturing site is now fully operational and all activities are functioning normally as part of our enterprise risk management plan we have extensive insurance coverage to help mitigate the impact of such an event our deductible in this particular case is 2 million and we believe at this point all of the remaining costs should be fully recovered in subsequent quarters from our insurance coverage while the flash flood was a very unfortunate event it highlighted the value of our enterprise risk management plan and the benefits of preparedness for such an event as well as the risk mitigation strategies implemented in advance of the event such as our insurance coverage but also the redundant manufacturing capabilities we have for many of our products and services across our global supply chain network i would like to once again thank the balchem team for their incredible teamwork during and after the event that enabled us to get back up and running safely in a relatively short amount of time with minimal disruption to our customers moving on to a different topic i am very excited to share that in june balchem s board of directors elected ms kathy fish to fill a vacancy on the board ms fish recently retired from the position of chief research development and innovation officer at the procter gamble company over a long career at p g kathy held various roles within the research and development function of increasing responsibility before leading the global function from 2014 to 2020 kathy brings to the balchem board important new product development and direct to consumer expertise along with her international business acumen and experience in driving a growth culture kathy will serve on the corporate governance and nominating committee and we are very pleased with her addition to our board of directors as mentioned on our last earnings call in april we released our third sustainability report we have for the first time published our 2030 goals to reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and water usage by 25 these are significant and important goals that further our commitment to operate with excellence as strong stewards of our stakeholders while providing innovative solutions for the health and nutritional needs of the world lastly despite numerous challenges to manage in the overall macroeconomic environment at the moment and discrete challenges in the quarter related to the flash flood event at our verona missouri manufacturing facility we achieved solid second quarter results which highlights the strength and resilience of our business model as was always as was also mentioned on our last earnings call while the significantly higher raw material and freight costs we are facing are not differentially impacting balchem we continue to dedicate significant resources to various mitigating activities to effectively manage through these very significant challenges i m now going to turn the call back over to martin to go through the detailed consolidated financial results for the company and the results for each of our business segments carl martin bengtsson chief financial officer and treasurer thank you ted as ted mentioned overall we delivered strong financial results in a challenging environment our second quarter net sales of 202 4 million or 16 7 higher than the prior year comparable quarter we delivered record sales in all three segments human nutrition and health animal nutrition health and specialty products the impact of foreign exchange to our sales was a positive 2 3 million primarily due to the stronger euro contributing a positive 1 3 impact to our year over year sales growth second quarter consolidated gross margin dollars of 59 4 million were up 4 1 million or 7 3 compared with 55 4 million for the same period in the prior year our gross margin percent was 29 4 of sales in the quarter down 257 basis points compared to 31 9 in the second quarter of 2020 the 257 basis point decrease was primarily due to a significant increase in certain raw material and distribution costs and the costs associated with the recovery from the flash flood event partially offset by favorable mix and overall manufacturing efficiencies consolidated operating expenses for the second quarter of 2021 were 28 9 million as compared to 28 5 million in the prior year the slight increase was primarily due to higher compensation related costs partially offset by the prior year being negatively impacted by a goodwill impairment charge related to business formally included in the industrial products segment and a decrease in transaction and integration costs gaap earnings from operations for the second quarter were 30 6 million an increase of 3 7 million or 13 7 compared to the prior year quarter on an adjusted basis as detailed in our earnings release this morning non gaap earnings from operations of 41 1 million were up 5 2 million or 14 6 compared to the prior year quarter adjusted ebitda of 50 1 million was 6 3 million or 14 3 above the second quarter of 2020 interest expense for the second quarter of 2021 was 0 6 million and our net debt was 43 7 million with an overall leverage ratio on a net debt basis of 0 2 million the company s effective tax rates for the second quarters of 2021 and 2020 were 24 3 and 18 7 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in certain tax credits and lower tax benefits from stock based compensation consolidated net income closed the quarter at 22 7 million up 7 6 from the prior year quarter this quarterly net income translated into diluted net earnings per share of 0 7 an increase of 0 05 or 7 from last year s comparable quarter on an adjusted basis our second quarter adjusted net earnings were 30 4 million or 0 93 per diluted share up 2 8 million or 10 3 compared with prior year quarter we generated quarterly free cash flow of 28 4 million and we closed the quarter with 79 9 million of cash on the balance sheet as we look at it from a segment perspective for the quarter our human nutrition health segment generated quarterly sales of 111 5 million an increase of 14 million or 14 4 from the prior year the sales increase was driven both by strong sales growth within food and beverage markets as well as higher sales within the minerals and nutrients businesses we were very pleased to see significant year over year and sequential growth on the food ingredient side of our business as well as continued strong sales within our minerals and choline nutrients business our human nutrition health segment delivered quarterly earnings from operations of 19 million an increase of 3 5 million or 22 7 compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to the aforementioned higher sales and overall manufacturing efficiencies partially offset by higher raw material and distribution costs and the costs associated with the recovery from the flash flood event that we experienced at our verona missouri manufacturing site excluding the effect of noncash expense associated with amortization of intangible assets of 4 3 million and excluding the direct expenses related to the verona flash flood event second quarter adjusted earnings from operations for this segment were 25 3 million an increase of 5 million or 24 6 our animal nutrition health segment generated quarterly sales of 54 5 million an increase of 8 1 million or 17 6 compared to the prior year the increase in sales was primarily the result of higher sales in both monogastric and ruminant animal markets and a favorable impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates which contributed 1 3 million or 2 8 of growth to the segment our ruminant business grew volumes 31 8 and we continue to successfully drive penetration of our rumen protected and capsulated products in the market in terms of dairy economics milk and milk protein prices have come down a bit during the second quarter but are still at relatively healthy levels where our products have a strong value proposition on the monogastric side overall volumes were down slightly due to lower european demand for choline however the financial impact of this volume decrease was fully offset by higher volumes of u s feed grade choline an increase in average selling prices and higher sales of chelated minerals and companion animal products animal nutrition health quarterly earnings from operations of 3 6 million were down 2 9 million or 44 6 from the prior year quarter primarily due to increases in raw material and distribution costs and the costs associated with the recovery from the flash flood event at our verona missouri manufacturing facility excluding the effect of noncash expense associated with amortization of intangible assets of 0 2 million and excluding the direct expenses related to the verona flash blood event of 1 4 million second quarter adjusted earnings from operations for this segment were 5 2 million a decrease of 1 4 million or 21 8 as raw material escalations slows and given the pricing mechanism we have currently in place in the vast majority of our animal nutrition health customer contracts we re expecting that margins will improve in this business segment as we progress through the second half of the year and into 2022 our specialty products segment delivered quarterly sales of 34 million an increase of 5 8 million or 20 7 compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to higher sales for products sold both to the medical device sterilization and the plant nutrition markets the specialty products segment had second quarter earnings from operations of 9 7 million an increase of 1 7 million or 21 5 versus the prior year quarter the increase was primarily due to the aforementioned higher sales partially offset by increases in raw material and distribution costs excluding the effect of noncash expense associated with amortization of intangible assets of 1 3 million and excluding the direct expenses related to the verona flash flood event second quarter adjusted earnings from operations for this segment were 11 2 million an increase of 1 6 million or 16 8 i m now going to turn the call back over to ted for some closing remarks theodore l harris chairman chief executive officer and president thanks martin we are very pleased with balchem s financial results reported earlier this morning delivering all time record revenues in all three of our business segments we achieved record second quarter consolidated gaap net earnings record quarterly non gaap adjusted net earnings record adjusted ebitda and strong cash flows from operations all of this while facing continued higher raw material costs global logistics and distribution challenges and manufacturing disruption and inventory loss related to the flash flood event at our verona plant these strong results reported today continue to show that we are well positioned in attractive markets where we have the leadership and capabilities to be successful not only today but also into the future i will now turn the call back over to martin to open it up for questions martin carl martin bengtsson chief financial officer and treasurer thank you ted this now concludes the formal portion of the conference at this point we will open the conference call for questions questions and answers operator our first question is from mark connelly with stephens mark william connelly stephens analyst thank you ted last quarter my question about normalization of hospital activity was probably premature are you seeing any retrenchment at hospitals in terms of suspending elective surgeries and sort of reversing that early normalization theodore l harris chairman chief executive officer and president thanks for the question mark and the short answer is no we are not yet but as we all can reflect maybe on the news of the last few days it s obviously continues to be a rapidly changing environment relative to the pandemic and the delta variant so while we re not seeing that today we re watching it closely i would say we re pleased with the sterilization business has been slowly returning volumes are up both year over year and sequentially but i would also say it has been a little bit lumpy in that return and it continues to be a bit lumpy i think as we see real demand return with increased selective surgeries but also the replenishment of supply chains that were depleted during the pandemic but again the short answer is no we re not seeing that yet but obviously that could be a possibility going forward so we need to watch that closely mark william connelly stephens analyst switching gears we re hearing from a number of companies that the big wellness push with the surge in vitamin supplements last year has slowed and in some cases reversed how does that affect your expectations for the nutrient part of human health for the rest of the year theodore l harris chairman chief executive officer and president certainly the pandemic and the focus on immunity boosting minerals and vitamins has benefited our nutrients business over the last year or so we have not yet seen a slowdown in demand we are seeing the growth year over year is slower than it was last quarter for example so we re seeing a slowing in the growth year over year partly because we re now comparing to quarters that saw some benefit last year but demand remains very strong and at this point in time we continue to believe that the changing in consumer behavior relative to increased attention to these types of products and supplementation will continue but certainly the year over year growth will wane as we saw in q2 but we re still very pleased with the strong demand for our products mark william connelly stephens analyst i hope you continue to buck that trend and just one last question your market share in choline in the animal market you saw a nice boost this quarter what are the biggest challenges to driving penetration rates and how do you decide how aggressively to go after that on a sort of a year over year basis theodore l harris chairman chief executive officer and president so you know again as you re well aware there are two very different aspects to our choline business for the animal market one certainly is the monogastric market that includes companion animal swine and poultry primarily we have very strong market share in the u s strong market share in europe we really don t have much presence in asia and south america so our business is primarily a north american and european business and our business there tends to grow with the market i would say there is some share to be gained but really i think the opportunity is more around driving increased usage of choline there are alternatives we ve talked about betaine in the past so replacement of betaine which grows the overall choline market that would grow our business using science to show that choline should be fed at higher dose levels than it currently is that also would drive higher demand for us and increased usage for choline so those really are more of the growth drivers in the monogastric and the feed grade choline the companion animal business obviously is growing very quickly with the overall market that is certainly showing up in our results so that s really how we re driving growth there from a penetration perspective choline is very highly penetrated in those markets most companion animal products include choline most poultry swine diets include choline so it s not so much penetrating the market it s very different to our sort of highly engineered encapsulated choline that we sell into the dairy industry where we feel as though in north america choline is only penetrated let s say 40 at this point in time and in europe it s still less than 5 so that s really where we have an opportunity to be very aggressive about driving penetration and it s again a lot by developing new science bringing our old science to customers and convincing nutritionists that there s a significant payback and benefit of feeding choline and we re learning through new studies that choline is important for more than maybe just we originally positioned it as a fatty liver product that addresses fatty liver we ve recently done a study that shows that choline may be very beneficial to heat stress in cows and that really could bring a very different value proposition to choline and therefore help penetration and broaden the use of choline so i think the opportunity to really drive increased penetration and be very aggressive both in europe and the u s for that is really where our focus is and we re doing that through science we re doing it through more nutritionists on our staff more salespeople on the ground boots on the ground matters here and that s where we re focused mark william connelly stephens analyst thank you sir operator our next question is from bob labick with cjs securities please proceed bob labick good morning congratulations on nice quarter and execution i wanted to start on the human nutrition side how would you characterize the food and beverage the flavors and powder sales are they back to pre covid levels yet and what are the growth drivers that you re focused on from here theodore l harris chairman chief executive officer and president so you know our sales in aggregate certainly are back and ahead of pre covid levels we ve been growing nicely if you just look at the food business so you exclude nutrients we were up about 17 in the quarter and that s really as a result i think of just good solid fundamental growth in the markets that we serve i think certainly some of our growth initiatives are coming to fruition there but there s also a bit of a replenishment of the supply chain that is happening there is a return of demand associated with those parts of the market that were depressed because of the pandemic specifically foodservice which i think in aggregate we would say is probably not quite back to pre pandemic levels but getting close we ve certainly seen it come back nicely and also lastly no real decline in the aspects of the business that benefited somewhat from the pandemic so it s really a fairly kind of broad based growth that we re experiencing and certainly our sales levels are higher than our pre pandemic levels but we don t believe all of the foodservice business is fully back and we also don t believe that some of the benefits that we have seen that we expect to slow down a little bit we believe that they re still there and they haven t waned fully yet so we feel good about the growth in the overall business in human nutrition health in the quarter and expect that we can continue to drive nice growth for the rest of the year bob labick ok great and yes i m sticking with the human nutrition and health the margins remain very strong on an adjusted basis as well above prior levels is that a benefit from mix or how are you thinking about the kind of margin profile in h h going forward theodore l harris chairman chief executive officer and president let me start and then martin can add to or correct me but certainly mix is playing a role in the margin performance of the business but we re also seeing if you recall in probably 2019 2018 we talked a fair bit about manufacturing inefficiencies that we were struggling in certain areas from an efficiency perspective in some of our human nutrition health plants and a really our business teams and our supply chain and operations teams have really done a good job of addressing many of those inefficiencies and so as you saw in the prepared remarks we re seeing some favorable manufacturing efficiencies partly driven by higher volumes but also partly driven just by eliminating some of those inefficiencies that we were experiencing so mix for sure is part of it addressing some of those inefficiencies is also a big part of it offset somewhat by the higher raw material costs that while clearly very significantly impacting our animal nutrition business are also impacting human nutrition in a material way so martin i ll pass it back to you with any other color carl martin bengtsson chief financial officer and treasurer no maybe the only thing i would add there is that our human business are the ones that have been best enabled to date to also pass through the raw material increases to their customers so they ve seen less of an impact there so the efficiencies that ted mentioned have therefore been able to shine through and show up in the p l so that s maybe what i would add there mark william connelly stephens analyst and then the last one for me i can jump back in queue on the last call we talked about your pivot marketing spending and how you re reallocating dollars can you give us any examples of what you re doing now i know it s still relatively new if there s any way to quantify the outcomes or if you re happy with the results so far or any update on that initiative theodore l harris chairman chief executive officer and president yes we really are happy i have to say it s still all relatively new so we re not necessarily seeing a lot of fruits from our labor at this point in time but we re really pleased with the team that we ve built we are seeing we had a campaign for example this quarter for within beverages for the use of our branded choline which we call vitacholine as well as our albian minerals we ve also kind of introduced a bit of an indulgent product but in our encapsulates and inclusions business glimmer varigates that are getting some attention that basically are glimmering pieces that you can put into ice cream and treats and things like that that are pretty cool and like i said getting some attention and frozen desserts and so forth so we are excited about the types of things that we can do based on market research that we re doing in house right now as well as the market expertise that we re bringing to our customers and the market so i think there s a lot more to come there because this is all new but early signs are very positive and we continue to be excited just about the new launches that our customers are launching out their products that have our products in them premier nutrition for example just launched a new sku that includes choline and a protein beverage and that really is a leading consumer brand in the protein beverage segment and there are various other launches that we re excited about so i think overall we re really headed in the right direction from a marketing perspective and something that was really missing in the past for us mark william connelly stephens analyst sounds superb thank you very much theodore l harris chairman chief executive officer and president thanks operator our next question is from mitra ramgopal with sidoti company please proceed lalishwar mitra ramgopal sidoti company analyst yes good morning thanks for taking in questions first i just want to get a sense as you look at gross margin clearly seeing some pressure from the as you mentioned higher raw material and distribution costs and i was just curious as we look out to the second half of the year if we should anticipate maybe some improvement off of 2q or it s still too early to get a sense as to how that plays out carl martin bengtsson chief financial officer and treasurer yeah good morning mitra this is martin the i think the when you think about where the pressure is coming from obviously the raw materials is the big one and it s significant we saw almost above 9 million of inflation in the second quarter on like for like items year over year which is a huge number when you think about it and nothing that we ve ever seen in the past and we ve passed through a lot of that not all of it we passed through in terms of pricing call it about 7 million of this we still end up with a couple of million of gross margin pressure when we think about that raw is it going to go away i don t know when it will go away if it will go away and to what extent prices will start coming down it s just hard to tell right now for us it is primarily around chemicals it s around oils it s around some proteins that we buy et cetera where we re seeing just commodity price increases that are that are pretty significant so i think it s going to be a matter of how that curve develops so will it happen in the third quarter fourth quarter will it be in 2022 it s almost impossible to say and in the meanwhile we re really focused on getting the right pricing in the market and recovering our costs around this as ted pointed out before we re not really differentially impacted versus our competition we re all in the same boat here which makes it a little bit easier for us also to go out and recover some of these costs from a production standpoint and an efficiency in our supply chain network our plants have been running well we had the flood event but that s more of a discrete unique event that you can t necessarily control but apart from that our plants have been running very well in the last few quarters and we anticipate that to continue you mentioned the distribution costs which are just like the raws seen significant increases just with all the disruptions and containers being in the wrong places and prices going up et cetera and for us that was when you look at it on a year over year basis call it a 50 60 basis points impact to our profitability from that and you would have to think that supply and demand will balance and prices will come down to more normalized level at some point it s not like suddenly all the containers are gone but they re in the wrong places at the moment and then the system is not working well so i just can t say whether that s going to happen third quarter fourth quarter or 2022 but you would have to think that it will start normalizing at some point so that s a little bit what we re living through at the moment it s managing the raws getting the pricing in the market passing that through and just trying to be efficient on the distribution side while obviously ensuring that our own backyard in terms of how we run our plants is running very efficiently and that s kind of where the attention is at the moment lalishwar mitra ramgopal sidoti company analyst no that s great i definitely appreciate the color there and then on the erp platform i believe that s almost on us in terms of the implementation i was wondering if you re starting to see some efficiencies there or is it a little too early yet carl martin bengtsson chief financial officer and treasurer no we re definitely seeing efficiencies i mean we re call it 98 to 99 done we have two international smaller locations to go in the implementation and that we plan so we plan to be done this year in 2021 on budget as well i should point out because we re pretty proud of that that is not the case in erp implementation but if we take a step back and as i said why do we do this in the first place right for us being on five systems and with acquisitions that grow into seven systems getting that down to 1 just from a business continuity it was very important some of these other systems were closer to the end of life and we re willing to have a modern system in place it was a lot around the controls and the security which we feel very good about at the moment just in terms of that enhanced visibility and controls and also just from a cybersecurity and all the attention around that trying to stay on top of it and managing that situation it s a lot easier for us having one system to manage then than many and then the growth and scalability as we re growing as a business growing on this one platform enable us to actually do that and not be prohibited and lastly from a cost perspective which was not the primary incentive why we did d 365 we re seeing some efficiencies there we re doing a lot more with the resources we have in terms of not needing to add resources as we ve grown here over the last two years and we ve also made some smaller organizational changes in some areas in terms of efficiencies but i would not call that out as the key big driver of trying to take cost out it s more to build a proper platform that supports our growth our controls and just the continuity of the business lalishwar mitra ramgopal sidoti company analyst and then finally i guess a little of time and i assume with this with the erp it probably makes it a little easier to digest new acquisitions and i m just curious if you had any update in terms of activity levels you might be seeing on the acquisition front theodore l harris chairman chief executive officer and president yes i think that activity levels are reasonably high again as i ve said probably in the last few calls as we entered 2020 things really did slow down in the market but also at balchem we were struggling with how do we complete a transaction in a remote environment and i would say we re very much through that and the market is busy and active and we are as well so we continue to feel good about the pipeline of opportunities that we see out there and the specific opportunities that are active so we re spending a fair amount of resources focused on our inorganic growth obviously our primary focus is driving the organic growth of the company but we are spending i would say back to pre pandemic levels amount of resources and time on inorganic opportunities lalishwar mitra ramgopal sidoti company analyst ok that s great thanks for taking in questions theodore l harris chairman chief executive officer and president thanks mitra carl martin bengtsson chief financial officer and treasurer thanks mitra operator our next question is from ram selvaraju raju with h c wainwright please proceed raghuram selvaraju h c wainwright analyst thanks so much for taking my question just a couple of minor housekeeping ones i think these are probably for martin can you just comment on how the accounting treatment is going to look like for whatever insurance recovery you re able to accomplish in the wake of the flash flood event in verona missouri how is that potentially going to show up from a p l perspective and also from a cash flow perspective and can you comment at this time on when you talk about partial recovery what does that mean half 10 approximately carl martin bengtsson chief financial officer and treasurer yes so in terms of recovery i ll answer that first we do expect i can t guarantee it since we haven t gone through it with the insurance company yet but it would be reasonable to expect that we would recover our costs with it exception of the insurance deductible right so there s a 2 million deductible so our costs less the 2 million is what we expect to recover we had about call it 3 8 million of impact in the second quarter we expect another 1 5 million of costs show up in the third quarter so take those two and deduct 2 million that s what we expect to get back from an accounting perspective where you would see it at the moment in the second quarter right is you see it in our cogs almost exclusively in terms of where the negative impact has hit in cost of goods sold the 3 8 million we adjusted it out for adjusted earnings as an adjustment as we go forward and have insurance recoveries our intention is also to adjust out those recoveries so that is an apples for apples right we adjusted out a negative impact now we will adjust out the insurance recoveries as we go forward from a cash flow perspective obviously it will be positive cash flow when we receive the insurance recoveries as we ve had negative cash outlays here in this period but most of this is flowing through cogs at the moment since that s where we re having our expenses i don t know if that answers your question ram or not happy to add any additional raghuram selvaraju h c wainwright analyst no that s no that s very helpful so whatever the impact is going to be both the negative impact and the positive impact the vast majority of it is going to be on the cogs line carl martin bengtsson chief financial officer and treasurer correct correct raghuram selvaraju h c wainwright analyst yes okay and you would anticipate that a there s not going to be any further negative impact after this quarter is over and b that you will get the insurance proceeds before the end of this year is that reasonable carl martin bengtsson chief financial officer and treasurer i would just clarify that in saying we do expect the third quarter to have 1 5 million of negative impact we had 3 8 million in the second quarter we expect another 1 5 million in the third quarter of negative impact when we will get the insurance recoveries i don t want to comment on that because sometimes it moves relatively quickly sometimes it s a longer process i don t know whether we will see any in the third quarter whether it will come in the fourth quarter whether it will come early in 2022 i just don t have that knowledge as to when exactly the process will conclude so it will depend on the process there raghuram selvaraju h c wainwright analyst no that s fair secondly i wanted to ask in a general sense about the medical sterilization business and if you believe that we are now seeing a level of activity in that domain a level of demand in that arena which is commensurate with steady state demand or if you expect there to be further tailwinds going forward given the current status of the pandemic some normalization around that just wanted to get a sense of where you think things stand on that front theodore l harris chairman chief executive officer and president yes so while we ve seen really improvement quarter on quarter for three or four quarters now i would say that we re still not back to steady state and a pre pandemic level and certainly elective surgeries are the driver here and i do think that people while hospitals are allowing elective surgeries and there s room for elective surgeries i do think some people still are choosing to not have an elective surgery just for concern about going to the hospital so the business has improved quarter on quarter we feel good about that but i would not say that it s back to pre pandemic levels and we do think that there is more improvement that we will see in subsequent quarters barring any very significant kind of change in the progress that we ve been making relative to the pandemic and any mandates around elective surgeries that could stall the slow recovery or cause it to regress but as i said earlier we are not seeing that today in our orders or hearing that from our customers we re still seeing that sort of slow steady recovery raghuram selvaraju h c wainwright analyst ok thanks and then just to revert back to martin once more not sure if i missed this what is your guidance regarding effective tax rate percentage for the second half of 2021 carl martin bengtsson chief financial officer and treasurer so we re at about 23 1 year to date and i think around their 23 plus or minus a little bit is the right estimate for 2021 raghuram selvaraju h c wainwright analyst great and thank you very much and congrats on an excellent quarter despite these challenges with the flash flood carl martin bengtsson chief financial officer and treasurer thank you ragh theodore l harris chairman chief executive officer and president thank you ragh operator we have reached the end of our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr harris for closing remarks theodore l harris chairman chief executive officer and president thanks sherry

driving east out of cheyenne a lot of people probably think there s nothing but cornfields and oil wells but if you climb in an atv with rancher alan kirkbride he ll show you a secret world where his ancestors have raised cattle since the late 1800s we climb out on the bank of horse creek where thick willows grow under high white cliffs kirkbride says little creeks like this seep up from groundwater that s essential for growing grass for his herd he says climate change has made disputes over even small water sources like this a rougher sport we talk about people fighting over water that they ve been doing it for 100 years well we see the future is very possibly continual difficulties between different users kirkbride says it s in our future i guess fighting is on kirkbride s mind because one of his neighbors has petitioned to drill eight high capacity water wells that would drain 1 6 billion gallons of water a year out from under this landscape enough to supply a city of 10 000 recent science shows that when you lower the level of the groundwater creeks like this one dry up kirkbride says not only would that threaten his herd he might have to cough up big bucks to drill deeper wells to get to the water table he says it d be one thing if his neighbors intended to use all that water for agriculture the way they say they will oh i think it s an obvious opportunity to do better with the water to sell them to an oil company or even to a municipality in both cases far more lucrative he says four members of the lerwick family are looking to drill the wells and have been trying to obtain permits for over a year now their application says they want to use all this water for crops but they could change that use for other purposes later kirkbride says if the state engineer approves these permits it could cause southeast wyoming to go arid like it has other places that rely on the massive ogallala aquifer the granddaddy of all aquifers in the u s i would like to point out these are some of the oldest surface water rights in the state of wyoming some of the oldest ranches some of the most magnificent places you have ever seen that stand to be lost it makes me almost cry because i ve seen them and i ve been on them and i know what will be lost reba epler look what s happened on the south plains from southwest texas all the way up it s been the same story the water table goes down creeks go dry kirkbride says so taking a hint from the south and central plains why obviously it s gonna happen here that wouldn t be good for anyone not for ranchers who need water for their stock not for the rest of us who need it to drink but oil companies and the city of cheyenne are both very thirsty and the temptation to sell the water to them would be fierce growing corn or barley isn t likely to make the lerwicks much money but selling the water to a city or to the minerals industry would definitely make them a pretty penny the lerwicks though insist they just want to farm in a courtroom in the basement of the capitol in cheyenne their lawyer wiliam hiser argues there s no reason they shouldn t get these wells we believe that there is no question that there is water available for our appropriation in this aquifer and i think the empirical evidence will show that that s available because the water is available hiser argues wyoming water law says it can be used as long as it benefits wyoming people but when ty lerwick one of the four family members in the case is pressed in court on whether he would transfer the use of the water from irrigation to oil and gas development he says possibly but not likely that word possibly is terrifying to some of their neighbors like attorney reba epler who represents the lerwick s neighbors who are fighting the permits she grew up on a ranch in the area herself her opening statement in the basement of the capitol makes it clear what s at stake i would like to point out these are some of the oldest surface water rights in the state of wyoming some of the oldest ranches some of the most magnificent places you have ever seen that stand to be lost it makes me almost cry because i ve seen them and i ve been on them and i know what will be lost says epler she says wyoming water law may need to be updated as droughts worsen and water just becomes more and more valuable epler says it should be treated like surface water and no one should be allowed to divert it if it would injure another water user one of the most fundamental things you must remember in water law is that you cannot harm another appropriator in surface water you can t move your diversion to another location if you re going to harm somebody and in groundwater i would assert that the same rule applies if the lerwicks succeed in drilling these wells and give it to oil and gas companies it could benefit some ranchers in the area colt breugmann is one of them he sits out on his porch under a big cottonwood on his ranch my brother and i have about 9 000 acres of minerals that are unleased in laramie county and the greatest wells that have ever been drilled in the united states are right across the fence from us he says but those wells in that play can t be produced because there s not enough fresh water up there right now and so it happens to be near the lerwicks so if i was to keep my mouth shut which is probably what i should have done then if that water was used it would benefit me but it still doesn t mean it s right melodie edwards wyoming public radio you read that right breugmann is adamantly opposed to the idea of using freshwater for fracking but he s afraid that a few years after the lerwicks get these wells that s exactly what will happen groundwater needs to be left alone in the state of wyoming he says it needs to be off limits and i m coming to you as an oilfield insider i want the aquifer to be left alone for my children and my grandchildren it can only be replenished by god instead breugmann says wyoming lawmakers should require oil and gas companies to only use recycled water fracking water that s been cleaned up he says in recent years that technology has grown by leaps and bounds we produce enough water in the state of wyoming from drilling practices to frack every single well with that produced water and that produced water can be cleaned breugmann says it s only a matter of time before water becomes way more valuable than oil the state engineer s office is currently reviewing the case and is expected to release its decision in the coming weeks
like many new pandemic pet owners nia morgan knew her puppy zorro had grown very attached to her due to all the time she spent at home with him so she was understandably hesitant about leaving him for the first time with a sitter she d hired through rover a popular platform for booking dog and cat sitters morgan took what she thought were adequate steps to ensure her timid then 9 month old poodle mix would be in good hands during an upcoming trip she interviewed a rover sitter and did a trial run dropping zorro and a friend s dog off together with the sitter for the day zorro s temperament was good said morgan after picking up her dog which made her feel comfortable enough to book the same sitter for a five day trip one day after she left the sitter said her phone had broken and she was using her computer to send updates through the platform morgan said she wasn t sent photos of zorro something that is typically common for sitters to do but she had been satisfied with the in depth messages the sitter was providing the evening before morgan was set to return home to chicago the sitter messaged her that zorro got loose while she was at her boyfriend s house more than an hour away from her home according to correspondence viewed by cnn business morgan would soon discover through a post from the local animal control s facebook page that zorro had gone missing at the beginning of the stay according to a police report the local animal control received two calls reporting a loose dog on the first day of zorro s stay one came from a man who claimed his girlfriend s dog had gotten loose describing a dog similar to zorro the sitter waited four days to notify morgan all while providing false updates according to correspondence viewed by cnn business four months later morgan is still searching for zorro mostly she feels with little support from rover which initially included amber alert robocalls flyers and a 100 contribution toward a reward for finding zorro we feel terribly that some pet parents believe we ve fallen short of our obligation to them said rover spokesperson dave rosenbaum in a statement for this story we ll continue to work hard to live up to our community s expectations more than 2 million pet parents have turned to rover s network of trusted sitters and dog walkers to book services including boarding house sitting and day care according to the company now it is set to ride a wave of pandemic pet demand to a wall street debut but as with other sharing economy platforms which largely rely on independent contractors with limited amounts of vetting there can be a dark side cnn business spoke with six pet owners who said their dogs have gone missing or died while in the care of a sitter they found on rover s platform since the start of the pandemic all of them said they turned to the platform because it was a recognizable name in the industry and they felt more comfortable after reading positive reviews of their respective sitters on the site one pet owner said her sitter remained on the platform for months after her dogs were lost while in the sitter s care rover declined to comment on this claim another owner whose dog was found dead with no explanation said the sitter whose care he was in remains live on the platform rover said it is reviewing this matter it s unclear how many owners have experienced such incidents rosenbaum told cnn business the company tracks these incidents but does not currently disclose numbers however there have been stories over the years of dogs who were lost abused or found dead while in the care of rover sitters often reported on by local news outlets cnn business has not independently confirmed these accounts others don t make it to the press at all in some cases potentially due to the company s efforts to tie some payouts to non disclosure agreements which can effectively silence people from going public with their stories additionally when signing up to use rover customers agree to bring any claims against the company to individual arbitration a process that keeps issues out of court and prevents people from banding together to pursue combined cases such as a class action lawsuit unless they explicitly opt out of the agreement with a written notice as a team motivated by a shared love of pets we re committed to helping people access quality pet care so it weighs heavily on our hearts if someone has a negative experience rosenbaum said in a statement to cnn business over 40 million services have been booked through the platform with 97 of reviewed stays receiving 5 stars but even one negative experience is too many we work every day to improve the platform so that every experience on rover is a positive one rosenbaum told cnn business that it raised its standard reward for a lost dog from 100 to 500 in early july to address the effects of rising pandemic puppy adoptions and pent up travel demand at times rover increases the amount or applies other resources if we believe doing so could materially increase the likelihood of quickly reuniting a pet with their family he said that change came late for owners like morgan and elizabeth snell whose terrier mix tony went missing in greenville south carolina on july 4 after cnn business asked whether rover would offer the 500 amount to pet owners whose dogs are still missing and specifically mentioned morgan s zorro the company offered morgan the 500 amount snell said she was offered the larger contribution after her story was featured on local news this update would have been proactively communicated to the pet parent irrespective of press coverage rosenbaum said pandemic dog sitting boom founded in seattle in 2011 rover is part of a cohort of startups that emerged over the last decade uber and lyft chief among them that created marketplaces to connect individuals in need of a particular service with individuals who can provide such a service on a gig by gig basis the company dominated the sharing economy pet market even as it faced competition from wag a rival startup that raised an eye popping 300 million only to stumble as cnn business previously reported wag s leadership had struggled to handle fundamental issues facing its business including growth customer service and the safety of pets rover weathered the pandemic and arguably emerged stronger this year thanks to all the people who added canines to their homes and then needed pet walking and sitting services as the country reopened rover has increasingly eaten away at wag s market share holding 95 of the u s share of sales compared to wag s 5 in june 2021 according to data from bloomberg second measure now rover expects to begin trading on the nasdaq next month through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company which will value the combined company at 1 63 billion and help it continue to expand but amid the boom in business there have also been new reports of missing or killed dogs while in the care of a rover sitter in an sec filing from nebula caravel the company rover is merging with to go public one of its risk factors is an acknowledgment that rover cannot guarantee the safety of pets pet care providers pet parents and third parties like other on demand companies rover requires pet sitters to pass at least a basic background check which references a sex offender registry terrorist watchlist and the national criminal database which has its own limitations including the fact not all records are digitized rover says that sitter profiles are reviewed and approved by the company applicants also take a basic six question safety quiz according to rover s site sitters who apply for rover will receive approval or be notified that information provided is incomplete within 24 48 hours but some customers question the thoroughness of the background checks annette leturia dropped off her two dogs 2 year old togo and nearly 4 year old liam with a rover sitter in houston texas in late june for what was supposed to be a week long vacation only to return early after the sitter told her togo was found dead on the bathroom floor afterward leturia said she had an independent background check done on the sitter which turned up troubling charges for grand theft and fraud she said she still has no closure on what happened to togo in the meantime based on screenshots viewed by cnn business the sitter appears to be pet sitting on the platform when asked about this rosenbaum said we have asked our team to review the specifics of this incident and take further action if appropriate morgan zorro s owner also said she discovered her sitter had past criminal charges rosenbaum pointed out that cases can change between an initial charge and a final ruling in the interest of accuracy and fairness we must make decisions based on what is legally available to our background check provider and reported to us he said rover said sitters can choose to apply for a standard 25 or an enhanced 35 background check and pet owners can choose to only hire providers with enhanced checks the company also said it promotes meet and greets with sitters as well as meeting with multiple potential sitters prior to booking there is otherwise minimal vetting training or oversight because workers are treated by the company as independent contractors rather than employees a classification that could be jeopardized if the company asserted more control over sitters this factor is a standard complaint about the business model that worries some whether you re talking about ride share or grocery delivery there are lots of complaints about poor service because these platforms have decided to go down this route of using independent contractors they actually can t really train people to do a good job or to screen people maybe the way you d really want them to do it said miriam cherry a law professor at saint louis university school of law who has studied corporate social responsibility and the gig economy it is not a good model if you really care about wanting absolute good quality knowing you re covered if something goes wrong with a pet she added if

clontarf at least 14 indigenous students who attended the st paul diocese industrial school of clontarf in the late 1800s are buried in two plots in the st malachy cemetery in clontarf minnesota a review of an incomplete list of school documents suggests there were more than 14 student deaths at the school a memorial erected during the town s 1978 centennial describes the people buried there as sioux and chippewa indian youths who died while attending the clontarf industrial school between 1878 and 1898 the school located in clontarf from 1877 to 1898 taught a mix of indigenous students from various tribes through a contract with the federal government and also white orphans from minnesota according to swift county death records all those listed on the memorial died between 1883 and 1893 mostly from tuberculosis commonly referred to as consumption at the time those named on the memorial have dakota as their birthplace on county death records their ages range from 9 to 22 and are all males advertisement a memorial for 14 students that died at the st paul industrial boarding school of clontarf mark wasson west central tribune an incomplete list of quarterly reports from the school which are part of a collection of documents maintained at the university of minnesota morris lists at least 18 deaths at the school a march 1886 quarterly report lists isreal langer 10 of the chippewa tribe and nicholas lanninyan nayi 14 of the sioux tribe as having died that quarter they are not listed on the memorial a june 1889 quarterly reports lists seven deaths that quarter but only benedict ahami 18 whose tribe is listed as sioux is on the memorial the names of the other students who died at the school that quarter are currently unknown a 1978 swift county monitor article states the students listed on the memorial died during epidemics at the school the article also mentions that the school had 108 indigenous children in 1886 from the standing rock reservation devil s lake now spirit lake reservation pembina mountain and turtle mountain reservations and the white earth reservation the dates of death for those listed on the memorial do not match up with the incomplete quarterly reports the west central tribune reviewed suggesting more than 18 students died during the more than 20 years the school was open advertisement quarterly reports for the st paul industrial boarding school in clontarf the archdiocese of st paul and minneapolis has a collection of documents from the school but they are not digitized and the west central tribune has not been allowed to view them the archdiocese did not respond to a request for comment about student deaths or the church running of the school clontarf city officials also declined to comment the rev gary mills director of the swift county historical society and museum said he would guess the town erected the memorial in 1978 to document history but he isn t completely sure of the reason and historical records are unclear mills who grew up around benson a town about six miles south of clontarf and served as a lutheran minister for more than 35 years in new york said it s necessary to find out what exactly happened at boarding schools where indigenous people were sent we whitewash history and i think it s necessary to find out what happened because these are wrongs that somehow at least need to be stated mills who has a doctorate in theology from the university of chicago said people want to right the wrong and that s one issue but at least we need to recognize and publicly state what the wrong is so people know the truth of the history mills said he supports working with indigenous groups in the search for the truth advertisement i think it s absolutely necessary and i think we need to be supporting more of that he said that search for the truth can be labor intensive documents related to where these indigenous youth went and what happened to them aren t often held by the tribes themselves and can be scattered throughout various governmental and private institutions there s that barrier to access which is a barrier to truth finding which is a barrier to truth telling and the reconciliation process jaime arsenault archives manager and tribal historic preservation officer for the white earth reservation in northern minnesota said i think that before we get to this period of reconciliation and before we get to that period of truth telling that there is this stage of truth finding and it has to be done in a way that is led by native nations so that indigenous communities aren t further exploited but rather retain their autonomy and self determination to make these choices for themselves arsenault who is also the designated repatriation representative for the white earth band said she is in the process of working with various colleges in minnesota to access archival records to find out more about these schools and the impact they had on indigenous people the sisters of the order of saint benedict in st joseph minnesota have been particularly helpful and committed to seeing this process through according to arsenault a lot of tribal nations have been aware of the impact of residential schools and that includes the cemeteries they ve long known those stories that are hard to hear she said but people outside the tribal nations don t necessarily have that same knowledge this history is not taught in the school systems now we re getting to this place where many people are starting to hear these stories for the first time some institutions are beginning to seek out ways they can support truth telling and reconciliation efforts and that s good my hope is that we can collectively keep this momentum going because this is heavy work and it will take time considerable to do it well the town also has a plaque next to their post office calling contract schools like the one in clontarf a nationwide program to erase american indian culture a plaque in clontarf which describes the forced assimilation through education the st paul diocese industrial school in clontarf took part in mark wasson west central tribune advertisement the department of the interior announced earlier this year that the department will conduct a comprehensive review of federal boarding schools the school in clontarf was operated by the federal government between 1897 and 1898 the interior department will address the inter generational impact of indian boarding schools to shed light on the unspoken traumas of the past no matter how hard it will be secretary haaland said at the national congress of american indians 2021 mid year conference in june i know that this process will be long and difficult i know that this process will be painful it won t undo the heartbreak and loss we feel but only by acknowledging the past can we work toward a future that we re all proud to embrace the department did not respond to a request for comment about whether the clontarf school will be part of that review besides the white earth reservation no other tribes the west central tribune contacted responded to a request for comment a november 1902 article in the saint paul globe about the school s superintendent and st malachy pastor father anatole oster mentions he visited the sisseton tribe and other sioux camps for the purpose of securing boys for the school during his time at the school oster was later appointed as the vicar general of the st paul diocese there are multiple news reports at the time of indigenous pupils running away from the school they were just trying to get away and get back to where they felt they belonged instead of being thrust into a school that their parents never wanted them to go local clontarf historian anne schirmer said schirmer who grew up in clontarf township said that while the school tried to do the right thing as far as educating orphaned children and teaching them a trade taking indigenous youth from the reservations was not the right thing to do advertisement 1888 list of escaped students from the st paul industrial boarding school in clontarf by west central tribune on scribd what was the clontarf industrial school the school founded in 1874 as the catholic industrial school just outside of st paul was moved to clontarf in 1877 as part of bishop john ireland s desire to teach the children of white colonists in his western minnesota catholic colonies according to the 1956 paper catholic boarding schools on the western front by james p shannon the school was located about a mile northwest of the 1978 memorial in a place that is now private property according to shannon not enough colonists children attended the school so in 1884 ireland secured a contract with the u s government to teach and board indigenous children for 100 per child the school had an average enrollment of 130 children a year the students that attended were a mix of white minnesotan orphans and indigenous boys they were taught basic schooling carpentry blacksmithing and farming the school would later receive 150 per student according to a february 1889 article from the new ulm review orphans sent to st paul industrial boarding school in clontarf published in the saint paul globe sept 17 1885 in 1892 congress cut funding for residential schools outside of reservations and the school once again faced financial difficulties advertisement the school was sold to the u s government by bishop ireland in march 1897 for 10 300 according to an 1899 document created by the u s secretary of the interior a letter to the commissioner of indian affairs from indian affairs supervisor wm m moss recommended the government not purchase the school calling the school s inventory closer to a large stock or dairy farm than a school in fact there is nothing suggestive of an indian school to my mind but the main school building and that only on the outside the inside being especially repulsive in detail he wrote the school was operated for a short time as a non reservation school by the federal government and later consolidated in june 30 1898 with an indigenous industrial school for girls in morris the distance between the two locations is about 19 miles so they were both likely drawing students from the same region

as well as information from health officials and local authorities to determine the appropriate scope of operations and allocation of resources necessary to navigate this dynamic and unprecedented environment supply chain the company maintains a network of strategic sourcing partners which includes material vendors and third party manufacturers the company is actively experiencing disruption and delays within its sourcing network related to covid 19 outbreaks in various countries the company is also experiencing capacity constraints and cost pressures related to container shortages and port congestion that are causing shipping delays and may lead to higher usage of air freight in future periods the full effect of disruptions and delays are not yet known but the company will continue to monitor the situation closely and is actively working to mitigate these pressures where possible the company s distribution center in moreno valley california as well as other third party distribution facilities that the company leverages to service its operations are currently in operation and supporting ongoing logistics however these facilities have been operating and may continue to operate at limited capacity due to the enhanced health and safety measures that are in place the company anticipates operational challenges related to capacity constraints as well as increased costs associated with warehouse employee safety and payroll expense the company s third party logistics providers are also experiencing capacity constraints which are having an adverse effect on our operations retail stores approximately 66 of the company s global stores were open for the entire first quarter which compares to approximately 20 in the prior year first quarter given the ongoing and uncertain pandemic conditions which include meaningful local and regional differences in expert agency guidance and local authority mandates the company anticipates that temporary retail store closures and operating limitations in certain geographies may continue for at least a portion of the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 and potentially beyond non gaap financial measures in certain instances the company may present non gaap financial measures including constant currency to provide information that may assist investors in understanding its financial results and assessing its prospects for future performance the company believes these non gaap financial measures are important indicators of its operating performance because they exclude items that are unrelated to and may not be indicative of its core operating results the non gaap financial measures presented by the company may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for comparing the performance of other companies relative to deckers for example in order to calculate constant currency information the company calculates the current period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate hedges and remeasurements in the condensed consolidated financial statements further the company reports comparable dtc sales on a constant currency basis for dtc operations that were open throughout the current and prior reporting periods and may adjust prior reporting periods to conform to current year accounting policies these non gaap financial measures are not intended to represent and should not be considered to be more meaningful measures than or alternatives to measures of operating performance as determined in accordance with gaap to the extent the company utilizes such non gaap financial measures in the future it expects to calculate them using a consistent method from period to period about deckers brands

like many new pandemic pet owners nia morgan knew her puppy zorro had grown very attached to her due to all the time she spent at home with him so she was understandably hesitant about leaving him for the first time with a sitter she d hired through rover a popular platform for booking dog and cat sitters morgan took what she thought were adequate steps to ensure her timid then 9 month old poodle mix would be in good hands during an upcoming trip she interviewed a rover sitter and did a trial run dropping zorro and a friend s dog off together with the sitter for the day zorro s temperament was good said morgan after picking up her dog which made her feel comfortable enough to book the same sitter for a five day trip one day after she left the sitter said her phone had broken and she was using her computer to send updates through the platform morgan said she wasn t sent photos of zorro something that is typically common for sitters to do but she had been satisfied with the in depth messages the sitter was providing the evening before morgan was set to return home to chicago the sitter messaged her that zorro got loose while she was at her boyfriend s house more than an hour away from her home according to correspondence viewed by cnn business morgan would soon discover through a post from the local animal control s facebook page that zorro had gone missing at the beginning of the stay according to a police report the local animal control received two calls reporting a loose dog on the first day of zorro s stay one came from a man who claimed his girlfriend s dog had gotten loose describing a dog similar to zorro the sitter waited four days to notify morgan all while providing false updates according to correspondence viewed by cnn business four months later morgan is still searching for zorro mostly she feels with little support from rover which initially included amber alert robocalls flyers and a 100 contribution toward a reward for finding zorro we feel terribly that some pet parents believe we ve fallen short of our obligation to them said rover spokesperson dave rosenbaum in a statement for this story we ll continue to work hard to live up to our community s expectations more than 2 million pet parents have turned to rover s network of trusted sitters and dog walkers to book services including boarding house sitting and day care according to the company now it is set to ride a wave of pandemic pet demand to a wall street debut but as with other sharing economy platforms which largely rely on independent contractors with limited amounts of vetting there can be a dark side cnn business spoke with six pet owners who said their dogs have gone missing or died while in the care of a sitter they found on rover s platform since the start of the pandemic all of them said they turned to the platform because it was a recognizable name in the industry and they felt more comfortable after reading positive reviews of their respective sitters on the site one pet owner said her sitter remained on the platform for months after her dogs were lost while in the sitter s care rover declined to comment on this claim another owner whose dog was found dead with no explanation said the sitter whose care he was in remains live on the platform rover said it is reviewing this matter it s unclear how many owners have experienced such incidents rosenbaum told cnn business the company tracks these incidents but does not currently disclose numbers however there have been stories over the years of dogs who were lost abused or found dead while in the care of rover sitters often reported on by local news outlets cnn business has not independently confirmed these accounts others don t make it to the press at all in some cases potentially due to the company s efforts to tie some payouts to non disclosure agreements which can effectively silence people from going public with their stories additionally when signing up to use rover customers agree to bring any claims against the company to individual arbitration a process that keeps issues out of court and prevents people from banding together to pursue combined cases such as a class action lawsuit unless they explicitly opt out of the agreement with a written notice as a team motivated by a shared love of pets we re committed to helping people access quality pet care so it weighs heavily on our hearts if someone has a negative experience rosenbaum said in a statement to cnn business over 40 million services have been booked through the platform with 97 of reviewed stays receiving 5 stars but even one negative experience is too many we work every day to improve the platform so that every experience on rover is a positive one rosenbaum told cnn business that it raised its standard reward for a lost dog from 100 to 500 in early july to address the effects of rising pandemic puppy adoptions and pent up travel demand at times rover increases the amount or applies other resources if we believe doing so could materially increase the likelihood of quickly reuniting a pet with their family he said that change came late for owners like morgan and elizabeth snell whose terrier mix tony went missing in greenville south carolina on july 4 after cnn business asked whether rover would offer the 500 amount to pet owners whose dogs are still missing and specifically mentioned morgan s zorro the company offered morgan the 500 amount snell said she was offered the larger contribution after her story was featured on local news this update would have been proactively communicated to the pet parent irrespective of press coverage rosenbaum said pandemic dog sitting boom founded in seattle in 2011 rover is part of a cohort of startups that emerged over the last decade uber and lyft chief among them that created marketplaces to connect individuals in need of a particular service with individuals who can provide such a service on a gig by gig basis the company dominated the sharing economy pet market even as it faced competition from wag a rival startup that raised an eye popping 300 million only to stumble as cnn business previously reported wag s leadership had struggled to handle fundamental issues facing its business including growth customer service and the safety of pets rover weathered the pandemic and arguably emerged stronger this year thanks to all the people who added canines to their homes and then needed pet walking and sitting services as the country reopened rover has increasingly eaten away at wag s market share holding 95 of the u s share of sales compared to wag s 5 in june 2021 according to data from bloomberg second measure now rover expects to begin trading on the nasdaq next month through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company which will value the combined company at 1 63 billion and help it continue to expand but amid the boom in business there have also been new reports of missing or killed dogs while in the care of a rover sitter in an sec filing from nebula caravel the company rover is merging with to go public one of its risk factors is an acknowledgment that rover cannot guarantee the safety of pets pet care providers pet parents and third parties like other on demand companies rover requires pet sitters to pass at least a basic background check which references a sex offender registry terrorist watchlist and the national criminal database which has its own limitations including the fact not all records are digitized rover says that sitter profiles are reviewed and approved by the company applicants also take a basic six question safety quiz according to rover s site sitters who apply for rover will receive approval or be notified that information provided is incomplete within 24 48 hours but some customers question the thoroughness of the background checks annette leturia dropped off her two dogs 2 year old togo and nearly 4 year old liam with a rover sitter in houston texas in late june for what was supposed to be a week long vacation only to return early after the sitter told her togo was found dead on the bathroom floor afterward leturia said she had an independent background check done on the sitter which turned up troubling charges for grand theft and fraud she said she still has no closure on what happened to togo in the meantime based on screenshots viewed by cnn business the sitter appears to be pet sitting on the platform when asked about this rosenbaum said we have asked our team to review the specifics of this incident and take further action if appropriate morgan zorro s owner also said she discovered her sitter had past criminal charges rosenbaum pointed out that cases can change between an initial charge and a final ruling in the interest of accuracy and fairness we must make decisions based on what is legally available to our background check provider and reported to us he said rover said sitters can choose to apply for a standard 25 or an enhanced 35 background check and pet owners can choose to only hire providers with enhanced checks the company also said it promotes meet and greets with sitters as well as meeting with multiple potential sitters prior to booking there is otherwise minimal vetting training or oversight because workers are treated by the company as independent contractors rather than employees a classification that could be jeopardized if the company asserted more control over sitters this factor is a standard complaint about the business model that worries some whether you re talking about ride share or grocery delivery there are lots of complaints about poor service because these platforms have decided to go down this route of using independent contractors they actually can t really train people to do a good job or to screen people maybe the way you d really want them to do it said miriam cherry a law professor at saint louis university school of law who has studied corporate social responsibility and the gig economy it is not a good model if you really care about wanting absolute good quality knowing you re covered if something goes wrong with a pet she added if

successful production of rare earth carbonate from u s sourced natural monazite sand at our white mesa mill we are also very excited about our recently announced strategic alliance with radtran which has the potential to help produce isotopes from our existing re carbonate and uranium process streams for use in cancer therapeutics that can improve human health and ultimately save lives these two initiatives which are complementary to our core uranium business are examples of the unique and valuable capabilities of the white mesa mill we also announced the sale of several non core conventional uranium assets to international consolidated uranium these are licensed uranium assets with excellent production track records but we don t think markets value these assets appropriately within our portfolio with this accretive disposition we hope to unlock value in these excellent assets for our shareholders the outlook for uranium also continues to improve vanadium markets are strengthening

the proposed u s uranium reserve once it is established by the u s government but what i find most exciting about all this is that not only do we have excellent optionality and exposure to improved uranium markets we are also leveraging our existing uranium assets to give the company and our shareholders exposure to vanadium rees and potentially medical isotope markets all as complements to our

deliveries in 2021 on july 7 2021 the company and neo performance materials inc neo jointly announced that the first container approximately 20 tonnes of product of an expected first run of 15 containers of re carbonate was successfully produced by energy fuels at the mill and is en route to neo s silmet rare earth separations facility in estonia creating a new united states to europe rare earth supply chain monazite sand is widely recognized as one of the most valuable rare earth minerals in the world due to its superior distributions of magnetic rees needed for various clean energy defense and other advanced technologies natural monazite sand is currently recovered as a low cost byproduct of heavy mineral sand hms operations in the u s and elsewhere in the world the historic challenge with monazite is that it contains higher concentrations of natural uranium thorium and other radionuclides relative to other minerals thereby requiring specific licenses and specialized technical capabilities to handle and process energy fuels currently holds the required licenses and we have developed the ability to unlock the value of this domestic resource over the past 20 years of recycling numerous feeds for the recovery of uranium energy fuels commercial scale production of re carbonate from u s mined natural monazite sand positions energy fuels as the only company in north america currently producing a monazite derived enhanced rare earth material the company and neo also announced the signing of a definitive supply agreement under which energy fuels will ship all or a portion of its re carbonate to neo s silmet facility for processing into separated rare earth materials used in rare earth permanent magnets and other rare earth based advanced materials we believe energy fuels is well on its way to creating a new low cost fully integrated u s rare earth supply chain that meets the highest global standards for environmental protection sustainability and human rights that allows for source validation and tracking from mining through final end use applications for manufacturers in north america europe japan and other nations we are currently scoping the potential to produce separated ree oxides using proven solvent extraction sx technology that we have utilized for the recovery of uranium and vanadium over the past 40 years we are also evaluating moving farther down the ree supply chain to produce certain rare earth metals alloys and other products sale of non core conventional assets to international consolidated uranium inc on july 15 2021 the company and international consolidated uranium inc cur jointly announced the signing of a definitive asset purchase agreement under which cur will acquire a portfolio of energy fuels non core conventional uranium projects located in utah and colorado including the daneros mine the tony m mine the rim mine the sage plain project and several u s department of energy leases in addition at closing the company and cur will enter into toll milling and operating agreements with respect to the properties the consideration payable by cur to energy fuels includes us 2 million cash payable at closing such number of shares that results in energy fuels holding 19 9 of the outstanding cur common shares immediately after closing cdn 6 million of deferred cash payable over time and up to cdn 5 million of deferred cash payable on the commencement of commercial production at the properties through this accretive disposition energy fuels believes the value of these high quality permitted and past producing mines can be unlocked for company shareholders while also cutting standby costs earning management fees and potentially realizing toll milling fees in the future based on the current cur share price exchange rates and assuming the closing and full performance of the agreement the proforma value of this divestment is approximately us 24 million collaboration with radtran llc on recovering medical isotopes for advanced cancer therapies on july 28 2021 the company announced the execution of a strategic alliance agreement with radtran llc a technology development company focused on closing critical gaps in the procurement of medical isotopes for emerging targeted alpha therapy tat cancer therapeutics and other applications under this strategic alliance the company will evaluate the feasibility of recovering th 232 and potentially ra 226 from its existing uranium and re carbonate process streams at the mill and together with radtran evaluate the feasibility of recovering ra 228 from the th 232 and th 228 from the ra 228 at the mill using radtran technologies the recovered ra 228 th 228 and potentially ra 226 would then be sold to pharmaceutical companies and others to produce pb 212 ac 225 bi 213 ra 224 and ra 223 which are the leading medically attractive tat isotopes for the treatment of cancer existing supplies of these isotopes for tat applications are in short supply and methods of production are costly and currently cannot be scaled to meet the demand as new drugs are developed and approved this is a major roadblock in the research and development of new tat drugs as pharmaceutical companies wait for scalable and affordable production technologies to become available under this exciting initiative the company has the potential to recycle valuable isotopes from its existing process streams that would otherwise be lost to disposal for use in the treatment of cancer market conditions the outlook for uranium continues to improve as demand continues to outpace supplies and uranium juniors and financial intermediaries enter the market to purchase uranium and build inventories the weekly spot price for uranium has increased 4 from 31 25 to 32 50 per pound during the quarter and 7 from 30 40 to 32 50 during the first six months of 2021 the spot price of uranium is currently at 32 50 per pound as of july 23 2021 energy fuels holds 691 000 pounds of u s origin uranium in inventory that we recently produced at our own facilities in the u s through our low cost alternate feed material production which is among the lowest cost uranium production in the world today vanadium markets are also strengthening an improving global economy coupled with political unrest in south africa and other factors has caused vanadium prices to rise 83 this year from 5 40 per pound as of december 25 2020 to 8 75 per pound as of june 25 2021 to 9 88 per pound as of july 30 2021 vanadium is a valuable clean energy metal historically used in steel master alloys and chemicals it is also seeing considerable interest in emerging grid scale battery technologies used to store renewable energy energy fuels also holds about 1 7 million pounds of finished high purity vanadium pentoxide in inventory plus 1 5 to 3 0 million pounds of solubilized vanadium inventory in the mill s tailings solutions that we can recover relatively quickly we also hold large quantities of high grade vanadium resources at our standby mines where we recently developed new mining techniques that we believe can increase production and lower costs when mining resumes in the future the mill was the largest u s vanadium producer as recently as 2019 finally ree prices continue to be strong with the price of ndpr increasing 48 year to date from 78 50 kg on january 4 2021 to 116 00 kg on july 30 2021 and 118 from 53 3 kg on july 27 2020 to date the company s sales price for its re carbonate is currently based on the prices of ree oxides with the price of ndpr being the primary driver of the company s re carbonate sales price at this time operations update and outlook for period ending june 30 2021 overview although the outlook for uranium continues to improve uranium prices have not risen enough to date to justify uranium production at the company s mines and isr facilities at this time as a result uranium recovery is expected to be maintained at reduced levels at current uranium price levels until such time when market conditions improve sufficiently or the u s government buys uranium from the company following the establishment of the proposed u s uranium reserve the company will continue to seek new sources of revenue including through its emerging ree business as well as new sources of alternate feed materials and new fee processing opportunities at the mill that can be processed under existing market conditions i e without reliance on current uranium sales prices the company is also seeking new sources of natural monazite sands for its emerging rare earth business and continues its support of u s governmental activities to assist the u s uranium mining industry including the proposed establishment of a u s uranium reserve extraction and recovery activities overview during the six months ended june 30 2021 the company did not recover significant quantities of u 3 o 8 and expects to package insignificant quantities of u 3 o 8 for the remainder of 2021 focusing instead on ramping up and optimizing its re carbonate production this is a reduction from previous guidance of 30 000 to 60 000 pounds of uranium production in 2021 all uranium recovered during 2021 at the mill is expected to be retained in circuit at the mill and not to be packaged in 2021 the company does not plan to extract and or recover any amounts of uranium of any significance from its nichols ranch project in 2021 which was placed on standby in the second quarter of 2020 due to the depletion of its existing wellfields in addition the company expects to keep the alta mesa project and its conventional mining properties on standby during 2021 the company expects to recover approximately 700 to 1 100 tonnes of re carbonate at the mill in 2021 containing approximately 350 to 550 tonnes of total rare earth oxides treo subject to receipt of sufficient quantities of monazite this is a reduction from previous guidance of 2 000 to 3 000 tons 1 814 to 2 721 tonnes of re carbonate containing approximately 1 000 to 1 600 tons 907 to 1 451 tonnes of treo in 2021 due to what the company expects to be a short term delay in supply of monazite sands to the mill under the company s existing supply agreement the company expects to produce no vanadium during the 2021 year the company has strategically opted not to enter into any uranium sales commitments for 2021 therefore subject to the proposed establishment of a u s uranium reserve and general market conditions existing inventories are expected to remain unchanged at approximately 691 000 pounds of u 3 o 8 at year end all v 2 o 5 inventory is expected to be sold on the spot market if prices rise sufficiently above current levels but otherwise maintained in inventory the company expects to sell all or a portion of its re carbonate to neo performance materials or other global separation facilities and or to stockpile it for future separation at the mill or elsewhere about energy fuels energy fuels is a leading u s based uranium mining company supplying u 3 o 8 to major nuclear utilities the company also produces vanadium from certain of its projects as market conditions warrant and is ramping up to commercial scale production of re carbonate in 2021 its corporate offices are in lakewood colorado near denver and all of its assets and employees are in the united states energy fuels holds three of america s key uranium production centers the white mesa mill in utah the nichols ranch isr project in wyoming and the alta mesa isr project in texas the white mesa mill is the only conventional uranium mill operating in the u s today has a licensed capacity of over 8 million pounds of u 3 o 8 per year and has the ability to produce vanadium when market conditions warrant as well as re carbonate from various uranium bearing ores the nichols ranch isr project is currently on standby and has a licensed capacity of 2 million pounds of u 3 o 8 per year the alta mesa isr project is also currently on standby in addition to the above production facilities energy fuels also has one of the largest ni 43 101 compliant uranium

stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 daniel racine president chief executive officer thank you operator thank you all for joining us and welcome to our second quarter 2021 conference call and webcast presenting with me today is jason leblanc our chief financial officer yohann bouchard chief operating officer and henry marsden senior vp exploration will be available to answer questions i will start as always with health and safety our total recordable injury rate was 0 58 for the first six months of 2021 earlier this year we introduced our climate action strategy continue to advance the strategy during the quarter with work ongoing to determine baselines and gather data to develop abatement scenarios the strategy is one pillar of our approach to esg health and safety environmental management governance and community engagement are all deeply rooted within our organization we re proud to have been named one of canada s best 50 canadian corporate citizen by corporate knights yamana ranked 31st overall and was the top ranked canadian mining company the best 50 ranking are based on a series of criterias including eight environmental metrics five social metrics six governance metrics and three economic factors to learn more about our esg performance i invite you to look at our latest material issue report and global reporting initiative report both are available on our website turning now to our quarter two operational highlights we had a strong production with 217 to 402 ounces of gold led by standout performance at jacobina canadian malartic el peneon and minera florida jacobina and canadian malartic i m pleased to note both reach all time quarterly heights cerro moro production increased compared to the second quarter of last year both but as we indicated previously we re expecting the mine to see much stronger results in the second half of this year produced 1 63 million ounces of silver during the quarter geo production was 241 to 341 ounces quarterly cash costs were 7 2 per geo and all in sustaining costs were 1081 per geo in line with plan our strong cash flow generation and increased cash balances continue to position us well to return cash to shareholders in the form of a higher dividend as reported yesterday we are increasing our annual dividend to 0 12 per share up nearly 15 from the previous dividend and a 500 increase compared to quarter two 2019 we also announced a normal course issuer bid that allows for the purchase of up to 5 of the company s issued and outstanding common shares over the next 12 months first half production and costs were in line with our plan set out at the beginning of the year as with prior years we expect quarter four to be the strongest quarter i would like to remind everyone that the guided production to be a 57 53 split between the first half and the second half and this is exactly what we have achieved in the first half taking a closer look at our operations as mentioned jacobina posted record quarterly production of 47 503 ounces of gold as you may have seen in our release yesterday updating progress on the phased expansion of jacobina average throughput for the quarter was 7 200 tonnes per day up 5 over the period prior quarter with throughput at reaching 7 500 tonnes per day for the entire month of may i ll talk more about the phase expansion in a moment at el peneon geo production for the quarter was 52 607 ounces including 39 492 ounces of gold and 891 255 ounces of silver we continue to expect planned production in quarter three and quarter four with the second half production to account for approximately 57 of the operation and world geo production canadian malartic had a record quarter producing 92 106 ounces of gold exceeding plan due to higher grades and recoveries from or found deeper in the malartic pit the operation remained on track to complete the progressive drilling and blasting at the barnat by at the end of quarter three of 2021 minera florida was a standout performer during the quarter production of 23 818 ounces of gold was above plan and higher than the same period in the prior year linear development continues to advance well ahead of plan and exploration results continue to demonstrate extension of identified areas of mineralization and new discoveries production at e cerro moro was 25 313 geo compared to 15 451 geo in the prior year period this includes 14 488 ounces of gold and silver production was at 736 820 ounces in the latest quarter challenging water conditions limited travel and impacted shift change however the company took the opportunity during this time to fast track certain health safety and other site improvement originally planned for the second half of the year which will benefit future quarters the transition to more mill feed coming from the underground ore at higher grade than the open pit ore will continue through the second half of 2021 we have a number of compelling growth opportunities in our portfolio and that we re very excited about one of these is the phase expansion at jacobina we ve made significant progress on phase two expansion to increase throughput to 8 500 tonnes per day and raised production to 230 000 ounces per year the jacobina planned to continue to exceed expectations as mentioned our success underscores the simplify approach that we are now taking to complete phase two this includes debottlenecking the processing plant and tailing system as well as operational improvement that derisk the project greatly reduce capex and eliminate the needs to install an additional ball mills our capital costs are expected to be only a fraction of the original estimated amount not exceeding 15 million to 20 million the key takeaway in yesterday s update is the greater certainty and reduced risk as we now require incremental optimization and operational improvement to achieve the phase two throughput subject to the successful completion of required permit modification we expect jacobina to begin producing the new 8 500 tonnes per day in the second half of 2023 as we advance phase two engineering for phase three expansion to 10 000 tonnes per day will advance in parallel with the planned modification originally planned for phase two now consider adequate for the phase three the feasibility study for the phase three is scheduled to be completed in 2023 and project commissioning is still on track for 2027 in addition to the phase two update we also disclosed strong exploration results at jacobina yesterday the results included exceptional drilling from canavieiras central and morro do vento as well as the discovery of a new zone at jolo belo sul with 536 000 ounces of mineral resources the results support the phase expansion and demonstrate jacobina s exceptional long term growth potential and ability to further extend strategic mine life turning now to wasamac our wholly owned gold project in quebec s prolific abitibi temiscamingue region we are excited to be growing our presence in quebec which is also owned to our canadian malartic operation wasamac is a great project and since acquiring it early this year we have made it even better we ve carried out several studies that have expanded reserve and average annual production while increasing throughput and plant nameplate capacity as a result we ve made the decision to advance the project to construction we expect to receive all permits and authorization by the third quarter of 2024 we have identified opportunities to improve ramp up and decrease the processing plant construction period development will be fully funded from available cash and cash flow once development is completed production will ramp up quickly and we ll achieve full production of approximately 200 000 ounces per year in year two and sustain that level for at least the next four years with costs well below the company s average wasamac has a reserve of 1 91 million ounces along with indicated resources of 326 000 ounces and inferred resources of 258 000 ounces with excellent additional exploration potential we believe wasamac will be a very long mine life of 15 years or more assuming this strategic mine life npv will be in the range of 850 million to 900 million at 18 50 oil price just 100 kilometers down the road from wasamac is our canadian malartic operation where we re advancing the odyssey underground project with our partner this is another outstanding project that will extend canadian malartic s mine life through at least 2039 the second quarter we ve completed overburden excavation and grouting to prepare for the construction of the production shaft and headframe we ve also made progress on the underground ramp development is ahead of schedule with approximately 764 linear meters completed this year and 1 587 linear meters completed since the start the exploration ramp is expected to take about two years to complete with the first drilling platform established in early july we have also completed construction of the shaft collar and engineering is progressing on the headframe and hoist room paste plant power line substation and workshop and the warehouse construction of the headframe and hoist room is slated to begin in the third quarter of 2021 and with that i will turn it over to jason jason leblanc senior vice president of finance chief financial officer thank you daniel and good morning everyone turning now to our financial performance adjusted net earnings for the second quarter were 70 7 million or 0 07 per share combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled 702 million an increase of approximately 8 over december 31 year end this includes about 223 million that has been made available for the mara project cash balances along with further liquidity and cash flows are more than sufficient to fully manage the company s business and capital allocation objectives which includes further returns of capital to shareholders we continue to generate robust cash flows with cash flows from operating activities increasing to 153 5 million in quarter two versus 129 4 million in the same period last year cash flows from operating activities before net change in working capital were 167 8 million and free cash flow before dividends and debt repayments increased 34 year over year to 51 2 million we expect cash flow to improve in the second half of the year with quarter four expected to deliver the strongest performance in line with the production and costs for quarter three and quarter four capital spending will be a little higher than the first half of the year as expected for sustaining capital we ll average about 50 million of spend per quarter for expansionary capex the average will be about 40 million per quarter with about half that attributed to odyssey and for exploration we ll spend between 25 million and 30 million with a 70 30 split between capital and opex we continue to see a strong performance across our portfolio with production and cost tracking to plan our first half results are well aligned to our 2021 guidance release at the start of the year which called for 53 of production to be weighted to the second half of the year our costs are also tracking in line for where they thought they would be at the end of quarter two and prospectively with minimal impact from inflationary pressures for the balance of the year as noted we expect stronger production and lower costs in the second half quarter four is expected to be our strongest quarter with the highest quarterly production and lowest quarterly costs continuing to trend from previous years and with that i ll turn it back over to daniel daniel racine president chief executive officer thank you jason before we begin the q a i want to talk a little bit more about wasamac and our growing presence in quebec i want to highlight the point raised by our executive chairman peter marrone in his most recent blog if you haven t read it yet the blog i encourage you to do so it s published roughly once a month as peter shares his perspective on a wide range of topics related to the gold mining sector his message in that blog can be summed up in five words focused on big pictures our long term production profile in quebec including wasamac and odyssey is 450 000 to 500 000 ounces per year between 2028 and 2035 while that s a strong profile in its own right we believe it s just the starting point that the mineral resources and exploration profile at wasamac and odyssey will generate significant production and mine life upside that s where we re forecasting a 15 year strategic mine life for wasamac and why we believe odyssey will be in production far from beyond 2039 we know that projection like this call for an element of trust on your part and trust and benefit of the doubt are in short supply in our industry for us for good reason as a result of event in the last cycle however there have been many changes in our industry and in our company in particular along with many successes we believe we merit the benefit of the doubt that our long term track record of converting resources to reserve at el peneon and jacobina and our success at canadian malartic had good reason for your faith in confidence without diminishing the success of our other mines odyssey is a game changer at a mine that has been a significant win for us on cash flows but before odyssey canadian malartic was seen as limited only to its well established open pit today is a top tier generational open pit and on the ground mine so we urge you to look at the bigger picture wasamac has the potential to become another generational mine in our portfolio a mine that will be in production for at least 15 years carried in our strategic mine life we look forward to advancing this mine and realizing its full potential and we hope you join us and enjoy the full episode upside and that in term of our canadian profile in short in few short years we have established a platform this is among the biggest in canada internal production with a production platform that will reach an initial roughly 500 000 ounces of gold all concentrated in two mines in the same region of the country and with that i will turn it back over to the operator for questions operator questions and answers operator thank you we will now take questions from the telephone lines and the first question is from anita soni from cibc world markets please go ahead your line is now open anita soni cibc world markets analyst good morning guys thanks for taking my call my question is with regards to the indications that you ve given for inflation going forward can you give us a little bit more color on some of the offsets that you re seeing i think you mentioned that you are seeing some inflationary pressures but you ve got some operational sorry operational synergies that can offset that and areas where you might not have operational synergies and we might see some cost escalation thanks daniel racine president chief executive officer i ll start and i ll let jason to give more detail but talking about inflation a big part of our cost is manpower and then we have negotiated two contracts this year successfully within our budget so we have not seen really inflation in that part there s been some inflation pressure in the first half but like we mentioned we were able with our some synergies some good operational excellence again to limit the impact and then we were right in light so maybe jason you can give some detail of what we see coming and how we plan to mitigate these cost pressure jason leblanc senior vice president of finance chief financial officer yes sure daniel mentioned we re seeing inflation those headline items like everybody else out there they re trickling down to consumption level of grinding media and the like explosives etc and those are all up year over year up a little bit more than our plan but we indicated it is not significant with the guidance range that we provided previously it s accommodated in there with a little bit stronger foreign exchange i probably paid that at 15 20 of negative impact compared to where we were at the start of the year and obviously we re working to try to offset that with all of our procurement efforts i think we feel pretty good about that and then also operational excellence i think it s been a big part of our success over the last number of years and that program is just that much more mature in advance so we feel like we re in a pretty good position to offset some of these impacts and we do think they are cyclical in nature they are all these direct inputs are up quite a bit from recent cycle loads so i think they come off from highs earlier this year so they do seem to be moderating but there is definitely an element of uncertainty here and we have to do our best to manage it anita soni cibc world markets analyst okay and then the second question is just on jacobina i think you guys mentioned that you d be pulling lower grades for the second half of the year as the mill is now outpacing the mine as we go forward and that was temporary and it s going to be you re set up into 2022 but how do we think about grades in jacobina in 2022 and 2023 i think previously we were kind of targeting toward a 2 3 gram per tonne material to achieve those production targets is that still your target daniel racine president chief executive officer yes anita coming from the underground mine itself that s the grid you can expect but you can understand that our phase one was 6 500 tonnes per day we budget a bit higher than that at 68 but you saw our number we re achieving 72 and 75 so the mine is not ready to produce that amount of tonne but we have stockpiles at a bit lower grade so this is why the grades will be a bit slower so we re going to process more tonne a bit lower grade and then in total that will be a higher production at the end of the day i think we have to take the advantage that we can put that supplemental incremental ore into the mill and that s what we do we re making a lot of money even with 2 1 grams per tonne at jacobina that s what and then eventually when we re going to catch up the production the underground production to what the mill is able to do then the grade will come back to that 2 3 grams per tonne or 2 4 grams per tonne anita soni cibc world markets analyst i guess i was just asking when do you think you d get back to that 2 3 grams per tonne or 2 4 grams per tonne and then secondly as you mentioned you re making a lot of money at 2 1 grams per tonne so then what kind of is there any kind of i guess processing cost reduction with the higher throughputs that i should be thinking about in the model while you re still processing 2 1 grams per tonne daniel racine president chief executive officer yohann why don t you answer that question yohann bouchard senior vice president of operations yes daniel thank you we re going to see for sure i mean we re doing step by step implementation to the processing plant for sure with what we have in mind by increasing to 8 500 tonne per day without having to you can understand that we re going to be much more efficient so yes for sure 8 500 with that new i would say approach i would say i would expect to see some kind decrease with processing daniel racine president chief executive officer regarding grade anita that s when phase two was planned so around the second half of 2023 you should see grade cut going back even maybe next year you should see grade coming at that 2 3 grams per tonne or 2 4 grams per tonne anita soni cibc world markets analyst okay fair enough and then lastly on cerro moro as we look at the just taking a look at the production year to date overall is it fair to say that it might undershoot the original sort of guidance range for that specific asset where other assets that are outperforming like minera florida and el peneon versus your budgets might make up the difference daniel racine president chief executive officer sure the other four mines will do better but we re still targeting to achieve our guidance for cerro moro so second half at cerro moro is planned to be a very good half we re going to see it as always a risk but we re still aiming to achieve our guidance at cerro moro anita soni cibc world markets analyst all right so that was on throughput reverting back to normal throughputs after that sort of health and safety shutdown that you guys had and then secondly on i guess really good grades right daniel racine president chief executive officer yes exactly anita soni cibc world markets analyst okay thank you very much that s it for my question operator thank you the next question is from fahad tariq from credit suisse please go ahead your line is now open fahad tariq credit suisse analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question just on the dividend i noticed there was some commentary around just maybe a different methodology or a slightly different perspective based on minimal cash that s needed can you just touch on kind of the thinking around how the dividend is increased if that has changed given there s obviously some capital commitments that are coming up over the next few years with wasamac and malartic you add that up it could be almost 1 billion of capex over the next few years just maybe just any changes to the way you re thinking about the dividend daniel racine president chief executive officer good morning fahad we mentioned in the past that we might look on formula for dividend but we ve decided not to do that we look at our like you mentioned we look at our future capital our future cash flow generation and what we can afford as a dividend and then when we look at what s coming at malartic at wasamac you saw that jacobina is a lot less now that we can afford to increase our dividend to 0 12 per share and then we re going to continue to look at it in the future and then we want that like we mentioned many times that dividend to be sustainable so if we were able to increase it from 0 105 to 0 12 per share it s because we believe our profile in the next many years can we can t afford to pay it at that level fahad tariq credit suisse analyst okay that s clear so if gold prices stay above 1 350 an ounce it s fair to assume that this dividend would be consistent daniel racine president chief executive officer it will be consistent at 1 350 absolutely fahad tariq credit suisse analyst okay great that s it for me thank you so much daniel racine president chief executive officer thank you operator thank you the next question is from josh wolfson from rbc capital markets please go ahead your line is now open josh wolfson rbc capital markets analyst thanks for taking my question focusing on cerro moro is there anything is there any details you could provide in order for us to sort of connect the dots as to what s required to see improvements in the second half of the year historically and last year obviously covid being a bigger impact getting the development rate seems to be a challenge what s maybe giving you more comfort on the outlook now in terms of expected improvements daniel racine president chief executive officer good morning josh i ll let yohann answer but i ll say development is rates are improving they re growing a lot better now so maybe yohann you can give color of why we re very confident that the second half will be quite a good half at cerro moro yohann bouchard senior vice president of operations so as daniel said we did progress very well to catch back on our development so that will turn a lot of flexibilities with mining just to give you an example when we start july we were only we had only to do 70 meters development to meet all the requirements for the next six weeks so we re getting in better position we have higher reconciliation i would say better reconciliation between what we mine versus what we see to the mill within some progress as well with controlling dilution and what s already in our mine so all that together i think that the operation now reach a point where we see i would say quarter three and quarter four reached the target that we wanted so again that s going to be a progressing approach quarter over quarter at cerro moro so for sure and i will not hide any details and going to be challenging to meet our budget and guidance on that one but the plan that we have in front of us is showing a good trend if we succeed to maintain a high level of development josh wolfson rbc capital markets analyst and for the heap leach study what was the grade of the material that was used for the column tests yohann bouchard senior vice president of operations it s about one gram per tonne josh wolfson rbc capital markets analyst and when you re thinking about this five million tonne target i guess initial resource is that a comparable grade we should think about for this opportunity yohann bouchard senior vice president of operations yes i think it will yes that s correct for sure i mean we re going to see we re going to see opportunities as well i mean we don t dilute if we don t have to but that can be our but i would say one gram per tonne is our minimal heap leach grade for sure josh wolfson rbc capital markets analyst okay thank you very much operator thank you the next question is from mike parkin from national bank please go ahead your line is now open mike parkin national bank analyst thanks for taking my question with odyssey has there been a good plan developed in terms of what will ultimately be involved with the canadian malartic mill in terms of what it will be scaled down to right now you ve got the big size feeding into the three ball mill lines if i remember correctly i know there s been some preliminary talk about potentially removing the is the idea to kind of run a couple the ball mill lines and kind of keep the third one as a spare or what s the thoughts there daniel racine president chief executive officer wondering mike yohann maybe you can put some color on it but we know exactly what needs to be done to achieve but again mike we re what six seven years away to be in full production underground at odyssey so things might change we our partner announced and then we said the same thing a new discovery at malartic during the second quarter so if we find more or more areas to be mined then throughput might increase in the future at malartic but for now we know exactly what it s needed to achieve 20 000 tonne per day so maybe yohann on the mill what needs to be done yohann bouchard senior vice president of operations yes i will not go in the detail mike on your question but what you need to what we need to understand here is we cannot batch the ore because the processing time because we need to keep a piece at a time all the time to accommodate the mining sequence so as you said we need to i would say rightsize the processing times about 20 000 tonne per day and the idea here is going to be to be to do it efficiently so we re going to park some of the branding units some of the many equipment can be parked but that s going to be removed in case of something that is coming so we re going to have we re going to remain with that flexibilities so from the current i would say from the current costs processing costs by processing less tonnes we believe that the processing cost will increase by about let s say the top of my head 1 50 us per tonne more or processing going at 20 000 tonnes per day mike parkin national bank analyst okay that s perfect another question with the jacobina kind of revisit on the phase two simply just kind of looking at it in terms of where the bottlenecks are and unlocking the potential by addressing those rather than going ahead with the bigger capital spend can you just give us a couple of ideas where the bigger bottlenecks are within the mill and how you re working to address those yohann bouchard senior vice president of operations yes for sure i mean jacobina we go we had a really good surprise of team all working like we did a really good job i mean to do those the bottlenecking little project and it just creates a price and it bring us to just reconsider what we have for our phase two expansion so i would say on the short term mike they re going to work on the like what all be the water pumping system and flurry pumping system and we also want to do some modification to our tailing line so even if we did some we still have to do some modification there to release over that system so in parallel i mean what we see there is we have we re using a power draw of about 92 and i mean the sweet spot for mining is about 95 to 97 so we re going to take advantage of weeding power draw at our grinding units i would say we also underutilized the crushing circuits primary circuit is about 38 and the secondary crusher circuit is in up about 50 so we see some opportunities there by optimizing usage and i would say maybe decrease of these of the crushing so that will help and i would say the second one is that we see the third point is going to be to optimize grinding size and also screening and performance to for sure unload the running units and be able to push more tonnes through the mill mike parkin national bank analyst you expect any loss in recovery or have you already kind of done some studies on that where you re not seeing material daniel racine president chief executive officer yes a good question i mean maybe you saw that in our release that we have given two tests in quarter two and we went up we put the mill up to 8 600 tonnes per day on a day and we averaged a really high tonnage over a short period of time so for sure we saw a decrease of recovery during that time but that was within 1 i would say and i m generously saying that so i mean by doing all that and for sure now we re looking at we actually have designed 160 micron i mean between 160 and 180 micron doesn t make a big difference we believe that we can push that a little bit further and we don t see at the inflection point so that means by being cutting a little bit by processing i would say material for sure we re going to cut on power requirement as well so as i said this is something that come up like in quarter three and we re very excited and we still try to understand what s going to be i would say the positive impact on cost going forward and ready to find where it s going to be a sweet spot for processing rate mike parkin national bank analyst okay that s good and then last question with respect to the ncib how should we kind of think about the execution of that are you going to be strategic or looking to kind of just be a regular participant in the market with it and buying kind of a fairly steady pace of shares throughout the next 12 months daniel racine president chief executive officer we re going to be strategic mike we would not intend to buy a small amount of shares it s it s we re going when we re going to decide to do it if we do it it s going to be on a strategy point of view mike parkin national bank analyst okay that s it for me guys thank so much daniel racine president chief executive officer thank you mike operator the next question is from ralph profiti from eight capital please go ahead your line is now open ralph profiti eight capital analyst good morning thank you daniel for the question there s quite a comprehensive tailing strategy being built around jacobina and i m just wondering is substitution of the surface tailings to the highest degree possible to go here where you re taking more sort of an esg perspective or are you coming away with more of a strategic mine life at the increased processing rate of 10 000 tonnes per day when you re managing the surface tailings capacity daniel racine president chief executive officer good morning ralph good good question there s a lot of strategy behind you know the 10 000 tonne per day at jacobina we have to think about tailing you know we mentioned already that we re going to go with an hydraulic backfill system to start we re probably going to switch eventually or have both also a base fill system to put more detailing underground and even now we re studying a dry stack tailing on surface to have to use less less space on surface and all of that it s include in our strategy we would like to use as much as possible in the maximum the ex the actual tailing and that s what we ve been successful to you know at 16 6 500 tonnes per day we added 13 years 13 16 years tailing in mine life we will increase to 85 and we will have the same because we re going to implement a backfill system so the next step going to a higher tonnage is to to use the same strategy what we can do to maintain our attaining mine life still increasing the underground mine life but putting more more training so you re absolutely right that s part of our strategy to put as much or more tailings underground or reduce our footprint on surface with tailing we re doing already quite good but we see opportunities in the future and that s going to be part one of the big part of the phase three expansion ralph profiti eight capital analyst okay yeah thank you and you know my second question is coming back to some of these wage inflation pressures you talked about the two contracts secured would it be safe to say that those are in that sort of plus 2 to 5 range that we re seeing in the industry benchmark and specifically when does the cerro moro wage negotiation come due daniel racine president chief executive officer we did el peneon and jacobina this year cerro moro i don t remember maybe yohann you know yohann bouchard senior vice president of operations daniel i don t recall sorry daniel racine president chief executive officer yeah i get back to you but i don t think it s this year ralph profiti eight capital analyst 2023 guys daniel racine president chief executive officer 2023 okay so we re two years away ralph profiti eight capital analyst okay thank you that s great daniel racine president chief executive officer thank you ralph operator thank you the next question is from tanya jakusconek please go from scotiabank please go ahead your line is now open tanya jakusconek scotiabank analyst great good morning everybody i just wanted to come back on the share buyback i know you commented on it being strategic i m just trying to understand how you view your dividend versus your share buybacks dividends about 115 million your share buyback should you do all of it that s over 200 million it s probably double your dividend i m just wondering how you re balancing that do you have a target in mind that share buyback would be similar to your dividend just trying to understand the strategy daniel racine president chief executive officer go ahead jason jason leblanc senior vice president of finance chief financial officer yeah i think for tanya it s got to start with the overall capital allocation so we still have that balance across all those priorities that s the first kind of point of reference and as daniel said with the 0 12 that s effectively fixed in our mind it s sustainable we make sure it s sustainable through the cycle and that s going to be the first priority and then once we look at those other capital allocation opportunities then we can look at the ncib so straight give you first and then there ll be a component going to the ncib tanya jakusconek scotiabank analyst okay so there isn t a target within the component it s whatever you so there isn t a target basically jason leblanc senior vice president of finance chief financial officer well we can t look at just the dividend you know in and of itself we ve got to look at all the capital allocation i think we ve got the transparency on capital now it s very well laid out with the two projects in odyssey and wasamac now it s spread out manageable and every year and we will still continue to chip away at the balance sheet too so we re going to be balanced across everything like we have been for the last several years daniel racine president chief executive officer and we mentioned many times tanya that we have like three buckets so our capital allocation the dividend and reducing the debt and then the debt is reaching a level now that we are very comfortable it will continue to improve so at one point when there s enough cash and we might decide to do the ncib so it s all included in our strategy we look at all the time the three these three buckets and then if there s money available at one point we might do the we might do the share buyback but it will all depend what happened with so many other factors at that gold price that we don t control tanya jakusconek scotiabank analyst okay no that s fair enough thank you and maybe just coming back to the inflation i know anita ask this and i just wanted to come back and you know you talked about efficiencies offsetting this inflation and jason thank you for the currencies of was due to strengthening of the currency just for ourselves are you seeing the inflation when you look at all of these numbers going forward in that 3 to 5 range that you re looking to offset i m just trying to see if that you re similar with your peers in that sense jason leblanc senior vice president of finance chief financial officer yeah and maybe just start to clarify the 15 to 20 would be both fx and inflationary pressures baked together i kind of gave you a one stop there so that s the two of them and the it s coming through on a component of items we highlighted a few in our disclosure but we re seeing the results of our procurement efforts showing lower costs on other stuff so i think that that part of it as well to the extent we are seeing higher costs on like the straightforward stuff like grinding media we re actually seeing lower cost on cyanide by example because of consolidation work that we re doing so it s a bit of both but the net is a little bit more inflation for sure so we ve got to focus on more of those bundling and consolidation opportunities to try to take the edge off it and then back to our pure operational excellence so that s more of a productivity avoidance type approach there so it s we re coming at it from all angles tanya jakusconek scotiabank analyst okay so it seems as though you re probably then on the lower end of that sort of range in terms of what you re seeing inflationary wise jason leblanc senior vice president of finance chief financial officer yeah for sure that s fine the 3 to 5 i think that fits squarely within the labor component that daniel mentioned very much within our very much within our planning and then on a line item basis we may see higher than 3 to 5 but when you look at the aggregate of all of our work it s going to come out more of that 3 to 5 range per tanya jakusconek scotiabank analyst that s good great thank you so much for the insight operator thank you there are no further questions registered at this time i ll turn the meeting back over to mr

other related materials and with that i ll pass the call over to our chief executive officer jason fox jason e fox chief executive officer thank you peter and good morning everyone having proved the resilience of our portfolio throughout the pandemic the first half of 2021 has been characterized by an acceleration in growth driven primarily by record deal volume enabling us to further increase our investment expectations for the year and raise our affo guidance we continue to see a high level of deal activity with several hundred million dollars of deals currently in our pipeline and with inflation taking center stage with investors w p carey is well positioned to generate additional upside with 60 of our abr coming from leases that rents bumps tied to cpi i ll focus my remarks this morning on these 2 growth drivers accretive investments and the rent escalations embedded in our leases after which i ll hand the call over to our cfo toni sanzone who will focus on our results guidance and balance sheet and as usual we re joined by our president john park and our head of asset management brooks gordon starting with our growth through acquisitions for the second quarter investment volume was 780 million driven primarily by the completion of 11 acquisitions our net lease investments had a weighted average cap rate of 5 6 reflecting the mix and quality of the assets we acquired amid a competitive market environment for example about 40 of our second quarter investment volume was in class a warehouse including a 195 million investment in a newly constructed logistics facility in the u k which is expected to receive a green very good environmental rating and is net leased to jaguar land rover for a 30 year term also about 40 of our second quarter investment volume came from europe where cap rates tend to be lower although spreads remain attractive given our ability to issue euro denominated debt which is currently over 100 basis points cheaper than where we can issue u s bonds the differentiating factor from other net lease reits is our ability to achieve attractive rent increases over long lease terms in recent years we believe we ve been originating leases that are among the longest in the net lease sector our second quarter investments had a weighted average lease term of 21 years with increases averaging 2 2 for those with either fixed rent increases or floors the profile of our investments results in an average yield that s meaningfully more attractive than peers we re originating shorter term leases with lower or even no rent increases initial going in cap rates taking in isolation do not tell the whole story of the prolonged accretion we achieve for example a lease with a 6 going in cap rate and 2 5 annual rent increases over a 20 year term has an average annual yield of over 7 5 turning now to our growth through rent escalations and how we re positioned for inflation 99 5 of our abr comes from leases with built in rent growth which includes 60 from leases tied to inflation the majority of that representing 37 of total abr comes from leases tied to uncapped cpi is split roughly 60 40 between europe and the u s 23 of our abr comes from leases tied to cpi that have floors and or caps the average floor is approximately 1 5 on an annualized basis and the average cap is approximately 3 and lastly leases with fixed rent bumps represent 35 of abr and have average annualized increases of around 2 because inflation generally flows through to rents with a lag we expect our contractual same store rent growth to increase about 100 basis points from 1 5 to about 2 5 over the next 12 months based on current economic forecasts holding all other factors constant this assumes inflation over the remainder of 2021 of about 3 5 in the u s and averaging 2 75 across europe which then stabilizes in 2022 to around 2 in both regions of course if actual inflation runs higher than currently predicted we would expect our contractual same store growth to ultimately be above 2 5 while this gives a sense of the impact of inflation on our rent growth about a year from now the impact on abr is of course cumulative and the effect of compounding can be powerful over longer time frames turning now to the internal and external factors contributing to the sustainability of our increased investment activity with 1 billion of investments completed in the first half of the year 122 million of capital investment projects scheduled to complete in the second half of the year and the several hundred million dollars of deals in our pipeline we expect 2021 to be a record year for deal volume we also expect to maintain a high volume of deals through a combination of factors from an internal perspective with the simplification of the company largely complete we re now singularly focused on investing for our balance sheet and feel we re benefiting from deeper relationships and market expertise as well as from a more streamlined investment process from a macro perspective sale leasebacks continue to gain popularity with corporations as part of an overall trend of leasing rather than owning real estate and m a activity has picked up driving net lease deal flow as companies seek to optimize their balance sheets and private equity firms monetize assets to drive returns we also benefit from the scale of our portfolio with about 30 of our second quarter investment volume coming from follow on deals originated through our existing tenant and sponsor relationships while our diversified approach ultimately provides a vast and deep addressable market over 2 continents from a top down perspective our core focus remains on industrial and warehouse assets which comprised about 70 of our second quarter deal volume within these sectors we ve recently expanded into attractive subsectors with r d and lab space and industries like food processing and production which are all well suited for sale leasebacks we ve also been investing in essential retail properties in europe especially stores with strong unit level performance completing investments in grocery portfolios in spain and france over the last 9 months in addition to our core focus we create incremental deal volume and growth through more opportunistic investments a very recent example of our ability to put additional money to work in this way is the construction loan we entered into during the second quarter related to a retail complex currently under development on the las vegas strip we funded an initial 85 million draw in june and expect to fund additional draws over the next 12 to 18 months up to 225 million the drawn amounts earned 6 interest and upon completion with the option to convert part of the loan into ownership of net lease retail assets at an extremely desirable location at very attractive cap rates in closing given all these factors coupled with the cost of capital that allows us to consistently make accretive investments we re confident that we can maintain a strong pace of investments in the second half of the year and we ve raised the investment volume in our 2021 guidance to reflect that lastly the worst of the covid pandemic seems to be behind us the recent surge in delta variant case numbers serves as an important reminder that in addition to investment volume underwriting and portfolio quality still matter that the proven performance of our portfolio continues to differentiate w p carey from other net lease reits and with that i ll pass the call over to toni toni sanzone chief financial officer thank you jason and good morning everyone i m pleased to say that we exceeded expectations with our second quarter results completing a strong first half of the year and positioning us to again raise our full year guidance for the quarter we generated total affo of 1 27 per share and real estate affo of 1 23 which increased 12 year over year reflecting the accelerated pace of our investment activity year to date and the continued strength of our rent collections which were 99 for the quarter we are raising our full year affo guidance increasing at 0 06 at the midpoint we currently expect to generate total affo of between 4 94 and 5 02 per share for the full year including real estate affo of between 4 82 and 4 90 per share representing over 5 year over year growth at the midpoint we ve raised our full year expectations for investment volume to a range of 1 5 billion to 2 billion including capital investments and commitment scheduled to complete this year also included in our investment volume is the construction funding of the las vegas retail complex jason discussed earnings from this investment are expected to add about 3 million to affo this year which will be reflected in earnings from equity method investments disposition activity during the second quarter totaled 86 million bringing dispositions for the first half of the year to 100 million based on our current visibility into the timing of certain sales we ve lowered our expectations for total disposition activity for the year to between 150 million to 250 million comprehensive same store rent growth which is based on pro rata rental income included in affo was 2 year over year on a full year basis we expect our comprehensive same store rent growth to exceed our recent pre covid growth rates driven by sustained collections of 99 as well as certain covid related rent recoveries we assume will occur in the back half of the year during the second quarter we resumed collecting substantially all quarterly rent due from a retail tenant in europe that had made partial rent payments in prior quarters due to lockdowns our affo guidance range now assumes that during the second half of 2021 we recover most if not all of the 4 5 million of outstanding rent due from this tenant lease termination and other revenues increased during the second quarter due primarily to the receipt of 4 4 million in lease related settlements we currently assume no significant additional payments of this nature in the back half of the year for g a expense we ve raised and narrowed our guidance outlook for the full year to fall within a range of 82 million to 84 million up moderately from our prior expectations on last quarter s call i noted that in april we received preferred stock dividends totaling 3 3 million from our investment in watermark lodging trust representing the amount due for the prior 4 quarters which was the primary driver of our non operating income line item for the 2021 second quarter going forward we expect to receive preferred dividends of approximately 8 000 on a quarterly basis which is embedded in our full year guidance moving now to our capital markets activity and balance sheet following an active first quarter during which we issued bonds at our tightest spreads and lowest coupons to date we raised well priced equity during the second quarter in june we completed an equity forward offering for just over 6 million shares locking in our ability to match fund acquisitions with 455 million of equity raised at a gross price of 75 30 per share we settled a portion of these latest forward agreements during the second quarter as well as the remaining forward agreements from those we put in place last year we also issued shares under our atm program in aggregate we issued 6 7 million shares during the second quarter raising 472 million in net proceeds the majority of our share issuances occurred later in the quarter and will therefore be fully reflected in our third quarter weighted average share count at quarter end our weighted average interest rate was 2 6 a significant decline from 3 2 a year ago reflecting the continued improvement in our cost of debt interest expense for the second quarter totaled 49 3 million which declined 6 year over year primarily reflecting the full quarter impact of the interest cost savings generated by our first quarter debt prepayments and refinancings from a leverage perspective debt to gross assets remains at the low end of our target range ending the second quarter at 41 1 net debt to adjusted ebitda was 6 times at the end of the quarter and 5 8 times when factoring in the remaining shares available under our latest equity forward our liquidity position remained very strong ensuring we re well positioned to fund new acquisitions and continue accessing capital markets opportunistically we ended the second quarter with total liquidity of approximately 2 billion including cash the available capacity on our 1 8 billion credit facility and our ability to settle 4 million shares remaining under forward agreements by the end of 2022 for anticipated net proceeds of approximately 300 million in closing building on the recent momentum in our deal volume which is expected to continue in the second half of the year we anticipate a record year for acquisitions supported by strong liquidity capital market flexibility and a favorable cost of capital in addition to the proven downside protection our portfolio provides with sustained higher inflation we d also expect it to generate additional upside to our growth over the longer term and with that i ll hand the call back to the operator for questions questions and answers operator thank you at this time we will take questions thank you our first question is coming from sheila mcgrath with evercore please proceed with your question sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst yes good morning jason jason e fox chief executive officer good morning sheila sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst good morning a big investment quarter pipeline is larger can you help us understand how the volume has picked up so much is it have you added new personnel have you broadened the initial yield criteria because your cost of capital has improved or is there just more product for sale maybe as a result of increasing m a jason e fox chief executive officer yes i think it s a little bit of all of those things i mean certainly with the simplification of our business largely complete after the cpa merger and the continued wind down of investment management business there s more of a singular focus on growth for us our cost of capital continues to work really well and obviously the diversified approach doesn t hurt either offers us a wide opportunity set that s both clearly in the u s and europe and we can compete at a broad range of cap rates as you mentioned we ve expanded that target cap rate range some and i think that allows us to buy higher quality probably mainly industrial assets which is contributing to the increased deal volume but to your point m a that s led to more sale leasebacks in our mind and it seems more and maybe more of a permanent shift in how corporates view owning versus leasing their real estate and of course as the market leader in sale leaseback this is clearly favorable to us as well so lots of changes i think there are some more incremental changes we made in our within our investment process and within the team as well and i think all of that has led to what we view as more sustained deal activity and where we sit today the opportunities have been there and there s really no reason for us to believe that level of transaction activity won t continue into the future so we feel good about where we are sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay that s great one more question i think it was helpful highlighting how much of your leases are tied to like uncapped cpi just wondering if you could explain how that works like is it an annual adjustment for as you look back over the past year and i would guess that cpi is tracking across the different countries where you have assets pretty significantly just wondering if that s an annual adjustment every 5 years or how it works jason e fox chief executive officer yes each lease is going to be unique i would say the majority of our leases have annual increases but there certainly are leases that would bump every 2 years or every 5 years as well those will be in the portfolio there is a lag effect i think as you pointed out because the leases are more in this annual cadence for some of them it may take months before that fully flows through to our abr and then you re right i mean the u s leases are predominantly based on cpi and then in europe it depends some of them are eurozone inflation base some of them are more specific to a country german cpi or dutch cpi or u k rpi so it s really deal specific but i think generally speaking we like this exposure to inflation i think it s one of the differentiators in our portfolio sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst thank you jason e fox chief executive officer welcome operator thank you our next question comes from spenser allaway with green street please proceed with your question spenser allaway green street advisors analyst thank you just on the construction loan i was wondering if you guys could provide a little bit of color on the expected risk adjusted yield that you guys expecting on these relative to more traditional acquisitions and capital investment projects jason e fox chief executive officer yes sure i mean look our core focus is still on acquiring industrial and warehouse properties in the u s and europe and also retail in europe for that matter as well and when we think about retail in the u s we typically are taking a more opportunistic approach and i think this transaction falls into that category for now it s a construction loan i think we talk about that it s going to earn during the construction period 6 interest which we think is a pretty healthy rate especially relative to where cap rates have trended it s a phenomenal location i d call it one of the best development parcels on the entire las vegas strip if you know the market at all at the intersection of las vegas boulevard and harman at the southern end of the pedestrian bridge that links the cosmopolitan hotel to city center and crystals mall and from our analysis it s a location with some of the highest foot traffic in the entire united states so for us in terms of risk adjusted returns we actually completed a very similar project to this across the street probably 6 or 7 years ago it was very very successful it s with the same operating partner so we have lots of confidence in our ability to execute here and as i said we think it s a good risk adjusted return for the loan and for now it is a loan but ultimately we ll have the opportunity through some purchase options to buy some longer term net leases and we can talk about kind of specifics of that if it were to happen down the road construction is complete spenser allaway green street advisors analyst okay great and then realizing you guys have been focusing on industrial like you mentioned in your prepared remarks and i understand you don t have a crystal ball for everything in 22 yet but just looking forward how optimistic or do you have a sense of the addressable market really in europe remaining related to that property type jason e fox chief executive officer specifically industrial in europe was the question spenser allaway green street advisors analyst yeah jason e fox chief executive officer or just generally about how we see our ability to keep on ramping up transaction volume spenser allaway green street advisors analyst both would be great but yes more specifically as it relates to industrial is that s where you ve been focused jason e fox chief executive officer yes and it is both in u s and europe i mean look it s clear to everyone that industrial has been the focus of many investors and it s had tremendous capital inflows i mean what we re not doing is competing on the shorter term multi let industrial assets that are hitting the headlines that we re seeing it was in the 4s and now it s probably the 3s in terms of going in cap rates those are trading at these levels because there s a perception that they have and probably it s probably real that they have good mark to market opportunities we re focused more on longer term 15 20 plus year leases with good industrial assets this can be logistics it could be high quality like the jlr deal that we purchased earlier this year we re also focused on light manufacturing food production r d all which also fall under our industrial category and we have a very good track record of sourcing predominantly through sale leasebacks and i think that s a big reason why we re able to acquire these with those structures in place and what we feel are higher than market cap rates as well so look it s hard to predict what s going to happen in 2022 but we think we re set up very well as i ve mentioned earlier on sheila s question to continue to show the momentum that we ve had on the acquisition front spenser allaway green street advisors analyst great thanks for the color jason e fox chief executive officer yes you re welcome operator thank you our next question is coming from the line of anthony paolone with jpmorgan please proceed with your question anthony paolone jpmorgan analyst great thank you i don t know if i missed this but can you comment on just your current pipeline and the skew between europe in the u s and also just how yields might look compared to 5 6 that you mentioned in the second quarter jason e fox chief executive officer yes sure so yes so the pipeline is strong as we ve talked about year to date at this point just to recap we ve closed about 1 billion of deals including the 780 million in the second quarter we also have 122 million of capital projects expansions and build to suits that are expected to complete in 2021 at that point they get added to our volume and rent roll so we have kind of 1 1 billion locked in at this point in time and our pipeline remains strong there s over 300 million of deals in advanced stages right now which we believe much of that will close during the third quarter and then beyond that we still have a couple of hundred million dollars more of identified deals that are earlier stages but advancing through the diligence and closing process and of course our fourth quarter as we ve talked about in the past tends to be our most active quarter of the year we don t have visibility into that now but it does tend to be the most active year and i think a lot of that has rate has led to our guidance raise we feel good about that midpoint and maybe with the potential to get into the top half of that range as well so there s really no reason to think that anything is going to slow down here assuming market conditions don t change substantially you asked about u s versus europe year to date it s been about 60 40 u s to europe europe has slowed a little bit but that s typical this time of year the current pipeline is probably more call it three quarters u s a quarter europe but we would expect that to pick up as we get a little further into the year i think the last part of your question was about cap rates we look at a pretty wide range of cap rates part of the benefits of a diversified approach i would say we target deals into this 5 to 7 cap rate range you pointed out that the quarter was a 5 6 weighted average cap rate year to date it s around 5 8 weighted average cap rate and this is a going in cap rate i think that s important to note a lot of that i think you can attribute to market compression but i think also we talked about the mix of assets that we re acquiring and higher quality warehouse is just going to trade a little bit lower but we think we re getting good risk adjusted returns from where we ll acquire them and then you also mentioned europe and europe does have lower cap rates that s driving that sum also and as you know our cost of borrow in europe is meaningfully lower so while we might be doing some tighter going in cap rates in europe they still generate even the same or maybe even better spreads i think the last thing to note here is that from an accretion standpoint we re not overly focused on going in cap rates if you think about especially how we structure our transactions virtually all of our leases have built in bumps many of them as we talk about are based on inflation the ones that are fixed are probably in the 2 range and these are long leases so over a 20 year period with interesting bumps the average yield is significantly higher and i think that will be the case for all the deals that we re purchasing this year anthony paolone jpmorgan analyst got it and just i appreciate the context on the duration side of your deals is it something that when a deal comes to you the duration is there and either take it or leave it or is it something that you want longer duration and so you make other concessions to get it or how does that work jason e fox chief executive officer well most of the deals that we source are through sale leasebacks and build to suits so the entire structure is a negotiation and there s give and takes throughout that process but certainly lease term is important to us the types of bumps that we have that s important to us especially inflation so i think it s all on the table and there are trade offs especially in a competitive market but as you can see we ve been successful and transacting with very long lease terms very interesting bump profiles and still maintaining an attractive initial cap rate and spread our cost of capital anthony paolone jpmorgan analyst all right and just one last maybe detailed question it seemed like lease termination income in the quarter was a bit elevated any color around that and whether that does anything to the noi run rate we should think about going forward jason e fox chief executive officer toni do you want to take that one toni sanzone chief financial officer yes i will take that one thanks thanks jason no i think that we did mention that the this quarter specifically included a couple of larger payments from tenants it totaled about 4 million 4 5 million in the small bankruptcy settlement in that amount as well i think there are there s a recurring portion of this line item that runs through every quarter and then sort of these one off amounts that do tend to recur from time to time during the year i d say on average we re looking at about 12 million for the full year which is in line with where it was last year so i don t think we re really expecting anything or we don t have anything in our line of sight right now for the remainder of this year i said this quarter was certainly an uptick anthony paolone jpmorgan analyst okay but the payments didn t tie to us having to take like a piece of your run rate revenue out because something that was terminated or anything toni sanzone chief financial officer no these were end of lease payments typically to restore the premises we ll settle with a tenant on their way out so nothing in terms of recurring noi there but certainly an economic part of the lease that we enforce anthony paolone jpmorgan analyst got it understand thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of elvis rodriguez with bank of america please proceed with your question elvis rodriguez bank of america analyst hi thanks to you all thanks for taking the call just a couple of questions so one you mentioned the increased interest on sale leasebacks in particular what sectors or property types are you seeing this more in today versus perhaps 2 years ago and then on that question if you could just update us on the lab office or interest in lab lab r d space like what are you seeing there what markets are they is it the mega clusters that some of the other public reits own and or these are secondary markets thanks jason e fox chief executive officer yes sure so sale leasebacks i would say it s more broadly increasing as corporates perhaps a result of some of the liquidity crunches that they had during covid corporates i think are moving more toward leasing rather than owning their real estate and that includes critical operating real estate that are good candidates for sale leasebacks and long term leases and that s where we ve been targeting and it s we talk about industrial being a broad asset class for us there s certainly a lot of warehouse deals that we re doing but within that we re also doing as you mentioned r d cold storage food processing and production so i think all of those lend themselves well to sale leasebacks again because of the criticality of the assets which lends themselves well to corporates being willing to sign very long term leases and your specific question on lab i mean we re not primarily focused on lab i think it s going to be more incremental deal volume when there are opportunities to do sale leasebacks it s not going to be competing with the alexandrias of the world in cambridge and san diego so it s just a little different approach for us elvis rodriguez bank of america analyst great and then just a question so at the end of 4q 20 you got about 9 5 of your leases of abr rolling in 2024 and now you only have about 8 is that a function of bringing leases up selling assets how should we think about the role that s occurring in the portfolio over the next few years and what retention can look like thanks jason e fox chief executive officer brooks do you want to take that one brooks gordon managing director head of asset management sure so with respect to 2024 it s really just ongoing leasing activity that has occurred so that s not really disposition activity so we are very focused always on reducing that next 5 year lease roll percentage and we re making good progress on that in the next 3 years we have a very manageable lease expiration outlook less than say 8 through 2023 2024 and 2025 certainly larger years but that s pretty typical at this point in time and so we re focused on all of those years right now and that s really our approach is kind of 5 years out really taking a proactive approach to those on note in 2024 the biggest piece of that is the u haul lease expiration and that s one where they have a purchase option in 2024 so when you back that out it s really only about 5 of abr expiring in 2024 elvis rodriguez bank of america analyst at this point to your best of your knowledge do you expect them to exercise that option jason e fox chief executive officer we do elvis rodriguez bank of america analyst right thank you very much operator thank you our next question is coming from manny korchman with citigroup please proceed with your quesiton manny korchman citigroup analyst hi good morning eveyone jason e fox chief executive officer good morning manny korchman citigroup analyst so as i went through your presentation i noticed that the percentage of income from investment grade tenants ticked down this quarter was that anything specific just mix of new acquisitions and dispositions something you ve done on purpose or is it just a stat that s maybe less relevant for what s actually happening in the portfolio jason e fox chief executive officer yes i think it s probably more of a function of the latter is that what we have been buying have not been investment grade and maybe it s important to kind of touch on that a little bit we ve talked about it in the past that we feel the sweet spot in net lease is just below investment grade there s much less capital to chase some deals and not only does that help us generate higher yields but we also get better lease structures whether that s a rent bumps the duration of the leases or really even specific lease provisions and maybe more importantly are the results while our portfolio may have a lower percentage of investment grade abr we ve outperformed all of our peers during the stress test that was the pandemic and that includes these peers with higher investment grade rated tenants or abr based so i think it s about underwriting it s about portfolio construction and i think track record matters manny korchman citigroup analyst great thank you and then just going to dispositions for a second you sold the portfolio of hellweg stores was that just a tenant concentration issue was it just opportunity to sell or can you give us some color on why you sold this jason e fox chief executive officer sure yes we exited 7 hellweg stores in the quarter it s really an opportunistic sale there s an aspect of managing diversification as well there but we created a lot of value when we extended that portfolio a few years ago it s going to the lease there so this is a pretty targeted opportunity to reduce some of the weakest stores in the portfolio with good execution but we wouldn t expect to see more of those in the hellweg assets manny korchman citigroup analyst and then jason just on the construction loan for another second was that something you guys were actively in the market looking forward to lend on a project like that and are you looking at other deals like that or maybe just give us a little bit of back story as how you ended up investing in there to begin with jason e fox chief executive officer yes we re doing this transaction with a really trusted partner of ours so we ve probably done i don t know 4 5 construction projects with a lot of downside protection structured in which is consistent with how we look at the world and perhaps some upside with especially in this case with the potential to exercise purchase options to own it yes i would actually say it s a new a new vertical but we like the risk return profile of this investment and again we have a proven track record in partnership with our operating partners so we ll see if there s more to come but it s a meaningful size of capital put to work and we like finding ways to do that manny korchman citigroup analyst thanks very much jason e fox chief executive officer welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris lucas with capital one securities please proceed with your question chris lucas capital one securities analyst hi good morning everybody just kind of following up on the last question jason just maybe give some risk parameters what s the expected loan to cost on that construction loan jason e fox chief executive officer well the way this is structured is we re funding the vast majority of the capital going in with some downside protections put in place i don t want to go into all the specifics of what that is but there s really strong collateral package behind that which gives us a lot of comfort especially given the location as i mentioned earlier we think it s one of the best development parcels on the entire strip and probably one of the better ones across the country of that matter for retail it s got some of the highest foot traffic counts in the entire country at this point so we like the risk return profile especially with the structure that we have in place but for several reasons i can t get into the specifics chris lucas capital one securities analyst okay and then is it relates to just sort of the participation or equity conversion or purchase rate what is the structure of your potential ownership at the end is it a portion by converting your loan into an equity piece or is this a first right offer or something along those lines jason e fox chief executive officer no it s an option to purchase into to really 2 components some of the net lease units as well as into the full project a minority interest if that s what we prefer as well so i would say that we ll have more color and disclosure on that if that happens it is just an option but we can go into some more details down the road chris lucas capital one securities analyst and what s the general time frame for when sort of you started funding so when is the project expected to be completed and stabilized jason e fox chief executive officer it s probably a 12 to 18 month period so perhaps this time next year q3 q4 of 2022 is my expectation chris lucas capital one securities analyst okay and then toni just on the guidance bump to g a was that that cash or non cash comp that s primarily driving that bolt toni sanzone chief financial officer we re giving guidance on the cash g a expense so that s really on the cash side chris lucas capital one securities analyst and what is driving that increase toni sanzone chief financial officer we narrowed the range based on where we are in the year and the increase is driven predominantly by the portion of compensation that s tied to our results for the year given we re tracking above target chris lucas capital one securities analyst okay perfect thank you that s all i have this morning operator thank you our next question is coming from frank lee with bmo please proceed with your question frank lee bmo analyst hi good morning everyone jason you mentioned the potential benefits from higher rent bumps tied to inflation just curious if any of the benefits are factored into your current guidance or does the lag effect push us entirely to 22 jason e fox chief executive officer toni do you want to talk about the components of that toni sanzone chief financial officer yes i think if you look at kind of the same store results for this quarter there s certainly no impact from the current inflation flowing through i think jason gave the example of how that would flow through and i think we d expect it to be seen more fully a full year from now so call it the 12 months from now second quarter of next year potentially 100 basis point increase in our same store growth at the current level but we do expect kind of a gradual increase there and the curves that jason mentioned in his example of what we have baked into our guidance so you ll see a small piece of that in the back half of this year but more fully by the middle of next year frank lee bmo analyst okay thanks and then i just want to ask about cpa 18 we re coming up on the 7 year anniversary are you starting to have any conversations i just want to get a sense on how we should think about timing jason e fox chief executive officer yeah there s really nothing new to update there cpa 18 hasn t reached its liquidity timetable yet based on the guidelines in the prospectus and there s flexibility in that we ve talked about that in the past but it s really up to the independent directors and their discretion on when to consider options so other than that there s really nothing new to update frank lee bmo analyst okay thank you jason e fox chief executive officer you re welcome operator thank you at this time i m not showing any further questions i ll now hand the call back to mr sands peter sands head of investor relations great thank you for your interest in w p carey if anyone has additional questions please call investor relations directly on 212 492 1110 and that concludes today s call you may now disconnect duration 42 minutes call participants peter sands head of investor

bloomberg how exposed to chinese stocks is your portfolio the answer could be more than you think an indexing boom that s gone on for over a decade has coincided with china s emergence as the world s second biggest economy a confluence that s driven trillions of dollars into its burgeoning equity market often via passive funds these products track gauges like the msci emerging markets index where the weighting for mainland and hong kong based stocks has doubled in 10 years to about 35 or the msci asia pacific index where their shares account for over a quarter of the market value of all members in other words the passive era has put untold billions at the mercy of beijing s zeal for reform investors are now getting a reminder of just what that means a government crackdown on sectors ranging from education to technology wiped out about 1 trillion off chinese shares listed on the mainland in hong kong and the u s over the past week as losses mounted investors exited they ve pulled 4 9 billion from china focused equity etfs in 2021 the highest net outflows in the world according to data compiled by bloomberg yet to be completely insulated would mean ditching all manner of broader index vehicles and that s reopening the debate about the inclusion and weighting of chinese securities in major gauges if you re a passive investor and you want something that s a reliable rate of return something steady and unsexy to play one of the major markets in the world the risk that a portion of that portfolio goes to zero by government edict overnight it s just really risky said soren aandahl texas based founder of short selling firm blue orca capital if people that are constructing passive indexes are doing their job properly they re going to have to price the risk premium of what just happened going forward national team in fact index providers have grappled with the issue for years the risk of the xi jinping led government s heavy hand is well known yet many global investors want exposure to the world s second largest equity market and its fast growing economy so the likes of msci inc ftse russell and s p dow jones indices llc spent years gradually increasing the presence of chinese stocks in their gauges the process was fraught with delays amid concerns over things like capital controls and transparency issues which persist in a market where a national team of state backed funds still intervenes when needed spokespersons for ftse and s p declined to comment on what the latest turmoil might mean for china s presence in indexes an msci spokesperson said that it s hard to foresee the impact of the ongoing market actions as market volatility always exists the firm monitors regulatory changes that may have an impact on the accessibility of markets and investability of securities included in its indexes bloomberg lp the parent of bloomberg news competes with these firms to offer indexing and financial data advantage active at goldman sachs group inc the past week has left some clients wondering if the country s stock market has become too dangerous uninvestable has featured in many of our recent conversations with clients regarding investing in chinese stocks the bank s strategists wrote in a note meanwhile blackrock investment institute strategists have recently started to treat china s market in its own category outside of both emerging and developed markets of course to experienced emerging market investors volatility fueled by the chinese government is nothing new some fund managers point out that beijing tends to be anti cycle stepping up policy action when the macro environment appears to be improving the implication is you can avoid the worst losses if you are prepared or can move fast that hands a potential advantage to active managers famed thematic investor cathie wood is the perfect example her firm new york based ark investment management slashed its exposure to chinese tech companies before the worst of the rout what has happened in china validates the need for active management more than ever cesar perez ruiz chief investment officer at pictet wealth management in geneva said in an email stock pickers will be able to quantify the regulatory risk and be able to extract further value out of it he said by ditching the index investors can instead focus on companies often smaller where industry policies are more supportive there was evidence of that this week as traders loaded up on semiconductor and electric vehicle maker stocks such as semiconductor manufacturing international corp and byd co ride the storm for china bulls there s another way to view the recent turbulence the policies unveiled in recent weeks aim for greater access to education more competition and improved workers rights and aren t a complete surprise given the communist party s goals of better social and economic outcomes under the latest five year plan they could ultimately help strengthen the economy and lead to a stronger market which a broad passive strategy would be well placed to capture however it s clear the pace of regulatory change has caught investors off guard that will force many to take a closer look at just how exposed they might be to future shocks we believe a thoughtful and thorough re evaluation is warranted before any portfolio decisions said vivian lin thurston portfolio manager at william blair investment management especially given the meaningful implications of this development on global investments in china overall 2021

our safe harbor statement as well as in our presentation and in all the materials that we have distributed earlier today for further details concerning risks and uncertainties please refer to these documents as well as to our sec filings we are aware that it is most likely us to keep you away from your weekend therefore we try to keep the presentation short and leave time for q a as always we would like to limit the number of questions again to two in order to give everyone the chance to ask questions it would be great if we could make this work again with us today is of course rice powell our ceo and chairman of the management board rice will give you some more color around the business development and of course also with us is helen giza our chief financial officer who will give you an update on the financials and the outlook i will now hand over to rice the floor is yours rice powell chief executive officer thank you dominik welcome everyone and happy friday i don t remember the last time we did an earnings call on a friday but it s almost a weekend hang in there thank you for joining us today i ll begin on slide four we continue to deliver organic growth for the quarter despite the expected adverse covid impacts this affected the number of treatments in our dialysis business and compounds in the related downstream assets as dialysis patients are continuing to be missing in our clinics and they do not need certain of our services such as vascular access or the pharmacy and additionally if they re not in our clinics then they don t need renal drugs or dialysis products we continue to see excess mortality further accumulate in the quarter but at significantly reduced levels as we had anticipated the second quarter revenue and earnings were both adversely affected by exchange rate effects earnings development during the quarter was negatively impacted by phasing and a strong year prior base this was driven by the cares act funding that we received in the second quarter of last year as you know to cover the covid related expenses from the start of the pandemic we continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities in the quarter first patients in value based arrangements accounted for approximately 10 of our total u s patients with end stage kidney disease and we have approximately 20 000 ckd patients in value based arrangements secondly home dialysis experienced continued momentum in the second quarter with 14 8 of our treatments in the united states performed in a home setting thirdly sustainability continues to be at the heart of our strategy in order to further support our sustainability management we recently joined econsense a network of companies united in the goal of shaping the transformation to a suitable economy and society and in parallel to all of the above mentioned activities there is the fme 25 program to transform our global operating model and sustainably reduce our cost base until 2025 we are on track with this work we plan to announce details on fme 25 in the fall while we are cautious and continue to watch the delta variant and the increasing macroeconomic inflationary impacts the overall development in the second quarter and first half of the year was in line with our expectations and we are therefore confirming our guidance thinking ahead of 2021 i d like to mention the proposed medicare esrd prospective payment system rate for 2022 the proposed 1 2 increase is roughly in line with our expectations please keep in mind that this report is still in draft form the comment period is open we expect to see the final rate at some point in the month of november turning to slide five for the first half of the year we delivered over 26 million life sustaining treatments to over 345000 patients both the number of patients and treatments are down 1 from a year ago as a result of the impacts of the pandemic on our patients lives the 2 growth in our clinic network reflects our international development with the strongest growth rate coming from asia pacific where we had 6 growth in a number of clinics in the quarter turning to slide six we continue to see stable anemia as well as bone and mineral metabolism control demonstrating that our patients are receiving high quality consistent dialysis care even in light of the pandemic if you would turn to slide seven this slide compares the development of covid infections worldwide to the number of incidents we have seen in our fresenius medical care patient population the comparison highlights the vaccination efficacy among our patients as worldwide cases spiked in april the number of cases for fmc patients declined over the same period and thereafter today approximately 71 of our patients worldwide are at least partially vaccinated in the us approximately 71 of our patients as well are partially vaccinated we also know that there are somewhere between 3 to 4 of our patients that are being vaccinated outside of fmc control when that happens we verify the vaccination we look at that takes a little longer for us to get those things those numbers crunched if you will but we do believe we are somewhere in that 73 to 74 but we quote 71 because we know that to be exactly in our control while this figure is well ahead of the overall vaccination rate for adult americans it does simply reflect a higher degree of vaccine hesitancy that we typically see with our annual influenza vaccines in normal times we see about a 10 hesitancy for vaccination of just the regular current flu if you will so obviously we are working hard to try to lower this vaccine hesitancy among our patient population as it relates to covid turning to slide eight as we anticipated covid related excess mortality on a global basis continued to accumulate in the second quarter but at a significantly lower rate thank goodness the 1 489 excess deaths in the quarter were skewed to the start of the period 635 deaths occurred in april 449 in may and 406 deaths in june we are encouraged by this trend and continue to expect that we will get to a normalized excess mortality pattern in the second half of the year it is not a perfect calendar meaning that as of june 30 we will step into july and everything will be perfect it will take a little time but we are optimistic that over the course of the third quarter we ll see this come into the range that we have anticipated these are global numbers and the excess mortality in north america in the second quarter accounted for less than 25 of the international experience and i think that s significant when you stop and think about the size and scope of north america and the fact that it is a little under 25 of what we saw across the quarter while the incremental rate of excess mortality has slowed the accumulation we have experienced will continue to weigh on performance globally on a last 12 month basis excess deaths further accumulated to approximately 11 200 and then looking at it from the start of the pandemic we ve accumulated to approximately 15 000 moving on to slide nine in the second quarter we achieved revenue of eur4 3 billion reflecting 2 growth in constant currency our net income excluding special items declined by 31 on a constant currency basis as previously announced costs related to fme 25 will be treated as a special item and during the second quarter we had eur6 million in fme 25 related consulting costs at pre tax level i mentioned already that the pandemic negatively impacted our top and bottom line and we continue to face headwinds from foreign currency translation earnings growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by a high prior year base please recall that the second quarter of 2020 benefited from the recovery of covid related negative effects that we had experienced in the first quarter of last year moving to slide 10 we experienced negative exchange rate effects in all of our regions despite the challenges related to the pandemic we delivered organic growth during the second quarter driven by our international markets emea asia pacific and latin america all contributed with positive organic growth organic growth was slightly down in north america here we not only face negative impacts from covid but also lower reimbursement for calcimimetics as a consequence of them being placed in the bundle and with that i ll turn it over to helen who will give you more color on our development through the quarter helen please helen giza chief financial officer thank you rice as we moved hi everybody and i hope you re staying well as we move to slide 12 i ll pick up on the services development in the second quarter healthcare services delivered growth of 2 at constant currency overall organic growth increased despite the negative impact from the pandemic and from calcimimetics due to the organic growth in the international markets this was more than offset by negative exchange effects the adverse covid on organic growth in healthcare services amounted to approximately 240 basis points for the quarter while down year over year in the us we did see sequential improvement in same market treatment growth it improved from a decline of from the first quarter to a decline of 2 this quarter this shows that the underlying fundamentals are intact i will now move to the products business slide on slide 13 our products business achieved 1 organic growth for the second quarter on a regional basis both emea and asia pacific had a solid quarter with each delivering 3 organic growth overall products growth in the second quarter was driven by higher sales of in center disposables in emea and asia pacific machines for chronic treatment and renal pharmaceuticals this positive development was offset mainly by negative exchange rate effects the organic decline in north america was driven in particular by lower sales of products for acute care treatments compared to a strong prior year base turning to slide 14 for the second quarter total group operating income amounted to eur424 million which is a decline of 30 at constant currency the chart on the left illustrates the contribution from each region as well as the corresponding regional margins as we have discussed we faced an adverse impact from covid and we are comparing the q2 margins against an inflated prior year base in the second quarter of last year we did recover the negative impact from covid that we experienced in the first quarter of last year consequently as indicated a tough base to compare with additionally we had a favorability in the phasing of our sg a expenses in the first quarter of this year that we knew would reverse in the second quarter exchange rate effects were a headwind in all regions but also particularly strong in our largest region north america and we experienced increased costs due to macroeconomic inflationary effects affecting both labor and raw materials on the positive side we saw an improved payer mix due to the growth in medicare advantage and medicare advantage continued its growth at the usual intra year pace in the second quarter and remains like in the last years our fastest growing book of business our medicare advantage mix now represents a percentage in the very high 20s relative to our entire us patient population and not just within the medicare eligible patients our second quarter net income excluding special items declined by 31 on a constant currency basis which includes a negative net covid 19 impact of eur74 million i will now move on to slide 15 although the big swing between q1 and q2 was expected we thought it might be helpful to look at the margin developments for the first half of the year overall i think the half one margin development gives a clearer view on where we are in this pandemic year the biggest impact on margins for the first six months of the year relates to covid not surprisingly the effects of excess mortality on both our core dialysis and downstream businesses are a large component of the covid 19 impact it is important to remember that the effect of accumulated excess mortality since the beginning of the pandemic will continue to impact our margins in the second half of the year even if there is no further accumulation of excess mortality assumed we also faced higher costs for both labor and raw materials due to macroeconomic inflationary effects and this is something we continue to monitor and we assume will not ease in the second half of the year in 2020 the first half benefited from the gains we made from the sale of vascular and cardiovascular clinics consequently this effect had a negative impact for the comparison of the margins year over year but would not impact the development of h2 as previously mentioned from the positive side for the first half of 2021 the improved medicare advantage payer mix in the us contributed to the margin development looking at the first six months of 2021 collectively our development is very much in line with our h1 expectations and in the middle of our guidance range for that reason we are comfortable confirming our outlook for the year with that turning to slide 16 during the second quarter we generated operating cash flows of eur921 million and a resulting margin of 21 3 the decline was mainly due to the us federal government payments in the second quarter last year under the cares act and the start of the recruitment of these advanced payments in the second quarter of this year eur159 million were recouped during the quarter the timing of the payments of labor expenses also contributed to the lower level of cash flow our net leverage ratio for the second quarter of 3 1 times is within our target range of three to 3 5 times earlier this year we signed our first sustainability linked financing instruments further underlining our commitments to create value in ecological social and economic terms the eur2 billion syndicated revolving credit facility includes a component that links its margin development to sustainability performance the ratings presented at the bottom right will be reconfirmed early in 2021 and support our solid financial position with that we ll turn to slide 17 in light of the effects of covid the first six months of the year developed in line with our expectations our full year assumptions continue to hold and we are confirming our 2021 targets as defined in february for 2021 we expect to deliver low to mid single digit revenue growth and a decline in net income of high teens to mid 20s our guidance assumes a normalization of excess mortality patterns beginning in the second half of the year and as rice noted it may not be zero as of july 1 but we are certainly heading in the right direction at the end of the second quarter we are exactly where we plan to be relative to our guidance and while we are very encouraged by the vaccination progress among our patient base we are closely watching to see how the delta variant develops in several markets particularly where vaccination rates are lower it is too early to say whether this will lead to accumulation of further excess mortality or not but we are cautiously optimistic we are also monitoring the increasing macroeconomic inflationary impacts which affect both labor costs manufacturing and distribution costs so in summary from what we know right now we are on track with our guidance and that concludes my prepared remarks and i will turn it over to dominik to begin the q a dominik heger head of investor relations strategic development and communications executive vice president thank you rice thank you helen for your presentation i ll hand it over to emma please open the q a questions and answers operator thank you the first question comes from the line of tom jones with berenberg please go ahead tom jones berenberg analyst hi good afternoon or good morning thanks for taking my questions i have two the first probably one for helen was just on slide 15 some clarification the 120 basis points or percentage point sorry 120 basis points or it s friday afternoon hit to margins that you saw in h1 from higher costs for labor and supplies just to be clear was any of that covid related or is it all of the covid related cost item included in the 230 basis point headwind that you talked of and then secondly a question for rice on the es the pps proposal not so much about the rates but about all the other stuff that was buried in there what should we make of some of the changes or proposed changes to the etc models i mean some of them look helpful but they don t appear to have addressed some of the key floors in that program so i m just wondering kind of what you thought about the proposals and what else you think you might be able to get done between the proposed rule and the final rule rice powell chief executive officer hey tom it s rice helen why don t you go ahead i think tom was looking for you to give some guidance on your slide 15 helen giza chief financial officer yeah yeah happy to hi tom hope you re well so to avoid confusion that is completely separate to any covid related increase that is truly the 120 basis points that you see is truly limited to wage inflation that we estimate around 3 for that and other increases that we are seeing kind of across the business that is contemplated in the guidance i think the watch out for us on inflation is truly these increases that we re seeing and we re calling the macroeconomic more kind of petrochemical lumber things like that that have an impact on our manufacturing costs and freight and distribution but the 120 basis points that you see here is in our guidance and normal inflation rates and separate to covid tom jones berenberg analyst okay perfect that s very clear and then on the eps rice powell chief executive officer yeah hey tom i would say we ve got work to do we are working on our commentary i m guessing because we ve known each other a long time you re poking a little bit at the epc models and what are they looking at when they say dual eligible to be preferred within home and transplant we actually think that s sort of arbitrary and i think you ve got the cmmi folks looking at that versus the group of people that do the prospective payment work they are two separate groups and some of it s not logical i mean if you think about dual eligible are they really in the best place to do home therapy given their station in life etc and is that really going to give them the best chance for good outcomes so i think there s just socioeconomic questions we have about the way that reads and it doesn t really make sense so we re still working on it we do get the sense that there hasn t been a lot of coordination with between this branch cmmi and what they re proposing versus where the prospective payment system is and how they look at these things so we re hoping to connect those dots in our commentary and get a better read on this tom jones berenberg analyst okay that s very helpful on the subject of models the ckcc model anything additional you can share with us on that since the q1 results rice powell chief executive officer yeah the only thing and i m happy to share that in the couple of conversations that we ve had with liz filer in the spring they are absolutely committed that we will start january 1 and they re bullish on getting that started and seeing where it goes so we are taking it at face value and we ll be prepared and ready to go as you know we have infrastructure and everything we need so we re looking forward to getting started to that in the new year tom jones berenberg analyst okay that s great i ll get back in the queue rice powell chief executive officer thanks tom operator the next question comes from the line of veronika dubajova with goldman sachs please go ahead veronika dubajova goldman sachs analyst good morning helen and rice thanks for taking my question i ll keep it to two as well please one i just want to clarify a little bit the raw material commentary or cost inflation commentary helen and i guess just a follow on on tom s question just confirm the 120 basis points that you saw in the second quarter is not outside of the usual bound that you would have expected to experience in the business and i guess maybe if you re willing to comment on what is assumed for the second half within the guide that would be helpful just to push you a little bit more on that and my second question is trying to follow on from something that was actually set on your parent company conference call which is i think stefan made some comments on the expected contribution from fmc to the fresenius cost savings plan and just backing out from the comments that he had made it does suggest a fairly low run rate of cost savings from fmc in 2023 i think on my math i get to about 100 million out of the up to 0 5 billion that you re targeting just trying to understand whether we should be reading something into that as you guys have done more work on sme 25 is this program really that heavily weighted toward 2024 and 2025 or are we not comparing apples and oranges here thanks guys rice powell chief executive officer thanks veronika go ahead helen i think you ve got one and i ll take two helen giza chief financial officer yeah hi veronika yeah so just to kind of keep clarifying maybe this raw material commentary what we saw in the half one is in line with our expectations and the inflationary increases that we had built into our guidance range you can expect that to continue through half two i think the watch out for us as i said is if there s anything significant over and above that that we re not seeing coming at this point some things have gone up and back down some things are still running higher but i would say the call out year over year is not unusual from an inflationary increase but obviously as we look at the current labor market and also these broader economic increases that are being driven by supply and demand we re just watching it out and being cautious but nothing that would take us of our guidance at this point veronika veronika dubajova goldman sachs analyst thanks helen rice powell chief executive officer veronika number two i would not read too much into that and what i mean by this is we are not done with our work and this program is not just cost cutting it s operational model and looking at the business and how do we want to go forward with the business and as we ve talked with fsc about this they would certainly like more concrete numbers and i m not giving them to them because we are not where we want to be right now so i would just say i understand where they are but i would tell you when we come to you in the fall you ll understand where we are where we re going and how this is going to play out but just keep in mind it s not a set cost cut and so i wouldn t run numbers and try to figure out where it is because we re going to tell you where it is when we do this in the fall if you catch my drift veronika dubajova goldman sachs analyst understood that s very clear thank you guys and hope you have a good rest of the summer rice powell chief executive officer thanks veronika operator the next question comes from the line of oliver metzger with commerzbank please go ahead oliver metzger commerzbank analyst hi thanks for taking my questions the first one is on your reported vaccination level of 71 so you made some comments but for me at first glance it looks not that high particularly if you look for the age record so but it s on a global level and i think there are clearly some differences from a regional perspective so could you give us an idea of where you are in particular in the us and in emea and yes that s the first question the second one is also on the slide there are some metrics basically patients are down year on year treatments are down you reported some home dialysis on a record level but still i see the number of clinics is up by 2 so is there anything which i do miss or should i just read stronger utilization from the clinic can you give us more color on the relation between these metrics thank you very much rice powell chief executive officer sure oliver i ll take those so at a global vaccination rate of 71 find me somebody doing better because i don t think they are and keep in mind that s a global rate so that incorporates places like south africa where there s very little going on or indonesia vietnam so i feel very good about where we are at 71 and in the midst of as i said in my commentary a significant hesitancy in certain parts of the us as well as in other markets that people are not getting vaccinated i think we ll see that reduce i think it will get better when these vaccines are fda approved i think that will give some subset of this hesitancy population comfort that they re going to go ahead and vaccinate and i suspect there are going to be some no matter what we do we won t get them there but the us is at 71 a little bit higher if you take those that are not in our system so they re probably 72 to 73 and i think if you look at emea they are in the high 60s even incorporating those emerging markets where the vaccination rates are very slow or very low which tells you then in many many parts of europe they re seeing just as good a vaccination rates as we saw in the us so i actually think we re not doing as well as i d like to don t get me wrong oliver but i think we re doing pretty well but it could be better and we re working hard on that on the number of clinics up 2 that was predominantly driven by asia pacific in the quarter they were up about 6 in their number of clinics we had some new clinics in every region as you well know some of these are have been we ve been building and getting them certified and validated over an 18 month period and some of those started a while ago and they re just now coming on board with the bulk of that 2 growth that we saw really sits in asia pacific in the international markets oliver metzger commerzbank analyst okay great may i quickly ask one follow up on home dialysis record level so could you share with us which part comes from pd which part comes from hhd rice powell chief executive officer sure i don t know the specific numbers but what i will tell you is pd is consistently growing in the mid to high single digit single numbers and then we are still seeing double digit growth on the home hemo and again we had 14 8 of our treatments done at home in the quarter but we are seeing pd fairly consistently of quarter to quarter and then the hhd has grown faster in some quarters it s slow sometimes but in this case i think we re pretty comfortable with what we re seeing oliver metzger commerzbank analyst okay great thank you very much rice powell chief executive officer thank you oliver operator the next question comes from the line of michael jungling with morgan stanley please go ahead michael jungling morgan stanley analyst thank you and good afternoon i have two questions on vaccinations firstly can you comment where you think the vaccination number will end up by the end of this year and then secondly can you comment on how effective or whether you know how effective the vaccinations are within your esrd patient population and in essence i know it s a morbid topic but do you have a sense of what the survival rate is of patients who get covid but have been vaccinated rice powell chief executive officer sure michael good questions well wow for me to speculate on where we could end up i would hope that it would be a great outcome if we were at a 90 vaccination rate which would mean it basically is equaling what we normally see when we do the annual as i call it regular influenza vaccinations that usually runs around 10 hesitancy so i would love to see us get another 15 out of this i think that we will get some pickup as i said when they get fda approved i think that will make a difference in the us i think we re going to continue to see the rates improve in the rest of the world short of some of the parts of the world that are emerging that we just can t get them vaccines so i do hope that we get better and then relative to the effectiveness we ve actually done study within fmc it s not a huge study but even with the challenged health status of our dialysis patients we do see that they are getting they re getting protection that we are seeing effectiveness of the vaccines now i think what is really the question that i have in my mind and we re talking about it with the medical office is if you take the delta variant which we re all watching and everything we read tells us for not vaccinated people it is 3x more viral than the others which is very concerning but in the few cases that we are aware of dialysis patients that have been vaccinated twice and they had a breakthrough and the delta variant is an issue for them generally they have not had nearly the severity of symptom with that so that s a very small sample size michael but so i would tell you the real magic here is we just got to keep getting the folks vaccinated and hope that we re going to be able to withstand what if anything comes in the delta variant but that s the way we see it at this point in time michael jungling morgan stanley analyst and maybe i can briefly follow up on this vaccination maybe i can ask it the other way how many do you know what proportion of your patients have actually had covid covid 19 rice powell chief executive officer yes i probably can get that data i don t have it at my fingertips and i don t know if anybody from the medical office on the call wants to shoot me a text i ll come back to you i don t know that right now but we can easily get that number it s just not my fingertips michael michael jungling morgan stanley analyst okay thank you rice powell chief executive officer you bet thank you operator the next question comes from the line of james vane tempest with jefferies please go ahead mr vane tempest your line is currently muted we move on to the next question from the line of david adlington with jpmorgan please go ahead david adlington jpmorgan analyst hi thanks for taking my questions two please so first sorry to revisit again on the vaccination side is there anything else you can do to try and accelerate the uptake is it just education or just some stronger levers you could pull and if it remains at about 25 to sort of 30 unvaccinated rate are you running any math in terms of what that might mean in terms of the evolution of patient mortality from here and then the second one is just on the cost evolution i m just wondering how sympathetic your customers payers are so your customers on the product side and the wider payers on the service side how sympathetic are they to any sort of price increases from your side rice powell chief executive officer thanks david yes helen i ll take one and two i ll let you take three if you would please so relative to vaccination uptake efforts we have particularly well globally but certainly in the us we have done a number of things to try to encourage people to vaccinate educational things videos where myself and other people have actually been vaccinated in talking about the importance of that it s a little bit of this situation david that it s overly politicized in the us so we re going to continue to work hard on trying to continue to see the number go up at 75 we have not tried to model at this point what that could mean for mortality because particularly it s just something that we re going to need a little more time to try to sort our way through and quite honestly i m a lot more focused on let s see if we can get 75 to 90 which i had said earlier but those are mathematics that we can run and will consider we just haven t done it at this point and then helen do you want to talk about products and payers and how they feel about where we are helen giza chief financial officer yes for sure as you can appreciate david a lot of our pricing is already contracted and the kind of the burden of the increased covid cost is obviously falling on us there s not a lot of opportunity to pass this on or get increases obviously last year a lot of those increases were covered from the us government this year obviously we are bearing that cost some of that you hope will show up in future cost reports and go into the future increases but where we have contracts with our customers it s been quite challenging and difficult i would say to pass on any of that cost increase david adlington jpmorgan analyst understood thanks rice operator the next question comes from the line of falko friedrichs with deutsche bank please go ahead falko friedrichs deutsche bank analyst thank you good afternoon and two questions please the first one going back to fme 25 rice could you update us on the time lines on when we will get the final details is that still with q3 results or do you plan to do a capital markets day around it any sort of time line here would be helpful and given that you mentioned you re sort of still working through everything how focused should the market really be on this eur500 million net income savings number and how sure are you that it will actually be the eur500 million or could there be some variation depending on what you will sign over the next few months and then my second question is on value based care thanks very much for providing the patient numbers in your prepared remarks is there any way you can also provide a very rough revenue number of revenue that is coming out of value based care and settings and even if it s just a range or a ballpark figure rice powell chief executive officer hey falko thank you for the questions i will take number one i think that s kind of an a and b part on the timeline and the focus on the savings numbers and then helen if you want to pick up the value based care that would be great so i would do it this way i would say fall to me is october november and i think you can think about if we did a capital markets day we probably would try to do it sometime in the middle of october and then obviously we ve got the earnings call i think on november 2 so it s a fairly small window within that time frame and i think we ve just got to work our way through where we think it makes most sense and how we want to do that so it s a pretty short window so figure october to november and i laid out those possibilities for you look we are focused on the eur500 million we re going at this looking at that and wanting as i said and as we ve talked about a one for one payback on that over the period of the planning period if you will so we re looking at it from that perspective we re not we didn t tell you eur500 million and hope be happy we re going to get eur100 million that would be a disaster so we re going at this as hard as we can looking to deliver what we ve talked about and if we can do more we will but that s the way we re approaching this and helen on the value based care helen giza chief financial officer yes happy to hi falko so as you know obviously we stopped reporting the care coordination number separately because we feel the business is changing and we re moving more into bbc and more toward the capitated model that it doesn t make sense to kind of keep that separate it s a very much a key part of our dialysis services business i don t i also don t think that reporting the revenue number is really that meaningful because all the different models have the contracts have different models and some have pass through of costs some of the shared savings models do not so i think for us we are as we re looking at the operating model work outlined with fme25 we re also looking hard at what that means for our reporting and what kpis will make sense for bbc moving forward so i think more to come but recognizing that we re really going through this big change as this bbc part of our business continues to grow so i think we ll have more updates as we move on our reporting falko friedrichs deutsche bank analyst okay thank you operator the next question comes from the line of james vane tempest with jefferies please go ahead james vane tempest jefferies analyst taking my question apologies i had some technical difficulties before so apologies if these have been answered just firstly on inflation it s interesting on slide 15 i think it was how the impact from was more than the offsetting factors for medicare advantage and you do mention how inflection is going to continue in the second half so is it fair to say that the medicare advantage for the year will not be able to offset inflationary pressures and then my second question on machinations i think you said 71 just wondering if you can comment on your patient population in areas which have lower vaccination rates compared to the national average and then a final quick question if i can is excess mortality i think you said it was 406 in june i know we re nearly at the end of july but i m just wondering what where we are at the moment is it sort of 350 ish or so or sub 300 it would be interesting to know where we are coming into the summer thank you so much rice powell chief executive officer thanks james no worries about not getting the difficulties our way of life these days helen i ll let you take number one on the inflation in the slide 15 and i ll come back around on vaccination helen giza chief financial officer yeah happy to hi james it s good to hear you the inflation obviously when we put out the guidance back in february if you recall i had a slide there that showed a lot of pluses and minuses and obviously that s what we re tracking without doubt the kind of the inflationary increases year over year were built in and i think it is an important driver of the change from 2020 to 2021 that we shouldn t forget and of course the medicare advantage is a kind of a positive offset to that so i don t think anything untoward or we want truly were trying to signal anything concerning in slide 15 in fact it was trying to prove to be more trying to show to be more helpful to kind of understand those increases but i think obviously as i you may have missed my comments earlier to probably both tom and veronika that the we just want to be cautious and watch those inflationary increases in the back half but we have a base increase built in already and of course we are happy with the medicare advantage performance as an offset to that too rice rice powell chief executive officer yes thank you so james i m not sure i understood what you were asking me relative to vaccinations what we re seeing versus other parts of the world can you just run that by me again i just want to make sure i get it right james vane tempest jefferies analyst yeah sure so when you look at where your patients are located say particularly in the us i m just wondering where the concentration of your patients lie versus where you ve seen higher or lower levels of vaccination so for example you have more patients in less vaccinated areas than the national average which would basically be it might be harder to get to that 90 level if there s sort of more and perhaps if you can take that in national as well thank you rice powell chief executive officer perfect thank you that s helpful so if we deal with the 800 pound gorilla which is the us i can tell you that the issue that we are seeing is in the southern states mississippi alabama louisiana arkansas missouri that is where we are finding the most hesitancy among those people and so if we re going to appreciably get close to 90 we re going to have to get some of the folks that are in that southeastern us region there are some far out west montana wyoming idaho but we re going to have to see some number of those folks when these get fda approval come into the program if you will and i suspect there will be some that won t just based on political whatever you want to call it ignorance whatever i think when you look in the rest of world there is no question that if you take emea we ve got to continue to get more vaccination in developed markets and what i d say kind of some of the medium emerging markets but there are some places that we don t like it but we don t know that it s going to get appreciably better such as south africa or if you think about india or vietnam indonesia so we have to get as much as we can from those places that are vaccinating and they have the ability we have tried to get vaccines into south africa and some of these other countries and we re working on it but it s not an easy thing to do and then on your last question i would tell you that we don t have a read if we were at 406 in june what will be july i hope the heck it s well south of there but we ll get a view of those numbers probably around the mid to latter part of august it takes us somewhere between two weeks to three weeks when we close the month to be able to get those numbers so we re just not in the right place to do that just yet james vane tempest jefferies analyst okay thanks so much rice powell chief executive officer you bet operator the next question comes from the line of christoph gretler with credit suisse please go ahead christoph gretler credit suisse analyst thank you operator good afternoon or morning we are following nice to speak i still have one question actually not kind of enough it s on wage inflation in the us specifically when i listen to some of the us hospitals now they called out quite some substantial increase in wage inflation they expect and the year the pps rate looks a bit backward looking in this respect kind enough what s your thoughts about that and how kind of how much room do you have to accommodate more wage inflation accelerating wage inflation is there any discussion going on in d c maybe kind enough to give something extra for this year which still seems to be kind of a very high inflation year specifically maybe if you could elaborate on that and not just on general kind of on the labor market situation for dialysis clinic personnel maybe that would be great thank you rice powell chief executive officer sure happy to chris nice to hear from you so a couple of things i would say we are looking and we have planned for wage inflation in this year at around 3 so i think we have some of that covered i do think that the esrd population and if you will our clinic staff or nurses i m not sure we are a perfect equivalent to what you re seeing in the big hospital systems in the us i actually think they may be experiencing things a little different than we are their rates may be a little higher but we believe that we have planned accordingly for this what we have done is as we were in the pandemic we utilized temporary health to help us get through spots because we ve had some employees that had to go out they were all as well so i think we ve gotten through that ok what i would say to you is yes at a 1 2 pps drafted number i would have loved to have seen it higher it was within the range that we thought it could be i think there are two pieces to the answer to your question one is that there s still eur24 billion in provider relief funds that are sitting in d c on access and to the degree that those funds would be available for us relative to ppe and potentially some labor help there that s out there we continue to talk about that but d c is pretty focused right now on infrastructure but we continue to see if there s a possibility for that and i think that the overall labor situation in the us particularly in healthcare i think that s going to get discussed in d c as well and we would certainly weigh in on that but i think i m less worried about where we are for the back half of the year and how we plan that it would certainly be nice to get some ppe help as i ve been a broken record on that every quarter but at this point we ve not had any more active detailed conversations on that hopefully that s helpful for you christoph gretler credit suisse analyst yes very good thank you appreciate the comment and have a great weekend later on rice powell chief executive officer you as well operator there are no further questions at this time so i hand back to dominik for closing comments dominik heger head of investor relations strategic development and communications executive vice president thank you emma thank you everyone for the

devin and hello everyone we have a lot of good things to discuss today we started fiscal 2022 on an exciting note with the closing of dorner the largest acquisition in the company s history our blueprint for growth 2 0 strategy has clearly defined our path forward and the columbus mckinnon business system or cmbs as we refer to it is driving our execution we delivered 24 organic growth in the quarter with record adjusted gross margin and we ended the quarter with record backlog as all of our markets are demonstrating strong demand we acquired dorner on april 7 and its performance in the quarter exceeded our expectations dorner adds precision conveying systems expanding our intelligent motion solutions for material handling additionally it serves markets with secular trends that are demonstrating strength such as e commerce food processing and life sciences we had sales of about 213 million in the quarter including 34 million from dorner lifting revenue which represents our organic or legacy business was 179 million and we are trending toward our pre pandemic quarterly sales levels of around 200 million to 210 million we are optimistic about current trends customer demand and our market position demand came from all markets but was especially encouraging in the heavy industrial offshore oil and gas production e commerce and entertainment markets we believe that we are gaining ground as these markets recover with our recently launched products including our integrated crane kits utility lever hoist aquaguard and edge roller technology conveyors as well as the expansion of our compass cpq tool i should note that our sales performance in the quarter would have been approximately 5 million to 10 million better had it not been for challenges within the supply chain and labor shortages it s been a constant battle to match available components such as motors and electrical components with production schedules to produce complete orders and service our ongoing demand this has required us to juggle resources balance loads and manage our production lines with a high degree of agility fortunately we re making progress with our recruiting efforts and we are systematically building select inventory and committed supplier capacity to buffer further impacts in the supply chain despite these challenges our first quarter margins improved nicely dorner s accretive margin profile elevated gross margins by 80 basis points to a record adjusted gross margin of 36 3 adjusted operating margin was 11 1 a full point higher than the trailing fourth quarter adjusted ebitda margin expanded 210 basis points to 16 compared with the fourth quarter we have many initiatives underway to drive our 2 0 strategy and deliver outsized growth to ensure that we execute successfully we are enhancing cmbs establishing enterprisewide standards and discipline for processes accountability and scalability turning to slide 4 i m pleased to report that we published our inaugural corporate social responsibility report in june this was an extensive enterprise initiative that prioritized the material factors that were most relevant to both our business and our stakeholders we organized our report in compliance with gri core standards and align our priorities with the relevant un sustainable development goals we have established metrics around several key factors such as employee health and safety training and leadership development and diversity and inclusion we have also identified environmental sustainability targets around energy consumption emissions and waste reduction we ve established green teams at each global operation and are encouraged with the level of engagement within the organization these initiatives and metrics are integrated into our business at every level you can see our priorities by category on this slide and i hope you take the time to review our report which can be found on the homepage of our website turning to slide five we announced earlier this week the launch of intelli connect mobile plus which further advances our intelli product offerings with even greater intelligence and information management for our customers intelli connect mobile plus provides an intelligent solution that targets the secular drivers of automation digitization and the internet of things a direct secured wifi

of our intelligent products for lifting also apply to conveying we are sharing our technology talents and skills across the organization to identify further opportunities to create compelling offerings for our customers looking more broadly new products introduced by columbus mckinnon with in the last three years or our n 3 revenue for the quarter grew 19 year over year with that i ll hand it over to greg greg gregory p rustowicz vice president of finance treasurer and chief financial officer thank you david good morning everyone on slide six net sales in the first quarter were 213 5 million up 53 5 from a year ago which was the quarter most heavily impacted by the pandemic this sales level was near the midpoint of our guidance for first quarter revenue of approximately 212 million to 217 million while we continue to see demand improve sequentially like many other industrial companies we experienced supply chain delays which impacted revenue levels in the quarter this was also the first quarter that the dorner acquisition is included in our results as david mentioned dorner exceeded our expectations delivering over 34 million of revenue in a truncated quarter given that we closed the acquisition on april 7 looking at our sales bridge sales volume was up 31 million or 22 5 we also realized positive pricing as we saw year over year pricing improved by 1 4 foreign currency remains a tailwind and increased sales by 5 or 6 9 million let me provide a little color on sales by region for the first quarter we saw sales volume increase in the u s by nearly 28 we realized 90 basis points of pricing as a reminder we have not yet benefited from the second price increase that we announced the last week of june as many of our shipments in the quarter were sitting in backlog at the start of the quarter outside of the u s sales volume was up approximately 16 and pricing was up 2 by region sales volume was up 51 in canada up 39 in latin america up 12 in emea and up 7 in apac we are monitoring inflationary pressures globally and have announced additional price increases in the u s and canada effective in august in addition we are looking at additional surcharges in europe later in the quarter on slide seven we saw our gross margin improved sequentially to 34 7 which compares with 34 4 in the fiscal fourth quarter we achieved a record adjusted gross margin of 36 3 this quarter we incurred 3 million of inventory step up expense and 500 000 of acquisition deal and integration costs that hit cost of sales as part of purchase accounting we value dorner assets and liabilities at fair market value the 3 million of inventory step up expense represents the difference between the fair market value of dorner s inventory and the actual inventoriable cost this amount is then expensed based on inventory turns which was all recognized in our first quarter and won t impact future quarters overall dorner was 80 basis points accretive to adjusted gross margin this quarter in addition to dorner adjusted gross margins reflected the operating leverage from higher sales volumes which led to favorable year over year productivity in our factories this was partially offset by the negative impact of supply chain challenges we are still benefiting from our 80 20 process which contributed approximately 1 3 million incremental year over year gross profit expansion in the quarter largely from factory closure savings we are focused on product line simplification this year and are making good progress with sku and component reductions unfortunately this part of the 80 20 process takes longer to realize benefits but will pay dividends over a longer horizon let s now review the quarter s gross profit bridge first quarter gross profit of 74 1 million was up 29 3 million compared with the prior year this was driven by several factors first dorner contributed 14 million of gross profit sales volume added 11 6 million of gross profit compared to a year ago we also saw positive productivity net of other cost changes of 2 9 million despite some supply chain challenges that i referenced foreign currency translation added 2 4 million to gross profit pricing net of raw material inflation was positive 700 000 which was offset by higher tariffs on products coming from china of 1 million in the prior year quarter we had factory closure and business realignment costs which did not repeat this quarter we incurred 500 000 of acquisition integration costs and inventory step up expense of 3 million and as i previously mentioned the inventory step up expense will not reoccur in the future as shown on slide 8 our sg a costs were 57 2 million in the quarter or 26 8 of sales included in this total were 8 7 million of dorner acquisition related costs and 600 000 of business realignment costs which we have included as pro forma items in our adjusted operating income adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps calculations excluding these onetime costs our sg a costs would have been 47 9 million or 22 4 of sales i would point out that this number also has an incremental 5 9 million of our sg a costs from the dorner acquisition this means that legacy columbus mckinnon incurred 42 million of our sg a costs which was comparable to 42 3 million recorded in q4 excluding acquisition deal costs and business realignment costs incurred q4 for the fiscal second quarter we are increasing our q2 estimate for rsg a to 52 million which includes the full impact of the dorner acquisition this includes additional investments and strategic growth initiatives as well as higher variable selling costs which reflect a higher level of sales in q2 compared to q1 turning to slide nine adjusted operating income was 23 6 million adjusted operating margin was 11 1 of sales up 750 basis points from the prior year this margin expansion is driven by the operating leverage in the business incremental pricing and the dorner acquisition at current fx rates we expect total amortization expense of 6 3 million per quarter with dorner as you can see on slide 10 we recorded a gaap loss per diluted share for the quarter of 0 27 adjusted earnings per diluted share were 0 69 which were up substantially from 0 17 per share in the prior year and up 0 09 per share sequentially i want to highlight that for this quarter and going forward we are adding back amortization expense from the income statement on a tax affected basis to our adjusted earnings per diluted share calculation in q1 this added 0 18 to adjusted earnings per diluted share all periods on this chart have been restated for this we feel that this is a better indicator of the true cash earnings performance of the company as we intend to be programmatic with our m a strategy on a gaap basis we recorded the cost of debt refinancing this quarter of 14 8 million and acquisition deal and integration costs of 9 2 million we also had the inventory step up expense that i previously discussed with the new financing that we completed in may we expect interest expense of approximately 4 7 million in the second quarter and our diluted shares outstanding are anticipated average 29 million shares in the second quarter as well our tax rate on a gaap basis is expected to be in the range of 21 to 23 and we will continue to use 22 as our tax rate for non gaap adjusted earnings per share on slide 11 our adjusted ebitda margin continues to increase and was 13 7 on a trailing 12 month basis in the first quarter with dorner adjusted ebitda margin was 16 dorner was accretive to our adjusted ebitda margin by 190 basis points our return on invested capital also continues to improve and was 7 8 in q1 which slightly exceeded our current wacc we continue to target a 19 ebitda margin and expect our roic to be double digits in fy 23 excluding the impact of future acquisitions we remain highly confident that our strategy will enable us to drive profitable growth and achieve these objectives moving to slide 12 we used 11 million of free cash flow this quarter which included a cash outflow of 10 9 million related to acquisition deal costs which were paid in the quarter as sales have increased we have also increased our working capital investment by approximately 26 million which included additional investments in inventory to meet rising demand our working capital as a percent of sales was 12 5 of sales which was in line with what we were expecting capex was 3 6 million in the quarter we expect capex of 20 million to 25 million for the full year turning to slide 13 as we discussed in may we refinanced the capital structure post dorner acquisition which included a bridge loan an equity offering in a new term loan b the new 450 million term loan b carries an interest rate of libor plus 275 basis points with a 50 basis point libor floor this gives us a low cost flexible capital structure that will serve us well for the coming years as of june 30 on a pro forma basis which includes dorner s june ltm adjusted ebitda but excludes expected cost synergies our net leverage ratio was approximately 3 0 times we expect to hit our target leverage ratio of 2 times within two years excluding any additional acquisitions finally our liquidity which includes our cash on hand and revolver availability remained strong and was approximately 170 million at the end of june please advance the slide 14 and i will turn it back over to david david j wilson resident chief executive officer and director terrific thanks greg as we mentioned we ve had strong demand across all of our markets and columbus mckinnon s book to bill ratio was a solid 1 17 in the quarter dorner contributed 36 million in orders and had backlog of 40 5 million at the end of the quarter lifting solutions had 2 4 sequential growth in the quarter driven by 5 growth in our short cycle business while the project business which tends to be lumpy was flat compared with the trailing fourth quarter this sequential organic growth is our first quarter in our first quarter is noteworthy given the typical seasonality of our business our fiscal fourth quarter tends to be boosted by the combination of orders being placed ahead of price increases promotional sales and the availability of new customer budgets this quarter s increase bucks this historical trend and demonstrates the momentum of the economic recovery we achieved record backlog of 247 million at the end of the quarter including dorner excluding the acquisition we had a record organic backlog of 207 million we re pleased with this progress and the foundation this provides as we advance through fiscal 2022 approximately 140 million of our backlog is available to ship in the second fiscal quarter turning to slide 15 we re expecting sales to range between 225 million and 230 million for the second quarter at the midpoint of this range this is about a 7 sequential increase over the first quarter demand across all markets as i noted earlier is strong in heavy processing applications such as steel production demand for retrofit modernization and new capacity projects is strong and quote activity is gaining momentum in the pulp and paper market where equipment capacity has been heavily utilized we re now seeing requests for upgrades and repair parts offshore oil and gas projects are also coming back to life our explosion protected stall products are particularly well suited for these applications we provide unique solutions that address special lifting requirements and help to solve challenging engineering problems we also provide industrial products for drilling platforms and have seen a nice improvement in demand there we saw a resurgence in the entertainment market as many covid restrictions have been lifted opening up traveling concerts sporting events and festivals this market which was coming off of a dead standstill had the biggest resurgence for us conveying solutions had some notable q1 wins in e commerce food processing and life sciences demand for our unique conveying solution for autonomous mobile robots has grown and we see even further potential in the e commerce space we also had strong demand in food services and life sciences we won a large order from a frozen food company to provide a specialty conveying solution that automates processes increases uptime and improves product flow we were also awarded a large life science project where our precision conveyors are embedded into equipment that is used for blood analysis in fact all of dorner s markets are demonstrating strength as i mentioned while demand has been strong we continue to carefully navigate the challenges associated with the global supply chain and u s staffing shortages this is requiring a great deal of agility on everyone s part as we respond with as much flexibility as possible to meet increasing demand i m proud of how our team is rising to this set of challenges we remain highly focused on columbus mckinnon s organic growth and acquisitive development and are advancing several projects aligned with our core growth framework and acquisition pipeline with that terry we can open up the line for questions questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session the first question will be from matt summerville with d a davidson will jellison d a davidson analyst this is will jellison on for matt summerville this morning david j wilson resident chief executive officer and director hi will good morning will jellison d a davidson analyst first question is just a quick follow up on the supply chain you already spoke about could you provide a little bit more color about the way freight played into the constraints and what potentially you could do to counter those david j wilson resident chief executive officer and director yes sure so we ve seen significant cost increases associated with freight charges and we have been navigating that i think relatively successfully we ve been securing containers i guess in a more normal fashion over the last couple of months is the container position around the world has seemed to have stabilized and so that s been helpful we re also making sure that we re routing containers through the right ports to make sure that where there s congestion we re avoiding that congestion but with the freight price or cost increases as well as material cost increases in this inflationary environment we ve been working hard to make sure as we have historically to offset those costs with appropriate price increases and we feel like we ve been effective at positioning ourselves to ensure that as we go throughout the year we re able to offset the costs that we ve seen will jellison d a davidson analyst and then a quick follow up to that sticking on supply chain constraints with your recruiting efforts for new talent do you expect that your labor costs could be any meaningfully higher from things like higher wages or benefits that that new labor pool might demand david j wilson resident chief executive officer and director yes i mean obviously the labor markets have been pretty tight and we ve been working to attract and retain the best talent and we feel like we ve got a great team and we re attracting and developing great new talent within the organization to do that we ve made sure that our market our pay is market competitive we did have an annual merit increase that we implemented this year that was part of our budget planning process and part of what s factored into the way that we ve been managing and communicating about the business but the current environment is one that s challenging and we ve had to provide appropriate incentives for people to join but nothing that materially affects the compensation or labor costs within our business will jellison d a davidson analyst thanks great thank you i ll get back thank you operator the next question is from chris howe of barrington research chris howe barrington research analyst good morning david good morning greg another question on that supply chain you mentioned the 5 million to 10 million that could have been better if we excluded some of the constraints that you experienced this quarter if we think about that in the context of some of the continuing challenges in this market i would assume that that 5 million to 10 million still sits as potential revenue further down the line as this environment starts to loosen so perhaps this could lead to top line potential if we look a little bit further down the road past this pressure from david j wilson resident chief executive officer and director yes yes for sure i mean as you saw with our record backlog we ve got a substantial position in our backlog a nice position in short term as well as long term as we ve communicated the split the five to 10 that could have been better certainly we were gunning to do better than what we did we wanted to exceed that top line position we re pleased with where we ended up and we think that you re right we ve got that 5 to 10 still in the backlog ready to go and it will go as we manage through material availability and the constraints that are out there we do have a number of actions that are underway in our supply chain and with our vendors to make sure that we secure capacity for materials whether it s in actual parts or blanket order secured capacity over a period of time and we are increasing inventory in select areas to make sure that for more standard products less specific engineered to order products we have the available materials to meet the rising demand but we re encouraged with the progress that we re making although challenged like most are in this environment to make sure that we re getting materials in that we need specific for the demand that s coming in and as i indicated in my prepared remarks it s been a constant challenge to remain agile and shift resources and keep up with what has been very encouraging rising demand and greg i don t know if there s anything else you d add to that gregory p rustowicz vice president of finance treasurer and chief financial officer i would chris the 5 million to 10 million is going to ship this quarter and as we ve added inventory to the system we ve added on a cash basis 11 million more inventory that will start to alleviate some of the supply chain challenges we ve had and as we ve locked up additional capacity but having said that i think it s going to be another quarter or so while this plays itself out chris howe barrington research analyst i have many follow ups but we ll stick with one i think that points to the long term sustainability and the growth that you see in the underlying business david mentioned in some of the prepared remarks about that 19 target and the gross margin potential that you see in the business so in thinking in line with this target that points to the potential perhaps to go beyond this target as we look at the company more on a run rate basis there seems to be good margin potential there especially when considering the other initiatives that you have such as product line simplification that will flow through later down the line david j wilson resident chief executive officer and director yes exactly chris i understand completely and we have a 19 target that had been previously communicated we re obviously very focused on making sure that we achieve that and we ve committed to get there and we re communicating a level of confidence around our ability to get there we believe that the earnings potential of the business goes beyond that and we re certainly focused on taking it to that next level there are a number of opportunities within the business as it relates to continued growth opportunity as well as improved leverage on that growth so we remain encouraged and positive about where that endpoint is or that next level is i should say and i think you re thinking about the business the right way greg what would you add to that gregory p rustowicz vice president of finance treasurer and chief financial officer yes so chris if you recall the 19 ebitda margin target was based on legacy columbus mckinnon and this quarter dorner was 190 basis points accretive so as we continue to recover from a covid environment there is that potential and so the 19 with dorner is actually going to accelerate a year from what we had previously thought with the downturn with covid this year being a recovery year next year being kind of back to pre covid levels so absolutely there s upside potential to the 19 operator next question is from john tanwanteng of cjs securities john tanwanteng cjs securities analyst hi good morning it s lucas for john you guys answered most of my specific questions very detailed presentation appreciate that and congrats on the quarter i guess just one big picture question for me in terms of from a strategic standpoint are you looking at more m a or is debt pay down the immediate priority kind of how are you thinking about that in the balance sheet at the moment david j wilson resident chief executive officer and director right so we re remaining actively attentive to what s happening in the markets making sure that we re keeping our ear to the ground and staying engaged around attractive opportunities for columbus mckinnon to continue to grow through acquisition but we re also very acutely focused on ensuring that we delever and we have an expectation that we ll be able to do that rapidly and so knowing that deals take a little bit of time to develop we obviously want to make sure that we re in the mix when the right opportunities present themselves and we re going to be disciplined and thoughtful and strategic about where we invest but we do intend as it been indicated in our prepared remarks to be programmatic with the work we do to develop and grow the company gregory p rustowicz vice president of finance treasurer and chief financial officer yes luca just to add on so the pro forma net leverage ratio today is three times and that includes a full 12 months of dorner results and on a financial covenant basis which is what we report to the banks it s actually going to be below the three times so there s because i think of the equity offering that we did that basically gives us the ability to get back in the market sooner and so i wouldn t size obviously matters right from an m a perspective so i think we re well positioned today to do bolt ons without any trouble at all david j wilson resident chief executive officer and director right and i would just add one quick comment to that as i mentioned the dorner deal is going incredibly well they have a terrific management team they have the opportunity to participate they do participate in great markets and the opportunity to expand their participation in those markets and we re really encouraged by developments and potential there and so we re mindful of making sure we execute well with what we ve done and so i want to be careful to make sure that it s clear we re focused on what s right in front of us and execution but we re also maintaining our focus on executing the blueprint for growth 2 0 strategy that we ve developed which is an ambitious one operator the next question is from michael mcginn of wells fargo michael mcginn wells fargo analyst hi good morning everybody nice quarter so i wanted to switch to the cash flow last quarter we saw the step up in capex with the addition of dorner and that being a private equity run business presumably with a nice wish list of investment items is there any update on the low hanging fruit to improved doner s throughput and maybe how that ties into your overall synergy assumptions david j wilson resident chief executive officer and director yes so from a capex perspective i ll take that one we re anticipating 20 million to 25 million for columbus mckinnon and i think 3 million to 4 million with dorner and that s about close to their historical level maybe a little bit higher but in general it s what i would call an asset light business there is some cnc machining but it s mostly assembling and we have actually gotten additional space for them because their business is growing so rapidly and we re also in the process of adding to a second shift to take advantage of the what s in front of them so capex wise i think the 20 million to 25 million is a good number to use going forward and i would say that there isn t really a large capital project that they brought forward as soon as the ownership changed hands yes i mean we ve said we want to invest in growth right and there are opportunities for us to make select investments targeted investments that are appropriate in terms of size to continue to invest and scale the business and we feel that there are many synergies between the businesses that will enable growth that are outside of specific onetime capex let s say investments michael mcginn wells fargo analyst going back to one of your end markets which is food processing david one of your predecessor firms received an outside bid and food processing was highlighted as a key growth area i was wondering where columbus operates best within the food space meat poultry seafood etc and when you see bids like this in the market how does that make you think about your own company s valuation prospects david j wilson resident chief executive officer and director right well we re thrilled with the markets we ve entered with this acquisition we feel like we re playing in some very attractive and fast growing secular markets which was an objective of the acquisition and as we pivot columbus mckinnon to participate in those more attractive higher growth markets we participate in the markets you just mentioned seafood meat poultry with the products we produce bakeries yes and so we participate in those in others life science markets that are very attractive e commerce markets that are very attractive and then the general automation space more broadly so we feel like we re well positioned we feel like there is a lot of value out there for us to develop and create for columbus mckinnon and we re executing on that strategy i mentioned and feel like the runway is pretty long for us operator the next question comes from greg palm of craig hallum capital group please go ahead greg palm craig hallum capital group analyst to everybody so just following up on the i guess the revenue constraints in the quarter was that specific to the core columbus business or was dorner included in that as well as some level of constraint david j wilson resident chief executive officer and director yes i would say it s a bit of a mix obviously we have a larger business within columbus mckinnon and so on a ratio basis more of that would be skewed toward the columbus mckinnon portfolio but it s a mix and we are working collaboratively on all fronts to make sure that we re moving the constraints that exist in the current supply chain challenge greg palm craig hallum capital group analyst and you mentioned that dorner did exceed your expectations i mean is there a certain end market or application that you think is driving the outsized growth and would sort of be curious to get your sense on how autonomous robots that opportunity is sort of progressing david j wilson resident chief executive officer and director so it s a there s a story kind of within each of those end markets and as i said in my prepared remarks we re particularly encouraged by developments in the e commerce life sciences and food processing space where we receive notable wins in those orders and when we re talking to customers in that space there s a pipeline of very interesting and attractive opportunities that lie ahead and so as we continue to gain traction and build our reference installed base that obviously grows aftermarket opportunities as well and it grows the opportunity to leverage those very strong references to continue to build that part of the business with other customers that compete in those areas so we re excited and we really feel good about developments in those specific markets and that s the i guess in some the areas where they saw the most opportunity in the quarter operator the next question is a follow up from chris howe with barrington research chris howe barrington research analyst all right just wanted to sneak one in here before the call is up i had a question about dorner some of which was highlighted in your previous comments there with the question from craig as we think about the outperformance of dorner versus your expectations in the quarter and as we think about this environment it seems like the pandemic is having a slightly longer tail than we expected with the delta variance can you comment or give context around this environment should we see it continue perhaps some of these secular trends like in e commerce is deepening its penetration within this environment or is it rather taking market share in this environment that s benefiting dorner david j wilson resident chief executive officer and director it s an interesting thing to consider i would say that we are we re continuing to see strong demand and i think that the macro developments in the market associated with the pandemic have had an impact on future impacts future use of e commerce as an example and i think that we re going to see mega trends that will continue to drive a push in that direction that whether the tail is longer or is truncated i think those are here to stay and that s going to be positive for this for us we re also doing a lot of work around our npd initiatives and that s both within the core business and within dorner and we re excited about the progress that we re making relative to the new product launches and the share we re gaining with the launches that we ve put in place and so we ve been focused on innovation and on making sure that we can develop products that will compete effectively in the market and we re pleased that as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we re we ve grown 19 with our n minus three revenue in the first quarter which is inclusive of dorner greg palm craig hallum capital group analyst so i guess another way to think about it too chris is that the dorner end markets are growing 6 to 8 and dorner is well outpacing and if we go back to a year ago even though we didn t own them on a year over year basis their sales are up 50 now granted there was a they had a bit of a impact due to covid but that s very very strong growth 50 growth year over year operator the next question is a follow up from michael mcginn of wells fargo michael mcginn wells fargo analyst so i want to just add some numbers and a finer point to the gross margin conversation and the price cost so if i m looking at the deck pricing net of material cost inflation was a 700 000 benefit versus the total pricing on the top line was 2 million so the rate the flow through was 35 which is a touch below your blended gross margin is this number is that number realizing that the price increases happened later in the quarter and you haven t seen the full benefit is that conversion rate going to ramp or stay the same or decline as some costs and labor constraints begin to creep into the business david j wilson resident chief executive officer and director it s absolutely going to ramp so the 2 million of price and the price net of inflation of 700 000 implies 1 3 million of raw material inflation and as you know we typically raise prices in the u s in the core business in the march time frame so we take a lot of orders pre price increase we did have some stocking orders we talked about in the last call in the neighborhood of just under 10 million in the u s and so we had backlog in the quarter at old prices and then on top of it as i talked about in my prepared remarks we had another price increase that was implemented at the end of june and none of that is reflected in the sales in the quarter to any extent so that s and now we ve got another price increase that s effective in august so absolutely price increases are going to ramp going forward and the amount of price that we see but i would say it s going to be just given this last price increase it s really going to be the december quarter where we see the full impact because we don t for newer backlog we don t reprice it gregory p rustowicz vice president of finance treasurer and chief financial officer in october to december quarter operator and this concludes our question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to mr wilson for any closing remarks david j wilson resident chief executive officer and director great thank you very much i appreciate it carrie thank you for your time today to everyone we re pleased with our start to fiscal 2022 and we re seeing strong demand across all of our markets backlog is at record levels and we are decisively navigating the challenges associated with supply chain constraints and labor shortages margins are expanding with improving volume the addition of dorner and as we focus on achieving operational excellence through cmbs finally the dorner acquisition is exceeding expectations and we are pursuing opportunities to expand this platform further i hope you re as excited as i am about columbus mckinnon s positive momentum and the long term value creation potential that we have and i hope you all have a terrific day thank you operator duration 46 minutes call participants

from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap reconciliations of all non gaap metrics with the applicable gaap measures are provided in the appendix of this slide presentation in today s earnings press release and they are also on our website i will now turn the call over to anil for his prepared remarks anil anil singhal co founder president chief executive officer chairman of the board thank you tony good morning everyone and thank you for joining us let s begin on slide number six with a brief recap of our first quarter non gaap results we had a solid start to the fiscal year first quarter revenue increased more than three percent to 190 3 million compared with the same quarter last year strong product revenue growth in both the service assurance and cybersecurity product lines more than offset lower service revenue and drove our service our revenue increase while contributing to our strong diluted earning per share performance diluted earnings per share increased more than 17 to 0 20 compared with the same quarter last year let us move to slide seven for some further perspective as we review business insights and market rents in our service provider vertical revenue grew approximately 10 compared with the same quarter last year this growth was partially attributable to a large domestic cable operator investing in their 5g core and edge environment solutions we also benefited from an international carrier customer accepting completion of an implementation earlier than expected as we recognized revenue a quarter earlier than planned during the quarter we also received a low eight figure radio frequency propagation modeling order from a tier 1 north american carrier as they progress their 5g network planning we anticipate that we will be able to complete these projects by the end of our fiscal year within the service provider market we have started seeing some momentum around 5g network advancements globally michael will discuss some of these wins during his remarks turning to our enterprise customer vertical revenue declined approximately one percent compared with the same quarter last year low single digit revenue growth in the service assurance area was offset by a mid single digit decline in the enterprise security area primarily attributable to reduced spending from a financial institution factor compared to the same quarter in the earlier year despite the relatively flat overall enterprise and customer vertical performance in the first quarter we see opportunity in this vertical for the full fiscal year as customer accelerate cloud migration and cybersecurity investments the ability of our solutions to provide visibility and protection during a cloud transition and in hybrid or multi cloud environments give customers the control and confidence required to innovate some recently launched solutions which include smart edge monitoring and omni cyber investigator will help address the visibility and security needs our smart edge monitoring solution uses an innovative approach that combines smart data analytics and synthetic transaction testing to assist in earlier identification and rapid resolution of performance issues to protect the digital experience from anywhere this unique solution gives it teams complete visibility and insight to assure the highest quality end user experience in any network or application regardless of where employees perform their job we believe our new products will gain greater traction as our sales team resumes traveling conduct in person customer meetings and complete proof of concepts that demonstrate the value for solution in reducing mean time to resolution of issues while saving time and expense michael will highlight some of the customer wins we experienced in this vertical during the quarter in his remarks in the longer term we see potential opportunity emerging in the enterprise customer vertical for 5g utilization as the enterprises and governments look to leverage 5g technology in private networks through network slices and at the edge netscout is one of the only handful of vendors that have both service provider and enterprise knowledge in providing both scale and functionality this should serve us and our customers well as 5g advancements unfold in the future now let us move to slide number eight to review our outlook with one quarter behind us we are off to a solid start to the fiscal year as the world continues to emerge from the pandemic we remain focused on meeting our customer needs for service assurance and cybersecurity solutions that s also the connected world s toughest challenge as we advance our new service assurance and omnis cybersecurity solutions and resume normal customer interaction selling these solutions we believe sales will accelerate toward the second half of the fiscal year we also believe we will build greater momentum with our netscout without bought initiative that is focused on expanding our business with existing customers by leveraging our incumbency to access both existing and new budgets acquiring new customers through new consumption choices and expanding our reach into high value adjacencies such as expanded cybersecurity and big data analytics that can leverage our smart data we remain committed to delivering within the non gaap fiscal year 2022 outlook that was provided on our may six 2021 earnings call which calls for low single digit revenue growth and enhanced diluted earnings per share at the midpoint of our outlook jean will recap the numbers during her remarks finally i am proud to announce that we recently issued our inaugural environmental social and governance esg report which is available in the company section of our website at www netscout com while esg is a growing area of interest for a diverse set of stakeholders this principle has always been part of who we are at netscout to obtain greater insight into how we think about esg and our efforts in the area i invite you to explore this new report and join us as we strive to increase our positive impact on the world i look forward to sharing our progress with you as the fiscal number year progresses i will now turn the call over to michael for his remarks michael szabados chief operating officer thank you anil and good morning everyone slide number 10 outlines the areas that i will cover in the service provider customer vertical we continue to see some momentum on 5g globally some customers continue their planning with radio frequency propagation modeling projects while others are starting initial deployments during the quarter we won a couple of low seven figure deals in the large domestic cable operator space where they are using both our service assurance and cybersecurity solutions as they build up their 5g core data centers and protect their edge environment internationally we won a low seven figure deal with a mobile carrier in asia related to the core to ran service assurance visibility for the initial rollout of 5g we successfully won these deals due to our superior technology comprehensive solutions and incumbency despite the competitive bid process used in some of these transactions in the enterprise customer vertical we continue to gain traction with existing as well as new customers within the pharmaceutical sector we closed two low seven figure deals deals with two leading pharmaceutical manufacturers first with a long standing customer that leverages our solutions for visibility of all the network traffic releated to their manufacturing operations our proactive application visibility is trusted to ensure operations run smoothly by identifying and assisting and mitigating service disruptions this customer also deploys our cybersecurity solutions given the unwelcomed interest from bad actors due to the company s trade secrets and medical importance second a new customer purchased our service assurance solutions to replace an incumbent s product to gain superior visibility as they transition their hybrid infrastructure and advanced their digital transformation this deal was won during a highly competitive bid process both wins demonstrate the critical value of our comprehensive and powerful solution in winning deals by leveraging our incumbency and in securing new customers in terms of go to market activities we continue to focus on advancing our cyber security and public cloud brand awareness beyond marketing campaigns we are also attending leading tradeshows to showcase our brand and solutions later this month netscout will attend the virtual version of black hat of 2021 and later this year we will be attending the aws re invent conference in las vegas at the black hat event we will showcase our omni cybersecurity and arbor ddos solutions as well as host presentations addressing the threat of triple extortion being used by ransomware gangs during these events we will demonstrate our visibility and cybersecurity solution can be leveraged to detect investigate and respond to these threats and reduce mean time to resolution and cost by fostering collaboration between it and security operations teams at the aws re invent conference we will support our partnership with aws and showcase our visibility tools that can be leveraged in the cloud environment that concludes my prepared remarks i will now turn over the call to jean jean bua chief financial officer thank you michael and good morning everyone i will review key metrics for our first quarter along with our outlook as a reminder this review focuses on our non gaap results unless otherwise stated and all reconciliations to our gaap results appear in the presentation appendix regardless i will note the nature of any such comparison slide number 12 details our results for our first quarter of fiscal year 2022 revenue grew 3 5 over the same quarter in the prior fiscal year to 190 3 million product revenue grew 14 3 and service revenue declined 3 4 over the prior fiscal year s quarter the decline in service revenue increased non renewals associated with service provider consolidation and discontinued product lines our first quarter fiscal year 2022 gross profit margin was 74 2 down 0 4 percentage points over the same quarter last fiscal year as inventory associated with discontinued products was reserved quarterly operating expenses increased 2 4 from the prior fiscal year largely due to variable sales compensation and increased costs associated with our first quarter sales kick off and engage events we reported an operating profit margin of 11 4 compared with 11 2 in the same quarter last fiscal year diluted earnings per share was 0 20 up 17 6 from the same period last fiscal year turning to slide 13 i would like to review key revenue trends for the first quarter in the service provider customer vertical revenue grew 9 6 while the enterprise customer vertical declined 1 1 approximately 54 of total revenue was generated from the enterprise customer vertical with the remainder from the service provider customer vertical turning to slide 14 which shows our geographic revenue mix on a gaap basis revenue by geography continues to be domestically weighted but international revenue increased compared to the same quarter in the prior year there was no customers that represent 10 or more of revenue in the quarter slide 15 details our balance sheet highlights and free cash flow we ended the quarter with cash cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities of 493 9 million which is an increase of 17 5 million since the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 free cash flow generated in the quarter was 21 5 million we currently have capacity on our share repurchase authorization and depending on market conditions plan to be active in the market we did not repurchase any of our common stock during the first quarter of the fiscal year from a debt perspective as of the end of the first quarter we had 350 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility on july 27 2021 we leveraged the favorable financing market environment to amend and extend our revolving credit facility we amended 800 million revolving credit facility extends the maturity from january 2023 to july 2026 increase in financial flexibility and lower financing costs to briefly recap other balance sheet highlights accounts receivable net was 146 2 million down by 51 5 million since the end of march dsos were 63 days versus 75 days at the end of fiscal year 2021 and 57 days at the same time last year the increase in the dsos in the first quarter of this year compared with the first quarter of the prior year is primarily attributable to the timing of when orders were received in the quarter let us move to slide 16 for commentary on our outlook i will focus my review on our non gaap outlook as anil noted in his earlier comments we are reiterating the non gaap outlook that was presented on our may six 2021 earnings call for fiscal year 2022 the expected revenue range is 835 million to 865 million which implies low single digit growth the anticipated effective tax rate is expected to be between 21 and 22 as we incorporate the impact from the recent u k tax legislation change increasing their tax rate from 19 to 25 assuming approximately 75 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding the non gaap diluted earnings per share range is expected to be between 1 71 and 1 77 the gaap diluted net income per share range has been updated to account for certain charges including the impact of the amendment of our revolving credit facility i would also like to offer some color on the non gaap outlook for the first half of the fiscal year as we assess the opportunities in front of us we currently anticipate approximately 1 5 revenue growth with corresponding mid single digit diluted earnings per share growth compared with the first half of the prior fiscal year that concludes my formal review of our financial results before we transition to q and a i would like to quickly note that our upcoming ir conference participation is listed on slide 17 thank you and i will now turn the call over to the operator to start q and a questions and answers operator and we will take our first question from matt hedberg with rbc capital markets your line is now open anushka rbc capital markets analyst hi this is anushka for matt hedberg thanks for taking my question could you talk about how the federal vertical performed in the quarter and do you see any benefits as fed spending picks up anil singhal co founder president chief executive officer chairman of the board well our big federal quarter is actually the coming quarter and so we have a lot of orders in the pipeline but as always the federal spending and last minute spend is still up for the grab so we are looking for a good fed quarter and normally q1 is not a good fed quarter but q2 is a good fed quarter being the end of the fiscal year so i m not sure jean what we had in this quarter but i think big orders for fed are expected in the coming quarters jean bua chief financial officer the federal sector this quarter on a quarter over quarter basis went down in the single millions of dollars so ranging from 2 million to 4 million less this quarter than in q1 of last year anushka rbc capital markets analyst got it and if i could ask one more did you mention anything on software only mix jean bua chief financial officer so the software what we ve been calling software only which is the transition of customers from hardware appliances to costs or to just buying software from us for the quarter was about 32 it was 40 in q1 of last year which was predominantly due to the financials and government dynamics this quarter versus last quarter and last year for the full fiscal year we ended the software only portion at about 34 anushka rbc capital markets analyst got it thank you operator we ll take our next question from eric martinuzzi with lake street your line is now open eric martinuzzi lake street analyst on the services revenue it was down sequentially a little bit more than i would have thought is that tied to is that just a lagging indicator tied to weak product sales a year ago jean bua chief financial officer eric there s a few things going on in there one is there was a comparison a difficult compare of about 1 million where we had back maintenance in q1 of last year the other item is as i mentioned in the script service provider consolidation where the largest one of the two largest carriers combined and they re reassessing their renewals on all of their equipment as they rationalized their network deployment and then we ve talked in the past about some ancillary product lines such as fluke and as those product lines continue to not be sold so certain customers do not renew on their service revenue eric martinuzzi lake street analyst okay and then how should we think about it for the september quarter is q1 a base from which we grow jean bua chief financial officer i would say those dynamics continue at this point into q2 and that there are programs in place that sales of wanting to reincentivize certain customers as well as just looking at other areas where they can improve the service revenue renewal focus for the full year it would appear at this point that we will probably be flat to maybe down slightly one percent in service revenue at the midpoint of guidance eric martinuzzi lake street analyst that s it thanks for taking my questions operator and we will take our next question from james fish with piper sandler james fish piper sandler analyst thank you good morning guys so you guys called out enterprise security weakness and obviously we have been gaining the strength across the board given what s going on in the attack environment much like what we had about seven years ago now and really some of the strongest budget in times we have actually come across in a long long time i guess why isn t netscout not seeing that strength is it a competitive thing that the financial institutions specifically are shifting toward others in your space or is it just the flow through of running out of the pipeline from last year and then jean anyway to think about the mix for netscout with service assurance versus arbor as well as arbor enterprise versus service provider to help us with what is going on with the enterprise arbor weakness here anil singhal co founder president chief executive officer chairman of the board james let me just cover high level and maybe jean can add some commentary so this one quarter is not the trend overall we think the service assurance as cyber security growth for the year will be close to twice the rate of service assurance growth in the year so as we talked about single digit overall growth security growth will be much much higher than that i think it s just a timing there are some big deals in different quarters that one quarter trend and so there is no real issues related to what is happening in the competitive environment it s just the timing of the deals and sometime in q1 last year may have been better for some reasons but overall trend this year is that we are going to see higher growth trends in cyber security even though some of the new products may not hit the mark if we are not able to do trials because of covid issues international also cybersecurity is almost a much larger percentage of our business is international and as you know we have a lot of pandemic related issues so overall you will see that our cyber security growth will be higher than the overall growth and it could be as much as two times the service assurance growth this year james fish piper sandler analyst jean any color on the mix there jean bua chief financial officer so what i would say is arbor declined this quarter due to most of the u s and financials as you point out probably the decline was again probably around somewhere between 3 million to 5 million in overall revenue and then as anil said it s mostly due to the timing of deals going forward all of our focus is on ddos and there are some new products coming out which would include mobile security and as we have talked about in the past arbor is a cadillac so they do well in the large institutions that are enterprise and then they do well in service provider and then going forward with the security products that anil and team are rolling out the anticipated growth of that is probably the difference between the different ranges in our guidance james fish piper sandler analyst understood just one more for me if you got a second one of your networking peers actually called out earlier product orders due to supply chain shortages and it does seem like you guys had some more net pull in effect this quarter especially as you left guide unchanged despite the product upside here and eight figure large deal that we were talking about is it fair to think about that net pull in effect of a couple of million and that s kind of the difference between where the street is here for total revenue versus in fiscal q1 and versus fiscal q2 that we got the upside on jean bua chief financial officer yes i would say it s not only to the supply chain it is related to one of the asian providers that had been rolling out their 4g network over a few years now and they completed one of their projects involving our solution in this quarter rather than last quarter and then i m sorry this quarter rather than next quarter and as you stated it s probably somewhere between say 2 million to 4 million that was pulled forward from q2 over q1 and so if you normalize for that where our product revenue grew 14 if you normalize for that our product revenue would probably have grown somewhere between around eight percent in q1 james fish piper sandler analyst thanks guys operator and we will take our final question from kevin liu with k liu company llc your line is now open kevin liu k liu company llc analyst good morning just a quick follow up on the security side of the business you have talked in past quarters just about the ability to demo some of these newer solutions have you guys seen that start to open up much at all or is there still some risk to being able to trail and get that in front of customers anil singhal co founder president chief executive officer chairman of the board yes so yes kevin there is some risk into that i just wanted to mention that what our cyber security line is 100 based on arbor solution right now so not only we expect to grow that area with some new ideas we have and new way of deploying the product but we are also adding now non ddos security to our portfolio omnis security so for the ddos product line we are not as much ddos extensions to the product line we are not as much dependent on doing pocs but for the new additional non ddos security which is we are counting on at least toward to meet the higher end of the guidance as jean mentioned called omnis security we are counting on pocs and yes that could be impacted but that will be the difference between where we end up in the guidance so our guidance range assumes these scenarios that was in best case and the big difference is going to be how well we do how well our traction goes in the face of pandemic both international and u s in this fiscal year kevin liu k liu company llc analyst got it i appreciated that and just one for jean as well on the product gross margin side i think you mentioned an inventory reserve taken i was wondering if you could provide the size of that and then maybe more generally just talk to whether that was the primary factor and kind of the decline relative to the back half of last year or if there are other things whether it s component costs or freight that might be also impacting the margin there jean bua chief financial officer so this quarter s product margin is down due to about 1 million of discontinued products that we reserved i would say the last half year last prior fiscal year was gross margin was probably a little more suppressed by the product mix where we had more calibration revenue which as you know is lower margin lower gross margin overall kevin liu k liu company llc analyst got it and then just one last one just with respect to the smart edge monitoring solution that you guys introduced i m curious if that s something that your customers have been asking for a while or if there s more kind of an opportunity that you identified given some of the hybrid work dynamics that s gone on since the pandemic anil singhal co founder president chief executive officer chairman of the board yes so kevin so we have announced our smart edge monitoring solution last year and for remote sites and unfortunately most of the remote site people went home because of pandemic so we got a lot of input from our customers that they are looking for similar capability for work from home users so this now the revised smart edge monitoring solution which we sort of reannounced and we had a recent press release is basically provide the same functionality which was available in data center and the remote site to the work from home user which is that if you have an it problem is it your carrier is it your cloud provider is it your laptop or is it your vpn and we are the only solution in the market we can quickly do triage for that this also requires trials and pocs but it s still with existing customer and is incremental to our existing solution so i think yes there is a we are counting on some traction in that area in the coming quarters kevin liu k liu company llc analyst great thanks for taking my questions and good luck as you make your way to the rest of the year operator i will now turn the program back over to tony piazza for any additional or closing remarks tony piazza vice president corporate finance thank you operator this now

call over to andy hendricks for some opening remarks andy william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director thanks mike good morning and welcome to patterson uti s second quarter conference call we are pleased that you can join us today for the second quarter revenues and adjusted ebitda increased sequentially as drilling and completion activity has steadily improved from the lows of last summer based on conversations with customers about the remainder of this year and into early 2022 we expect increasing activity and increasing pricing in contract drilling since the beginning of the second quarter our rig count has increased by eight rigs in addition to the overall increase in our industry we continue to see increasing customer interest in reducing emissions through the use of alternative power sources and we believe these lower emissions technologies where we have a leadership position are a differentiator as an example we were recently notified by a major international e p that we will be increasing our activity within their drilling program and activating multiple rigs over the next year this major customer intends to use a combination of our natural gas powered and our high line utility powered rigs in pressure pumping we took advantage of opportunities with customers to accelerate our reactivation plans and we activated two spreads late in the quarter i m very pleased with the performance of our team this quarter as they met margin expectations while also incurring reactivation costs for these two spreads at the end of the quarter these two spreads are expected to be accretive to our average adjusted ebitda per spread and will help improve our fixed cost coverage going forward we continue to see opportunities to economically reactivate additional spreads and as such we expect to reactivate another spread early in the fourth quarter our pressure pumping team has done a great job in controlling costs through greater operational efficiency and has also successfully achieved higher pricing to improve margins with the improved pricing we expect a meaningful improvement in our third quarter pressure pumping margins as well with the increasing demand for lower emissions technologies and consistent with our disciplined approach to capital spending we plan to continue to upgrade engines on existing pump trailers to tier four dual fuel we continue to believe that tier four dual fuel has many advantages especially over electric frac spreads which in reality also burn natural gas we believe this premium technology generates savings and offers operational flexibility for the customer and better economics for patterson uti we ve also started to gain considerable experience performing simul fracs and i believe we are one of the very few companies to have completed simul fracs in both the northeast and in the permian in directional drilling the reliability and performance of our mercury measurement while drilling system and our impact directional drilling motors have allowed us to continue gaining market share during the second quarter we saw a 70 increase in the number of rigs on which we provided directional drilling services which led to better than expected revenues but margins were impacted by the higher reactivation costs as we grew with that i will now turn the call over to andy smith who will review the financial results for the second quarter c andrew smith chief financial officer executive vice president thanks andy and good morning for the second quarter we reported a net loss of 103 million or 0 55 per share while consolidated adjusted ebitda was 35 4 million before i get into the segments as a general comment due to improving activity levels and increasing tightness in the overall labor market we are starting to see general oilfield cost inflation across our segments this inflation combined with the increasing challenge of attracting employees to the industry is increasing the complexity of reactivating equipment we believe this challenge combined with the increasing demand for premium drilling and completion services will support higher pricing going forward within our segments in contract drilling our average rig count improved for the third consecutive quarter and averaged 73 rigs in the second quarter up from 69 rigs in the first quarter average rig margin per day during the second quarter was 6 250 average rig operating cost per day increased relative to the first quarter due primarily to fewer rigs on low cost standby higher rig reactivation expenses and the sales and use tax refund in the first quarter that did not recur in the second quarter at june 30 2021 we had term contracts for drilling rigs providing for approximately 210 million of future day rate drilling revenue based on contracts currently in place we expect an average of 37 rigs operating under term contracts during the third quarter at an average of 24 rigs operating under term contracts during the four quarters ending june 30 2022 for the third quarter we expect our rig count to improve to an average of 81 rigs ending the quarter at 83 rigs contract drilling gross profit is expected to improve to approximately 46 million average rig margin per day is expected to be approximately flat with the second quarter level in pressure pumping we averaged eight active spreads during the second quarter ahead of our expectation for seven spreads as we reactivated two spreads during the month of june even after costs associated with the reactivation of the extra spread pressure pumping gross margin improved to 9 7 million for the second quarter pressure pumping revenues increased almost 50 sequentially to 112 million for the third quarter we expect to average nine active spreads pressure pumping revenues are expected to improve from second quarter levels by more than 30 to approximately 150 million and gross margin is expected to be approximately 18 million turning now to directional drilling revenues for the second quarter increased 26 to 24 9 million from 19 7 million in the first quarter as the number of rigs on which we provided directional drilling services increased by 70 during the second quarter however with the increase in reactivation costs gross margin for the second quarter decreased slightly to 2 5 million for the third quarter we expect to further benefit from higher activity levels with revenues increasing approximately 35 sequentially to 34 million gross profit for the third quarter is expected to be 4 million turning now to our other operations which includes our rental technology and e p businesses revenues for the second quarter improved to 13 2 million and gross margin improved to 2 8 million for the third quarter we expect revenues to improve to 14 million with a gross margin of 4 5 million on a consolidated basis for the third quarter we expect total depreciation depletion amortization and impairment expense of approximately 141 million selling general and administrative expense is expected to be approximately 23 million for the third quarter and for the full year 2021 we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 17 based on conversations with customers about increasing activity levels into 2022 we are increasing our 2021 capex forecast to 165 million including 105 million for contract drilling 35 million for pressure pumping and 25 million for directional drilling other and general corporate the increase in our capex budget primarily consists of investments in high demand items that generate ancillary revenue including specialty drill pipe and esg related technologies as well as higher maintenance capex due to increasing activity also we will be paying a quarterly cash dividend of 0 02 per share on september 16 2021 to holders of record as of september 2 2021 with that i ll now turn the call back to andy hendricks william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director thanks andy it s been a while since we ve had this level of visibility into future quarters and i m very encouraged by the continuing increase in e p demand that we are seeing for our services in drilling and completions while this was primarily driven by the trading ranges of commodities over the last six months it is also driven by patterson uti s overall high level of well site performance and efficiency as well as our esg related technologies i expect this demand continues at least into 2022 for patterson uti as we ve discussed this means both increasing activity and increasing pricing in our businesses finally let me provide a short update on our pending acquisition of pioneer energy services subject to regulatory approvals customary closing conditions and the approval of pioneer energy services stockholders we continue to expect this acquisition will close in the fourth quarter pioneer s experienced people high quality assets and efficient operations in the united states and colombia will be a valuable addition to our business with that we would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work efforts and successes both in our industry and in general and we look forward to a stronger second half of the year felita we would now like to open the call to questions questions and answers operator and your first question comes from the line of mike sabella with bank of america michael james sabella bofa securities analyst hey good morning everyone william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director good morning michael james sabella bofa securities analyst so andy you have mentioned some upgrades on the frac fleet to tier four dual fuel maybe you could just give us an idea i guess where you are today in terms of kind of capacity of next gen frac equipment and if any of the capex bump that you all announced today is on the frac upgrades and then as we think about that maybe talk us through economics on what we see from those upgraded fleets today william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director yes what we re doing is we re actually changing the engines from older models of engines to the new tier four dual fuel so it s not a change in the horsepower it s an engine swap on the trailer we started this a few months ago with tier four dual fuel and we re going to continue to invest some capex to do this for the rest of this year and into next year to get ready to have even another full spread ready for q1 next year this is i mean there s certainly some capex in there but it s a relatively small amount compared to overall capex for the company but we see this as a very cost effective solution to upgrade the level of technology on our existing equipment without adding horsepower into the market michael james sabella bofa securities analyst understood and then maybe you can just i guess talk us through just on the rig side maybe describe kind of where you think customer interest is coming from as we look a little further out obviously this year the rig demand incremental rig demand has been dominated by private e ps the duc inventory that was held by the public e ps looks like it s largely been exhausted so it seems like the setup is there that the public e ps have to come back for rigs as well would you i guess agree with that assessment and if it plays out that way just talk through what it means for patterson kind of relative to a market that s been more dominated by private e ps william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director yes certainly as we came off the downturn last year it was private that moved quicker but when you look into what we re seeing in the second half of this year and into 2022 it s really broad i mean it s privates that are going to add rigs it s midsized publics it s large international e ps so we re just seeing more of a broad based uptake in rigs with the discussions that are happening going into early 22 michael james sabella bofa securities analyst got it thanks operator your next question come from the line of vaibhav coker vaibhav vaishnav from coker palmer vaibhav d vaishnav coker palmer institutional analyst thank you for trying in thank you for taking my question gentlemen william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director good morning vebs vaibhav d vaishnav coker palmer institutional analyst so i guess if we talk about pressure pumping could you help us think about like in the market are we today where we actually can get better pricing for esg friendly fleet versus conventional fleets william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director yes we believe that with by changing out the engines and offering tier four dual fuel on existing pump trailers that not only can pick up more work but we can also get better pricing and margins on that particular work i mean it offers a lot of benefits for the customer in terms of cost savings but as i mentioned earlier there s also good economics for us vaibhav d vaishnav coker palmer institutional analyst okay switching to land drilling as we move from here into 2022 2023 i m not trying to pin you down for a number but just generally how do you think about where the land drilling margins could go back to versus what we saw in the prior cycles obviously one change is like now you are providing more services on the same rig so just putting that in context would be helpful william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director so the way that i see this evolving because we re already in discussions for putting up rigs across the second half of this year and into 22 it s actually quite interesting like i mentioned we just haven t had this level of visibility in a long while and my concern is that we ve got some of our operators customers that are still working through their budget process and they may not even make decisions until late this year or early next year on rigs they want and by that time some of the rigs that they ve been used to running are not going to be available and so i think you re going to have this situation as we move into 2022 that s more of a fear of missing out and there s going to be more of a scramble for the best super spec rigs that are out there and now granted we all have a lot of high spec rigs but when you talk about the best performing super spec rigs and with some of the operators a little bit slower in their budget cycles i think they re going to land in a space in early 22 that they re not going to have necessarily the rigs that they want to have and when you see that happening in the cycle that s really a big push on pricing and that s a big push on margins it s been a while since we ve seen that too and so i do think it evolves into 22 that we have the possibility to get back to some of the higher margins that we ve seen in the past and other cycles and part of what may drive that is when some of these larger operators that are a little bit slower decide that they want to add rigs and they can t get all the specs that they want they ve now got to work with the drilling contractor to pay for upgrades and those kind of discussions drive pricing and i think you ll hear more of that as we get into 2022 vaibhav d vaishnav coker palmer institutional analyst so maybe what i m hearing is really as opposed to correct me if i m misinterpreting this but what i m hearing really is in fourth quarter when we typically think about like a decline given where the commodity prices are based on your customer conversations actually we can see more rig increases in 4q is that fair interpretation of what you re saying william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director i think you can take fourth quarter decline and throw it out the window this year if you look at where commodity prices are trading oil wti above 65 a barrel in natural gas above 3 we re not considering a fourth quarter decline vaibhav d vaishnav coker palmer institutional analyst that s very helpful and thank you for taking my question operator your next question is from the line of john daniel with daniel energy john daniel daniel energy analyst hey guys good morning thank you william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director good morning john john daniel daniel energy analyst just i know you can t name the e p company i m not asking for that but you talked about the international e p thus presumably a large one picking up multiple rigs i m curious if you could just maybe hazard a guess as to what the relative change in incremental rigs versus where they are today just frame it for us and when that would happen if you can t that s fine i m just trying we all and the reason i m asking is obviously like you see the privates going from 0 to 1 one to 2 i mean the percentage changes are huge and we typically think of these large guys as being disciplined but like everything would suggest they re going to be adding rigs and maybe significantly so just your thoughts william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director so i think this may be a situation that s specific to us because this is a large major e p that has a drilling program that may not that may grow their drilling programs somewhat but we re very likely to be growing share within their existing drilling program so i think there s still relative discipline out there i m not calling a lack of discipline or a big ramp up in their particular program but because of the technology because of the performance and efficiency that we ve been offering with this particular operator over the last few years our team has done a great job and we see ourselves growing share and esg and emissions related technology are part of that equation as well john daniel daniel energy analyst okay fair enough on the frac side i just want to make sure i ve got the sequencing right you re running eight today is that right going to 9 william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director correct eight going to 9 john daniel daniel energy analyst and then did you william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director we re at 9 we just finished we just activated number 9 and then we re going to 10 early q4 could be late q3 but likely early q4 john daniel daniel energy analyst okay got it and if you said this i apologize the number of let s just say year end at year end what would be roughly the tier four dgb split within your fleet given the investment william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director so we have a number of different things in our fleet we have tier two dual fuel we have tier 4 we have tier four dual fuel by the end of this year with changing out more engines we ll be up to a full spread of tier four dual fuel and then we ll also be set up for a second tier or second spread of tier four dual fuel next year john daniel daniel energy analyst okay all right guys thank you very much for answering the questions william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director thanks operator your next question is from the line of scott levine with bloomberg scott justin levine bloomberg intelligence analyst hi good morning guys william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director good morning scott justin levine bloomberg intelligence analyst so i wanted to see if i can get a sense of your outlook for net pricing for both drilling and pressure pumping for the back half of this year if i heard correctly in your prepared comments you said you expected your average daily rig margins to hold about flat in the third quarter and that s what i think we heard out of one of your competitors yesterday but your activity levels are increasing and we ve seen the inventory of ducs drop pretty considerably recently so is it fair to assume that the pace of activity and drilling accelerates but maybe the net pricing lags a bit behind the recovery net pricing in pressure pumping or are you seeing it from a different vantage point from your perspective just curious there william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director yes so our view is we re seeing a steady increase in rig count throughout h2 and into 2022 we re also seeing an increase in pricing but we ve also had some cost inflation as well so the cost inflation is keeping the margins flat quarter on quarter but then we expect margins to improve after that scott justin levine bloomberg intelligence analyst and on the pumping side is it a different situation or is the magnitude any different or is it roughly similar trend as far as you can say william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director i d say pumping is coming off a more challenging bottom and as we increase the number of spreads we re operating we re improving margins by a mixture of increasing pricing and then better fixed cost coverage as well scott justin levine bloomberg intelligence analyst understood thank you william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director thanks operator there are no other questions at this time william andrew hendricks jr president chief executive officer and director all right well we thank everybody for dialing into our earnings call this morning and have a good quarter thanks

christopher bilotto president and chief operating officer thank you olivia and good morning welcome to the second quarter earnings call for office properties income trust yesterday we reported normalized ffo of 1 15 per share exceeding our expectations as well as consensus estimates for the quarter during the second quarter we advanced many of our core business strategies focused on enhancing the overall quality and geographic footprint of our portfolio driving healthy portfolio cash flow growth and retention through proactive asset management and leasing managing through areas of known risk and opportunity and effective balance sheet management to execute on our deleveraging and refinancing initiatives overall we have seen office leasing activity begin to recover and remain encouraged by the long term outlook for our company turning first to an update on our acquisition and capital recycling activity as previously announced in june we acquired two core class a office properties for a total of 550 million these acquisitions are accretive to cash flows and enhance our overall portfolio metrics including geographic diversification occupancy average building age and weighted average lease terms with newer construction and modern infrastructure and design each of the properties have limited capital requirements deliver contractual annual rent growth of over 2 and offer a net lease structure for recoveries of operating expenses as a result we believe these two new investment opportunities will provide attractive long term risk adjusted returns for opi the first property known as 1k fulton in chicago was acquired for 355 million representing a gaap cap rate of 4 7 at closing this 531 000 square foot property is 73 leased to google as its midwest headquarters and more than 99 leased overall with a weighted average lease term of 6 6 years we are pleased to add google as our second largest tenant for opi providing aa rated cash flow and accounting for 3 6 of opi s total annualized rental income this leed certified property underwent a full redevelopment in 2015 and is located in the highly desirable fulton submarket of downtown chicago a neighborhood which has experienced strong population growth among young educated professionals attracting fortune 500 companies such as google and mcdonald s which has supported residential and mixed use development in addition the fulton submarket continues to benefit from our rapidly growing presence of both technology and life science companies providing opi with a favorable market investment landscape while we expect to benefit from the current lease term and corresponding cash flow stability we estimate current rent to be close to 20 below market providing the opportunity for further upside upon lease renewal we also acquired the property known as twelve24 in atlanta for 195 million representing a gaap cap rate of 6 3 at closing this 346 000 square foot property is 96 leased to insight global as its corporate headquarters and more than 98 leased overall with a weighted average lease term of 14 2 years insight global is the third largest staffing company in the u s and has experienced solid growth over the last few years including the addition of 5 000 employees in 2020 this core class a property was constructed in 2021 and is located in atlanta s central perimeter submarket which is the largest employment center in greater atlanta and home to fortune 500 headquarters for mercedes state farm and nasdaq given these dynamics we believe twelve24 should provide opi attractive risk adjusted returns in a healthy market with a high quality tenant turning to dispositions as discussed last quarter in april we sold our property located in huntsville alabama that was a known vacate in the third quarter for 39 million in july we also sold two properties for a total of 7 million including our property in fresno california that was a known vacate in the fourth quarter we are pleased to sell these non core properties as part of our focus to reshape the portfolio and eliminate potential drags in occupancy as well as anticipated capital and downtime since the start of our capital recycling program in 2020 we committed to selling properties that are older in age more capital intensive or those that have maximized value and exit markets where we see limited future growth and reinvest the proceeds into higher quality and stronger cash flow producing properties we have since sold 287 million of properties while eliminating forecasted capital spending needs of 113 million over a five year period as part of these efforts we have reinvested those proceeds into properties located in strong growing markets with an average age of close to three years and a highly accretive five year cash contribution yield in excess of 5 we believe the execution of our capital recycling initiatives will continue to enhance the quality of our portfolio as supported by key metrics including the increase of our portfolio wall to 5 9 years from 4 9 years in q1 an overall reduction of the average age of our portfolio and our expanded footprint in strong growing markets such as atlanta and chicago we expect to continue with our capital recycling program in the future quarters which matt will also touch on in his prepared remarks as was recently announced in june we commenced the redevelopment of 20 massachusetts avenue in washington d c this project will expand the existing seven story 340 000 square foot class b property to a 10 story 427 000 square foot mixed use property that is expected to be completed in early 2023 the redesigned property will feature 184 000 square feet of class a office space 14 000 square feet of retail space a luxuriously appointed hotel and extensive amenities state of the art design and construction will underscore our commitment to sustainability with a focus on touchless systems as well as leed and well certifications we are also pleased to be more than 50 pre leased at this early stage in the project timeline with the execution of a 230 000 square foot lease for a 271 key royal sonesta hotel sonesta is one of the largest hotel management companies in the u s and the eighth largest hotel brand and franchise company in america sonesta currently operates close to 1 300 hotels with over 140 000 rooms and brings growing brand recognition to this distinctive capitol hill destination 20 massachusetts ave is located adjacent to union station a major regional transit hub and a short walk to the united states capitol and supreme court we anticipate total project cost of approximately 200 million with stabilized year returns of 8 to 10 making this a highly accretive use of capital turning to leasing results for the quarter we are encouraged by the momentum of our leasing dialog and activity in the second quarter importantly we have seen new leasing accelerate and new deals contributed nearly 50 of our total activity during the second quarter we completed 548 000 square feet of new and renewal leasing with a 17 1 roll up in rent a weighted average lease term of 16 6 years and leasing concessions and capital commitments of 8 42 per square foot per lease year we ended the quarter with consolidated occupancy of 89 5 in addition to the sonesta to lease of sonesta we renewed the gsa in cheyenne wyoming for 67 000 square feet and a 20 year term and extended the gsa lease in holtsville new york for 101 000 square feet and a three year term both of these tenants renewed with the roll up in rent of close to 20 and the overall economics serve as a proud example of how a strategically located agency can deliver strong investment and leasing results for opi our leasing pipeline remains robust with discussions covering 3 8 million square feet including more than 890 000 square feet of new and renewal leasing in advanced stages of negotiations more than 130 000 square feet that has been executed subsequent to quarter end and 1 2 million square feet that could absorb vacant space this is the fourth consecutive quarter where our leasing pipeline has been in excess of three million square feet which highlights the growing interest from tenants across our portfolio i ll discuss three of our four known larger vacates for 2021 as mentioned last quarter at the fourth property in plantation florida the gsa s lease expired in april and represent 80 basis points of annualized revenue the tenant elected to hold over for up to 12 months and we now anticipate continued occupancy through mid december 2021 despite this holdover activity for private sector leasing has been strong with several large users having acquired into the building including a signed term sheet for half of the total square footage despite the pressure of the last 18 months our investment strategy and portfolio composition of key industries and tenants has continued to perform well we are pleased with the successful execution of our capital recycling program and believe we are well positioned to continue to advance our growth objectives i will now turn the call over to matt brown to provide details on our financial results matt matt brown chief financial officer and treasurer thanks chris and good morning everyone normalized ffo for the second quarter was 55 4 million or 1 15 per share which beat consensus in the high end of our estimate by 0 02 mainly due to operating expenses lagging our forecast based on building utilization levels remaining below our estimates and noi from the properties we acquired in june cad for the second quarter was 33 8 million or 0 70 per share resulting in a rolling four quarter cad payout ratio of 63 g a expense for the second quarter was 13 million which includes 5 9 million of estimated business management incentive fees excluding estimated incentive fees g a expense was 7 1 million compared to 7 2 million for the same period last year and 6 1 million for the prior quarter the increase sequentially is driven by annual trustee share grant expense as well as higher base business management fees due to an increase in our average share price in the quarter as a reminder incentive fees under our business management agreement with rmr are payable after the end of each calendar year in which they are earned but are recognized in the calculation of net income in accordance with gaap in the first second and third quarters if applicable we do not include such expense in adjusted ebitdare or normalized ffo until the fourth quarter when the final incentive fee amount is determined the incentive fee accrued in the second quarter is based on opi s total return in comparison to the index over the 3 year measurement period opi outperformed the index by 15 1 with a total return of 31 5 this equates to an estimated annual incentive fee of 22 2 million the incentive fee accrual may increase or decrease over the remainder of the year depending on how opi performs relative to the index interest expense for the second quarter was 29 million an increase of 200 000 from the prior quarter while interest expense increased sequentially we expect interest expense to be between 26 and 27 million for each of the third and fourth quarters of 2021 the expected decline from q2 is primarily due to the accretive bond offering in may in which we raised 300 million of 2 65 unsecured senior notes and used the proceeds to redeem 310 million of 5 875 senior notes and the prepayment of 71 million of 3 55 mortgage debt in june using cash on hand and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility the may bond offering was 6 times oversubscribed and we believe this indicates a positive investor outlook for office real estate the opportunistic debt management will result in interest expense savings of approximately 10 million annually turning to property level results for the quarter same property cash basis noi decreased 2 7 million or 3 1 compared to the second quarter of 2020 slightly outperforming a low end of our guidance range of negative 3 5 to 5 5 as expected the decrease was mainly driven by a reduction in rental income of 2 million driven by declines in occupancy as well as an increase in operating expenses of 700 000 mainly due to increases in real estate taxes turning to normalized ffo and same property cash basis noi expectations we expect third quarter normalized ffo to be between 1 20 and 1 22 per share driven by the following an increase of 0 16 including 0 11 from the june acquisitions and 0 05 from the q2 bond offering and redemption activities described above offset by a decrease of 0 10 including 0 07 due to increased operating expenses and 0 03 from the sale of the fresno california property in july we expect third quarter same property cash basis noi to be flat to down 2 as compared to the third quarter of 2020 turning to capital expenditures and the balance sheet we spent 19 million on recurring capital during the second quarter and we expect recurring capital expenditures for the full year to be between 75 and 80 million as chris mentioned we also commenced our redevelopment of 20 mass ave in june and spent 10 3 million in the second quarter we anticipate delivery in the first quarter of 2023 and total project cost of approximately 200 million of which 46 million is expected to be spent in 2021 at june 30 our leverage was 6 9 times pro forma for the two property acquisitions in june which were funded using cash on hand and approximately 350 million of borrowings under our 750 million revolving credit facility we expect to dispose off non core properties under our capital recycling program to repay debt and manage our leverage levels and have approximately 300 million of properties in the market or identified for disposition that we plan to bring to market in the near term we currently have 380 million outstanding and 370 million available on our revolving credit facility we are pleased with the execution of many of our core business strategies in the second quarter which have enhanced the quality diversity and security of our portfolio operator that concludes our prepared remarks we re ready to open the call up for questions questions and answers operator and our first question today comes from bryan maher b riley fbr please proceed bryan anthony maher b riley fbr analyst couple of questions on mass ave which looks fantastic on the website that you have explaining what it s all about that 200 million of cost is that going to be a fixed cost is there guarantees by the builder on that christopher bilotto president and chief operating officer yes i mean typically bryan this is chris typically with these projects at this side it s kind of a gmp so on the onset we structure kind of the agreement where we kind of lock in pricing and then anything that is in excess would be borne by either the contractor or if needed through use of contingencies so for that particular project we ve bought down a lot of the job already and so i think we feel pretty comfortable where that number is trending bryan anthony maher b riley fbr analyst okay and i think you said 46 million will be spent on it in 2021 does that include the 10 million i think you referenced in 2q christopher bilotto president and chief operating officer yes that s inclusive bryan anthony maher b riley fbr analyst okay so roughly 150 million 155 million in 2022 or do you expect some of the balance to carry over into 2023 christopher bilotto president and chief operating officer there s a portion that will carry into 2023 and i think the number is trending right now at less than 20 million bryan anthony maher b riley fbr analyst okay and then as it relates to those two office properties you recently bought in chicago and atlanta how did you source those and via that sourcing kind of how deep is the pipeline of other similar assets that you could acquire christopher bilotto president and chief operating officer well i think from a sourcing initiative i mean through kind of our manager and our acquisition team we re sourcing opportunities rarely i think we see most if not all deals out there whether individual acquisitions or other opportunities and so these two deals came to us through that kind of venue and then our relationships with brokers and so with respect to how many other deals like this are out there i mean as far as our pipeline goes i mean our focus now coming out of these acquisitions is kind of back into some capital recycling but there s a handful of deals out there in the market kind of of similar quality and so i think we evaluate them on a case by case basis but again these kind of came through our channel and relationships bryan anthony maher b riley fbr analyst great and then just last for me and i think you commented on this in the last quarter s earnings call but based upon how the last three months have unfolded can you give us your updated thoughts on where year end occupancy shakes out maybe plus or minus 50 bps christopher bilotto president and chief operating officer yes i think it s relatively the same bryan i mean i think we ve talked about kind of the 89 to 91 and i think it kind of stands there with some of the moving pieces that we still have with kind of leases out there for pending execution things around kind of capital recycling i think we feel that that s a pretty good number to stand by bryan anthony maher b riley fbr analyst okay thank you that s all for me christopher bilotto president and chief operating officer thank you operator at this time our next question comes from vikram malhotra of morgan stanley please proceed vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst thanks so much for taking the questions i guess just maybe first one given the given sort of the acquisition disposition kind of faith and just the differing cap rates in terms of what you re paying for acquiring versus the disposition i think some of these cap rates seem pretty high i m just wondering if you can give us a sense of like how and then obviously the capex implications of the newer assets can you give us a sense of how cad is likely to trend or maybe even just from a dividend payout perspective over the next few quarters matt brown chief financial officer and treasurer yes the acquisitions from a cad perspective are accretive so we expect it to be favorable as it relates to dividend coverage our rolling fourth quarter coverage is 63 currently absent potential incentive fee paid to our manager we expect 2021 payout of about 70 vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst and that excludes the incentive fee correct matt brown chief financial officer and treasurer that s right with the incentive fee it s right around 80 vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst 80 okay and then i guess the if we think about the overall occupancy you mentioned kind of a view of where we could check out near term i m just wondering like bigger picture given sort of the government exposure i think a couple of days ago the gsa announced that they re going to be offering temp space or build out temp space for other for different federal branches and they expect their office space to the needs to shrink over time i m just wondering kind of how you can you combine that with sort of the known move outs are there risks to the portfolio you see in terms of potential decline in usage of space on a more permanent basis from the government agencies christopher bilotto president and chief operating officer yes so i think a couple of different things i think right now kind of the office of personnel management had a memorandum that went out i think it was in june to kind of get feedback from the agencies around one kind of their reentry plans and timing on utilization and then two at an agency level about kind of how they think about the future of the workplace and so it s going to be heavily driven by agency in addition to kind of the new commission and the gsa and then that administration and so i d say that because i think the outcome of some of that feedback is going to drive that decision which i think over time we ll learn more about i would say today where we stand when you kind of look at our makeup 22 of our annualized revenue is with the federal government i would say about half of it today is more kind of defense mission driven meaning highly secure facilities and in those cases those tenants want to retain control of the building or certain areas within a building and so the likelihood of them consolidating or condensing within a building it seems less likely and then outside of that i think it s just going to be i think forward facing agencies we would expect to see some shifts in their program which represents a lesser percentage for us and i kind of look to our results i mentioned a few leases or transactions this quarter with the gsa and both of those i would say are kind of the nonpartisan meaning the ones that are more highly likely in our view to downsize or consolidate and in those cases i mean they re extending in one case for a 20 year term and the other case for three and so i think the short of it is it remains highly evolved along what agencies will do and i think our experience with the government is that it s much more difficult to get space given the process if you give space back and so i think they ll be very mindful of kind of how they roll out that plan and how much they elect to give back if any depending on the circumstances vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst that makes sense just related to that if you could clarify any update or any changes to kind of the known move outs over the call it the next 18 months into 22 christopher bilotto president and chief operating officer yes so typically we like to provide 12 month guidance on known move outs and so when you kind of carve out the disposition of fresno we have about 5 6 of our annualized revenue expiring between kind of q3 and the end of q2 next year and so we think about 2 of that is a known vacate and really it s kind of smaller tenants that make up that list we talked about the lease with plantation florida being 80 80 basis points and also how we have a signed term sheet for half that space already and then the rest is just a handful of smaller tenants across the portfolio vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay great and sorry just last one on capex you talked about incremental investment redevelopment you gave the capital spend for this year i m just wondering like as you make these portfolio changes combined with potentially a little bit more of a work from home or work from anywhere model where do you see sort of the capex load on a per square foot basis or percent of noi basis where do you see that trending kind of over the next two or three years christopher bilotto president and chief operating officer i mean from i mean i can answer it in two parts i ll talk quickly about kind of leasing related capital i think from a leasing related capital i think over the last we ll call it six quarters it s slightly increased mostly due to kind of concessions and maybe being a little bit more heavily weighted on ti just kind of given changes to the economic environment and so i think that kind of over the short term i would expect that kind of the leasing capital per square foot would be elevated but we ve started to kind of see it level out a little bit and from a building capital matt brown chief financial officer and treasurer yes so on a building capital standpoint as we execute on our capital recycling and sell out of older more capital intensive properties and acquire kind of first generation buildings we d expect that to trend down vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay great thanks so much operator our next question comes from jason idoine of rbc capital markets jason r idoine rbc capital markets analyst yes just following up on vikram s question on the leasing i m curious to as to how concessions and tenants requests are changing today versus pre covid so if you could kind of touch on where the markets are today and i know you said that you d expect it to trend lower but i guess what would the timeline for that be christopher bilotto president and chief operating officer yes so i guess kind of just going back to my previous comment i think we re seeing kind of the capital cost per square foot per year slightly increasing from pre covid and that s i think that while it s leveled off i think it will stay elevated into the to near term or maybe into kind of early next year just based on where our pipeline is at and from a kind of other concession standpoint i would say things around free rent have leveled off albeit they still are elevated from where they were several years ago i think what we re seeing more of with respect to tenant requests is things about kind of expansion and controlling kind of rofos or rofrs being requested or baked to leases and so i think that s just a function of tenants who want to kind of commit today having room to grow with some form of control in their lease and so i would say that those are really kind of the three areas where we re seeing various levels of movement jason r idoine rbc capital markets analyst got it okay and then on the i guess the seattle lease with f5 any updates on that i think that that s right outside the 18 month window but any updates on like leasing activity or what the tenants plans are there christopher bilotto president and chief operating officer yes so that s a lease that expires in july of next year the plan there it continues with what we ve talked about historically where we re focused on evaluating that for a partial conversion to life science it s three buildings and so we re in the kind of the process of evaluating how much of that square footage we want to consider converting and so from an activity standpoint we do have activity from life science users for the space and so i think it s promising that s a market that s continued to kind of see an uptick in trends with respect to gravitation toward more life science users and we would expect that there s an outcome where a portion of buildings will be converted and so i would venture to guess within this next quarter we should have a little bit more definitive direction on timing costs kind of returns and other things to share jason r idoine rbc capital markets analyst got it okay and then last one for me just on the acquisition market could you just touch on like the volume of deals you re seeing in the market relative to i guess the last couple quarters are those are you seeing more deals come to the market and also what type of assets are you seeing coming to the market christopher bilotto president and chief operating officer i think the activity has been pretty consistent i mean we ve seen elevated transactions coming to the market ever since kind of the turn of the year and so i think that flow has been relatively consistent since so and again this is a variation of kind of the single tenant high credit well leased buildings and then what i might consider as maybe a little bit more core plus as well so but otherwise volume itself is at least deals out there has been pretty consistent jason r idoine rbc capital markets analyst got it thanks everyone operator this concludes the question and answer session at this time i would like to turn it back over to mr bilotto for any closing remarks christopher bilotto president and chief operating officer well thanks for joining us today we look forward to updating you on our progress this year and hope to see many of you at some of the upcoming conferences operator duration 34 minutes call participants olivia snyder manager investor relations

full earnings release published on air s website prepared remarks today come from terry considine our ceo keith kimmel our president incharge of property operations paul beldin our chief financial officer and other members of the management are present and will be available during our question and answer session which will follow our prepared remarks i will now turn the call to terry considine terry terry considine chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you lisa and thank each of you on this call for your interest in air business is good and its proved for the very good quarter with the most dramatic glitch is poor sound quality on our call the most important fact of today s apartment business is that strong consumer demand is driving higher rents and higher occupancy and the most important question for apartment investors is how much of a higher top line will reach my bottom line air with best in class margins flat controllable operating expenses and low g a provides peer leading efficiency in the flow through of revenue to ffo and cash dividends air is on track to accomplish and exceed its 2021 goals keith s property operations team was superb again notwithstanding bad debt resulting from california laws and local ordinances property revenue grew year over year in june and is accelerating to be up year over year for the full year controllable operating expenses are on track to be down for the full year again resulting in a return to full year noi growth air purchased city center upgrading our portfolio and showing the power of great operations air issued 300 million of equity to reduce leverage with the 600 million balance expected by year end from selling properties into a rising market the result was a beat to first half ffo guidance up by 7 an increase to second half ffo guidance up by 7 and a raise to quarterly dividends up by 2 air is well positioned for an excellent second half air is even better positioned for an excellent 2022 portfolio quality is good and well diversified loss to lease promises substantial rent growth the dilution of leverage reduction will be behind us as always the key is the air team and its focus on operational excellence to my colleagues in denver and my teammates in the field well done in 10 000 things and now to explain what we did how we did it and what we see ahead i d like to turn the call to keith kimmel head of property operations keith keith m kimmel president property operations thanks terry the second quarter was good more importantly our leading indicators point toward a continued rapid recovery in the second half of this year and an excellent 2022 we operate with the strategy to solve for maximize contribution to margin over a horizon of 12 months to 18 months that long term perspective allows us to look beyond the moment to spot changes in a market dynamics well in advance and adjust our approach accordingly our outlook for the business has improved over the past four quarterly calls first calling a bottom last october next identifying green shoots in january and then pointing to a rebound in april today we see acceleration the second quarter was good the recent performance will discuss means the third and fourth quarters will be record setting and we will be making decisions today to ensure 2022 continues to build on that performance what do i see that makes me increasingly optimistic leasing is running at a record pace the volume leasing in the second quarter is the highest we ve ever recorded 65 ahead of 2020 and 10 ahead of the previous best in the second quarter of 2019 occupancy is poised to accelerate one key leading indicator is the percentage of units which are leased which includes today s occupancy and all scheduled future move in and move out activity today we are 95 leased 8 ahead of the same day last year and 4 ahead of 2019 our lease percentage in 2019 was a precursor to the 97 4 occupancy in the fourth quarter driving our bullish outlook for the balance of this year pricing is rapidly improving we increased effective asking rents by 130 on average during the second quarter and in july we increased rates another 60 as a result signed new lease rates increased for the 10th consecutive month with july up 9 5 that means we ve not only returned to our pre covid rates but we have recovered back to the long term growth trend line that combination of record leasing higher occupancy and increasing rates will be the drivers that result in a strong growth in the second half of 2021 and into 2022 turning to the second quarter results revenue was lower year over year by 1 9 while increasing quarter over quarter by 80 basis points the year over year decrease is largely due to the earn in of last year s lower rents and continued bad debt elevated due to government suspensions of our contractual rights to collect past due rent the trend for year over year revenue growth is improving with june revenue up 1 8 from june of 2020 as we begin to earn in positive rates from this year bad debt for the quarter was 2 1 as renters even those without hardship continue to be protected from legal recourse that being said i am encouraged that we collected 700 000 in city and state rental assisted payments during the quarter partially offsetting the growing delinquency from those still allowed to live rent free controllable operating expenses were up 2 8 in the second quarter largely due to the timing of expenses last year during lockdown for the full year we expect controllable operating expenses to be down compared not only to 2020 but down compared to each of the previous 5 years overall expenses increased 5 driven by increased taxes and insurance as a result net operating income for the quarter was down 4 5 and turn positive in the month of june up 2 6 year over year most importantly even at the bottom of the cycle our margins remained strong at 70 7 continuing a string of 19 consecutive quarters with margins above 70 moving to individual markets we have improved across the board most markets have recovered not only to pre covid peak but also to the long term growth trend in asking rents miami and san diego were our strongest markets posting signed new lease rates up over 15 in july with asking rents now well above long term trend denver boston los angeles and washington d c have all steadily strengthened each has signed new lease rates up 8 or more in july and with asking rents also above trend in philadelphia in keeping with our approach of solving for long term contribution we pursued a strategy of increasing rates in the face of low occupancy this spring accepting the vacancy loss in the anticipation of a rapid recovery in the market we have now seen leasing rebound with demand from university city students and center city workers and as of today we are more leased than we were in 2019 signed new lease rates were up 5 in july as asking rents recovered to pre covid peak though they still lack trends slightly in essence we made a calculated trade in march lower second quarter occupancy and income for a higher rent royalty end of peak season this decision has been a net positive for both 2021 and 2022 pressure continues to ease in the bay area where we ve seen occupancy rebound with the return of tech workers rates have gradually strengthened and while they remain below pre covid peak new leases in july were signed at positive lease to lease as a result of these positive trends across our markets july has demonstrated further acceleration rates have reached record levels with signed new lease rates up 9 5 over the prior lease renewals up 5 9 and signed blended rate up 7 5 we anticipate occupancy of 95 8 up 30 basis points from june despite the higher friction of vacancy and we exit july well positioned for the balance of the year bad debt will continue to improve with increased california government assisted payments and the anticipated lifting of eviction moratoriums allowing us to address those who are delinquent and without a special hardship while still helping those who are in need we will continue to earn in the strong rate growth we ve signed over the past few months with 4 000 leases that are already signed and yet to begin at an average increase of 8 6 and sustained strong pricing as indicated by a 10 loss to lease in our current rent roll finally occupancy will increase rapidly as we exit peak season and frictional vacancy dissipates as we look to 2022 we expect revenue to benefit from the earn in of the great work the growth rate of leases already transacted and those to come as we reprice the 10 loss to lease continued growth in rental rates next year recovery of occupancy to pre covid levels improvements in other income and bad debt as government restrictions are eased continued discipline in controlling costs and contribution from city center on 7th where we have seen the value of air operations in the early days of ownership in the first 45 days we have raised rent 350 on average we ve transacted 27 leases at rates up more than 20 and increased occupancy beyond 97 city center will be a textbook example of how properties are worth more when operated by air over the next year or so we will refresh the physical property but more importantly we re putting in place air customer selection customer service and customer retention we are also implementing air s disciplined property operations so that work is done more effectively and at lower costs the expected result will be a sharp expansion of margin and bottom line just as we ve done before for example with bent tree and our philadelphia acquisitions my thanks to all the air team members involved in the successful integration of city center into our portfolio and more broadly thank you to all the air team members who have worked so hard and so well during the challenging times of the past 18 months this energy innovation and commitment to our customers have set us up for a strong rebound in future growth with that i ll now turn the call over to paul beldin our chief financial officer paul paul l beldin executive vice president chief financial officer thank you keith today i will discuss five topics first air s strong balance sheet including our measured strategy reduced leverage by 900 million over the course of the year second our recent acquisition of city center on 7th third our expectations for the remainder of 2021 fourth our announced dividend increase and fifth our optimism for continued improvement in 2022 first air s balance sheet is strong and flexible as part of the separation transaction we set a leverage target of debt to ebitda of 5 5 1 and a completion date of year end 2022 in april we decided to accelerate our delevering by 12 months to year end 2021 our plan is to achieve this result in three phases first during the second quarter we used the proceeds from our equity issuance to repay 318 million of property debt with a weighted average interest rate of 4 6 in doing so we incurred 34 million of prepayment penalties the prepayment penalties are justified through future interest savings second during the third quarter we expect to contract for property sales primarily from our new york city and chicago portfolios providing additional proceeds in excess of 300 million marketing these properties is well underway demand is strong with numerous would be buyers and attractive pricing closing are expected before year end with proceeds applied to reduce property debt third during the fourth quarter we expect to raise an additional 300 million or more from the sale of properties outright or in joint ventures our marketing here is also underway with similar high interest and attractive pricing in sum we are on track to raise the remaining 600 million necessary to reduce air leverage to our target level next i d like to spend a moment discussing our recent acquisition of city center on 7th and pembroke pines florida city center has 700 apartment homes with average in place rents monthly rents just under 1900 we purchased city center six weeks ago for 223 million and anticipate completing the pair trade by signing an additional 175 million of properties in the fourth quarter we expect a 4 2 yield during our first year of ownership and expect this yield to approach 6 over the next few years due to the effectiveness of keith s operating platform investment of an additional 10 million in property upgrades and refreshment and strong local demand the transaction will slightly increase leverage to ebitda at year end but we expect that rise in ebitda will put us on target soon thereafter this transaction is important to portfolio management by year end we expect to have reduced our capital allocation to new york city and chicago and increased our allocation of south florida by 200 basis points to approximately 10 the expected result is faster growth because of the strength of the south florida market and more predictable taxes and regulation now turning to full year 2021 guidance for a second time this year we are increasing our expectations for ffo same store revenue and noi and lowering our expectations for expenses we now expect full year ffo per share between 2 09 and 2 15 at the midpoint this is an increase of 7 from the guidance we gave six months ago with year to date ffo of 1 02 our guidance implies 8 acceleration in the second half of the year this acceleration is primarily attributable to the revenue and noi growth embedded in our guidance for same store operations during the second half of the year at the midpoint we expect revenue growth of about 6 we are confident in our revenue growth expectations because most of the growth is based on facts and existence today including maintaining july s expected average daily occupancy of 95 8 the earn in of existing leases and incremental commercial income from tenants who have resumed rent payments revenue expected growth of approximately 200 basis points is based on continued improvements in average daily occupancy lower bad debt expense including government assistance payments continuing at a level similar to the 700 000 received in the second quarter and the contribution from 3 700 leases remaining to be executed at rates expected to be 6 to 8 above expiring lease next on july 27 the air board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0 44 per share a 2 increase from the dividend paid in may this increase is due to higher revenue results also due to the air business model which features peer leading efficiency and conversion of higher top line to bottom line providing a flow through rate to shareholders of 10 higher than peer average i ll conclude with four quick comments about next year first we have the opportunity for substantial revenue growth in 2022 from the earn in of the current 10 loss to lease continued improvements and average daily occupancy and lower bad debt expense second more of our revenue will convert to ffo and dividends because of air s pure leading flow through rates third we expect increasing contribution from the acquisition of city center and fourth we expect a significant reduction in interest expense from lower borrowings at lower rates when you add it all together we can see that 2022 is shaping up to be a very good year with that we will now open the call for questions please limit your questions to two per time in the queue rocco i ll turn over to you for the first question questions and answers operator thank you sir today s first question comes from alex kalmus with zelman associates please go ahead alexander kalmus zelman associates analyst hi thank you for taking the question in the supplement you discussed the moody s rating and how that could potentially change later in the year after you execute some of your deleveraging what incremental benefits you think you ll achieve in that process versus where you already have with the s p investment grade rating terry considine chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes alex thank you for that question what we desire with the potential of a moody s rating is continued optionality and by having both an investment grade rating from moody s and s p it provides us greater opportunity to the debts of public capital markets and as you know today bond pricing is quite attractive and many of our activities during the course over the past six months since the establishment of air have been leading us toward the path of providing that optionality most notably an increase in our pool of properties that are unencumbered by debt and it has increased by 50 just in the past six months alexander kalmus zelman associates analyst got it thank you and turning to the dispositions you gave some numbers but just curious how the waiting will look like in 3q and 4q and what do you think that will due to the portfolio in terms of percentage of asset class so do you expect to have a little more weighting in a or b or c post dispositions terry considine chairman of the board and chief executive officer alex i ll start with that if somebody else wants to jump in please feel free the impact of the third quarter will actually be not consequential because the only real change between now and then is the acquisition of city center the transactions we ve been discussing are expected to close in the fourth quarter so if we project to year end as i mentioned in the prepared remarks our allocation to new york and chicago will come down the chicago portfolio is kind of a b plus a minus portfolio the new york portfolio is a c plus and so you ll see some shifts in our waitings from that factor but i think longer term what we want to do is remain diversified we want to remain diversified in both price points and in geography and we think the steps that we are undertaking will help accomplish that goal alexander kalmus zelman associates analyst got it thank you very much operator and our next question today comes from nick joseph with citi please go ahead nick joseph citi analyst thanks as you think about redeploying those proceeds from the asset sales what is the coupon on the debt that you re planning to repay and then what are the prepayment penalties associated with it terry considine chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah nick we re planning today to primarily repay property debt with the proceeds from the sales to reduce our leverage again to help reduce our non recourse property level debt down to levels that are more in line with the moody s targets the average cost of that debt we haven t finalized each piece of paper that we re going to repay but i would tell you it s going to come down from the 4 6 that we repaid in the second quarter it ll be more likely in the mid 3 range and so there will be prepayment penalties associated with that the exact amount again will be determined by the actual pieces repaid but what i will tell you as we run the numbers we expect that the interest that will be saved in future years is greater than the prepayment penalty on an npv basis nick joseph citi analyst thanks are you able to provide a range on that and i think last quarter you had at least given kind of a range for the potential prepayment penalties terry considine chairman of the board and chief executive officer not at this point nick in april when we spoke we had already identified the specific pieces of debt that were going to be repaid nick joseph citi analyst thanks and then as you think about your south florida portfolio are there any additional engineering studies or reinspections that are needed just given kind of the tragedy that happened down there lisa r cohn executive vice president general counsel and secretary thanks for the question we routinely work with structural engineers and architects and others as we re doing any work on our properties as well as any work that s being done on adjacent properties and routinely inspect our properties for their 40 year inspections and additionally and so we have no known issues we are just in an abundance of caution going to go back and take another look both to ensure that we haven t missed anything which i don t think we have but also just for peace of mind for our residents and teammates who work in those buildings nick joseph citi analyst thanks operator and the next question today comes from john kim of bmo capital markets please go ahead john kim bmo capital markets analyst thank you i just wanted to ask for more color on the rental uplift you had at city center how much of this was due to the market strength versus the air initiatives and what do you think you did that the prior owner didn t terry considine chairman of the board and chief executive officer i found that question hard to hear because of fluctuation in sound would you mind repeating it please john kim bmo capital markets analyst sure just some more color on city center and what you may have done that the prior owner didn t to get that rental uplift and how much of that conversely was due to the market strength keith m kimmel president property operations john it s keith i ll take it for you really john we can t believe we have a team who operates our buildings who doesn t put a ceiling on the opportunities in front of them and what i would say is is that what we did is when we walked on to the property and we looked how we were performing at our other communities in an around the south florida area we could see that there was opportunity to push it much much further we also think that there could be even more upside as we actually make improvements to the community so this was literally a day one walk on site bring in our team and increase it and then of course not to be missed the south florida market is very very red hot there s lots of people that are moving there and there s lots of benefits of living in florida that is augmenting the performance john kim bmo capital markets analyst okay and on the new lease change that you had in july you mentioned it was led by miami and san diego but it was really broad brush across your portfolio can you remind us how much of that uplift was due to rents versus the reduction of concession terry considine chairman of the board and chief executive officer john really what has happened is that we have actually moved beyond that because what has happened is we ve had a reversion to the mean of those asking rents that were pre covid and now we ve exceeded what would have been the historic trend lines so what we re really seeing is not only a recovery but an acceleration that is happening as the business is getting even better and so while of course lot of people talk about concessions and coming back what we really are focused on is we ve gone past that mark and we re seeing growth in strength that goes well beyond that john kim bmo capital markets analyst and what is your expectation for august and september terry considine chairman of the board and chief executive officer to be better than july john kim bmo capital markets analyst for both terry considine chairman of the board and chief executive officer indeed john kim bmo capital markets analyst okay thank you operator and our next question today comes from john pawlowski with green street please go ahead john pawlowski green street advisors analyst thanks maybe just one follow up on the florida acquisition is that 160 bps yield expansion should we think about that like year 3 yield or as you look at the time to put the capital into the building and achieve that up terry considine chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes john thank you for the question and your thoughts on timing is right on line with our plan and how we re going to be executing it we are starting the refreshment and improvement process as soon as we re able to mobilize and implement the plan so that s starting very soon but the completion of that work and then the full earn in of that work as reflected in our results will end up being in our numbers in the third year john pawlowski green street advisors analyst okay terry considine chairman of the board and chief executive officer hey john i m sorry i just left out a portion of something i should have said is that our going in yield today at 4 2 is quite strong on a relative cap rate basis but we re going to see that expand in year two and eventually end up at that close to 6 range in the third year so you ll see nice expansion in both years and year three it s not just a hockey stick in the third year john pawlowski green street advisors analyst understood i joined the call late so apologies if i missed this as we stand here today do you anticipate additional acquisitions this year terry considine chairman of the board and chief executive officer hey john this is terry and we are always looking for opportunities for accretive uses of shareholder capital john pawlowski green street advisors analyst all right last one from me terry when can we expect to hear additions to the board or new board members showing in terry considine chairman of the board and chief executive officer i think soon john pawlowski green street advisors analyst soon as in months or couple of years or terry considine chairman of the board and chief executive officer soon soon john john pawlowski green street advisors analyst all right thank you for the time operator our next question today comes from rich anderson of smbc please go ahead richard anderson smbc nikko securities america inc analyst hey good morning everybody so the strength that we re seeing in the sunbelt reminds me of mid 2000 in essex in california and the hyper growth that was coming out of that market back then and like everything else nothing lasts forever but i m wondering if maybe the rules are a little bit different this time if covid has created a permanent stigma on some of the coastal markets namely california and the ability to push rents particularly in the sunbelt is more of a permanent condition in your mind or do you think there would be more of a reversion to the mean between sunbelt and coastal gateway within the next few years or so terry considine chairman of the board and chief executive officer rich good morning and it s terry i ll try and take a cut at it we re comparing two different markets with two different dynamics the sunbelt market is today fantastic but it s in a context where money is free and the increases in profitability will attract competitive new supply you can see the record level of completions over 27 000 i think it is in dallas and houston and so that will be the dynamic there that there ll be tremendous economic growth and employment growth but over time the rental growth will be governed by the cost of competitive new supply in the coastal market or specifically in california which was your question the demand is great it s existing today it s unsatisfied today and there is a period of time where a building can be absorbed by existing demand and it remains hard to build and so the competitive new supply will be more constrained it is certainly correct that california is less of a golden state than it was a decade ago or two decades ago and that it s dealing with difficult social and political issues and it s something that makes us want to keep an eye on it richard anderson smbc nikko securities america inc analyst okay great and then keith to your or maybe paul to your comments about 2022 specifically on the earn in it seems to me the upside in 2022 might be more impressive in the first half of the year as opposed to the second half of the year assuming the earn in kind of only plays a role in the first part of the first half of the year is that the right way to think about it and for the full year 2022 to be sort of equally impressive you need you just need market rent growth to continue to at this state or greater for the stack half of next year to keep things is that a fair way to think about it keith m kimmel president property operations rich it definitely is a good way to think about it because as we are gaining momentum in these rates and transactions that are occurring now when you kick off a new year they will start earning in against what would have been a lower comp but the truth is that when we look at that loss to lease it is spread over our portfolio and so there will be opportunities throughout the entire year for us to reprice and our expectation is that we will continue to see rate growth on trend that will go through the balance of 2022 in addition richard anderson smbc nikko securities america inc analyst okay great thanks very much everyone operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes your question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any final remarks terry considine chairman of the board and chief executive officer well rocco thank you very much for hosting us today for those of you who have questions for air we thank you for your interest if you have further questions please feel free to call paul or me and we

president and ceo and jim ajello senior vice president of finance cfo and treasurer following their prepared remarks we will open the line for your questions now it s my pleasure to turn the call over to maria maria m pope president and chief executive officer good morning and thank you all for joining us the june heatwave and a rebounding economy tell the story for the quarter turning to slide 4 we reported net income of 32 million or 0 36 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2021 this compares with net income of 39 million or 0 43 for the second quarter of 2020 in light of economic growth and the accelerated recovery we are revising our earnings guidance to 2 70 in 2 85 per diluted share up from 2 55 to 2 70 and are reaffirming our 4 to 6 long term earnings growth guidance total revenues increased 14 as a result of higher retail energy deliveries as well as higher energy usage during the recent heat wave to meet this greater demand we purchased additional power at high prices compounded by low hydro and wind conditions across the region operating expenses increased driven by investment in resiliency in advance of the wildfire season as well as higher administrator and other expenses later in the call jim will review second quarter results in more detail he will also provide regulatory and capital updates as well as discuss the outlook for the rest of the year for the third time within the last 12 months we have experienced unprecedented weather events in late june a historic heat wave cost temperatures to soar to 116 degrees record heat was not only unique in its intensity but also duration on the hottest day we served a record load of 4 441mw compared to the previous record of just over 4 000mw more than two decades ago through it all and thanks to the dedication of our co workers and ongoing investments in generation great infrastructure improved work management processes as well as disaster preparation and training we maintained strong reliability in these times the full impact in importance of what we do is most evident i want to acknowledge that the heat event was not just a challenge for our business and our system it was also a human challenge for the people who live in our communities looking out for the safety of customers and serving our communities is and always will be our focus and priority this june as well as other extraordinary weather events our team delivered i cannot overstate my gratitude to everyone at pge first responders and our community partners while temperature is spiking to this extreme in the pacific northwest is unprecedented particularly so early in the year we were prepared we have prioritized assisted hardening and resiliency and we continue to see payoffs from building a smarter and more resilient grid our focus on preparedness is not isolated to our distribution system we ve also improved generation reliability especially under the stress of extreme weather our regional partnerships and supply agreements also enabled us to leverage surplus renewable energy across these extraordinary times partnerships with our customers to standby generation and demand response also played a critical role in ensuring reliability together these programs shave 63mw of our peak needs partnerships like these exemplify the spirit of oregonians and will significantly expand as we work together to meet the growing reliability and flexibility needs turning to slide 5 top of mind for everyone following the extreme heat wave is wildfire the bootleg wildfires currently burning in southern oregon near the california border is a stark example the vast majority of people in our service area live highly developed urban areas including 5 of oregon s 6 largest cities our region is also geographically different from california and southern oregon and historically we do not have the same climate vegetation forest or terrain as oregon s climate gets hotter and drier pge is doing more than ever to reduce risks and keep customers and oregon safe prevention detection and response are central to our approach including comprehensive risk analysis infrastructure investments as well as strong partnerships with local state and federal agencies wildfire is a top priority we are increasing vegetation management and deploying technologies such lidar and hyperspatial imaging to prioritize high risk areas we are expanding our use of automation remote monitoring and early alert systems such as line sensors reclosers and others we are installing fire resistant ductile iron transmission and distribution poles in priority wildfire areas modifying miles of transmission lines with tree wire better clearances and undergrounding in certain areas to enhanced monitoring and collaboration we ve improved detection and situational awareness and while our focus is on prevention and investing in our grid we are also expanding public safety power shut offs or psps zones as we work continuously to improve our number one priority is protecting the lives and property of our coworkers our customers and the communities we serve while the actions we re taking to provide safe reliable power is essential there is an urgent need to address the underlying conditions driving climate change to that end oregon lawmakers recently passed significant clean energy legislation enabling us to advance our shared goals of 80 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and 100 by 2040 while we continue to work through the irp processes this still affords us the opportunity to extend our green community tariff programs and the transportation electrification bill that enable us to further support ev adoption the key infrastructures up to and behind the meter additional important aspects of the legislation focus this past session is on low income customers social justice in those areas traditional left behind energy efficiency and the public purchase chart as well as important modifications to outdated energy laws dating back more than 2 decades overall this collaboration among stakeholders from across industry the public sector the business community and environmental organizations social justice community and equity groups resulted in the most significant clean energy standards in the country we look forward to continuing these partnerships working together expanding our renewable energy portfolio integrating distributed energy resources and continuing to invest in a reliable and resilient grid while this quarter once again presented challenges years of investment and planning prepared us well as we look forward we are encouraged by the growth of our region expanding high tech and digital sectors and continued in migration i ll now turn it over to jim for more detail jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer thanks maria this has certainly been a year of unprecedented weather events which further underscores the impacts of climate change on our business but also highlights how the investments we are making position us to tackle the challenges ahead i ll begin this morning with commentary on the economy and load growth oregon s economy continues to recover as we emerge from the pandemic and is showing signs of vitality once again as of july 27 approximately 68 of eligible oregonians have had at least one vaccine shot and at the end of june oregon is fully reopened and safety protocols are lifted the oregon economic and revenue forecast in may of 2021 stated and i quote the outlook for the near term economic growth is the strongest in decades if not generations through june unemployment in the tri county portland area was 5 6 an improvement from just over 6 in the first quarter we continue to see growth in the high tech and digital services with commercial recovery taking place at a brisk pace the recovery of the commercial segment was a contributor to our strong year over year load growth turning to slide 6 as maria said we reported 0 36 per share compared to 0 43 per share in the second quarter of 2020 year to date june earnings per diluted share is 1 43 which compares to 1 34 in the comparable period of 2020 i ll cover our financial performance quarter over quarter on slide 7 first we saw 0 04 a decrease in gross margin off a strong second quarter in 2020 where we experienced very low power costs revenues increased 14 both due to the acceleration of covid 19 recovery with our commercial and industrial customers and higher usage due to weather offsetting these increases were higher power costs to serve these higher loads purchase power and fuel costs increased 70 for the quarter primarily due to higher regional demand during the extreme weather we experienced in preparation for the june high heat event we procured more expensive power in the market to ensure we had extra resources at the ready for reliability our fixed plan to o m expenses were lower and increased earnings by 0 03 as we reduced maintenance expenses at our thermal generation facility facilities this was partially offset by higher distribution expense related to restoration activities during the june heat wave and work that was delayed from the february storms to prepare system in advance the wildfire system we did not spare effort or resources to respond to these events administrative expenses decreased earnings 0 04 as a result of higher legal and benefits expenses and finally there was a 0 02 decrease in tax expense from fewer ptcs production tax credits due to less wind generation turning to slide 8 earlier this month we filed a general rate case with the oregon public utilities commission to review our cost providing service and approve new prices to take effect in 2022 we have not filed a rate case since 2018 and our decision to delay pardon me filing into the middle of this year was in consideration of the timing of customer bill impacts as well as the impact of covid 19 on the community the overall price increase of 3 9 reflects nearly 1 billion of investment to upgrade our system to deliver safe reliable and clean electricity to customers specifically our proposed costs for recovery include projections to keep our system wildfires safe and resilient from weather and disaster related crisis technology to upgrade the grid including our integrated operation centers set to open by the end of this year the repowering of our faraday hydro facility and most importantly we have made investments in hundreds of individual projects large and small to modernize strengthen and upgrade our t d system for customer growth enhanced reliability and resilience we work with stakeholders in this regulatory process which should take approximately 10 months to complete with new prices expected to be effective in may of 2022 the procedural schedule for this docket is expected to be established in the coming weeks our rfp process for new renewables is in progress with independent evaluator selection moving forward as scheduled we are still planning on issuing the rfp this upcoming november and bidding one or more benchmark resources into the process regarding our deferrals related to the february storms we continue to expect a decision from the opuc on the approval of these expenses in 2022 through june 30 we have deferred 52 million related to the february storms we re confident in the recovery of these costs as they were prudently incurred in response to the unique and unprecedented nature of these storms cost recovery and approval of wildfires and covid 19 expenses remain in their respective dockets turning to slide 9 which shows our capital forecast through 2025 our capital plan remains on track and the investments we have made in grid maintenance and reliability have demonstrated their value to customers during the june heatwave and i am reaffirming that we will not need to issue equity in 2021 on slide 10 we continue to maintain a solid balance sheet including strong liquidity and investment grade ratings accompanied by a stable outlook we expect to fund 2021 capital expenditures and long term debt maturities with cash from operations during 2021 which is expected to range from 575 million to 625 million we are revising this range downward from 600 million to 650 million to represent the cash timing difference of regulatory deferrals we have more than adequate capital and access to additional capital in order to support our system and our planned investments we are still planning on a long term debt issuance later this year up to 400 million which will refinance the short term note issued earlier this year and satisfy our 2022 requirements turning to slide 11 our first half 2021 performance has been strong and we are well on track to achieve long term earnings growth guidance of 4 to 6 from the 2019 base year we are raising our year over year annual energy deliveries guidance from to 2 5 to 3 from 1 to 1 5 this reflects robust economic growth in our service territory and an accelerated recovery from 2019 pandemic 2019 at a quicker pace than anticipated we anticipate recovery to continue into the third and fourth quarter with slight declines in residential usage as individual spend less time at home looking ahead seasonal conditions in the region we anticipate above average heat and wildfire potential this season due to the drought and the hot and dry extended forecast we expect this to peak in the pacific northwest during august and september in anticipation of these conditions we are increasing our operating and maintenance expense forecast for wildlife fire mitigation and vegetation management and a series of other items which is increasing o m by 10 million for the full year to invest in the reliability and resiliency of our system given this performance and our expectations for the second half of the year we are raising our earnings guidance from 2 55 to 2 70 to a new guidance level of 2 70 to 2 85 per diluted share in summary i am optimistic on our outlook for the second half of the year and i m confident in the long term prospects of the business and now operator we re ready for questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of insoo kim with goldman sachs maria m pope president and chief executive officer hello insoo insoo kim goldman sachs analyst hi hi maria hi guys my first question is for jim just on the financial side i just want to understand the the raising of the guidance here is it just a combination of i know you ve had some tax benefits in the first quarter from the timing of regulatory items as well as the higher demand that you re talking about the user experience which were i m assuming above what you had forecasted i know part of that demand is decoupled but given the robust industrial demand is this all taking into like what gives you the confidence of the high range jardon jaramillo senior director of investor relations treasury and risk management yeah thanks insoo i think i think you ve got the right trend here so we did have the benefit in the first quarter of 0 09 as it were so that was off the midpoint of about 2 63 2 64 of the what i ll call the prior guidance plus we looked at this additional demand and we took that into account obviously offsetting that there is some headwinds with weather some additional o m expense that we just talked about so net net we ve done a lot of sensitivities around this so there is some puts and takes but we re comfortable on this in this new range i think you ve got it pretty well covered insoo kim goldman sachs analyst got it and related to that when we think about 22 obviously there is some there s a lot of moving parts there is the ongoing rate case with we ll play out sometime in 22 and just given some of the increased o m that you re doing this year to increase the reliability i m just wondering on your thoughts on that 22 earnings power with that four to six growth off of the 19 eps do you still feel like that s the right way to think about it when given the different types of outcomes that could come out of the rate case and different operating expense items jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer yes i think we need to see a little more line of sight into 22 before we discuss that guidance range which we ll do in february of that year so you re quite right o m is a factor you ve hit another important point i will note that even though we have just raised the guidance on o m for very good reasons if you look back at where we were in 2019 i expect this year s o m to come in at that same level 2 to 3 years later so i think we ve got strong performance in o m we ve got different challenges obviously in the grid and with weather but we re holding our own in terms of keeping o m at reasonable levels and it s almost spot on to where it would be if i m right about this year in terms of 2019 so i feel pretty good about that actually insoo kim goldman sachs analyst got it and just one more if i could maria it seems like over the past few quarters and every time we ve had this call there has been another unprecedented natural event that s happened and hopefully it s not a normal type of event but if this proves to be a bit more frequent or if that s maybe the growth expectations are there are you having conversations with the stakeholders on what type of maybe lower hanging fruit type of investments that you as the utilities could make even more than above and beyond what you re already doing for reliability you ve mentioned some undergrounding and whatnot but just curious on your general thoughts there maria m pope president and chief executive officer sure as we work with stakeholders and really firefighter professionals people who are first responders disaster recovery specialists and others we look at a variety of risks and even though we haven t experienced which seems hard to believe given the last 12 months that we ve had and with each one of our crisis that we ve had we ve emerged stronger we ve taken the learnings and reflected them immediately in our planning and how we do our work we still have much work to do and we will continue to assess the risks as we go forward and work collaboratively as well as with regulators insoo kim goldman sachs analyst understood thank you so much maria m pope president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of julien dumoulin smith with bank of america julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst hi good morning can you hear me jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer hi yes julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst excellent and congratulations on the outcomes here truly exceptional and in fact to that end and i m using the word exceptional on purpose i m trying to understand what s level of confidence here as you think about this load growth trend not just through the back half of this year because clearly your guidance range insinuates that but rather more structurally i mean it s obviously your service territory sits in a special place outside of california etc and certainly we ve seen some of your neighbors point you very exceptional load growth trends themselves just yesterday so i m just curious how do you think about this on a sort of a multi year basis and how does that sort of accrued of the business from a capex from a rate affordability perspective etc just thinking about sort of the bigger picture consequences maria m pope president and chief executive officer so julien first of all thank you and second we ve been talking for a couple of years about the robust nature of our service territory we are very fortunate to operate and to serve in area where people want to be where they are expanding their businesses particularly in digital and high tech and where we see people are interested in moving to so we are very fortunate to have the opportunity to serve the additional growth as well as invest in enhanced reliability resiliency and i would also note that oregonians are very clear on wanting a clean energy future and that was center to some of the legislation that was just passed this session which in many instances is not too different than our own goals as a company but further demonstrates the interest in a clean energy future within the state in the region julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst got it excellent and then i mean can we speak a little bit to the backdrop on this rate case and the ability to do this resolve any of these issues in a more settlement type fashion i was just curious i know we re early this is an evident question but obviously especially considering the load growth and your cost management efforts i suspect that certainly easily some of the sharper considerations around any case maria m pope president and chief executive officer so as you know we we have a tradition or a history of collaboration in selling our rate cases we work hand in glove with our with interveners and with stakeholders not just in rate case processes but in many other dockets we felt very strongly going into this rate case that we still have while things feel very robust much of our economy is still fragile and there are still many that are impacted by covid and are still struggling so we worked very hard to keep our price increases as affordable and as low as possible and also to keep the number of issues down we have a lot of issues that are of strategic importance in front of our commission and so we really focused on a couple of mechanisms decoupling in our outage restoration mechanism and then really on planning for the future with regards to coal strip and exiting any generation of coal that we re associated with let me let jim spend a little bit more time on that because that s an important component here jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer so yesterday we entered into a nearly unanimous settlement agreement regarding our depreciation study which was filed earlier in the year with the exception of one party we filed with the puc our new depreciation study agreement which will come into rates of course in this 2022 case one of the important features is the accelerated depreciation of the coal strip expense to 2025 so we have already i think demonstrated in an important way related to this case and of course the future and our desire to get to exit any of the coal investment here that we have in colstrip at a much earlier date so i think that s a that s an important development it s really the first development we can talk about vis a vis this case julien if you caught that one julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst got it and i m sorry to squeeze in another one but you ve got a lot going on here and it really comes back to when could we be in a position to review this growth rate on the more comprehensive base i mean you ve clearly seen your peers across west coast really ramp their spending and litigation efforts on wildfires at the same time resource adequacy perhaps as acute and as concerning as we ve seen in several decades and hydro is no exception to this you all have a resource procurement underway as it stands already i mean there are myriad factors if you are in considerations although the timing is important you know ultimately if i were to summarize that how and when do we get sort of an integrated and comprehensive view on spending in earnings growth jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer yeah i think you re hitting on a very important topic we will look at this rate of growth towards the end of the year as we prepare for 2022 i think you ve already identified one of the important variables which is growth for me we ve got to watch this transition out of covid 19 into a regular economy the residential load is probably going to dip a little bit commercial load is increasing as a transitional matter that was the sector of the economy that was hit the hardest and then i think you and insoo probably referred to something that i think is really important which is the structural and sustaining of value and growth of our industrial loads i mean i think that is here to stay and it s growing very rapidly this composite should allow us to look at the future a little differently perhaps think about growth a little differently perhaps think about capex a little differently which is equals growth in this business so that s on the table not today because we re watching a transition out of the pandemic right and we re watching very volatile load numbers very volatile weather conditions and so we re going to take all that into account towards the end of the year and talk more fully about that in february but i am frankly very pleased with the growth in that we ve got we ve just got to manage the grid in these volatile weather conditions so there are puts and takes there is some tailwinds and headwinds against your question here so if you could be patient we ll sort this out julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst excellent i wish you the best of luck thank you jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer thank you maria m pope president and chief executive officer thanks julien operator your next question comes from the line of peter bourdon with mizuho securities peter bourdon mizuho securities analyst hi thanks for taking my question maria m pope president and chief executive officer thank you peter bourdon mizuho securities analyst sure so just a follow up on that in regard to the rate case that was filed is that reflective of the updated kind of growth viewe or is that more of the 1 long term view maria m pope president and chief executive officer it reflects the best information that we have i would say that what jim noted was a tremendous amount of volatility and probably at an unprecedented nature one of the other things that s coming at us is higher inflation clearly both on the wage side as well as the material side we are managing through a complex supply chain with no implications to our operations but clearly there are a number of other issues in front of us that we we are all dealing with as we move forward jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer let me add peter what so just without getting too detailed so the case was filed based on a load forecast as maria said the best we had in hand in the march timeframe what is normal in these cases and what will happen here as we will update that load forecast in the september time frame as discussions proceed with the regulator intervener so there s a bit of a catch up there and so that is infused into the case as it sort of picks up momentum for discussions peter bourdon mizuho securities analyst okay thank you that that certainly helps and then just to clarify jim the first quarter 0 09 tax benefit that you had mentioned that is inclusive or are included in the updated guidance that s correct jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer that is correct peter bourdon mizuho securities analyst okay thank you jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer sure operator your next question comes from of sophie karp with keybanc sophie karp keybanc analyst hi good morning congrats on a good quarter and thank you for taking my question i was curious guys if you could give us more color on the volume growth here so clearly it has been a very strong quarter but do you have a sense of how much of that is coming from accounts growth people and or businesses moving in as opposed to just a cyclical rebound off of covid disruption last year jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer yeah so sophie thank you and good morning so yeah this is a little bit hard to parse right now right because what we cite numbers in our growth and of course weather adjusted fashion so that we ve got we ve got weather adjusted retail deliveries increased 8 i ve not seen that in this jurisdiction of course i m fairly new to it but historically speaking that s quite high we ve got i would say a lot of industrial growth that s come in i think we re also the third largest region in terms of in migration of residential folks and our commercial as i said a moment ago to peter is rebounding rapidly but in terms of net growth it s hard to pin that right now sophie karp keybanc analyst got it do you expect that at some point you will be able to kind of do we need the data and maybe update the long term forecast like of growth to reflect that so we can extrapolate something or how do you how do you think about that maria m pope president and chief executive officer absolutely sophie and what will be important is we put a few more quarters under us we will be able to see through trends when you get into extreme tail events like we have been experiencing you don t have a lot of data to rely upon and so it s helpful to put a few more quarters behind us in terms of what we re seeing in terms of digital high tech growth in migration jim noted what is really going to happen with a commercial versus residential i think is still to be determined so far the trends are looking good but it s too early to call jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer yeah sophie just maybe highlight one other point it s a pretty volatile situation at the moment given the transition in the economy i saw this at the end of june april and may were steaming along quite well in terms of earnings expectations and we hit june we had to enter into the market as i said earlier to purchase additional power resources and we had some distribution work in the field which caused june to be a very different month than we even expected so i m just referring that one month and sort of signaling that the quarter could have even been considerably better but for the volatility of weather in the power procurement and the distribution work we had to do in the field which is all necessary it s all job one all higher priority but it shows you how volatile this could be so well as maria said we want to see a little more time and some more results before we can look to the longer trends but we ll update you sophie karp keybanc analyst got you got you thank you and then maybe on guidance and sort of view you re raising guidance and that s great but with that said we kind of go into the peak wildfire season in august and september as you also noted i guess as it relates to this particular situation what would be something some items to watch as it relates to your guidance jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer well i mean i would only answer it this way when we calculate the guidance we obviously take into account some of the recent learnings we have so i can i can tell you that we built sensitivities for additional cost power cost other cost on the o m side and the like in terms of anticipating this we can t accurately calculate what will happen with weather but i will i will tell you that new guidance reflects sensitivities we have for events out of our control let s put it that way so there is it s embedded in our guidance this notion of the weather volatility the additional power costs and o m expense that could occur as a result sophie karp keybanc analyst all right so let s say if we had fairly fairly quiet wildfire season then it would be potential further upside to your numbers because you baked in some contingency for that jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer what i would say to you that the top of our range contemplates that sophie karp keybanc analyst got you thanks so much operator your next question comes from david peters with wolfe research david peters wolfe research analyst yeah hi good morning guys jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer hi dave david peters wolfe research analyst i was just wondering if you could maybe provide some additional color on the recent clean energy legislation that was signed i know this was in line with your goals as the company but are there areas that you think could be to incremental and of investment opportunities versus the plan that you currently have outlined and just what processes would you need to work through before you maybe see some of that come to fruition maria m pope president and chief executive officer sure so it was an extensive a legislative focus on clean energy on the grid on the reliability and resiliency overall and as you look at really the headline is 80 reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 90 by 2035 and 100 by 2040 obviously that latter part is more aspirational dependent upon technological innovation but it s it s i think it s important that this acknowledges alignment with portland general s strategy for some time so we ll be working collectively with regulators and with stakeholders as we accelerate our clean energy future in addition it cleaned up some language that dates back to restructuring laws from 1999 and some other things like that it also includes with a strong focus on environmental justice and community support provisions we also saw an expansion of the community green tariffs we ve had community green tariffs in place for a while and this allows us to expand our programs to our customers who are interested in going further and faster with 100 clean energy sooner than the dates i just gave you we worked collaboratively with many cities and others to get this done and then i would also note transportation electrification as you know oregon is a leader in transportation electrification it was one of the center pieces of governor kate brown s tenure leading the western governors this past year and we will be we now enable through this legislation to do more in terms of infrastructure up to and behind the meter so really enabling a faster transition to a clean transportation sector and then finally there is issues around the public purchase charge which is really traditionally supported what the number one energy efficiency program in the country through the energy trust of oregon and the good work that they do making some adjustments but most importantly extending that to 2035 versus its prior expiration of 2025 so i would say that it s inclusive it s comprehensive it make sure that we are focused on all parts of our community in particular those who have traditionally been left behind as we move to a clean energy future we are very pleased with how things turned out and more importantly the relationships and partnerships built in the ongoing dialog where we re probably just in the beginning of that and have much to learn jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer david just to cap that off so this sets the table i think very well for the execution of our strategy for us now to step back and figure out how we want to cost out provide new products and implement so we re really pleased by the shape of it the comprehensive nature of it but now we re at the point where we can say how do we execute and what sort of investments do we want to make against that we re just at that beginning stage david peters wolfe research analyst great thank you and then maria i know you testified on behalf of the senator wyden bill initially just curious has there been any movement on that front recently or anything new that you could share maria m pope president and chief executive officer i think there is terrific conversations on i think there s lots of movement i m not going to forecast at all but key to that legislation is our normalization provisions and a fix that will level the playing field between regulated utilities and others to be able to adequately recognize investment tax credits for the benefit of customers and accelerate a clean energy future bringing additional participants to the table and i think really changing the face of how we think of energy going forward jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer and i think it s probably obvious to say but i ll say it anyway this could be meaningful in terms of the way that we implement the or respond to the rfp that we re anticipating in november so we re really hoping that this moves forward in maria leadership in this with the senator and others in the industry are hopeful david peters wolfe research analyst great thank you guys maria m pope president and chief executive officer thank you jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer thank you operator your next question comes from brian russo with sidoti brian russo sidoti analyst yeah hi good morning maria m pope president and chief executive officer hi brian jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer hi brian russo sidoti analyst i think most of my questions have been asked and answered but on the transport electrification bill and strategy that you re pursuing in front and behind the meter can you give us some examples are you you re referring to ev charging stations within your service territory or are you just talking the need for new substations to deliver more electricity to various areas to support ev maria m pope president and chief executive officer all of the above so it will be expanding and making our system more robust it will be additional cabling and infrastructure to get to charging stations and it will be charging stations in and of themselves so it is a broad piece of legislation that really will enable us to help in the transition to the transportation sector which we know is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in our economy to more rapidly expanding into the electric sector and being more efficient and cleaner jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer hey brian even before this legislation was implemented recently we ve been in discussions we have a dedicated team a very good team but in discussions with various fleet owners looking at larger rollouts on their behalf i think as you would probably know as well that the c i sector moves very quickly on these opportunities and we are very active in that space right now we have nothing to announce but i think that this is going to be an interesting opportunity this will be a place also where in the future years we ll allocate increasing amounts of capital to this kind of segment i think it could be a very important strategy for us and really a game changer over the longer term brian russo sidoti analyst great my follow up is going to be i suppose there is very little capex involved in ev right now and i was just curious to know what type of dollar opportunity of investment this could be especially with the governor s support and then any time of time frame in which that might occur jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer yeah we re sizing that right now and it s not something that will roll out today but increasingly we ll talk more about that as we as we do more make ready work at the backbone of the system ready as we do fleet transactions you ll hear more and more from us on that maria m pope president and chief executive officer there is some really nice synergies as we do this work and invest in the system for transportation because it makes our regular business serving customers homes businesses industry that much more reliable and updating equipment and infrastructure also as we move to being able to use battery storage to support the stability of the grid with bidirectional charging that will be very very helpful to overall reliability of the system as we bring on increasing amounts of renewables jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer and not to belabor the point but i would also add that while 63 megawatt showed up of demand resources here in the most recent heat event i think that connecting the dots as we as we roll out more te and use the battery systems out there increasingly we want to dramatically increase our ders and transportation of electrification is going to be one of those strategies that will that will be symbiotic with that brian russo sidoti analyst okay and then just clarification when we look at the second half of the year just for disclosures in the 10 q as of june in terms of net variable power costs and the pcam you re 6 million above but i think the forward look through the end of the year is that you re going to be below the dead man but within the sharing so that implies some meaningful swing in favor of power costs in the second half of the year is that the way to look at it jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer i think directionally you re correct i see it the same way so there is a benefit there i get the same 6 million above the baseline so i think i think you ve sized it correctly brian russo sidoti analyst so it was a midpoint of your guidance does it assume zero balance neither a benefit nor on power costs jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer yes i would say that s about right within certain minor degrees of difference yeah maria m pope president and chief executive officer and i would say what we re really looking at is a change in margin so you may have higher power costs but we may also have higher revenue we may have lower power costs but we may have lower revenue so i think we re beginning to look at this differently given the volatility of the weather events that we ve seen and likely we ll continue to see as julian noted resource adequacy issues remain significant for the pacific northwest and the entire west and we re just in a period of transition and a lot more volatility brian russo sidoti analyst got it understood thank you very much maria m pope president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes live andrew levi with hite edge andrew levi hite edge analyst hey guys can you hear me jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer yes andy andrew levi hite edge analyst good okay i was going to make sure that couple of questions i mean a lot of it s kind of been touched on but i guess my first question is really around the service territory and more stuff that you ve touched on as far as the economy is concerned so it seems that you re in a very unique situation within our industry and probably maybe the best service territory within the continental 48 so can you maybe touch on what the opportunities are around kind of looking at that that the fact that you have a lot of purchase power you also have needs for for growth on top of that and you have a colstrip as well so i know you re going to file this this plan later in the year but can you kind of give us an idea if this growth continues how your plans may may change for the on the upside maria m pope president and chief executive officer so andy given in the year that we ve yeah no i think i got it i think given the year that we went through we we ve learned a whole new appreciation for the word agility and i would say if we look at our rfp it s for 150 average megawatts on the capacity need of 287 as we look going forward clearly we re in a period of transition and we will work collaboratively with all the stakeholders to make sure that we continue to support and have energy for a stable and reliable grid and that will take a variety of different kinds of investments when i think of what it s going to take for a clean energy future a stable affordable grid it s going to really take an all of above set of solutions and our ability to integrate renewables our ability to integrate integrate distributed energy resources to work collaboratively with our customers particularly those who have flexible load options and to be able to deliver value in unique ways at each of our customer want and need for their businesses for their residences it s a tremendous opportunity and we re fortunate we ve been talking a long time about the growth that s coming and it s nice to see it arrive jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer andy i would say that maria is really referring to the next tranche right the 150 to 287 but to fulfill our goals in terms of decarbonization and the like we re going to see a lot more growth of renewables in this region so i think beyond the 2024 2025 delivery i look beyond this to new irps that will add many many hundreds more megawatts of renewable power as we go we do see an exit from coalstrip all right as i mentioned earlier the 2025 depreciation is it has been filed and i m hopeful about that so i i see a strong transition here and i see a lot more renewables coming on to accommodate this growth so i m looking i m looking towards the end of the decade not just this next tranche of opportunities and i m seeing sustained growth as you and julien have pointed out and that sustained growth will require that we add more resources to the system we have many more distributed energy resources transportation of electrification is only going to increase the growth opportunities that we now have so it s a very i think positive outlook for resources and growth as i look down the down the line andrew levi hite edge analyst and then i mean i have a follow up but also jim maria that the beauty of it is that that topline growth and that growth within the service territory also helps offset the need for rate increases not rate increases period but obviously softens softens that and then well maria m pope president and chief executive officer you re absolutely right andy just on that point i think it s really important that that we recognize that our ability to continue to serve customers and either energy provider does have a synergistic impact on all customers and our ability to invest in reliability and resiliency of the system andrew levi hite edge analyst and then the other opportunity i ve seen people kind of tend to look at the wildfires down in southern oregon as a risk but i guess i kind of you pointed out obviously your service territory is different and people should take a close look at that and that s very important but also i view what s happening in southern oregon and more importantly what s happening in california as a large opportunity for you as a company and for your customers to get a more reliable system so as as oregon grows and as the portland area grows the reliability around your grid is going it s always important but obviously to keep that growth going that grid needs to be reliable and to depend on power that s being imported from california and in other parts of the state have you guys kind of talked about with whether it s with the regulators or just internally and with other people power brokers in a better way to put it no pun intended within the state of oregon that some of this whether it s renewable generation or whatever you end up installing that a lot of that has to be done around the load centers and in a sense to take away that fire risk as far as supply as we saw in the june in the june event maria m pope president and chief executive officer so andy what you just articulated is core to our strategy around our integrated operation center which is to be able to manage that more of distributed generation resources as technology develops we will basically include battery storage as well as others to make this more reliable more resilient so you re absolutely correct and overall at the company we have an expression that we never let a good crisis go to waste never would we have thought that when we came up with that term going into the pandemic that we would see so many prices over the past 12 months but i can tell you we have become we ve emerged stronger out of every event that we ve dealt with we ve come together as a company and as a team and worked collaboratively with our partners our community leaders our customers first responders and people who really care about this region oregon and its future andrew levi hite edge analyst got it and then my last question is just really around dividend policy when do we get a kind of an update on that and i guess maybe that kind of goes lockstep and any update we may get whether it s after the rate case or fourth quarter call or whenever it may be when we get the capex refresh the growth rate refresh i assume there ll be some type of look assuming things are positive to look at the dividend policy as well jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer yeah i would add to your question that what s pending here is is to look at our growth rate and to look at our dividend i think we provide a very competitive dividend today we ve been at a cagar of 5 5 over multiple years now you saw the dividend from yesterday s announcement i see that rate we are at the quarter we had a dividend payout ratio of call it 60 61 so we re clearly in a pretty strong position there it does in part depend on the rate case and a few other factors but growing the dividend here as i see it is absolutely going to be a steady affair for us i think for the future but exactly how much it will be around that 5 5 average cagr that we ve been experiencing is yet to be determined so i think the dividend is a important part of our total return to shareholders and we expect to carry on that way andrew levi hite edge analyst okay thank you guys very much and go trailblazers right for next year maria m pope president and chief executive officer yeah jim ajello senior vice president of finance chief financial officer and treasurer okay maria m pope president and chief executive officer thank you and thank you all for joining us today we appreciate your interest in our company and we hope to connect with you in the near future and very least we ll see you next quarter thank you operator

projections or expectations for the future all such statements are forward looking statements and while they reflect our current expectations they involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance you should review our filings with the sec for more information regarding the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections or expectations we do not plan on publicly updating or revising any forward looking statements during the quarter we also refer to non gaap financial measures such as diluted adjusted ebitda adjusted net income or loss and free cash flow you can find reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings release which has been posted to our website huntsman com i will now turn the call over to peter huntsman our chairman ceo and president peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you ivan good morning everybody and thank you for taking the time to join us this morning let s start out on slide number three adjusted ebitda for our polyurethanes division in the second quarter was 208 million versus 31 million a year ago our polyurethanes division continued to improve posting 13 year on year volume growth and 18 adjusted ebitda margins our differentiated volume which includes our spray insulation automotive and elastomers businesses grew by 22 as a reminder during the second quarter we conducted a major turnaround at our mdi facility in rotterdam the netherlands this turnaround occurs once every four years with many third party supply facilities carrying out turnarounds at the same time downtime associated with the turnaround negatively impacted volumes and adjusted ebitda by approximately 35 million in the quarter this was 10 million more than we communicated to you last quarter as several third party issues delayed our start up and forced the plant to run at lower rates for an extended period in may and june the good news is is that this turnaround is behind us and operations at rotterdam have returned to normal excluding the impact of the rotterdam turnaround our total volumes would have grown at 22 year on year as we were essentially sold out on our mdi units worldwide we continue to see a strong recovery in our americas and asian regions with mdi volumes growing 15 and 13 respectively versus the first quarter significantly higher margins also drove year over year adjusted ebitda growth in the quarter higher average selling prices offset higher raw material costs and unplanned outages we believe that longer term supply and demand fundamentals in the mdi industry will remain balanced and margins will remain at a fairly healthy level for the foreseeable future growth in our core construction markets including insulation adhesives and coatings continue to lead the recovery in urethanes all these sectors saw growth on a quarter over quarter basis even in europe where we had both planned and unplanned disruptions associated with the rotterdam turnaround north american insulation businesses including spray foam and our composite wood products business remains solid as we see residential construction spending remaining robust and commercial construction spending picking up our order book for spray foam has never been stronger and we re implementing price increases to help offset higher raw material pricing and logistical costs elastomers which included our global footwear business is another core growth platform for polyurethanes and it continues to see strong recovery trends globally demand in both residential excuse me demand in both industrial and consumer markets within elastomers remained strong results would have been even better this past quarter had it not been for shortages and some key raw materials and higher logistical costs we expect our business to keep up the momentum for the remainder of 2021 our global automotive business significantly increased year over year due to favorable comparisons however volumes were down mid single digits compared to the first quarter due to the ongoing chip shortages which have resulted in lower production rates industrywide having said that global demand in our markets is strong and we were able to redirect volumes originally intended for the automotive market into markets utilizing similar chemistries our polyurethanes strategy is to upgrade the quality of our portfolio we will continue to redirect more of our plant s output to our differentiated businesses in bottom slice lower margin component business we will invest in our downstream businesses organically and where it makes sense through bolt on acquisitions where we can generate higher and more stable margins through long term contracts in our components business we are doing so our splitter investment in geismar louisiana is consistent with this strategy once completed the new splitter will allow us to produce more higher value mdi molecules while maintaining the same total plant output this investment is progressing very well we re seeing strong demand for materials that are the output of this project and we re moving aggressively to complete this project as soon as possible to take advantage of these conditions we now expect to complete construction at the end of the first quarter 2022 earlier than originally planned once fully operational we expect this project to contribute 30 million in incremental adjusted ebitda on an annual basis and expect to see stronger margins next year as a result of our earlier than planned completion our po mtbe joint venture with sinopec in china where we own a 49 interest continues to benefit from very strong margins and is driving above average equity earnings we do see our equity earnings associated with this joint venture being lower in the second half of the year when compared to the first half of 2021 overall we remain very positive about the trends that we are seeing in polyurethanes globally demand is solid and the industry is toggling between balanced and tight at this point in time substitution will continue to help drive mdi growth and our sustainable solutions products which deliver increased energy agency are expected to follow trends that will have a very positive impact on mdi demand for the foreseeable future looking into the third quarter we see general demand fundamentals remaining solid or better and lower turnaround costs are already impacting the bottom line of the business in a positive manner even with typical seasonality and lower joint venture earnings equity earnings we would expect our polyurethanes third quarter adjusted ebitda to be between 240 million and 260 million turning to slide number four let s talk about our performance products segment which reported an adjustment an adjusted ebitda of 88 million compared to 29 million in last year s second quarter the improvement in this division was partially due to a strong finish in the first quarter with sales migrating into the second quarter the division also benefited from stronger pricing and margins due to tighter markets competitor outages and better pricing discipline accordingly our amines and maleic portfolio has recovered quicker and performed better than we expected at the beginning of the year delivering over 20 adjusted ebitda margins in the second quarter performance products strong financial results not just in the second quarter but increasingly across the last several quarters reflect a refresh of the business strategy implemented after the sale of our chemical intermediates and surfactants businesses this division is focused on targeted growth in our specialty amines carbonate and catalysts while driving commercial excellence across the entire segment including our maleic anhydride business these changes are already bearing fruit and are expected to have a meaningful positive impact on earnings moving forward volumes in our performance products segments were up 25 versus favorable comparisons in last year s second quarter and importantly are now at or above 2019 demand levels in most of the division s core markets leading the way are amines used in polyurethane catalysts construction and composite markets construction demand is also having a favorable impact on maleic anhydride volumes sold into upr opportunities to make bolt on acquisitions in this segment tend to be more limited and in some cases do not exist as we are building new markets as such performance products remains focused on driving growth primarily through high return low capital organic investments these investments include projects to develop catalysts serving the voc free polyurethanes market ultrapure carbonates into lithium batteries and high purity amines used in semiconductor manufacturing we expect these investments will begin contributing in a meaningful way in the next two to three years we see overall demand for performance products offerings remaining solid for the foreseeable future in the third quarter while there will be some typical seasonality planned turnaround and more balanced amine markets we still expect third quarter adjusted ebitda to be between 75 million and 80 million let s turn to slide number five advanced materials reported adjusted ebitda of 58 million in the quarter a significant improvement year over year driven primarily by the continuing recovery of our core industrial businesses and improving contributions from our recent acquisitions excluding the acquisition of gabriel performance products sales revenue in advanced materials increased to 42 compared to the second quarter of 2020 generating adjusted ebitda margins of 19 aerospace results were flat in the quarter versus the prior year although we saw another quarter of sequential improvement which we expect to see again in the third quarter we still think a full recovery to pre pandemic levels in this segment will take another year or two given our exposure to the wide body planes used more in international travel but we re encouraged that the recovery is tracking better than we had anticipated earlier this year excluding aerospace sales in our other core specialty businesses experienced growth year over year and are now slightly above 2019 levels additionally the integration of cvc thermoset specialties and gabriel performance products continues on plan we remain confident that we will achieve the total run rate synergies of 23 million we communicated at the time each of these respective transactions were announced overall our advanced materials division is tracking well and our aerospace and as aerospace recovers we expect this position to consistently generate adjusted ebitda margins in excess of 20 we will continue to grow this division organically and through targeted bolt on acquisitions third quarter adjusted ebitda for advanced materials should look similar quarter over quarter subject to typical seasonality and be between 50 million and 55 million moving to slide number six our textile effects division reported an adjusted ebitda of 28 million for the second quarter the recovery in earnings has been given has been driven by higher sales which more than doubled compared to the second quarter a year ago and demand has returned to pre pandemic levels in our key markets we saw volume improvements across every product category when compared to the prior year and generated 14 adjusted ebitda margins in the second quarter consumer sentiment in the us and europe continues to improve and retail store traffic and sales in each region are showing positive signs sustainability within the retail channel remains a focus for our customers and for us this macro trend favors our leading technologies that are environmentally friendly in areas such as water reduction which continues to gain share some of our asian customers were adversely affected by the renewed restrictions associated with the return of higher numbers of covid cases in certain regions toward the end of the quarter while we are watching these dynamics closely we still see adjusted fda in the third quarter to be well above pre pandemic levels before sharing some concluding thoughts i d like to turn a few minutes over to phil lister our chief financial officer philip m lister executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you peter turning to slide seven we were pleased to see the continuation of a strong recovery across the portfolio adjusted ebitda increased by 280 million year over year and by 45 million or 16 quarter over quarter the improvement in ebitda from the prior quarter is in spite of an approximate 35 million impact from the extended turnaround at our rotterdam mdi facility in particular we were pleased with the performance of both the advanced materials and the performance products divisions both of which achieved strong adjusted ebitda margins in the quarter and where we are investing inorganically and organically to grow these two divisions the increase in volumes year on year is primarily attributed to strong growth since the depth of the global pandemic across the majority of our portfolio and businesses variable margins significantly improved leading to adjusted ebitda margins moving into the high teens at 17 sales price increases exceeded some rapid increases in raw materials which have occurred since the beginning of the year turning to slide eight we continue to make good progress with the integration of our recent acquisitions a reminder that our huntsman building solutions target synergies have been exceeded and our advanced materials acquisitions of gabriel and cvc remain on track to deliver 23 million of synergies in addition our cost optimization plans also remain on track with our program and performance products fully completed in total we expect to achieve full year acquisition synergies and cost optimization of approximately 90 million in 2021 with a target of approximately 110 million in 2022 turning to slide nine we had a use of free cash flow from continuing operations of 83 million in the second quarter as a result of the extended turnaround at our rotterdam mdi facility the rotterdam mdi turnaround is now behind us for another four years and we anticipate significant free cash flow generation in the second half of the year consistent with remarks made on our last earnings call we anticipate a free cash flow conversion rate to adjusted ebitda of approximately 25 for the full year as peter indicated our mdi splitter project is now scheduled to come online earlier than previously anticipated as a result due to the acceleration of this project capital expenditures for 2021 will now be 355 million to 360 million approximately 25 million to 30 million higher than previously indicated this acceleration of spend in 2021 along with increased adjusted ebitda from the earlier start up of the splitter will contribute to a targeted free cash flow conversion of approximately 40 in 2022 should present demand trends continue we see no reason why we should not be targeting and meeting or exceeding a 40 free cash flow conversion after this year during the second quarter we received a 28 million earnout related to the sale of our india diy business bringing gross proceeds to 285 million and a multiple of approximately 15 times 2019 adjusted ebitda on the sale of the business our balance sheet remains strong with 1 9 billion of liquidity and a net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage of one time at the end of quarter two during the quarter we completed an offering of 400 million in 2 95 senior notes due in 2031 and used the net proceeds and cash on hand to redeem in full 400 million a 5 125 senior notes due in 2022 combined these transactions will save approximately 9 million in annual cash interest finally addressing capital allocation following the divestment of approximately one fifith of huntsman s portfolio to indorama in early 2020 we have focused on building our core platforms through targeted bolt on acquisitions where it makes sense from a valuation perspective this m a strategy will continue as we intend to grow our core platforms particularly in our specialty and downstream businesses as a reminder we increased our dividend by approximately 15 earlier this year and we currently have an approximate 3 dividend yield on our equity in addition we have an existing share repurchase plan authorized by our board of up to 1 billion of which we have bought back 580 million prior to the global pandemic we have placed share buybacks on hold during the pandemic taking account of market conditions and an appropriate return on capital we anticipate resuming some level of share repurchases in the second half of the year peter back to you peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you phil i think the results of this past quarter marked a significant milestone and our recovery from the recent calamitous results of the past five quarters due to a global pandemic the last time we had a quarter of this level of ebitda was in 2017 2018 during a time when our polyurethane business was enjoying unusually strong market conditions at that time mdi made up as much as 74 of our ebitda i think it is worth pausing and asking what is different today and what more is there yet to come this past quarter polyurethanes made up 54 of our adjusted ebitda as we see the result of a stronger performance products and recovery in advanced materials and the textile effects business that is likewise seeing a return to normality i hardly see the second quarter as being peak results as i look at the coming quarters we will see the effects of the completion of our geismar louisiana mdi splitter that will start generating ebitda in the second quarter of next year we ll also see the benefits of an additional 20 million of cost savings as we streamline our polyurethanes business our polyurethanes spray foam business has been constrained due to raw material supply issues that will be solved in the second half of this year mdi remains well balanced however during the second half of this year just over 10 of the global capacity of mdi will be lost due to announced closures for needed maintenance work this will be taking place at a time when our facilities ought to be operating at design rates and sold out in our performance products division we saw strong margins and some onetime benefits but the core of this business has fundamentally changed we ve expanded our customer portfolio controlled costs and exercised better pricing discipline we ve initiated projects that will continue to change this division as we expand production of our urethanes catalyst capacity our products feeding the semiconductor business and carbonates that will make us one of the largest sources of battery grade carbonates in the americas these projects will be completed by 2023 our advanced materials division has gone through a meaningful change this past year as we ve purchased and integrated our recent acquisitions of cvc and gabriel we ll see further cost optimization and commercial synergies in excess of 13 million by 2023 building upon the 10 million we will achieve this year we will also see the return of our aerospace business that will further enhance our ebitda by an additional 40 million to 50 million that is fully recovered our textile effects business will not only see the continued recovery of its retail customer base but the completion of our bangladeshi expansion that will deliver 10 million annually in short in the coming quarters the groundwork is being laid for over 150 million of additional ebitda that will take place across our businesses aside from aerospace this assumes no further recovery in the market additionally we have a very strong balance sheet that affords us to aggressively pursue m a opportunities this will be done where we have true synergies growth opportunities and the ability to stabilize our earnings having said that i am surprised at some of the multiples that have been seen in some of the recent transactions in this industry as i have said before we will be disciplined the quality of our earnings will continue to be of paramount importance this past quarter notwithstanding when we experienced a perfect storm of third party outages unplanned inventory build and associated lost sales most of which will be recovered in the second half of this year we are confident of our ability to deliver greater than 25 free cash flow to ebitda this year should present market conditions prevail we will see this percentage of free cash flow to ebitda increase to 40 this next year finally as phil mentioned in his comments we continue to pay a competitive dividend and will be reviewing our purchase of huntsman shares these share purchases will be determined by alternative uses of capital as well as the return on any such capital employed in short we hardly see these market conditions as anything but a normalized level with plenty more opportunity yet to come operator at this time we will turn over to any questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of frank mitsch with fermium research please proceed with your question frank mitsch fermium research analyst good morning and congrats phil on being named cfo peter working through the numbers it looks like you re expecting third quarter to be better than the second quarter in terms of ebitda and that typically is not the case with huntsman i think you have to go back several years when you find something like that so given that you re not anticipating to see kind of that typical seasonality or there s other factors at work in terms of inventories etcetera what does your early read on fourth quarter suggest that is typically you see even greater seasonality in the fourth quarter is this an anomalous year how should we be thinking about the seasonality impact on huntsman peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well i think that as we look into the third quarter we will see a little bit of seasonality for the third quarter we re also going to see the reversal of the t i or the downtime that we saw in rotterdam and when we back that out as well as some of the cost reductions that continue to flow through and the pricing initiatives that we have i think that we re going to see you re right a stronger third quarter certainly in our second quarter and we ll see our corporate expenses at that time in the third quarter and probably about the same in the fourth quarter about 50 million a quarter i ll remind you that there is some lifo charges in that number and also we re seeing recovery in our business travel and expenses and so forth just associated with running the business so we look at that third quarter we feel very confident about it again at this time barring a major pandemic closure of the economy or anything i would think that our fourth quarter is going to continue to be strong and i think our second half of the year again from where i sit right now should be a stronger half than the first half of the year and again that s looking at the present demand trends and so forth still very early in the third quarter but i ve got quite a bit of confidence i did mention that we re looking at about a 10 losing about 10 of the capacity in the third quarter that will also be about 10 of the industry capacity for mdi in the fourth quarter as well as we see a number of plants that are coming down for maintenance and some of those have been postponed since earlier in the year to the second half of this year and i don t see a lot of movement from that scheduling or further delays if you will so i think in the second half of this year we re going to see some pretty good demand and probably some constrained capacity operator our next question comes from the line of angel castillo with morgan stanley please proceed with your question angel castillo morgan stanley analyst hi thanks for taking my question congrats on the strong quarter and phil welcome as well just a quick question on mdi i m curious you talked about the differentiated volumes being stronger in the quarter than kind of the overall segment and just as you look at those end markets and kind of the mix between kind of the more commodity versus the differentiated volumes curious if you could give us more color what are you seeing beyond those volumes kind of going forward and what does that mean for your margins as well in terms of we all track mdi spreads but in terms of the mix that that could benefit peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well i m going to have tony hankins who s our divisional president perhaps comment on some of the macro trends that we re seeing regionally but as we look at it globally again we re looking at an environment where we re trying to take as much as our more commoditized tonnage and moving that into further downstream again i just want to remind the market that there will be some times when people might be scratching their heads saying why aren t we benefiting as much during some of the cyclical upside that you see on some of the more commoditized grades in some of these times of outages and so forth but i think we re trying to look at an mdi business that delivers more reliable margins as a better consistent cash flow and isn t so dependent on spot pricing so tony any comments that you have about some of the regional impacts we re seeing anthony hankins chief executive officer asia pacific and division president polyurethanes yes thank you we re seeing very strong demand right now in two of our three core downstream franchises the huntsman building solutions which is spray foam and our elastomers business particularly the footwear business and the industrial assets business where we re seeing very strong double digit growth there right through the second half of the year but we sold out we ve got an eight week order backlog in hbs the good news in that business is commercial construction is starting to pick up and we re seeing spray foam moving into that much more stronger than the past in addition to the residential construction area which has been very strong as you know with the new home build so we re very very pleased about that automotive has been off about 10 this quarter because of the chip shortage i think that s going to ease up a bit toward the end of the year that s clearly constraining automotive but we move those products into our into other chemistries as peter said on the call those are the chemistries that things like flexible foam into memory foam mattresses and pillows where we ve seen 35 quarter on quarter growth in those areas so we re very very optimistic and very upbeat about growth going forward in the second half in our downstream differentiated businesses and we re moving molecules from our component side of the business into those downstream markets that s the whole strategy of valuing moving from components to specialty where the margins are higher where the earnings are sustainable and where we re seeing real benefit particularly from the infrastructure build and the climate change investments which are going to be made in not just the coming quarters but the coming years so i m very very upbeat about these downstream businesses that we serve operator our next question comes from the line of bob koort with goldman sachs please proceed with your question bob koort goldman sachs analyst thank you very much peter i was curious you made a note that you re going to start maybe buying back some stock and also suggested that maybe multiples in the marketplace are a little elevated you guys have been very exceptional at selling assets is there any scope maybe to monetize some more assets and take advantage of those bids and what will be the hurdle or limiting gate factor on how much or what price you buy back stock would you think peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well bob very good question and we re going to be looking at on a really on a case by case basis as we weigh the alternative uses of capital frankly i d rather see cash going into business expansion and m a than share buyback but again it s a pretty simple equation is when we balance that return on capital employed and share buybacks versus m a so i think it needs to be a measured approach and something that we re going to be looking at carefully throughout the second half and it s part of the balanced approach that we have as we ve done in the past just to remind the market here that we bought in nearly 0 5 billion of our own shares over the last two to 2 5 years with the proceeds coming from indorama and just cash coming from the operations of the business i see that continuing but yes as we look at possible asset sales as i ve said in past calls we continue to look at our overall portfolio and as we find opportunities where those looking at our business will put a higher value on certain assets that perhaps than we may have internally we ll certainly entertain that and as i ve said in the past again we certainly are not at a point where i d say that there s nothing for sale within the company so again that s not to say that we re out trying to sell off divisions or anything but again it is to say that i think that any company has got to be able to look at where they can refresh and how they can refresh their portfolio operator our next question comes from the line of hassan ahmed with alembic global please proceed with your question hassan ahmed alembic global analyst good morning peter i just wanted to focus on the q3 guidance you ve given specifically for the polyurethanes business i mean if i adjust for lost earnings from the rotterdam turnaround it seems that you guys are guiding to flat to slightly up ebitda q2 to q3 and then if i sort of triangulate that with some of the comments that i heard it seems that probably volumes are going to be up and this is all obviously adjusted for the rotterdam turnaround it seems volumes will be up in q3 sequentially you guys have pricing initiatives in place so what am i missing here from the sounds of it it seems q2 to q3 polyurethane segment ebitda should be up nicely so are you guys being relatively conservative with that guidance peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well i would never accuse mr hankins here of sandbagging numbers hassan but i would put a couple of things in mind on the positive side well let me start with the need on the two areas of concern that i have looking into the third quarter one of those is going to be the lower number in that polyurethane numbers we have our joint venture from our po mtbe joint venture the equity earnings coming out of that in china in the second quarter i think that we had better quite a bit better than average earnings in the second quarter coming from that and i see that cooling in the third quarter that of which is selling propylene oxide and mtbe as those markets come into better balance i think that those earnings probably will be slowing a bit in the third quarter in the third quarter also we re going to be seeing the effects of higher raw materials particularly benzene now we re seeing benzene coming off of a recent 4 to 5 high this past quarter and dropping down to the 3 and change area but remember that our time of buying the benzene transporting the benzene converting it to nitrobenzene aniline crude mdi working it through our system typically is about a quarter impact and so what we saw in raw material increases in the second quarter will be hitting us in the third so on the negative side i d say again some pressures on the earnings on the po mtbe side and also having to deal with higher raw material costs in benzene that we know will be coming working its way through the system on the positive side yes the t i is behind us we have greater volumes and we are going to be pushing for price increases some of and that will be price increases across the board and it will be price increases that we re presently working with as i made mention in my comments with those contracts that we those longer term contracts where we have particularly in the americas where we have long term agreements kind of pass through sort of agreements many of those are coming due at this time and as tony articulated our objective in the americas is to take our polymer our commodity businesses and move those further downstream we re going to do that in two ways we re going to do that by putting it to the splitter and moving those into new markets those molecules that today are being sold at commodity pricing and those are the same pounds that also get moved into the spray foam business so we see it growing at double digit rates so our percentage of polymeric commodity based mdi particularly in north america is going to be is going to continue to be a shrinking market for us and we have an opportunity to with the remaining customer base that we have to evaluate those customers the service that we re giving the value that we re creating for them and look at that pricing as well so sorry long winded answer here but as we look into the third quarter and i think many of those things that we ll be implementing in the third quarter will spill over into the fourth quarter even though we ll see seasonality in the fourth quarter i think many of the positive attributes will spill in the fourth quarter which gives me as i mentioned earlier a lot of optimism not just the second half of this year but going into 2022 operator our next question comes from the line of kevin mccarthy with vertical research partners please proceed with your question cory vertical research partners analyst good morning this is cory on for kevin looking at the performance products segment we ve heard that huntsman is out with a price increase of 0 08 per pound for maleic anhydride in the third quarter sorry effective august 1 can you talk about maybe some of the price drivers for maleic and maybe the sustainability of those drivers as you see it through the second half and into next year and maybe could you break that down by region i think we ve seen a little bit of weakening in europe versus the us and china thank you peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes when we look at our maleic businesses bear in mind one of the two major drivers there is most products raw materials in the second quarter we saw an average raw material cost for the business across the board just under 1 a gallon and we see a current price of around 1 30 a gallon so 30 something percent increase in raw material prices which are going to necessitate higher selling prices for our maleic to offset that we re also seeing very strong demand in the maleic particularly in north america and in asia i think that we re seeing decent demand in europe not as strong as they are in north america and in asia but i continue to be quite bullish on the maleic business i think the fundamentals of it are strong we re a global leader in the capacity and in the economics and in the technology to produce maleic and i continue to believe it s going to be continue to be a business that delivers a very strong results for us operator our next question comes from the line of mike leithead with barclays please proceed with your question mike leithead barclays analyst great thanks good morning question just on the raw material front i think outside of benzene the company is a fairly decent sized buyer of chlorine and epi and if you look at those products there s been not only a fair amount of supply disruptions lately but the largest us producer of both products has been pretty vocal that price is only going to go upward moving forward so just curious how you think about your security of supply there and your ability to get pricing to offset that peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well look it is a time when as we see the recovery of the global economy the demand that s being pulled on the global economy that we are going to see raw material pressure probably across the board i will just note though that as we are looking into the third quarter into the fourth quarter we are starting to see prices diminish on the raw material front benzene seemingly has peaked in the second quarter going into the third quarter and typically going into the winter months the gasoline slate a lot of what refineries produce will also you ll start seeing a diminishment in some of those values as well on our epichlorohydrin and chlorine so far i m not going to comment on particular buying strategies and so forth but in the area particularly of epichlorohydrin there have been some disruptions in from the supply particularly from asia those things will be worked through look we ve been buyers or producers of epichlorohydrin for many years and this is a global commodity it s going to move with supply and demand and that s just the way it is i think in many commodities in this industry you sometimes get in those positions where you think prices are always going to stay high and prices will never diminish and economic reality will hit you particularly in commodities when you ve got global competition so i think longer term in spite of people trying to lock in long term prices quote forever the institutes of the markets will continue to be the same i don t see any fundamental change in that when you look and also and you look in china our large mdi plant we have hcl recycling there meaning that we recycle our chlorine we re looking at the possibility in the economic models of doing that more widespread throughout the company and i think as you start looking at technologies more and more our technologies not only will be for from an environmental point of view but how do we reduce how do we recycle and how do we capitalize on technologies that allow us to have better reliability less materials coming into our facilities and utilize technology to basically make more with less and i think that that s a trend that we re going to continue to see across the board operator our next question comes from the line of david begleiter with deutsche bank please proceed with your question david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you peter just on polyurethane you mentioned that 54 of ebitda today is from that segment can you talk about how much of that is now downstream differentiated ebitda versus commodity ebitda and how s it compared to a number of years ago peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well i think as we look at that commodity versus downstream i mean i think it s a little bit i m a bit hesitant to give an exact number on that because not everything fits exactly in those two buckets but i would look at tony hankins here and say we re probably looking at somewhere between two thirds to probably closer to three quarters of our ebitda is being earned by our differentiated products tony you see that anthony hankins chief executive officer asia pacific and division president polyurethanes no that s absolutely right peter i think we re very differentiated in europe the figure in europe is higher than that i think in america it s the americas is 70 75 the patriot splitter investment is really going to help us move that even further downstream and in china it s up 50 50 and that s the area we ve got to be more working to really start converting more of that component where we see the spike from the fly ups into more downstream stable lenses so yeah overall peter about 70 75 david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john roberts with ubs please proceed with your question john roberts ubs analyst thank you back to the performance products segment peter vegetable oil is also used in unsaturated polyester sort of different chemical route to some of the products is the surge in vegetable oil contributing to the supportive pricing there on maleic peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer no not that we re saying that vegetable is a product we follow very closely and we look at the alternative technologies and usage in those areas and so but i don t see it having any impact at this time john roberts ubs analyst and then you talked about some constraints in pu foam volume there is it your propylene oxide supply from indorama or was it blowing agents or some other additive that might be constraining the pu foams peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer tony do you want to comment on that anthony hankins chief executive officer asia pacific and division president polyurethanes yes john i think it s a wide range of raw materials i mean polyols have been constrained particularly in north america this past quarter but also catalyst blowing agents release agents i mean right across the board i think raw materials have been very tight and so things like butane dial which go into the cpu business we re hopeful that s going to get a lot better in the second half but yes it s been particularly in our huntsman building solutions business has been very restrictive of our ability to really capitalize on the strong growth so we re working hard to alleviate that with alternative products and remixing of chemistry operator our next question comes from the line of mike sison with wells fargo please proceed with your question mike sison wells fargo analyst hey guys nice quarter peter the mdi prices in china were pretty volatile in 2q and i know the u s and europe was a little bit more stable but you were able to hit your outlook for polyurethanes and given the volatility why do you think that was the case have you done enough in that portfolio to be able to manage the volatility in component pricing and then any thoughts on any new industry capacity coming on in 2022 just if you have any insight there thanks peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes and very quickly and if i m rather quick in my answers over the next couple we ve still got quite a few questions i know there s other companies that have their announced earnings they ll start in about 10 minutes so if i give rather quick answers my apologies we kind of i d like to try to get as many questions as possible on the chinese polymer mdi it remains volatile i wish we had a crystal ball that could see into the quarter and see where that price is but i would remind you that pmdi is only 5 of all of huntsman s portfolio and it s only 10 of polyurethanes so if we re getting it right i think it s more that we re getting the other 90 right and maybe that other 10 i d like to think we re getting it right but we try to be as transparent with the market as soon as we see something we try to pass that on to the market on capacity it s coming on look i don t outside of china in some announcements that have been made i don t see any greenfield and when i say greenfield i mean a brand new mdi site anywhere in the world i mean you re looking at four to five years to be able to build such a site there isn t any even in the planning and permitting stages at this point again there are some expansions taking place on existing facilities and so forth but i don t see any significant capacity coming on in mdi for the foreseeable future when i say foreseeable future i mean over the course of the next several years next question please operator our next question comes from p j juvekar with citi please proceed with your question eric petrie citi analyst hi peter it s eric petrie on for p j if i annualize first half performance products ebitda i get 300 million versus normalized the 200 million to 225 million that you put out there so is that level sustainable or do you see kind of normalization in the composites area peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer on performance products i see a little bit of seasonality third quarter is probably going to be down a bit from the second quarter 5 million 7 million down from the second quarter just because of some of the seasonality and turnaround that we have but by and large i see it moving in second half can be a little bit weaker than first half but not materially somewhere in that 260 270 ish sort of number be my guest i hope there d be some upside to that operator our next question comes from the line of arun viswanathan with rbc please proceed with your question arun viswanathan rbc analyst great thanks for taking my question i just wanted to get your thoughts on reliability obviously we ve had some force majeures here and production discipline disruptions at some of your competitor facilities i guess do you view that positively and i guess any comment on your own system obviously there s maintenance going on but do you expect kind of continued disruptions in the industry going forward thanks peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i would never wish disruption on any of our competitors but and now having said that i think that when you look at the configuration in this industry of the size of some of these lines that have been built 400 000 tons sort of lines it used to be when a line went down you were losing 50 000 or 100 000 tons of material when lines in mdi line to go down you need a very very small amount of contaminants to get into that system to put a line down and when you see a single line now of 300 000 400 000 500 000 metric tons and a line of that magnitude comes down for maintenance or cleaning you are going to see it impact literally the global balance so i think that s a factor and the other factor that i would say is that as you look at most of these mdi plants i think our competitors i think are very very well built they re very well they re very well maintained but they re also dependent on infrastructure that in many cases around the world is strained it s older i look at a lot of the chemical infrastructure here in north america much of it you get these brand new billion dollar facilities and they re being operated with an infrastructure that s 30 or 40 years old and so it s not just the facilities themselves but a lot of it is when you see a storm come through freeze come through something of that nature you re looking a lot at third party issues and look at the outage that we suffered in the second quarter due to the netherlands was a product pipeline that suffered corrosion that supplied a supplier to a supplier to us and so i mean you re kind of like three times removed of an older pipeline that had some corrosion unexpected corrosion in it so i think as you look at more of an interchangeable and an interconnected industry i think if anything i m not sure that really gets better i think we re just going to have to maintenance is going to have to be is going to continue to be paramount operator our next question comes from the line of alex yefremov with keybanc please proceed with your question alex yefremov keybanc analyst thank you and good morning everyone peter do you expect typical seasonality in the fourth quarter in polyurethanes and advanced materials or given the trends you just discussed could we see maybe flat q4 versus q3 peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes i do see seasonality i mean there will be the typical closures every year for some reason we have this phenomenon called thanksgiving and christmas the new year s that seemingly slow things down and yeah we will see that i do think that to offset my only point in saying that i m optimistic on the fourth quarter is i think that some of that seasonality will be offset by possible possible supply shortages and price increases and if those things happen then you ll see some of that seasonality will be muted but yeah there will be a slowdown in demand and that s just something that will happen operator our next question comes from the line of matthew blair with tudor pickering holt please proceed with your question matthew blair tudor pickering holt analyst hey good morning peter and phil you had a press release during the quarter that highlighted your increasing exposure to ev batteries i was hoping you could just talk about what is your content per vehicle i guess in terms of pounds for traditional ice vehicle and then what would you target for an ev how much of a difference do you think there will be peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well the vast majority of what we re putting in an ice vehicle today will be in an ev vehicle going forward i mean if you think about lightweight is of paramount important comfort insulation you want to make sure that you re driving a car that has mdic not tdi that has no low or no vocs in its catalyst i m just trying to promote tony s products there and but as you think about what we can be doing here on an ev that does not go into an ice vehicle you re going to see areas of the carbonates that go into the batteries themselves you re going to see even a greater emphasis i believe on light weighting on the heat insulation around batteries i think that s going to be huntsman material and as we look kind of in that further past the next two or three years take a look at the video that we just released on our miralon product that s on our website and on social media sites and this is there are some really exciting materials that are going to be coming out not only from huntsman but from our industry that will be doing a better job in light weighting in adhesion in structural strength and so forth stuff that isn t even on the market and i m not talking 10 or 20 years down the road i m talking two or three years down the road but i think it s going to revolutionize a lot and will increase not only the battery functionality in an ev but also in existing ice vehicles as well operator our next question comes from the line of laurence alexander with jefferies please proceed with your question laurence alexander jefferies analyst just two quick ones do you expect your own maintenance costs to go up as a percentage of sales or assets over the next few years and have you pulled forward any productivity from 2022 2023 or should you be able to maintain the same productivity run rate peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i think on both of those laurence we think that the maintenance costs that we have had traditionally over the last 10 years will be consistent over the course of the next couple of years and we ll be discussing this in more detail as we get into our investor day and so forth but i look as we sell off more and more of our heavy chemicals and you re maintaining more system houses and our spray foam facilities and so on you just don t we obviously spend i think very generously on maintenance you just don t have the high cost that you do on some of these larger facilities that we used to have so as we look at our productivity we look at our maintenance and so forth i think it s well balanced and i think it s going to continue as it has been over the course of the last decade we re going to continue to be very disciplined in our capex and we re going to be calibrating that capex around our projected ebitda we re not going to be cutting any of our maintenance and our requirements in the hns but as we look at that 40 threshold it is a very important number for us and there might be some projects that we delay some expansion business projects that we delay i think hitting that number and maintaining that sort of discipline is very important to this company and operator i see that we re at the top of the hour why don t we take one more question here and again i want to thank everybody for having taken the time to join us operator thank you our final question comes from the line of mike harrison with seaport research please proceed with your question mike harrison seaport research analyst hi good morning thanks for squeezing me in peter can you maybe give a little more color on the strategic refresh that you referred to in the performance products segment what changes have you made in addition to the 7 million of cost takeout that you completed and what gives you confidence that you re going to see sustained improvement in that business thanks peter r huntsman chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well i think that we re spending a lot of money and we have a very good product pipeline in that area if you were to look at this business five years ago you would have seen a very heavy focus on our surfactants business a lot of our crop protection businesses and so forth and this would have been because of the business that we sold two years ago coming up on two years indorama where that business was largely integrated with an upstream ethane to ethylene ethylene oxide propylene oxide and we re taking those molecules and i think moving those into more of a well a more commoditized market those that rewarded us for volume over value per pound and now that those are stand alone businesses we re looking at the molecules we re looking at the technology and we re looking at how do we achieve through less volume more value and i think that s going to continue and as we look at the strength of our maleic anhydride business the not just the integration going into upr but in other areas as a fuel additive a lube oil protective agent and so forth that maleic business is going to continue to be a value to us as we look at our amines and we start focusing as we mentioned earlier into a whole new area of semiconductors into batteries and electricity and into polyurethane catalysts again remember these are the products that are fueling the growth that we are seeing in the spray foam business on the polyurethane side this is an interdivisional supply channel that we have here and we see a tremendous opportunity to help grow that business at a very strong double digit growth rate here over the course of the next couple of years so as we see that i guess my point is we re focused more on value on a per pound basis we re focused more on where we re going to be having perhaps a little bit smaller nimbler business than where we were a couple of years ago when we were moving mass commoditization and surfactants and so forth not that those are bad markets we re just i think they re focused on pricing technology and execution and i think that we re starting to see the benefit of that coming through thank you very much operator

some cases excluding the impacts of lower of cost or market inventory adjustments or lcm with that being said i would now like to turn the call over to bob bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer thank you dave good day to all of you we appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter results before we begin with the business discussion i would like to acknowledge the sadness we are feeling throughout the lyondellbasell family after a tragic incident this week at our la porte facility which resulted in the death of two contractors and injuries to several additional contractors and employees every day we work diligently to ensure that the colleagues the friends and most importantly the families of our employees and contractors never have to receive the calls that went out last tuesday evening notifying them for the loss or injury of a loved one our investigation is underway and it will be some time before we reach a conclusive determination recovery for all of the injured please turn to slide three and let s review our second quarter financial results with more than 3 billion of quarterly ebitda despite the increased working capital required by higher prices and volumes we generated 1 9 billion of cash from operating activities these results demonstrate how lyondellbasell s disciplined investments in growth and share repurchases over the past few years have enabled us to establish new benchmarks for our company s profitability second quarter ebitda is a larger lyondellbasell is now positioned to generate stronger results and higher cash flow through business cycles the events of this week provide a vivid reminder of the reasons behind our company s commitment to safe and reliable operations let s turn to slide four and review our recent safety performance as of the end of june our year to date total recordable incident rate of 0 22 for employees and contractors remained in the top 10 of our industry as we do with all major incidents we will investigate the root cause and contributing factors involved in this week s events and share our findings with our contractors our employees and our industry peers our aim is to learn from all incidents and achieve a goal 0 work environment that prevents such tragedies from occurring on slide five i would like to highlight our most recent sustainability report that we released last month this report focuses on lyondellbasell s efforts to address three urgent global challenges for our business eliminating plastic waste in the environment addressing climate change and supporting a thriving society lyondellbasell is leading work to transform our industry toward more sustainable market for circular polymers on climate change we support the ambitions of the paris climate agreement and we re moving forward with investments in energy reduction increased utilization of renewable energy and evaluation of new low carbon technologies we will be sharing more details on our carbon reduction plans over the coming months in our work to advance the thriving society i m very pleased to see the enthusiasm from our employees with our emphasis on a safe work culture and community engagement our work to capture the full potential of our diverse global workforce should further enhance the sustainability of our company s performance following an exceptional second quarter some market observers are predicting a rapid decline in prices and profitability for our industry on slide six i would like to point out why we believe that markets will be stronger for longer covid vaccinations have been the driving force behind the reopening of societies and the rebounding global economy as of july only 14 of the global population is fully vaccinated while the u s and roughly a dozen other countries have achieved vaccination rates approaching or exceeding 50 health experts anticipate that vaccines will be rolling out to the rest of the world throughout 2022 and into 2023 as seen by the increased spread among unvaccinated populations and the rise of variants we still have much work ahead of us to contain the coronavirus and realize the full economic power of global reopening returning to normalcy is eagerly anticipated by consumers with considerable pent up demand and increased disposable income the bureau of economic analysis estimates that u s personal savings averaged 3 5 trillion during the first five months of 2021 nearly three times the level seen in 2019 with fiscal stimulus continuing to flow into the economy consumers are both motivated and well funded to this unfulfilled demand will persist to drive strong industrial production and demand for our materials for quite some time one example is that the average age of an automobile in the u s reached an all time high of 12 years in 2021 businesses and consumers will eventually need to replace this aging fleet of cars and trucks despite higher prices and supply chain constraints demand for our products serving automotive manufacturing are forecast to increase a total of 10 in 2021 and an additional 11 during 2022 strong u s household formation during the pandemic has evolved into a robust housing market lyondellbasell benefits from both direct demand for building and construction materials as well as demand for our products used in the myriad of furniture appliances and other goods that complete a new home and as vaccinations facilitate improvements in global mobility lyondellbasell s products will see increased demand from restocking and consumption by service entertainment travel and hospitality industries as well as increased demand for transportation fuels supplied by lyondellbasell s oxyfuels and refining businesses in short we remain confident that persistently high demand should support strong markets for our products through 2022 with that i will turn the call over to michael who will describe our financial and segment results over the past quarter michael mcmurray executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you bob good morning everyone please turn to slide seven and let me begin by highlighting our strong cash generation which has been enhanced by our recent growth investments in the second quarter lyondellbasell generated 1 9 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed toward the more than 4 billion over the past 12 months our free operating cash flow yield has been 10 1 over the past four quarters and free operating cash flow for the second quarter improved by more than 80 relative to the second quarter of 2019 we expect continued improvement of our last 12 months cash flow performance as we move forward through each quarter of 2021 let s turn to slide eight and review the details of our cash generation and deployment during the second quarter as i have mentioned during previous calls a strong and progressive dividend plays a fundamental role in our capital deployment strategy in the second quarter we expressed our confidence in our outlook by increasing the quarterly dividend by 7 6 to 1 13 per share we continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects during the quarter with approximately 430 million in capital expenditures strong cash flow supported debt repayments of 1 3 billion bringing our year to date debt reduction to 1 8 billion we closed the second quarter with cash and liquid investments of 1 5 billion last week s p global ratings recognize the improvement in our metrics by upgrading our credit ratings and indicating a stable outlook we expect that robust cash generation and an anticipated tax refund will enable continued progress on our goal to reduce our net debt by up to 4 billion during 2021 and further strengthen our investment grade balance sheet one modeling item of note our original full year net interest expense guidance of 430 million did not include extinguishment costs associated with our accelerated debt repayment program as a result our 2021 net interest expense will likely exceed this prior guidance please turn to slide nine to review our quarterly profitability in the second quarter of 2021 lyondellbasell s business portfolio delivered record ebitda of 3 billion this was an improvement of more than 1 4 billion relative to the first quarter our results reflect robust demand for our products driven by the recovery in global economy and our growth investments markets remained tight during the second quarter as the industry returned to normal operation following first quarter disruptions from the winter storm that constrained production for lyondellbasell and nearly all of our competitors with operations in the state of texas persistent consumer and industrial demand has met tight markets leading to seven consecutive months of north american polyethylene contract price increases totaling more than 900 per ton we expect market conditions to remain robust and that continued progress in global reopening sizable order backlogs in the increasing demand for transportation fuels will all support strong margins across lyondellbasell s businesses our previous quarterly ebitda record set in the third quarter of 2015 was approximately 2 2 billion with more than 140 million of ebitda contributed by our refining segment today our growth investments are helping offset a challenging refining environment and enabling us to surpass the 2015 record our aim is to leverage our larger business portfolio to achieve improved results at all stages of the business cycle now let s review second quarter results for each of our segments as mentioned my discussion will describe our underlying business results i will begin with our olefins and polyolefins americas segment on slide 10 strong demand improved margins and our growth investments drove second quarter ebitda to a record of 1 6 billion 709 million higher than the first quarter olefins results increased by approximately 310 million compared to the first quarter due to higher margins and volumes lyondellbasell s cracker operating rates increased to 93 and following the first quarter texas weather events about five points above the second quarter industry average margins improved primarily due to the absence of high cost incurred during the prior quarter s weather events polyolefin results increased by about 400 million during the second quarter as robust demand in tight markets drove higher prices and margins for polyethylene and polypropylene we anticipate continued strength in demand and margins for our o p and americas businesses during the third quarter while consultants are predicting some margin compression for ethylene recent outages have caused prices to quickly rebound and demonstrated that markets remain relatively tight high demand low downstream inventories and customer backlogs are expected to continue and provide ongoing support for strong polymer margins as of this week our august order volumes for pe and pp in the americas segment are stronger than any prior month in 2021 now please turn to slide 11 to review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins europe asia and international segment similar to the americas robust demand and improving margins in our eai markets drove second quarter ebitda to a record 708 million 296 million higher than the first quarter olefins results improved by 100 million as margins increased driven by higher ethylene and coproduct prices demand was robust during the quarter and we operated our crackers at a rate of 96 more than 10 above industry benchmarks combined polyolefin results increased approximately 180 million compared to the prior quarter strong polymer demand drove spread improvements with price increases for polyethylene and polypropylene outpacing monomer prices margin improvements were partially offset by a small decline in polyolefin volume during the third quarter we could see modest rebalancing of tight european markets as customers take downtime for summer holidays please turn to slide 12 as we take a look at our intermediates and derivatives segment robust demand expanded our margins and increased our sales volumes following the texas weather events and some plant maintenance during the prior quarter second quarter ebitda was 596 million more than three times higher than the prior quarter second quarter propylene oxide and derivative results increased by 170 million driven by record high margins intermediate chemicals results increased by about 170 million primarily due to higher product prices for most of the businesses oxyfuels and related products results increased by 70 million driven by higher margins benefiting from improved demand and higher gasoline prices we expect continued strength in durable goods and improving transportation fuels demand to increase third quarter volumes for our i d segment margins could slightly moderate if industry production rates remain strong please turn to slide 13 and allow me to dive a little deeper into transportation trends that support our improving outlook for lyondellbasell s oxyfuels and refined products demand for transportation fuels are rebounding from pandemic close total gasoline and distillate demand in june was within 5 of prepandemic levels reduced demand in margins for refined products is mostly due to lagging demand for jet fuel associated with business and international travel jet fuel demand remains stubbornly below pre pandemic levels as vaccinations in global travel resumes through 2022 and 2023 we expect refining margins will improve and drive additional earnings power for lyondellbasell s houston refinery the chart on the left illustrates the northwest europe raw material margin for mtbe which is an industry marker for our oxyfuels products sold into gasoline blending markets around the world while oxyfuels are typically a reliable performing business through the cycle low demand for gasoline pushed this margin into breakeven or negative territory over the prior four quarters since the beginning of this year global demand for gasoline and gasoline blending components such as mtbe and etbe has improved increasing the margin to an average of 167 per ton during the second quarter this is a significant rebound and well within the historical range shown by now let s move forward and review the results of our advanced polymer solutions segment on slide 14 the margin improvement was offset by a decline in volumes as semiconductor shortages reduced demand for our polymers serving automotive and electronic end markets second quarter ebitda was 129 million lower than the first quarter compounding solutions results decreased by about 25 million as volumes decline for polymers supplied to the automotive sector appliance manufacturing and other industries that were constrained by chip shortages advanced polymer results increased by approximately 10 million due to improved polymer price spreads over propylene raw materials in july feedstock cost for our polypropylene compounds produced in europe have increased and are likely to pressure margins during the third quarter we only expect gradual volume recovery for compound supply to automotive electronics applications as semiconductor supply constraints decrease over the coming quarters now let s turn to slide 15 and discuss and lower prices for refinery grade propylene co product this resulted in second quarter ebitda of negative 81 million an improvement of 29 million relative to the first quarter of 2021 in the second quarter the maya 2 1 1 benchmark increased by 6 14 per barrel to 21 46 per barrel the average crude throughput at the refinery increased to 248 000 barrels per day an operating rate of 93 in july we continue to see improvements in refined product demand and we are running the refinery at nearly full rates strong demand for diesel and improving demand for gasoline is expected to improve refining margins and could enable our refinery to return to profitability before the end of 2021 and as mentioned full margin recovery will require a stronger rebound in jet fuel demand please turn to slide 16 as we review the results of our technology segment increased licensing revenue was offset by a decline in catalyst margin resulting in a second ebitda of 92 million 2 million lower than the prior quarter we expect that third quarter profitability for our technology business will be similar to the same quarter last year based on the anticipated timing of licensing revenue and catalyst demand with that i ll turn the call over to bob bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer thank you michael let me summarize our view of current conditions and the outlook for our businesses with slide 17 in the near to midterm we are still in the early stages of the global economic recovery and despite the challenges from variants continued progress with vaccinations and reopening should continue to support robust demand and margins for our products pent up demand is tangible and consumers have ample liquidity to drive purchases of both services and manufactured goods as reopening proceeds globally low inventories due to supply constraints and logistics disruptions will only serve to extend tight market conditions downstream customer backlogs and persistent demand bode well for continued strength in lyondellbasell s order books in polyethylene strong u s and latin american demand has overtaken volumes that previously flowed from the u s to export markets in asia as logistics constraints subside and u s pg exports to asia resume producers will need to refill a depleted supply chain of 500 000 tons or more that is not fully captured in industry statistics in north america we expect markets for pe and pp will remain tight into next year higher vaccination rates are expected to improve global mobility over the coming year the return of international travel will drive further recovery in transportation fuels markets to increase profitability for our oxyfuels and refining businesses providing additional earnings upside for lyondellbasell let me close with slide 18 our second quarter results provide clear evidence of lyondellbasell s progress in maximizing cash flow performance through all stages of the business cycle we are leveraging our leading and advantaged positions across a larger asset base to deliver results that far exceed our previous benchmarks in today s strong markets our second quarter ebitda results are 38 higher than our previous record by 2023 we expect that our recent growth investments will provide an additional 1 5 billion of mid cycle ebitda earnings capability relative to 2017 our value driven growth investments should propel stronger performance in a variety of business environments our prudent financial strategy remains consistent we have increased our quarterly dividend and remain confident in our capability to deliver on this commitment throughout business cycles we are prioritizing deleveraging and our rapid progress on debt repayment will serve to further strengthen our investment grade balance sheet capacity expansions are coming online in our industry during a period of extraordinary demand growth and enabling an orderly absorption of this new capacity into the market further investments in petrochemicals are proceeding at a manageable rate and recent project cancellations and delays demonstrate capital discipline by market participants at lyondellbasell we re focused on providing leadership for our industry to establish a more sustainable future with new circular business models we will increase our capacity to serve the growing market demand for circulun branded polymers produced from recycled and renewable feedstocks as we work toward our goal of annually producing two million tons robust returns from our growing global business portfolio and look forward to updating you on our progress over the coming quarters we re now pleased to take your questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from jeff zekauskas with jpmorgan please proceed with your question bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer hi good morning jeff thank you for that question on inventory we are starting to restore inventories back to more normal levels they re better than they were or higher than they were back in q1 but still not above historic levels and we continue to be hand to mouth on several grades both in the u s and in europe they are improving one other comment about inventory is that in the u s in particular we re not positioned to do a lot of exports that will require another level of inventory which we don t have today so the inventory situation is improving not back to historic levels on july contract discussions are still ongoing markets are very firm tight we still have hurricane season in front of us we have a heavy maintenance schedule in the industry in q3 and early q4 in the u s so contract discussions are ongoing and there are more announcements out there for august operator thank you our next question comes from steve byrne with bank of america please proceed with your question steve byrne bank of america analyst yes thank you i m curious as to how much visibility do you have about inventory levels at your customers and whether their inventory levels are back to normal or still low or maybe they re starting to run them down just curious on that and is there anything structural that precludes your u s customers from from looking to the international market to fulfill their demand is there something that precludes them from really doing that whether it s product quality or or the type of material they need from converters anything you can comment on that bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer sure steve good morning first of all inventory at customers it s difficult for us to have exact numbers on that but i can tell you that when we ve had some intermittent unplanned outages recently we they seem to not have much inventory because for a day or two late they re very concerned so anecdotally i would say there s not much inventory downstream especially because there s this anticipation of pricing leveling off as well and we ve been talking about that for months now and prices continue to rise because of the persistent demand strength so all of that says to me customers are not holding an extraordinary amount of inventory when we re late they call us right away secondly your question about imports historically and even today imports because of long lead times and generally only the more generic grades are available for import the imports tend to be limited furthermore if you think about today transportation costs shipping costs and container costs from asia to the u s basically wipe out the entire arbitrage that exists today in polyethylene price for example shipping costs including container cost is three to four times what it used to be prepandemic so all of that limits the amount of imports that really come in and the customer s ability to import product operator thank you our next question comes from pj juvekar with citi please proceed with your questions pj juvekar citi analyst hi good morning bob bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer good morning pj pj juvekar citi analyst i hear your commentary about stronger for longer but even if one takes a view that this tightness is temporary maybe last for six months to a year the free cash flow you will get is real i mean you almost get 3 billion to 4 billion of free cash flow during this period of tightness what would you do with that free cash flow would you either go toward sort of green projects like ccs or co2 recycling or hydrogen projects or b would you rather go into m a opportunity there are a lot of mid cap companies in chemical industry that would fit well with your ind or aps segment how do you think about allocating this extra free cash flow bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer excellent thank you for that question p j there s a lot there first of all you re absolutely right this debate of where we are in the cycle whether we re at elevated levels or not i think there s a couple of points to be made one is that what s lost in this debate is that lyondellbasell s mid cycle earnings have stepped up through the cycle earnings power is up by 1 billion to 1 1 billion so far in 2021 compared to 2017 and when we have a full year of po tba production in 23 that will add another 400 million to 500 million of ebitda to our earnings power i think that s very important in terms of through the cycle cash generation ability to pay dividend fund buybacks in the future all of that we must not forget that while we continue to debate or we at peak or not secondly in terms of capital allocation our first priority is to continue to pay down debt and michael talked about that in the prepared remarks about our target of up to 4 billion of debt reduction this year we think that s very achievable we ll continue to update everyone on that once we re to that point where we ve taken out of 4 billion of debt then i think the whole range of sort of alternatives come into play continue to strengthen the dividend think about buybacks look for deep value m a i think we ve demonstrated that that s our focus and stay within the lanes where we swim today so we ll continue to look for that in terms of green projects we re still studying where we can get the most bang for the buck if you will and i suspect that our capex will reflect some of those green investments later in the decade probably 2025 onwards and i would suspect that will be for a total in the second half of 2021 somewhere in 2 billion to 3 billion range in terms of capex in the second half of the decade not annually but total for the second half of the decade operator thank you our next question comes from bob koort with goldman sachs please proceed with your question bob koort goldman sachs analyst thank you good morning bob you mentioned that the freight rates crowd out imports in the u s market i assume those freight rates are a friction point on export so you had mentioned that maybe there could be more demand than we ve seen and i presume part of that would be into the export market so how do you think it all plays out i was looking this morning it looks like export prices are 0 15 0 20 less than domestic prices for well molding polyethylene so do you have to give in on price in order to move that volume as inventories rebuild to do maybe offshore prices have to come up toward u s prices how do you see that dynamic playing out bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer yes great question bob so first of all historically even pre pandemic freight rates coming from asia to the u s were always higher than freight rates going out of u s to asia because of the backhaul sort of concept on product going out typically we would pay about 40 per ton excluding packaging just freight to get polyethylene for example from the gulf coast to asia today that s probably double it s not really limited in terms of exports frankly we just don t have enough production today to be able to export spot volume to asia we are doing some exports that are more contract oriented down to latin america we have some contract commitments even in asia that we continue to fulfill but we re not quite back in that mode certainly as a company we re not where we re looking for spot volume going to asia and i think as the year progresses and some of these bottlenecks around shipping relieve themselves i don t see that as being a challenge and over time as that happens i think the price in china should start to come up as their ability to export finished goods improves and i think the world will kind of equilibrate with china prices coming up as these shipping constraints relieve themselves operator thank you our next question comes from mike sison with wells fargo please proceed with your question mike sison wells fargo analyst hi good morning nice quarter guys when you think about your profitability heading into the second half of the year given i think your outlook tends to be a little bit more positive than the consultants do you think your margins will continue to improve sequentially bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer yes good morning mike so first of all you know with all due respect to all prognosticators underestimated demands consistently over last year and you know my comment about demand being stronger for longer i think that s being played out and we ve been talking about that since the last earnings call i think that will continue i mean if you think about it we still have global reopening in front of us so many durable goods that are on back order automobiles appliances furniture i could go on and on many value chains are still very low on inventory down through finished goods so that needs to get rebuilt and then for us as a company we ll benefit as mobility increases so when you think about all those factors it s hard to imagine that demand would weaken in the second half of the year now we do have some other forces at play we have feedstocks are coming up a bit with natural gas in the u s coming up fact spreads haven t really opened up but feedstocks are coming up but my sense is in this kind of market environment there s some ability to pass some of that through as a company we have some planned and unplanned outages here in q3 so we don t guide on earnings but if i think about q3 versus q2 we should have another very strong quarter in remains to be seen if we can get to a record level like we did in q2 but certainly very strong and well above prior records i mean that s how you should think about q3 and in q4 we ll have some seasonality but still from a historic perspective q4 will be well above historic q4 levels so hope that helps you in thinking through second half earnings for us operator thank you our next question comes from kevin mccarthy with vertical research partners please proceed with your question kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst good morning bob i was wondering if you could update us on your outlook for the propylene chain and specifically speak to polypropylene inventories you mentioned a few times that you re seeing a substantial order backlog for durable goods it looks like pp producers ran pretty hard in the quarter how do you see inventories on that chain and what implications do you see for polypropylene prices versus monomer as we move forward through the back half of the year bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer all right thanks kevin so i see continued strength and i think as durables strengthen and especially auto because that is one of the larger end uses for polypropylene for us inventories are still low and they re actually tighter on polypropylene than they are on polyethylene we re kind of hand them out and we have the lightning strike at lake charles which set us back about a week or 2 and so we re very tight on polypropylene and love for the most part we re managing to contract minimums with our customers as some of these bottlenecks relieve themselves for auto production that s just going to make the market tighter and then appliances those are big draws on polypropylene so my outlook is that polypropylene is going to be tight through the rest of the year and by the way the other benefit that we re waiting to see is in our aps segment with the auto sector being sluggish because of the chip shortage we re not seeing the full earnings power of aps just yet and that s a very significant part of the aps segment our service of the automotive market so i think polypropylene is going to be very strong i think propylene is going to be persistently high for the foreseeable future operator thank you our next question comes from frank mitsch with fermium research please proceed with your question frank mitsch fermium research analyst yes good morning let me offer my condolences as well looking at the business i was struck by the comment that your august order book on polyethylene is the best that it s been in any other month of the year i mean how anomalous is that and do you have people on 100 order allocation i mean how are you dealing with it i mean as i think about your volumes the second quarter polyethylene volumes were basically flat with the first quarter you know what are your thoughts about third quarter polyethylene volumes could you just stick in to that that will be helpful bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer sure frank and thank you for your word and support on the august order book comment i think it s just an indication of us having more volume to sell we ve been constrained all year and as we try to inch our inventory back to more normal levels we can with confidence take on more orders we re still constrained so we re not selling polyethylene unconstrained across the system but there are some grades now where we have enough availability that if a customer wants a product we re able to do it but it s really grade by grade in some areas we re still at contract minimums and so bottom line is q3 u s polyolefins sales should be higher than q2 as we produce more and sell more and i hope that that trend continues operator thank you our next question comes from arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks for taking my question congrats on the results i just wanted to get your thoughts a little bit more on ind it looks like your you had a pretty strong performance there how would you kind of judge the acetyls chain as well as propylene oxide over the next say two to four quarters yes thanks bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer sure arun so on propylene oxide demand is extremely strong margin are very very strong there we could sell more if we had it frankly i expect that to continue again coming back to my earlier comments about furniture shortages that plays right into po also automotive because the seat cushions and all that come from urethanes so we see a really good runway for propylene oxide going into the second half of the year and into even next year frankly if the rate demand is growing when our plant starts up we have a decent chance at absorbing a good bit of it right away and i think it will come on when it s needed likewise in acetyls continued strength from housing and you see the paint market being very strong because of home improvement and people buying new houses and refurbishing them and so on so i mean i don t see a let up on either of those adding to that arun our oxyfuels business has recovered nicely as we see more mobility around the world and still europe is largely in lockdown and i think the best profitability in oxyfuels is still in front of us and i think that will help offset any moderation in the o p area as we see the fuels improving in q3 q4 and into next year operator thank you our next question comes from vincent andrews with morgan stanley please proceed with your question vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thanks and good morning bob wondering if you can give us an update on the molecular recycling initiative in the italy plant bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer sure vincent it s coming along very well we re about to commission a semi works plant here in september and we ll that will be the next stage of development of that technology we continue to be very encouraged by the results we ve seen at the bench scale and we ll know within a couple of months what the bottlenecks are in that technology and my hope is that in later in 22 and into 23 we re prepared to make an investment decision on a medium scale molecular recycling plant which could be in production in 25 plus or minus operator thank you our next question comes from hassan ahmed with alembic global please proceed with your question hassan ahmed alembic global analyst good morning bob bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer good morning hassan ahmed alembic global analyst bob wanted to revisit some of your comments about the i d segment i mean obviously similar to most businesses 2020 was a bit rough but nice bump up back to call it a run rate of 600 million in quarterly ebitda and historically you ve talked about the i d segment being a pretty steady earner and as i sort of sit there and think about that and the steadiness of the earnings trajectory and some of the commentary you made from the sounds of it it seems that maybe the earnings power on a quarterly basis is maybe even north of 700 million steady early basis so call it almost 3 billion in steady ebitda annualized from that segment is that the right way to think about it bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer yes thank you hassan well one thing that we didn t experience in the past was a complete shutdown of global economy and that caused more volatility in ind because of the oxyfuels typically it s been very stable i think today with the assets we have you should still think about ind as a 1 5 billion plus or minus 15 and then as we add the po tba project we should be able to be consistently above 2 billion in ind with upside when markets are strong like they are today so that s how you should think about earnings power 1 5 maybe to 1 7 in that range plus or minus and then after the po tba project mid cycle consistently above 2 billion and in periods like this well well above operator thank you our next question comes from david begleiter with deutsche bank please proceed with your question david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you bob just on refinery do you think it can still be breakeven in q3 and give you a comment about it being potentially profitable in q4 how are you thinking about that business in 2022 thank you bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer thanks david so on the refinery i mean i think we need a reset in rins frankly that would help a lot to get to breakeven and as mobility increases i think we have a good shot of q4 being in the black it all it really depends on how this variant plays out if you think about our company that most parts of the company have shown very good resilience through the pandemic in fact strength in areas like packaging the refinery has been challenged not only from a demand standpoint but the light heavy differential narrowing i think we can get to close to breakeven here in q3 we need a rins reset and in q4 certainly we should be in the black operator thank you our next question comes from john roberts with ubs please proceed with your question john roberts ubs analyst thank you income from equity investments doubled sequentially from the first quarter what s the ebitda equivalent of that 285 million in equity income and maybe you could unpack for us a little bit the sequential improvement between bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer well there s a lot there and i ll probably ask you to follow up with dave afterwards on some of the details but let me just talk about a couple of the jv so first of all our saudi jvs remember that the cracker is in ethane cracker that s a big driver and as oil price rises and as prices go up globally on polyethylene that jv tends to do very well that s a big contributor to the increase in earnings from the existing jvs and then the sasol jv has done extremely well with the merchant ethylene that we sell from that and the ethane to polyethylene cash margins being where they are today between operating cash flow and the expected tax refund on that investment we expect to recover or get back half of our investment in 2021 so that s been a big driver and then incrementally all the other jvs have contributed to the improvement but i would say the saudi jv and the sasol jv we re probably the largest contributor in the increase and the sasol jv being brand new that was not in our p l for most of last year operator thank you our next question comes from jaideep pandya with enfield research please proceed with your question jaideep pandya enfield research analyst thanks just a question really around your volumes in q2 what was sort of constraining you because if i look at polyethylene polypropylene both in the u s and europe it not sequentially your volume in the quarter and then just a little bit more longer term question when we think about your businesses which are your businesses which you think have sort of room to grow in spreads as well as volumes as the economy reopens in 2022 and 2023 and people drive more fly more etc thanks bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer sure so jai first of all on volume constraints in q2 remember we still had some freeze impacts early in q2 here in the u s and then we had some unplanned downtime in the polymers but sequentially we were able to build a bit of inventory and we had pretty good production so i think the headline there s a lot underneath the details in which product lines were higher or lower my sense is that the fuels part of the business was still a bit weak in q2 but the polymers and the po was very strong in production in q2 and certainly up compared to q1 going forward you asked about which product lines have the most potential for spread and volume improvement definitely it s in fuels i do think there s incremental potential in spread improvement in the polymers area globally but where i think we have the greatest opportunity for a step up in volume and and spread is in oxyfuels and in gasoline and distillate here in the u s and we hope that will be very meaningful as we work through q3 and certainly into q4 operator thank you our next question comes from matthew blair with tudor pickering holt company please proceed with your question matthew blair tudor analyst hi good morning bob i m sorry to hear about the accident i had a question on the renewables side so you have several initiatives on the table i think it s probably fair to say that lyondell is one of the leaders in this area but at the same time investors have a hard time gauging just how meaningful these projects might be for such a large company so could you help put that into perspective as you look at like qcp or mortech or circulin what are you most excited about and what has the potential to really move the needle for you bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer sure thank you matthew and i appreciate your words of support yes i mean i have these conversations with investors often and this is going to build momentum over the decade first of all recall that our goal is to have about two million tons of recycled or renewable based plastics by the end of the decade by 2030 we think that will probably represent about 15 of our production i mean think about our work on maritech as well as on circularity on qcp mechanical recycling and the circulun brand in particular that s all part of our polyolefin franchise and given our capabilities in research and development application development we re leading in this area in circularity and we ll continue to it s just part of the polyolefin business is how i would think about it not some separate significant step up in earnings but it s part of making the polyolefin business work long term operator thank you our final question comes from jonathan rao with jpmorgan please proceed with your question jonathan rao jpmorgan analyst hi thanks for taking my question really appreciate the focus on deleveraging and the very good progress you ve made there year to date and i guess as it relates to the 4 billion net debt reduction target that you ve referenced that is a net target i m curious kind of how you think about paying down more debt versus just building cash on the balance sheet and in the case of the former possibly where within the debt capital structure you think about targeting thanks bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer yes i ll ask michael to respond to that question michael mcmurray executive vice president and chief financial officer no sure great so great question maybe just a couple of points what i would say is that our overall maturity profile is in great shape especially after all the actions that we took in 2020 actually our weighted average maturity is about 16 years as we sit here today and we don t have any significant near term maturities on a year to date basis we ve taken out 1 8 billion that was done through our term loan and some of our 2023 we have the ability to further deleverage in the second half of the year with the 650 million of callable notes that we have as well so that s obviously something that is in a prime focus and then lastly we typically have a bit of commercial paper that s outstanding that we can use to delever and then we re contemplating potentially doing a tender as well again in the second half of the year and then just from a targeting point of view kind of through the cycle our total debt to ebitda target is about 1 5 times to 2 5 times and so quite frankly as we re progressing through this year we re in great shape from that perspective as well as evidenced by the upgrade that we received a week ago from s p bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer great thank you michael and jonathan let s see how the year progresses when we get this 4 billion put away let s continue the dialogue on capital allocation i think we ve proven over the years that we ve been very disciplined in this area and you should continue to expect that from us operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i will now turn the call over to bob patel for closing remarks bhavesh v bob patel chief executive officer all right thank you alex in q2 2021 lyondellbasell has demonstrated its turbocharged earnings power in a very strong market environment and a larger company going forward we expect demand to remain strong as i ve mentioned throughout this call with reopening still ahead of us and many parts of the world backlogs in many product areas that have to be relieved inventory restocking and increased mobility we at lyondellbasell are really well positioned to significantly strengthen our investment grade balance sheet pay down debt and to capitalize on a stronger for longer market environment the main point that i hope investors got out of the call today is that we ve whether where we can debate about where we are in the cycle lyondellbasell have increased our earnings power through the cycle by more than 1 billion to date compared to 2017 and after our po tba project is online we ll add another 500 million of ebitda in earnings power all of that should provide for very robust cash flow which we will deploy in a very disciplined way to the benefit of our shareholders thank you for your interest and hope you all have a great weekend

expectations for the future as always these forward looking statements are subject to certain risk factors which could cause actual results to differ materially these risk factors are listed in the

right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 michael kehoe president chief executive officer thank you operator and good morning everyone we appreciate you re joining us on the call today bryan petrucelli kinsale s chief financial officer and brian haney chief operating officer are with me as well after each of us make a few comments we will then take any questions you may have kinsale s operating earnings for the second quarter 2021 were 1 28 per diluted share an increase of 52 from the second quarter of 2020 gross written premium was up over 45 for the quarter the company posted a 79 5 combined ratio and an 18 2 annualized operating return on equity for the first six months of 2021 these numbers are well ahead of our guidance of a mid 80s combined ratio and mid teens operating return on equity kinsale s results were driven by our unique business strategy that combines focus on the small account e s market control over our underwriting operation and technology enabled low costs but they are also driven especially the 45 growth rate in the second quarter from the continued favorable market conditions within the e s segment we continue to see steady growth in new business submissions which we see as a bit of a leading indicator and we continue to see low double digit rate increases across the book of business which are positively impacting our margins brian haney will offer some additional commentary on this topic here in a moment we are optimistic about market conditions for the balance of the year and perhaps next year as well regarding capital levels the company is well situated currently and we don t expect to need any additional capital this year even with the strong growth rate to the extent that we do need additional capital next year we would expect to use debt in lieu of equity capital i ll now turn the call over to bryan petrucelli bryan petrucelli chief financial officer thanks mike the results for the second quarter continue to be strong and driven by solid premium growth favorable loss experience and disciplined expense management we reported net income of 35 6 million for the second quarter of 2021 representing an increase of 17 8 when compared to 30 2 million last year and due primarily to higher earned premium and net favorable loss reserve development net operating earnings increased by 54 to 29 4 million up from 19 million in the second quarter of 2020 the company generated underwriting income of 28 7 million and a combined ratio of 79 2 for the quarter compared to 15 7 million and 83 8 last year with improvements to both the loss and expense ratios the combined ratio for the second quarter of 2021 included 6 6 points from net favorable prior year loss reserve development and 2 1 points from cat losses compared to 3 7 points of favorable loss reserve development and negligible cat losses last year the cat losses this quarter were primarily related to development on losses from a couple of the texas winter storms our current accident year loss ratio exclusive of cat losses decreased slightly in recognition of ongoing favorable pricing trends that mike previously touched on we expect there will always be some variability in our quarterly expense ratio and our 21 7 expense ratio for this quarter continues to benefit from some economies of scale given that our earned premiums are growing faster than our operating expenses and from slightly lower relative net commissions as a result of a shift in the mix of business to lines that are subject to reinsurance and where we receive ceding commissions our effective income tax rate for the quarter was 18 5 compared to 14 8 last year and higher due to lower tax benefits from stock compensation activity this quarter annualized operating return on equity was 18 2 for the first six months of this year and again as mike stated ahead of our mid teens guidance gross written premiums were approximately 194 million for the quarter representing a 45 increase over last year due to the favorable market conditions that mike mentioned and also superior our superior service standards on the investment side net investment income increased by 11 8 over the second quarter last year up to 7 4 million from 6 6 million last year as a result of continued growth in our investment portfolio annualized gross investment returns excluding cash and cash equivalents was 2 6 for the year so far compared to 3 last year diluted operating earnings per share was 1 28 per share for the quarter compared to 0 84 per share last year and with that i ll pass it over to brian haney brian haney chief operating officer thanks bryan as mentioned earlier premium grew 45 in the second quarter up 36 up from 36 in the first quarter and 34 in the fourth quarter of 2020 the growth is generally driven by higher submission volume and rate increases as well as robust economic growth which is driving up premiums every one of our divisions was up for the quarter led by allied health excess casualty and commercial property the reopening of the economy and the strong economic growth is providing us a significant boost submission growth was in the upper teens in the second quarter which represented a rebound from the first quarter as for rates we continue to push them up in response to market conditions as a reminder we have a very heterogeneous book of business which complicates reducing all the rate movement to one single number but that all being said we see rates being up in the low teens range in the aggregate during the second quarter generally consistent with the past two quarters some data suggest that the industry is past peak rate increases at this point but for whatever reason perhaps mix of business we feel that our rate increases have stayed high and not started to ebb it is worth discussing inflation for a moment it s important to note that a majority of our policies are written on inflation sensitive exposure bases such as revenue or payroll so as inflation goes up premiums go up commensurately for the bulk of our policies inflation also affects losses of course and while our loss trends have been tamed we are noticing a general price inflation for the businesses we insure and in the economy on the whole it is a matter of time before that shows up in loss trends for us and the rest of the industry the biggest components of our losses are medical cost lost wages construction costs and legal costs all of which are going to be affected by general price inflation we are aware of this and staying on top of it whatever the true inflation rate is and whether or not it is transitory we are getting rate increases that are in excess of it so we are implicitly building on what we re already strong margins we feel that elevated inflation will prolong the hard market because it will erode the margin improvement that insurers were aiming for with the increased rates we feel we are in a good spot because we are raising rates not to correct the problem but to further improve our already strong returns but in any event the longer inflation remains elevated the longer we expect the hard market will stay with us in summary we are optimistic we have a great team great results as well as a strong balance sheet with conservative reserves our business model works well in any market hard or softer in between but the current market conditions are really good and with that i ll turn it back over to mike michael kehoe president chief executive officer thanks brian operator we re now ready to take any questions that come in questions and answers operator thank you sir we have our first question from the line of jeff schmitt from william blair your line is open michael kehoe president chief executive officer good morning jeff jeff schmitt william blair analyst hi good morning just curious how you handle inflation from a reserving perspective i think you d have to have a view on whether it s sort of transitory or not you tend to be pretty conservative just wondering how you re accounting for that michael kehoe president chief executive officer yes i mean i think we ve spoken about this many times that it s a fundamental part of our business strategy to post reserves that are much more likely to develop favorably than unfavorably and we re constantly reviewing actual experience against all the various actuarial assumptions including loss cost trends and so as data comes in we adjust our estimates accordingly as brian said most of our policies are priced off of inflation sensitive metrics so to the extent inflation picks up that flows through the revenue that our insureds experience and our insurance premiums are priced off that inflated base but does that kind of get at your question jeff schmitt william blair analyst yes no i was just curious if you have to make a call on whether that s transitory or just how you handle that but and then you had pointed out i think some of the areas of highest growth was allied health excess casualty i think those areas have that s been are they sort of the farthest from rate adequacy or is there just greater dislocation in those lines could you maybe touch on those michael kehoe president chief executive officer well i would say i mean the rates we re charging those are adequate and we re earning like a really high margin i would just say the industry has had some challenges in those areas commercial property has seen a lot of cat activity in the industry allied health there s just been a number of competitors that have sort of blown up writing that type of business and excess casualty is a fairly common thing you would see in a market turn where people kind of get burned with soft market practices and then have to course correct and that s what we see going on so but i would say we feel pretty good about our rates and our experience in this jeff schmitt william blair analyst right yes and i was referring more to the market are those areas where the market is farther off i mean you ve been rate adequate obviously for some time but ok okay thanks fort the answers operator thank you we have another question from the line of mark hughes from truist your line is open mark hughes truist analyst yes thank you good morning michael kehoe president chief executive officer good morning mark mark hughes truist analyst the 210 points of development on the q1 storms was that inflation material costs higher than expected or what drove that michael kehoe president chief executive officer i think it was a couple of claims where we were in an excess position and on a larger commercial schedule there can be some ambiguity in the early days hey we think this loss is 30 million and over the course of the adjustment process it turns out to be a higher number and if we re attaching excess of substantial retention or an underlying schedule i think it was that type of thing i wouldn t attribute it to inflation per se i think it was just ambiguity in the adjustment process and we were in an excess position mark hughes truist analyst understood how about when we think about social inflation i think you ve spoken to this a number of times but do you see any movement in the court systems anything in your book that s been impacted by that i think you stay away from most of that but could you give us a sense of what s going on in terms of activity or court movement let s say michael kehoe president chief executive officer i think in general i would say loss cost trend is real we endeavor to stay well ahead of it i think given our focus on smaller commercial accounts the fact that we put up smaller limits inoculates us a little bit from some of these nuclear verdicts and the like i would say in terms of inflation we as brian indicated hey to the extent that there s a general price inflation we re going to see that along with everybody else and certainly when property claims come in material costs are up labor costs are up i m sure we re seeing that in current estimates but is it impacting our macro trends across our whole book of business no i think things are going quite well for us mark hughes truist analyst and then the reserve development in the quarter the 6 6 points how much of that was 2020 2020 was obviously an unusual year in terms of frequency and severity a little more depth i know in some of your older accident years you ve had some less favorable development through time how are you seeing that dynamic now michael kehoe president chief executive officer yes i mean we are conservatively positioned across all of our accident years that s a huge priority for us as a management team and as a business we ve gotten some dramatic rate increases the last couple of years and i would say some of those more current accident years are even more conservatively positioned and then 2020 also has the added issue of covid where our reported losses were lower than we expected and we offset that with higher ibnr just to make sure that we were well positioned in the case there were some bounce back in reported loss activity each quarter that goes by we ll make modest adjustments to those assumptions to normalize the 2020 accident year with the prior years but in general we re always every quarter we re looking at actual loss activity and comparing it against all the various actuarial assumptions that we make and we adjust but i think you re in general i think from an investor standpoint one thing i would note is hey we re seeing a modest uptick in the amount of redundancy that s coming out every quarter and i think that s largely a function of the pretty dramatic increases in price that we ve been able to charge the last couple of years so we again we feel very good about the reserves for the company and we feel very good about the modest margin expansion we re starting to see on the bottom line mark hughes truist analyst have you seen any bounce back off the 2020 accident year in terms of claim michael kehoe president chief executive officer no mark hughes truist analyst okay and then one final question i m sorry to drone on but the ryan specialty s ipo was i think part of their discussion was that there is consolidation among the wholesale brokers any thoughts on whether that is the case that there s consolidation that that has any meaning in terms of your ability to get to the market michael kehoe president chief executive officer well there s definitely been consolidation ryan has acquired a number of firms but the others have as well and it hasn t had any impact on us we do quite a bit of business with all the large wholesale brokers and but we work with a lot of smaller we kind of characterize them as national brokers some are more regional some are very local there are some start ups that have opened in the last couple of years we work with them as well but certainly there s been a lot of acquisition activity and as of today it hasn t really impacted our business so we do quite a bit of work with all those firms and they re very good at what they do mark hughes truist analyst thank you operator thank you sir we have another question from the line of casey alexander from compass point your line is open casey alexander compass point analyst hi good morning i have a couple of questions for you first of all kind of from a high level given the extraordinary growth rate that you re producing to what extent does this eventually stress your manpower your real estate footprint and your need to add some expenses to support this growth and also and particularly in relation to the real estate footprint how does work at home habits and work at home changes impact that dynamic michael kehoe president chief executive officer casey good morning this is mike yes we listen we ve been growing at a strong double digit rate for a number of years now and of course it puts a lot of stress on your management team we re recruiting and hiring a lot of people there s a big training component and the like but hey that s what we get paid to do and we ve been working hard at it for a number of years now so that s kind of business as usual in terms of the real estate footprint there s no stress there we ve got plenty of capacity in the building that we occupy what was the third part of your question casey alexander compass point analyst well just how this work at home habits impact that michael kehoe president chief executive officer yes we re a work from the office team and we did move 90 of our employees home when the virus first hit back in i guess it was march or april of 2020 but by october we re basically back in the office and given the number of new hires the training component we want those new employees to learn our culture working together in an office facilitates communication a big part of our business strategy is delivering best in class service to our brokers and all that all those goals are furthered by having everybody work together in an office and so that s how we re operating casey alexander compass point analyst okay great thanks and secondly i would say a year ago the discussion during the quarter you discussed that a decrease in the competitive environment and in the set of competitors was offered you kind of a clear vision toward accelerated growth over the course of the next year how would you characterize the competitive environment now compared to what it was a year ago brian haney chief operating officer i d say it s pretty flat so we ve seen some new competitors but they tend to be small and we ve still seen some pullback from larger competitors so on balance it s more or less the way it was casey alexander compass point analyst all right great thank you i appreciate you re taking my questions michael kehoe president chief executive officer thanks casey operator thank you sir we have another question from the line of rowland mayor from rbc capital your line is open rowland mayor rbc capital analyst hi good morning when you guys talked about low teens rate increases is that pure rate or the effects of changing terms and conditions included in that number brian haney chief operating officer it s pure rate michael kehoe president chief executive officer not including the effect that not including the effect of inflation on the exposure base rowland mayor rbc capital analyst got it and is there any way to quantify sort of the impact of your tightening terms and conditions and say is that worth another one or two points or is it the equivalent of one or two points of pricing or any brian haney chief operating officer it would be tough to quantify it s worth something michael kehoe president chief executive officer one or two is probably as good a guess as any rowland mayor rbc capital analyst got it that was really my following question i guess just to double enough casey s comment we ve seen a lot of companies talk about dialing up growth do you have in the next coming quarters is that that really hasn t worked down to you guys at all it s not really entered your market yet higher competition michael kehoe president chief executive officer i mean there s look there s plenty of competition i think brian said it was steady from the prior year our hit ratio on new business submissions continues to be somewhere between 10 and 15 it was the same last year it was the same the year before that so there s plenty of competition it s just it s diminished from where it was five years ago or four years ago when we were in a very what i would characterize as a more intensely competitive market it s a little bit less today but that doesn t mean there s no competition rowland mayor rbc capital analyst no that makes sense those were my only two questions congrats on the quarter michael kehoe president chief executive officer thanks rowland operator thank you we have another question from the line of pablo singzon from jpmorgan your line is open pablo singzon jpmorgan analyst hi thank you so my first question it seems like the improvement in accident year loss fix call it about one point from the first half last year to first half of this year is low in light of a gap we re getting between price increases to your point i think you said like low double digits in loss trends which i think in the past you ve said it in the mid single digit range can you share your thoughts on that and maybe is there an element of conservatism in the loss picture setting and i guess would it be reasonable to assume something to drift down in those loss picks over time michael kehoe president chief executive officer yes pablo good morning this is mike i would say there s absolutely an element of conservatism in those loss picks and i think they re highly likely to develop down over the years as those losses come in and they re adjusted and settled out and we re a relatively young company it s our i think our 12th accident year in business but if you look back every accident year but one of the very early ones have developed favorably on an inception to date basis and so that s a really important goal for us as a management team we want people to have a lot of confidence in our balance sheet and so yes absolutely conservative reserves we re getting really good rate increases and you match that up with a high quality very disciplined underwriting operation and we expect the margin expansion to continue incrementally pablo singzon jpmorgan analyst got it and along the same lines could you speak about where you see the expense ratio trending so obviously passengers has been going down even even as the company has been expanding right but just given the strong growth in premiums that would likely persist for at least the next couple of years how do you see that expense ratio trending brian haney chief operating officer we obviously are making investments in human capital and it as we grow there s a possibility you ll see a little more drift down in that expense ratio but i think if you re looking over the long term i think seeing where it is now the 21 to 22 to 23 range over the long term is probably where we would see it but over the short term you could see a slight improvement in that michael kehoe president chief executive officer yes keep in mind that it s a lot of it is mix of business as brian said earlier on his comments we reinsure some lines of business where we get a ceding commission which could help push that down if we saw an uptick in our excess casualty business for instance so that s one big component i think the variable is mix of business and then headcount pablo singzon jpmorgan analyst got it and then last question for me thanks for the update on capital but can you remind us again what kind or what levels being leveraged you d be comfortable running at and i suppose next year your surplus could potentially be funded by debt and equity depending on how growth plays out but i guess just sort of big picture what kind of leverage kinsale would be comfortable running at thanks michael kehoe president chief executive officer yes i think it s a 20 debt to total capital is kind of our long term target i think we re about 6 today so we got a ways to go but that s why we made the comments about really as we need additional capital to grow the business we would look to debt not equity at this point pablo singzon jpmorgan analyst got it and premium leverage or actually that was the question i should have been clear premium leverage and i guess depending on how you grow right that will affect your premium leverage but and well to me affect how much of that you might have to raise but what premium leverage would kinsale be comfortable running at thank you michael kehoe president chief executive officer yes the am best bcar model i mean it s a complex capital model the big drivers within that are reserves and premium but that there s other charges for growth and investments et cetera and so there s no specific premium to surplus ratio that would be driven from the model but we just estimate somewhere in the a little bit higher than 1 2 1 net written premium to statutory surplus that s not gaap equity and gaap equity and stat surplus are correlated but they re different numbers so for what that s worth obviously we re a rated and am best is our that s our am best rating that s a really important number for us and we re going to maintain that a rating so 1 2 to 1 25 to 1 i think is a good guess pablo singzon jpmorgan analyst okay thank you operator thank you pablo we have another question from the line of jamie inglis from philosmith your line is open jamie inglis philosmith analyst hi good morning i m interested in following up on your comments about inflation and how it helps you when it s your rates or your premiums are tied to revenue or payroll et cetera sort of allows you to participate in inflation on the revenue side but how does it work on the other side because if we pay a claim today the claims on a policy that was written a little while ago and it could be quite a while ago depending on the type of policy so does the inflation today allow you to in a way sort of put more in the bank from a reserve point of view or does that is it not work that way michael kehoe president chief executive officer this is mike i would say that this is going to be a very complex topic how insulation works its way through our book of business clearly if we collect a premium today and settle a claim in three years that claim is going to be inflated which is a negative the fact that we write a policy for 10 000 and at the end of the year the contractor that we re ensuring has charged higher rates because of inflation we re going to collect and audit additional premium that s an inflation benefit and there s a lot of those that work their way through our business but i would say in general we d like stable pricing but given the inflation sensitive pricing mechanism it provides a little bit of protection and then i think brian was brian haney commented earlier that the conservatism in our reserve position provides additional protection and then i would also say the fact that we tend to focus on posting lower limit policies probably provides another round of protection right but there s a lot of different things with inflation that would probably go either for us or against us jamie inglis philosmith analyst okay great thanks for your help michael kehoe president chief executive officer you bet operator thank you sir there are no further questions at this time i will now turn the call back to mr michael kehoe for closing remarks sir michael kehoe president chief executive officer okay thank you operator and thank you everybody for joining us and we look forward to

presentation uses certain non gaap measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures is contained in the press release so please turn to slide three and it s now my pleasure to turn the call over to our chairman and ceo scott santi e scott santi chairman chief executive officer thank you karen and good morning everyone in the second quarter we saw continued recovery momentum across our portfolio and we delivered strong operational execution and financial results revenue was up 43 with organic growth up 37 and we saw double digit growth in every segment and geography earnings per share of 2 45 was up 143 108 if you exclude the onetime tax benefit of 0 35 that we recorded in the quarter in this strong demand environment and in the face of very challenging supply conditions our teams around the world leveraged our long held close to the customer manufacturing and supply chain approach and the benefits of staying fully staffed and invested through our winter recovery positioning to continue providing world class service levels to our customers while also continuing to execute on our long term strategy to achieve and sustain itw s full potential performance we re certainly encouraged by our organic growth momentum as order intake rates remained pretty much strong across the board and during the second quarter we saw multiple examples of how our ability to sustain our differentiated delivery capabilities by remaining fully invested through the pandemic resulted in incremental share gain opportunities for our businesses while there s no doubt that the raw material supply environment is as challenging as we have experienced in a long time maybe ever in my 38 years at itw we are as well positioned as we can be to continue to set ourselves apart through our ability to respond for our customers we ve worked hard over the last nine years to position itw to deliver differentiated performance in any environment and i have no doubt that the itw team will continue to execute at a high level as we move through the balance of the year and beyond now for some more detail on our performance in the second quarter as i mentioned organic growth was 37 with strong performance across our seven segments the two segments that were hardest hit by the pandemic a year ago led the way this quarter with automotive oem up 84 and food equipment up 46 by geography north america was up 36 and international was up 38 with europe up 50 and asia pacific up 20 gaap eps of 2 45 was up 143 and included a onetime tax benefit of 0 35 related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets in the u k due to a change in the statutory corporate tax rate there excluding this item eps of 2 10 grew 108 it was a q2 record and was 10 higher than in q2 of 2019 operating income increased 99 and incremental margin was 40 at the enterprise level operating margin of 24 3 improved 680 basis points on strong volume leverage along with 150 basis points of benefits from our enterprise initiatives year to date our teams have delivered robust margin expansion with incremental margins for our seven segments ranging from 37 to 48 inclusive of price cost impact speaking of price cost price cost headwind to margin percentage in the quarter was 120 basis points while the pace of raw material cost increases accelerated in the second quarter our businesses have been active in implementing pricing actions in response to rising raw material costs since early in the year consistent with our strategy to cover raw material cost inflation with price adjustments on a dollar for dollar basis in q2 we ended up just short of that goal due to some timing lags and as a result net price cost impact reduced eps by 0 01 in the quarter we continue to expect price cost impact to be eps neutral or better for the year and i ll come back and provide more color on the price cost environment a little later in my remarks in the quarter after tax return on invested capital was a record at 30 8 free cash flow was 477 million with a conversion of 72 of net income when adjusted for the onetime tax benefit i mentioned earlier and that was due to the additional working capital investments necessary to support our strong organic growth we continue to expect approximately 100 conversion for the full year we repurchased 250 million of our shares this quarter as planned and finally our tax rate in the quarter was 10 1 due to the onetime tax benefit excluding this item our q2 tax rate was 23 now moving to slide four for an update on price cost we continue to experience raw material cost increases particularly in categories such as steel resins and chemicals and now project raw material cost inflation at around 7 for the full year which is almost five percentage points higher than what we anticipated as the year began and just for some perspective this is roughly 2 times what we experienced in the 2018 inflation tariff cycle we learned a lot from that experience and as a result the timeliness and pace of our price recovery actions are well ahead of where we were in 2018 as i mentioned we expect price cost impact to be eps neutral or better for the full year with pricing actions more than offsetting cost increases on a dollar for dollar basis price cost will continue to have a negative impact on our operating margin percentage however in the near term as we saw in q2 and that impact will likely be modestly higher in q3 versus q2 before it starts to go the other way for the full year we expect price cost impact to be dilutive to margin by about 100 basis points which is 50 basis points higher than where we were as of the end of q1 that being said margin benefits from enterprise initiatives and volume leverage will provide us with ample ability to offset the negative effect of price cost on margin percentage and deliver strong overall margin performance for the year and beyond the near term price cost impact we remain confident that we have meaningful additional structural margin improvement potential from the ongoing execution of our enterprise initiatives with that i ll turn it over to chris for some comments on our segment performance in q2 chris christopher a o herlihy vice chairman thank you scott and good morning everyone starting on slide five the table on the left provides some perspectives on the growth momentum in our businesses with a look at sequential revenue from q1 to q2 as you would expect the pace of recovery in our auto oem segment has been dampened by the well publicized shortage of semiconductor chips despite very strong underlying demand and for that reason we added a row to the table to show portfolio demand trends ex auto our q2 revenue ex auto increased 8 versus q1 this year q2 had one more shipping day than q1 so on an equal days basis our q2 versus q1 revenue growth ex auto is 6 which is 2 times of our normal q2 versus q1 seasonality of plus 3 in addition we added more than 200 million of backlog in q2 both of these factors show that demand accelerated meaningfully in q2 across our portfolio so let s go to a little more detail for each segment starting with automotive oem demand recovery versus prior year was most evident in this segment with 84 organic growth this of course was against easy comps versus a year ago when most of our customers in north america and western europe were shut down from mid march to mid may north america was up 102 europe was up 106 and china up 20 we estimate that the shortage of semiconductor chips negatively impacted our sales by about 60 million in the quarter operating margin of 18 8 was up 26 6 percentage points on volume leverage and enterprise initiatives price cost with a significant headwind of more than 200 basis points due to the longer cycle time required to implement price recovery actions in this segment given the ongoing semiconductor chip supply uncertainty we now expect full year organic growth in automotive to be approximately 10 versus our original range of 14 to 18 at the beginning of the year to be clear this is not lost revenue but simply delayed into next year furthermore the slower than expected growth in auto is offset by strength elsewhere in the enterprise please turn to slide six for food equipment in food equipment organic revenue rebounded 46 with recovery taking hold across the board and the backlog that is up significantly versus prior year north america was up 39 with equipment up 42 and service up 33 institutional revenue was up more than 30 with healthcare and education growth in the low to mid 30s and lodging up in the mid 20s restaurants were up about 60 with the largest year over year increases in full service and qsr retail grew in the mid teens on continued solid demand and new product rollouts international recovery was also robust at 58 with europe up 66 and asia pacific up 29 equipment sales were strong up 66 with service growth of 39 which continued to be impacted by extended lockdowns in europe operating margin was 22 with an incremental of 46 test measurement and electronics revenue of 606 million was a q2 record with organic growth of 29 test measurement was up 20 driven by solid recovery in customer capex spend and continued strength in semicon electronics grew 38 continued strength in consumer electronics and automotive applications and the added benefit in timing of some large equipment orders in electronic assembly operating margin of 28 1 was 240 basis points was up 240 basis points and a q2 record moving to slide seven welding growth was also strong in q2 at 33 equipment revenue was up 38 and consumables growth of 25 was the first time in positive territory since 2019 our industrial business grew 52 on increased capex spending by our customers and the commercial business remains solid up 26 following 17 growth in the first quarter north america was up 38 and international growth was 13 primarily driven by recovery in oil and gas polymers fluids organic growth was 28 led by our automotive aftermarket business up 33 on robust retail sales polymers was up 34 with continued momentum in mro applications and heavy industries fluids was up 8 with north america growth in the mid teens and european sales up low single digits operating margin was an all time record 27 3 with strong volume leverage and enterprise initiatives partly offset by price cost moving to slide eight construction organic growth of 28 reflected double digit growth and recovery in all three regions north america was up 20 with 16 growth in residential renovation and with 26 growth in commercial construction europe grew 61 with strong recovery versus easy comps in the u k and continental europe australia and new zealand organic growth was 13 with continued strength in residential and commercial operating margin in the segment of 27 6 was up 390 basis points and was a q2 record specialty organic revenue was up 17 with north america up 15 europe up 24 and asia pacific up 14 our flexible packaging business was up mid single digits against a tougher comp than the rest of this segment the majority of our businesses were up double digits led by appliance up more than 50 consumable sales were up 19 and equipment sales up 12 and with that i ll turn it back to scott e scott santi chairman chief executive officer thanks chris let s move on to slide nine for an update on our full year 2021 guidance we now expect full year revenue to be in the range of 14 3 billion to 14 6 billion up 15 at the midpoint versus last year with organic growth in the range of 11 to 13 and foreign currency translation impact of plus 3 this is an increase in organic growth of one percentage point at the midpoint versus the updated guidance that we provided at the end of q1 driven largely by the incremental revenue impact of pricing actions implemented in q2 in response to accelerating raw material cost increases while demand momentum accelerated in q2 versus q1 as we noted earlier in our presentation we are admittedly being conservative in not projecting that forward in our guidance at this point in time given the significant supply chain disruptions that continue to challenge many of our customers in auto and otherwise we are raising our gaap eps guidance by 0 35 to a range of 8 55 to 8 95 to incorporate the onetime tax benefit realized in the second quarter the midpoint of 8 75 represents earnings growth of 32 versus last year and 13 over 2019 factoring out the onetime q2 tax item the midpoint of our 2021 guidance is 10 higher than 2019 with regard to margin percentage as discussed earlier the incremental cost increases that we saw in q2 will result in full year margin dilution of 100 basis points versus the 50 basis points that we projected as of the end of q1 and we are adjusting our margin percentage guidance accordingly to a range of 24 5 to 25 5 which would still be an improvement of more than 200 basis points year over year and an all time record for the company and again we expect zero eps impact from price cost for the full year we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100 of net income factoring out the impact of the onetime noncash tax benefit we recorded in q2 through the first half we have repurchased 500 million of our shares and expect to repurchase an additional 500 million in the second half finally we expect our tax rate in the second half to be in our usual range of 23 to 24 and for a full year tax rate of around 20 lastly today s guidance excludes any impact from the previously announced acquisition of the mts test simulation business which we expect to close later this year and once that acquisition closes we ll provide you with an update and with that i ll turn it back over to you karen karen fletcher vice president investor relations okay thank you scott adam let s open up the line for questions please questions and answers operator and your first question comes from the line of andrew kaplowitz with citi andrew kaplowitz citi analyst best wishes to michael e scott santi chairman chief executive officer thank you he s on short term ir but he ll be back next week andrew kaplowitz citi analyst excellent so scott or chris you mentioned the raw material cost inflation we know you said inflation will be eps neutral or better for the year do you see the inflationary pressure had stabilized enough now or you can have a handle on these increases that you sort of put into the guide so when you look at q3 and q4 you have confidence in your forecast and then 22 you talked about last quarter what s the probability that these price increases are pretty sticky so you could exceed that 35 to 40 longer term incremental you have e scott santi chairman chief executive officer well on the first question i think we re very confident that we will cover whatever all the increases that have already been incurred and anything subsequent to that i would not be comfortable describing the environment as stabilizing at this point but ultimately i think we are have demonstrated we look back over the last going back to 2017 and even in 18 and certainly this year sort of on a quarterly basis worst impact from price cost and inflationary environments has been a 0 01 maybe 0 02 one quarter so i think we re fully comfortable that our that we ll be able to read and react to whatever might happen from here that the eps impact of the company will be negligible for the full year but i think as i said i don t it s not based on an assumption that things are going to stabilize from here for sure yes i don t think we re seeing we ve seen enough evidence of that nor am i predicting things are going to continue to reach forward either i think it s wait and see christopher a o herlihy vice chairman we saw a significant pickup in the pace of inflation in q2 e scott santi chairman chief executive officer yes andrew kaplowitz citi analyst guys maybe i could just ask a question specific to auto in the sense that you gave us the numbers now 10 for the year i think this quarter you said 20 basis points of price risk cost as you know there s always a lag before you can catch up there so should we assume incremental margins still getting a little worse before it gets better in that business and how long would you surmise it takes to get on top of price risk cost in that business christopher a o herlihy vice chairman well price versus cost in auto is always going to be challenging given the nature of the industry but i would say in terms of incremental in the second quarter in auto we had a 47 incremental and in fact a 47 incremental for the first half of the year so incrementals are strong no doubt but there s no doubt that the structure of the industry the structure of the pricing agreements it does take a little longer hard to say how long it will take for us to catch up there i would say andrew kaplowitz citi analyst thanks guys operator and your next question comes from the line of ann duignan with jpmorgan ann duignan jpmorgan analyst hi good morning christopher a o herlihy vice chairman good morning ann ann duignan jpmorgan analyst could you talk a little bit more about both construction products and test measurement where you said you delivered or you did deliver record q2 operating profit percent can you talk about how sustainable those margins are going forward was there any change here to mix or anything that we should be aware of that would result in those margins diminishing from here or are those sustainable at these levels christopher a o herlihy vice chairman yes so we say the construction margins are very sustainable we ve been improving margin construction for a long time now and certainly for the last few quarters here we ve been in the mid to high 20s in terms of margins in construction so despite the price cost environment we re seeing nice organic growth in construction we re getting nice price realization and so we will start to expect the margins there to be sustainable certainly in test measurement test measurement margins again trending in the high 20s here have been like that for a long time a segment that we like in terms of level of differentiation i believe it s our customer volumes so we don t see any issue with sustaining margins in either test measurement or construction ann duignan jpmorgan analyst okay and go ahead e scott santi chairman chief executive officer i m sorry i was going to add some color commentary that i think i was adding up the time when chris was reading the comments but i think we said all time record margins for q2 and three of our seven segments despite the price cost environment and i ll just circle back to a comment i made which is that there s still room to run in terms of structural margin improvement across the company we ve got 150 basis points of enterprise initiative benefit in this quarter so there s these are certainly sustainable improvements in performance and we expect to continue to do better as we go forward ann duignan jpmorgan analyst okay i ll leave it there in the interest of time i appreciate it thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of stephen volkmann with jefferies stephen volkmann jefferies analyst hi good morning guys maybe just following up on the comment about enterprise initiatives you re talking about i think 100 basis points for the year but you did 150 this quarter i think 120 if i have my numbers right last quarter you ve been overachieving did those slow down for some reason or is there a chance that you do better than 100 this year christopher a o herlihy vice chairman yes i mean i think we re saying 100 plus so we will do better than 100 this year and there s still a lot of impetus on enterprise initiatives on sourcing and 80 20 these are all initiatives and activities that are very granular within our segments within each division there s a host of activities they are working on and actually have been working on not just this year but even starting last year so we entered the year with a fair bit of tailwind in terms of enterprise initiatives so we would expect to do 100 plus for sure e scott santi chairman chief executive officer we re not slacking off stephen volkmann jefferies analyst and then maybe just following up on this price cost kind of question just curious about how you think about the policy here i mean it doesn t feel like there s a lot of pushback on pricing in any of the kind of verticals that we touch why not price for dollars plus margin why kind of create that headwind e scott santi chairman chief executive officer well i don t know the headwind from my perspective is a percentage headwind it s not an earnings headwind the overall position that we want is look we ve created an incredibly profitable economic engine and the most important job we have is to grow it organically and so from the standpoint of to the extent we don t have to go up as high as other people do we re leveraging that strong position and we can translate that into incremental share that s the preferred option we don t want i don t want our people fighting over the next increment we got to get the cost back for sure but then let s get on to talking to our customers about how we can help them improve their businesses operationally technically from a sales standpoint and so that s basically as we can we can certainly do more to get all distracted and try to price optimize in the short term but i don t think that serves our long term interest very well we make plenty of money that its not a stephen volkmann jefferies analyst fair point thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of jeff sprague with vertical research jeff sprague vertical research analyst hey thanks good morning everyone e scott santi chairman chief executive officer good morning jeff jeff sprague vertical research analyst good morning could we just drill a little bit into kind of the whole availability issue we talked about price cost and obviously it s tied to the availability of supply but outside of auto which is very visible and obvious are there clear places in your portfolio where either you re struggling to meet demand because of availability in your supply chain or you re feeling on the customer side perhaps you can deliver but they don t want it because they ve got problems elsewhere down the line i just wonder if you could give us some perspective on that and any color on to what degree if any it may have been limiting the top line here in the quarter or into the balance of the year e scott santi chairman chief executive officer yes i ll give you some overall color and then certainly let chris give you some segment level business level specifics if some things come to mind for him on this i would say in terms of overall color as we talk to our businesses around the world there s no question that it is a daily battle that to maintain supply position necessary to service our customers i would absolutely contend that we are doing better than most for a couple of reasons one is the fact that we have long head localized supply relationships with local manufacturing facilities serving our customers locally we have and then the other factor is what we talked about in our remarks the fact that we kept all our people through the pandemic we have not had to scramble to bring people back so normally our supply chain and our manufacturing operations function in a very simple automated way it s definitely taking a lot more let s call it boot force for now but i think that we re not hearing any big issues from the standpoint of our own ability to supply our customers it doesn t mean that there s not an occasional 2 bracket that shows up late in the there s a couple of welding machines that can t go i m just making that up but that s i m sure that s the case but ultimately given the service levels that we re monitoring as a standard part of our operating practices i would say that i m very comfortable saying that we re working a lot harder than we normally have to but ultimately performing pretty well i would say that the supply chain area beyond auto is much more of an issue for us on the demand side than the supply side and i d point to a couple of things we are seeing a lot of sort of timing changes in terms of orders and requirements not because we can t deliver something but because another supplier can t deliver something to a customer and i d also point to the 200 million of backlog and we ve talked about this before we ship basically today what our customers ordered yesterday and so we operate with very little backlog and the fact that we built a couple of hundred million dollars of backlog i can t analyze every dollar of it but my contention would be that that s a lot more due to sort of customer delays than it is our own ability to supply and look that was the 60 million in auto plus the 200 million in backlog that s another 10 percentage points of organic growth in the second quarter again i m not necessarily contending that all of it could have gone but my bet would be most of it i don t know if you have anything you want to add christopher a o herlihy vice chairman yes the other thing i would say in addition to what to scott s comments i think our overall kind of 80 20 focus here really creates a lot of advantages for us in terms of much more simplifying and streamlining product offerings obviously results in simplification of raw materials and components and that simplification of focus also extends to our suppliers a key part of our strategy and it s working very well for us for many years is to have these very strong and long lasting supplier partnerships and we re a key customer for most of our raw material suppliers this becomes really really important when supply chains become constrained and we ve really seen that work to our benefit here in the last 12 months jeff sprague vertical research analyst great and just a second question just on the m a pipeline obviously you don t have a deal until you ve got something to announce but can you give us a sense of how active your pipeline is have you been able to cultivate things maybe handicap the odds of some other things kind of coming into your strike zone e scott santi chairman chief executive officer well i would tell you that we are excited about mts we are working hard to get that one finished off that is about 650 million of annualized revenue so that s certainly enough work to do for a little while anyway i don t want to necessarily comment on the pipeline as much as to say we remain and will remain very interested in adding high quality businesses to the company but sort of the timing of all that is always the subject of the quality of what opportunities present themselves so there s always stuff going on but it s not a matter of how big or small the pipeline is it s more we re looking for a much narrower set of criteria than i think so it s more a function of the quality of what s there than the quantity jeff sprague vertical research analyst okay understood thanks i ll pass it on operator and your next question comes from the line of joe ritchie from goldman sachs joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst thanks good morning everyone e scott santi chairman chief executive officer good morning joe joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst so i know that i know you guys guide to organic growth trends really not improving or declining and that s just kind of how that s just in your policy going forward i guess when i think about each of the different segments and how you re thinking about the sequentials from here i don t really think about a lot of seasonality in your business but maybe perhaps the construction business right being a little bit seasonally weaker in the fourth quarter how are you thinking about sequential revenue for the segment throughout the rest of the year with the obviously you ve given us the auto guide but really the other segments e scott santi chairman chief executive officer yes i covered that i think overall in my comments but we have sort of temped down the run rate in terms of the guidance relative to run rate chris talked to you about the fact that in the second quarter we saw organic growth rates accelerate by a net three percentage points beyond seasonality and we basically didn t project that same momentum forward through the balance of the year because of the supply risk involved the supply chain risk to our customers so we re playing that pretty conservative and i think that ultimately is going to have more to do with the pace of the organic from here than trends of demand there s plenty of demand out there it s a matter of can our customers get enough raw material to support it joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst got it and then maybe scott just following on that like there you mentioned the backlog in the food equipment business like were you building backlog right now is that are you seeing that as more kind of like a 2022 opportunity just given what you re seeing from a supply chain standpoint or does do you expect some of that to convert in the second half e scott santi chairman chief executive officer i d say some of it converts i think the only one that s probably definitely into 2022 is the one that chris mentioned in auto where the streets sort of doesn t look it s going to get resolved anytime soon but i d say most of the rest of that backlog that 200 million i would expect to given our customers can take it because they can get the other components or things they need that can certainly convert in the back half i think it just doesn t make sense to up the revenue guide when everyone is still supply constrained right now that s i can t say it any more simply than that and until we see how things play out it just didn t make sense to take things too far from where they are now in terms of run rate until we see how that all how the supply issues play out in affecting our customers willingness to ability to take what they ve ordered from us and order more but i would say there s definitely from a standpoint of order rates and the overall demand there s definitely enough there to do well better than what s in our guidance if the supply chain situation gets significantly better from here forward joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst okay yes that s helpful i guess maybe one follow up on price cost i know we ve talked about it a little bit you did mention that 3q is expected to get a little bit worse from q2 but that you put through some pricing actions in 2q so i m just i guess i m just wondering does it take a little bit of time for some of those pricing actions to take hold or why would the headwind get worse in 3q christopher a o herlihy vice chairman yes joe i mean the real reason it s getting worse in q3 is because of the pace of inflation in q2 and we saw a significant pickup in pace in q2 and obviously there s a little bit of a lag so we see a little bit of a worsening in q3 based on what we know today based on the cost increases we see and the normal price increases we see a little worsening in q3 from q2 really on the base of the pace of inflation in q2 joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst got it okay great thank you both operator and your next question comes from the line of jamie cook with credit suisse jamie cook credit suisse analyst hey i guess just two questions one following up on the revenue outlook understanding why you guide sort of conservatively but is there any way you can help us understand just what you re seeing in terms of percentage increases on the order intake rate like by segment just to help us sort of understand what s out there and to what degree are you concerned is there any sort of double ordering that s happening as customers are worried they can t get stuff and then i guess my follow up question obviously the organic growth has performed very strong are there particular segments or customers where you are more sort of confident that some of this organic growth is associated with market share wins that are actually sort of sustainable from here on christopher a o herlihy vice chairman so in terms of acceleration of organic growth we re seeing it obviously we talked about where it s going in a different way but certainly in food equipment test measurement and electronics and welding are certainly growing faster than we expected earlier in the year so we see nice acceleration there we have no reason to believe that it s not sustainable based on our conversations with our customers the order patterns and so on and obviously as we walked and talked about the fact we ve been very busy here in terms of this winter recovery initiative over the last 12 months and well is it still kind of early to quantify this we re feeling pretty good about how we re positioned and we as you know we very intentionally remain fully staffed to serve our customers protect investments in people and initiatives our customer back innovation and so just sales excellence and we certainly have anecdotal evidence out there that would say that that is turning into real share gains and if i just maybe highlight some sort of examples in like food equipment where high levels of product availability maintaining service level excellence as scott talked about and being able to respond and supply where our competitor could not is enabling several share gain and incremental wins from competition in large chains both in foodservice and food retail another example might be in polymers fluids automotive aftermarket staying invested here we re able to sustain sales and our sales and innovation focus coupled with high service levels means we grew as i mentioned in the commentary automotive aftermarket grew by 33 in the quarter and this is well above customer point sales growth indicating that we are getting share in a meaningful way and even on residential construction in our roofing businesses a business which is up 45 in the quarter again we see very clearly we re gaining share there on competition who have certainly been supply chain and operationally constrained extending delivery times and so on and we continue to maintain differentiated service levels so again somewhat anecdotal somewhat early in the winter recovery strategy but certainly ample evidence that we seem to be gaining share and these are just a small selection of illustrative examples of the type of products that we re making across our seven segments jamie cook credit suisse analyst okay and then anything on the order rate intake if you can share with us just what you re seeing that you saw that by segment christopher a o herlihy vice chairman like i said we saw an acceleration of the three segments that i mentioned in e scott santi chairman chief executive officer those are certainly jamie cook credit suisse analyst i m just trying to get numbers you know what i mean if you can t that s fine e scott santi chairman chief executive officer yes orders pretty much equalized shipments for us because of what i said what we our customers order we ship the next day i would say that also your question about i think you used the term double dip ordering in terms of customers trying to hedge order more because they can t get supply i would i absolutely can t say that we re not seeing any of that but i would say that it would be much lower for us because of the fact that our service levels are so good our customers understand in terms of order to ship so some may be certainly ordering more than they would normally because they re concerned about things but i would think that in terms of our service levels we wouldn t there wouldn t be anything that wouldn t be a significant part of the overall demand picture for us jamie cook credit suisse analyst okay thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of nigel coe with wolfe research nigel coe wolfe research analyst thanks good morning and best wishes to mike hope he makes a speedy recovery e scott santi chairman chief executive officer thanks nigel nigel coe wolfe research analyst i wanted to go back to the supply constraints where are you kind of most outside of automotive which was predictable but where are you most concerned i m thinking about maybe electronics perhaps tools would be barriers so what are you monitoring most closely in terms of not just for illinois tool work but for your suppliers which businesses or geographies are you most concerned christopher a o herlihy vice chairman yes i would say electronics in general have been fairly constrained to that impact segments like welding food equipment test measurement and electronics would be one that i would call out the inflation environment obviously has been across the board in terms of steel resins chemicals and electronics but in terms of supply chain constraints electronics and to a certain sense steel related businesses e scott santi chairman chief executive officer but beyond that i don t think there s anything that really concentrates up i think again the color from our businesses it s something different every day but it s not a it takes a lot more work and it s not even the big dollar stuff it s the again the 2 bracket but it is a real it takes a real effort right now significantly more than normal christopher a o herlihy vice chairman demand tends to excel e scott santi chairman chief executive officer yes nigel coe wolfe research analyst yes and then some companies have talked about box purchases because of the higher volumes service plan i wouldn t think i suppose freight is a big issue for you but maybe address those two points and because that theoretically could change very quickly so i m just wondering what impact from spot purchases and bigger spending e scott santi chairman chief executive officer spot purchases can you explain that a little more nigel coe wolfe research analyst i think you and another company would purchase some hedges e scott santi chairman chief executive officer yes we don t hedge we don t forward back so everything current costs are flushing through right now yes christopher a o herlihy vice chairman and the second part of your question there i think related to freight and logistics is that correct and so with freight and logistics i mean obviously there s an impact for us but i would say less of an impact than some of our peers maybe on the basis that the producer where we sell producer and source where we sell philosophy that we ve long had has certainly mitigated the impact of freight and logistics on our cost structure and availability nigel coe wolfe research analyst great thanks guys operator and your next question comes from the line of scott davis with melius research scott davis melius research analyst hey good morning guys christopher a o herlihy vice chairman good morning e scott santi chairman chief executive officer good morning scott scott davis melius research analyst hope mike feels better must be a good story back story to the sports injury e scott santi chairman chief executive officer it s his to tell scott davis melius research analyst hopefully he didn t join some sort of football team or something the over 50 football team anyways i only have one question it s just on mts when you bring in mts how do you cadence 80 20 i mean how do you bring in a deal of this size kind of bring 80 20 in without really disrupting it is there kind of a playbook there you guys can walk through and help us understand christopher a o herlihy vice chairman yes absolutely scott so obviously we ve completely reinvigorated 80 20 over the last few years with this front to back process and effectively the process that we will employ on mts is exactly the same process that we have employed on our 84 divisions across the company so we have clear insight on what to do we have clear insight on how to do it and we have clear insight on what the outcome should be when we get it done properly coupled with the fact that we ve built a tremendous amount of capability in the company of folks who can go in and help guide mts on the 80 20 journey so we feel very confident in the playbook we feel very confident in our capability we think the raw materials in mts are fantastic with respect to 80 20 opportunity that s one of the key attractions for us when we bought it the other thing i d say to you is that we ve got a very similar business in our portfolio in test measurement and instron where we ve done this successfully before so very confident that we can do this and do this successfully e scott santi chairman chief executive officer the small plan it s probably a three to five year process the next part and part of that is not disrupting the business christopher a o herlihy vice chairman it s always the peers that make sense we re in no rush here e scott santi chairman chief executive officer yes scott davis melius research analyst okay super helpful good luck thank you e scott santi chairman chief executive officer thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of mig dobre with baird mig dobre baird analyst thank you good morning everyone going back to your comments on pricing obviously a lot changed over the past three months and can you maybe clarify for us what impact pricing had to your adjustment to the overall organic growth guidance e scott santi chairman chief executive officer for the year mig dobre baird analyst yes please e scott santi chairman chief executive officer yes yes it s 1 mig dobre baird analyst okay i m presuming then that e scott santi chairman chief executive officer that was the 1 we added toward the end mig dobre baird analyst okay that s kind of what i figured but i just wanted to confirm so if this is impacting the back half of the year primarily then at least presumably you have a couple of points of growth just from pricing in the back half if i look at the implied guidance right at the high end we re talking about growing something like 7 organically a couple of points of that is is there incremental price and i mean look scott you were talking earlier saying hey i m trying to take a conservative approach here but at least to me when i m adjusting out for this pricing element and i think about the comparisons that are still fairly easy relative to the prior year it just strikes me that you really are being conservative here in terms of how you re thinking about your business progression on a fixed price call it core basis so just to kind of clarify this is it that there is some lack of clarity as to where maybe demand is going to be because of what s happening with the supply chain or is it that you re having some second thoughts with regards to how you re going to be able to convert revenue given your some of the disruptions that you re having to deal with e scott santi chairman chief executive officer it s the former not the latter if i understood you correctly bigger risk for us by far is customer supply chain and what that does to their demand patterns from here on out it is as i said before it s about as volatile of a situation as i ve seen in my career at itw and so i don t i m not trying to be mysterious about it i think until we see that starts to stabilize it s just really hard to be comfortable sort of raising i know we re serving the demand we have today really well and the sort of run rate from the standpoint that our customers are able to sustain and i think we re comfortable to continue to our ability to do that will continue on for the back half there s a lot more orders and a lot more demand than that s again why we built backlog that s there s not a demand question if we had our customers had sort of unimpaired supply chains right now we d probably had 10 more points in the second quarter and this is it s not a fact that s just my opinion but just looking at the backlog and so i think demand is certainly much stronger right now given the pace of the recovery it s just a matter of from the standpoint of all the supply chain issues and risks for our customers their pace of being able to what they re ultimately going to need from us as i said it s just hard to justify going up with a lot of confidence from here but it s more their supply side than their demand side if that makes sense mig dobre baird analyst yes i think it does and the follow up to all of this is as we re starting to think about 2022 and if we re using your framework for the back half of 21 as the starting point in thinking about 2022 i think the question is how what growth is likely to look like next year right because meat and dairy pricing normalizes next year so you won t have the kind of tailwinds you have this year on that in that part e scott santi chairman chief executive officer look my we re not thinking about 22 much yet but i would just say as a general rule a lot of the supply chain disruption i think just pushes adds to the duration of the recovery i think there s plenty of business now and because all of it can t be satisfied the point of demand now and chris posted the example of auto this 60 million we couldn t ship in auto in the second quarter that s not going away that s just getting pushed out we ve got deals the dealer inventories at all time lows i forgot what it was less than a month maybe less than a month i think i saw and so to the extent i don t think it s necessarily the worst thing in the world that all the demand that s there right now can t be fully served because it s going to allow us to again this recovery duration gets extended by another two to four quarters maybe and we ll think harder about that as we get to the back part of the year mig dobre baird analyst okay that s helpful lastly for me on the topic of m a you talked about portions of your business that you consider for divestiture before you ve taken a step back on that this year i m sort of curious as activity has picked up multiples are pretty good will you reconsider this at a point in time down the line maybe 2022 e scott santi chairman chief executive officer yes mig dobre baird analyst okay thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of julian mitchell with barclays julian mitchell barclays analyst hi good morning maybe just a first question around the free cash flow i don t think that s been touched on yet your inventories and receivables are up each sort of 100 million plus sequentially just wondered how you see working capital playing out in the second half and what we should think about that as a sort of cash flow item for the year as a whole and also sort of more broadly on the capex side of things how much is your capex coming up this year and have you revised at all your sort of medium term capex planning assumptions because of these constraints e scott santi chairman chief executive officer i think the best way to model our working capital requirements is our months on hand and days sales outstanding sort of we manage the metrics on those generally speaking months on hand runs roughly 2 5 months dso i can t remember off the top of my head but whatever the average is 60 ish maybe so that s where working capital is going to go sales go up months on hand is not going to go up but the dollars invested if today is to stay at that month on hand going to go up same with receivables in terms of dso so it s not a it s something that happens automatically we don t have to sort of force that to happen but if sales go up inventory is going to go up that s months on hand is a function of that s how 80 20 works there s some elements of it that give us we want x amount of inventory to be able to provide the ability to react and respond to our customers that order today ship tomorrow kind of system so i think that s the best guide i can give you on working capital is just model that through and whether that s cash flow it s not going to be when you re jumping up as much as we did in q2 versus q1 it s going to obviously require some incremental working capital and then the other question i m sorry i m trying to do my best michael impersonation here so i m trying to think prior to that julian mitchell barclays analyst then it was just around capital spending and sort of e scott santi chairman chief executive officer capital spend yes so capex i think the plan for the year was up like 300 million or so karen fletcher vice president investor relations 300 million is our target e scott santi chairman chief executive officer yes for the year yes not up so there s no incremental capex we did defer some incremental capacity investments last year because of the pandemic we didn t need them those are certainly all coming back on but those are we operate with another element of 80 20 as we want to be front end loaded on capacity because that s how we serve our customers so as business continues to go forward we ll continue to invest in staying at sort of an increment meaningful increment ahead of current demand but that wouldn t be again something out of the norm of what we always do and it wouldn t be something sort of a lot coming through julian mitchell barclays analyst that s clear and then just a quick follow up on the auto oem margins is the point that after that step down sequentially in q2 the sort of 19 percentage level is a good baseline or floor in the current sort of demand and cost environment and so from here they move up sort of slowly given what s going on that 19 is where they should have bottomed out for now christopher a o herlihy vice chairman yes i d say it s a fair assumption we re seeing a bottom low here and i think it will be slower recovery based on what we see today a slow recovery from here on out e scott santi chairman chief executive officer remember it s prior margins in auto chris was probably 23 maybe and so there s still a lot of volume recovery to go in auto from where we were then and so i d say low to mid 20s is certainly achievable over time julian mitchell barclays analyst thank you very much e scott santi chairman chief executive officer sure operator and your final question comes from the line of joel tiss with bmo joel tiss bmo analyst scott you shouldn t be so hard on yourself i think you guys sound a little less annoyed by how dumb all our questions are than usual e scott santi chairman chief executive officer well now you know who the gloomy gus of the group is right joel tiss bmo analyst so i have like one topic and just two different angles on it one can you give us any sense if you think the food industry is kind of distracted with all the consolidation that s going on and then can we have a little more color on kind of what customers are back are large pieces of your end markets still not really there i m thinking like airports and cafeterias and things like that can you just give us a little more detail around sort of the share gains and where the customers are christopher a o herlihy vice chairman yes so i don t know about this distraction from consolidation i can tell you we re not distracted we re basically focused on trying to win the recovery here serve the needs of our customers even new products and so on so generally i think we re seeing some real nice recovery in food faster than actually than we thought at the beginning of the year we re certainly seeing the benefit of staying invested in food a little bit of price cost impact in food certainly but then obviously that s some of that relates to the fact that the price cost environment some additional pricing actions here in the second half but in terms of the end markets i mean basically with food we re back to about by the end of this year we expected back over 90 of the 2019 number so faster than we thought and in terms of end markets we re seeing nice pickup in institutional restaurants going back we mentioned restaurants being up 60 in terms of stuff that s coming back

business and are familiar with his deep knowledge of our business and the and his team have delivered in the americas division over the past seven years scott has outstanding previous experience and a proven track record in leading the americas segment s technology and data driven transformation strategy resulting in strong growth prior to the onset of covid furthermore during the pandemic scott

forward to continuing to collaborate with him as we focus on maximizing the performance of the company in this next chapter in our history justin cochrane the current ceo of our europe segment will continue in his role and will join these calls in the future to share the results from the europe segment i would also like to take this time to thank the incredible clear channel team for their dedication and hard work in managing through the most difficult business environment have ever experienced their ability to adapt to the quickly changing marketplace has ensured that we are in the best possible position to accelerate our recovery by capitalizing on the increasing demand for our medium as consumers return to the streets moving back now to the review of our business we delivered better than anticipated consolidated revenue of 531 million in the second quarter up 63 compared to the prior year excluding fx and china americas revenue was 272 million up 36 at the high end of our guidance and europe revenue was 247 million or 224 million excluding fx up 109 which exceeded our guidance encouragingly we saw a steady improvement in our top line performance each month as the second quarter progressed we achieved about 70 of 2019 revenue in april 80 in may and 90 in june for our americas and europe segments combined excluding fx moreover we are continuing to see positive momentum building our business in the current quarter as the recovery takes shape across our footprint all of our business segments are growing well ahead of last year with some markets now beginning to either match or exceed 2019 levels as a result of the continued strong rebound we re seeing in our business we re now increasing the revenue guidance for the second half of the year that we previously provided in our q1 earnings call from nearly 90 to about 95 of 2019 revenue excluding fx in china the recovery is across the board led primarily by our digital roadside business in short business is back and we are very excited about the trends we re seeing and our ability to capitalize on the recovery underway during the covid crisis we continued to strategically invest in our business while aggressively addressing our cost structure we believe we are emerging from the covid crisis with a stronger and more dynamic platform better positioned to deliver a broader and more valuable mix of actionable insights to advertisers combined with even greater flexibility in delivering highly targeted campaigns at the right time and in the right place these investments have energized our organization and have given our sales teams even stronger resources to present to new and returning advertisers now let me provide a brief update on each of our business segments beginning with the americas americas based on the information we have for the third quarter we expect americas revenue to be between 350 million and 325 million with our segment adjusted ebitda margin expected to return close to 2019 levels this would put our third quarter revenue performance for the americas within a few percentage points of our top line performance in the third quarter of 2019 in the third quarter we are experiencing notable uptick in demand as momentum builds and advertisers recognize the breadth of the recovery underway and the need to rebuild their campaigns refresh their brands and connect with consumers the majority of our markets are showing considerable improvement driven in large part by our digital business we re now seeing a strong rebound in airports and in big cities such as l a and new york as well as in key verticals that had previously been negatively impacted by the pandemic including theatrical retail and financial services we re continuing to see some name brand advertisers return to the out of home market after having been gone for years this renewed interest is due in part to their recognition of the advancements we ve made in our technology including our radar suite of solutions with regard to our technology investments we deployed 26 new digital billboards in the second quarter giving us a total of more than 1 500 digital billboards across the united states we also continued to strengthen our radar platform and programmatic solutions through the completion of multiple integrations with our strong base of partners these partnerships further elevate our data analytics capabilities and our ability to measure the impact of our assets on consumer reach and decision making for example earlier this month in a first for our industry we entered into a partnership with foursquare to provide brands with daily campaign performance metrics across our digital displays using this new solution powered by foursquare s attribution product our customers can evaluate an ad s performance by geography time of day demographic and historical visitations they can then use this data to understand consumers exposure to our displays and subsequent visits to retail locations and other points of interest this is the kind of offering that is attracting new advertisers to out of home we are not static billboards we are a dynamic addressable ecosystem europe turning to our business in europe based on the information we have today we expect third quarter segment revenue to be between 245 million and 255 million representing about 95 of europe s top line performance in the third quarter of 2019 excluding fx we are very encouraged with the trends we re seeing in q2 all our significant markets showed strong improvements versus trading seen earlier in the year and advertiser sentiment remained positive reflecting pent up demand and the return of large sporting events supporting our optimism regarding the future of our business adding to our momentum we are now actively in pursuit of contract tenders which have begun to open up again in belgium we were awarded a 10 year outdoor advertising contract covering belgium s train stations with digital screens in more than 46 cities currently we ultimately plan to grow our digital presence to 800 screens located in more than 100 stations across the country in france we were recently awarded the street furniture contract for aix en provence in barcelona we renewed the outdoor advertising contract covering the bus stops across the city overall we now operate 5 000 advertising places in the barcelona metropolitan area and expect to surpass 150 digital street furniture units by the year end supporting our ability to take full advantage of the recovery our digital footprint continues to expand in europe we added 68 digital displays in the second quarter for a total of over 16 600 screens now live building on the strength of our platform our radar rollout has been well received in the u k and spain and has now been introduced for audience proximity planning in all of our major european markets the introduction of our programmatic offering in europe clear channel launchpad has also gone according to plan following recent launches in the u k switzerland spain finland and the netherlands we launched in belgium in june and we are completing the launch in italy so in summary revenue momentum is clearly building across our business as the recovery gains steam and our markets continue to open up advertisers are gaining confidence as vaccination rates increase remaining restrictions are eased and mobility builds we are now seeing previously hard hit categories begin to light up again which is broadening our revenue base and strengthening our outlook we are well positioned to maximize the performance of our portfolio given the investments we have made in our digital data analytics and programmatic resources as well as our efforts to stay in front of advertisers throughout the pandemic we are now seeing a very healthy rebound in our business and with that let me turn it over to brian to discuss our second quarter 2021 financial results brian d coleman executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer thank you william good morning everyone thank you for joining our call as william mentioned we saw a substantial rebound in our business in the second quarter with june revenue for americas and europe combined about 90 of 2019 revenue excluding fx in china and we are optimistic about our growth through the balance of the year however we continue to manage our cost base including negotiating rent abatements in some of the markets most affected by covid 19 as well as strengthening our capital structure moving on to the results on slide 4 in the second quarter consolidated revenue increased 68 6 to 531 million adjusting for fx in china revenue was up 63 4 consolidated net loss in the second quarter was 124 million compared to a consolidated net loss of 143 million in q2 of 2020 consolidated adjusted ebitda was 97 million in q2 of 2021 a substantial improvement over q2 2020 which was negative 63 million adjusting for fx consolidated adjusted ebitda was 99 million in q2 of 2021 please turn to slide five for a review of americas second quarter results the americas segment revenue was 272 million in the second quarter of 2021 up 36 compared to the prior year and at the high end of the guidance we provided in may digital revenue rebounded strongly and was up 73 8 to 85 million local continues to rebound faster than national and was up 39 7 with national up 30 2 direct operating and sg a expenses were down 5 7 the decline is due in part to a 14 2 decline in site lease expense as a result of negotiated rent abatements additionally credit loss expense was reduced due to improved collections and outlook these were partially offset by higher compensation costs driven by improvements in operating performance segment adjusted ebitda was 127 million up 170 6 compared to the second quarter of last year with segment adjusted ebitda margin well above average due in large part to nonrecurring items including the negotiated rent abatements please turn to slide 6 this slide breaks out our billboard and transit revenue billboard and other was up 42 6 while transit was down 4 2 with airport display revenue down 4 7 to 25 million turning to slide seven for a bit more detail on billboard and others q2 revenue performance digital revenue from billboards street furniture and spectaculars rebounded strongly in q2 and was up 97 6 to 75 million with non digital up 27 1 next please turn to slide eight and a review of our performance in europe please note that as i comment on the percentage change from the prior year all percentages are adjusted for foreign exchange europe revenue was 247 million adjusting for foreign exchange revenue was 224 million up 108 8 compared to the second quarter of the prior year ahead of guidance we provided in our q1 earnings call revenue was up across all countries most notably in france and the u k and digital revenue was up 159 6 a strong performance driven in large part by the rebound in the u k direct operating and sg a expenses were up 33 2 compared to the second quarter of last year the largest driver of the increase in direct operating expense was higher site lease expense which increased 28 9 to 100 million after adjusting for fx due to lower negotiated rent abatements higher revenue and new contracts sg a expenses increased due to higher compensation expense as we ceased the temporary operating cost savings initiatives implemented in the prior year combined with lower government support and wage subsidies and higher commissions in the current year additionally direct operating expense and sg a expense increased due to 16 million of severance and related costs for the restructuring plan these expenses are not included in segment adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda was 2 million after adjusting for foreign exchange this is compared to negative 69 million in q2 of 2020 moving on to ccibv our europe segment consists of the businesses operated by ccibv and its consolidated subsidiary accordingly the revenue for our europe segment is the same as the revenue for ccibv europe segment adjusted ebitda the segment profitability metric reported in our financial statements does not include an allocation of ccibv s corporate expenses that are deducted from ccibv s operating income and adjusted ebitda ccibv revenue increased 140 million during the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 to 247 million after adjusting for a 23 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates ccibv revenue increased 117 million ccibv s operating loss was 40 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 99 million in the same period of 2020 let s move to slide nine and a quick review of other which includes latin america as a reminder the prior year results include clear media which was divested on april 28 2020 latin america revenue was 12 million in the second quarter up 9 million compared to the same period last year direct operating expense and sg a from our latin american business were 13 million up 4 million compared to the second quarter in the prior year latin america ebitda was negative 1 million now moving to slide 10 and a review of capital expenditures capex totaled 32 million in the second quarter an increase of approximately 8 million compared to the prior year as we ramped up our investment in our americas business onto slide 11 clear channel outdoors consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled 564 million as of june 30 2021 our debt was 5 7 billion up 169 million due in large part to the refinancing of the ccwh senior notes in february and june cash paid for interest on the debt was 67 million during the second quarter and 212 million year to date our weighted average cost of debt was 5 6 as of june 30 2021 moving on to slide 12 as mentioned we continue to focus on managing our cost base and strengthening our capital structure this includes achieving 35 million in rent abatements in the second quarter on a consolidated basis as a result of successful six site lease negotiations the majority of the rent abatements in the quarter were in our americas segment also we received european governmental support and wage subsidies in the spot of 2 million in the second quarter in june we successfully completed an offering of 1 05 billion of 7 5 ccoh senior notes through 2029 we used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem the remaining outstanding 9 25 ccwh senior notes through 2024 additionally as we previously announced in may we entered into a second amendment to the senior secured credit agreement extending the suspension of the springing financial covenant through december 31 2021 and further delaying the step down until september 30 2022 lastly in june one of our non guarantor european subsidiaries entered into a state guaranteed bond for approximately 36 million at current exchange rates which is guaranteed by the government of that country in response to covid 19 and finishing with our guidance as william mentioned for the third quarter of 2021 americas segment revenue is expected to be in the range of between 315 million and 325 million the adjusted ebitda margin expected to return to close to q3 2019 levels our europe segment revenue is expected to be in the range of between 245 million and 255 million adjusting for fx given our improved outlook we are revising our second half revenue guidance from nearly 90 of 2019 levels to about 95 excluding fx in china the recovery is across the board led primarily by our digital roadside businesses additionally we expect cash interest payments of 175 million in the last six months of 2021 and 324 million in 2022 we expect consolidated capital expenditures to be in the 165 million to 175 million range in 2021 this increase reflects our optimism regarding our prospects and our ability to capture new prospects to drive growth lastly we are increasing our guidance for our liquidity balance as of december 31 2021 including unrestricted cash and availability under the company s revolving credit facilities we expect the balance to be approximately 475 million to 525 million a 50 million increase from the guidance provided in may please keep in mind that liquidity could vary based on timing of cash receipts and or payments at year end that concludes my remarks and now let me turn the call back over to will william eccleshare chief executive officer president director thanks brian the recovery is now well underway across our markets and we are continuing to see solid revenue momentum in the second half of the year with several of our markets ahead of 2019 we remain focused on strategically investing in our technology including expanding our digital platform further strengthening our data analytics capabilities and building our programmatic resources with the aim of broadening our presence among a greater number of advertisers and increasing our market share our business is soundly rebounding our organization is energized and we are very excited about the growth trends that are building across our markets as we invest in our platform we will also continue to carefully manage our costs supporting our efforts to drive profitable growth over the long term as well as maintaining our financial flexibility and objective to de lever the balance sheet as i mentioned earlier i m very excited about the future of the company and look forward to speaking with many of you over the next few months as we prepare for the leadership transition with scott taking over as ceo at the end of the year and now let me turn over the call to the operator for the q a session questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of steven cahall with wells fargo steven cahall wells fargo analyst yes thanks so maybe first for scott it looks like the americas q3 guide is pretty close to 2019 as you mentioned it sounds like airport is better but probably still down and i m wondering if street furniture probably is too in places like so just wondering how you think about the recovery in sort of the bits of weakness and if we do see those get back to prior levels how do you think about the ebitda power in the americas business as that s done and should we expect any lumpiness to expenses due to rent abatements in the back half of the year and then william in europe maybe you could discuss a little bit of what sort of margins do you start to expect as you get to full run rate revenues i think of that as sort of a mid teens margin business so just wondering given all the cost work that you ve done how you think about it and then lastly scott just maybe what s next in terms of financial management maybe you could discuss a little bit the covenant springing suspension and what you expect for free cash flow in the back half of the year and liquidity thank you scott wells executive vice president chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas steve thanks for the questions i think brian will take that covenant one though so we ll let him get to that one on your question i do think q3 is looking like it s going to be pretty close to its counterpart in 2019 the things you named airports and street furniture are the things that will probably lag we still do have the dynamic that some cities are recovering slower than other cities in the mix new york is actually recovering quite nicely we don t have much in the way of street furniture there but the times square area is recovering nicely and the airports are recovering nicely along with the roadside that s done well in terms of the margins i think there s going to be some lumpiness in our margins for a bit i mean you witnessed it to the positive this quarter we ve kind of been consistent in talking about these negotiations are often for relatively big chunks of money and they are hard to predict and we re never 100 sure how they re going to come in i think a couple of things will happen over the next three or four quarters one is we are still working on some relief on contracts looking back even over last year i think the other thing to happen is you ll see some of the relief that we ve gotten come out and so it will take a bit of time for us to get to what we d call steady state margins but i don t think it s going to be wildly dramatic either hopefully that answers your question on the u s margin recovery william eccleshare chief executive officer president director yes i ll take the european question i m not going to give you any kind of guidance on what may or may not happen to margin over the coming months and years steven and i don t think you d expect me to we will continue to be very vigilant on costs across the european business i think we ve done some excellent work that we ve talked about on previous calls in terms of the cost reduction program and the restructuring and that will continue to have impact in the coming years but obviously we can t predict is the impact of some of the changes in inventory that we may see in the months and years ahead so i think i ll just leave it at that on margin unless brian wants to add anything before he takes on the covenant question as well brian d coleman executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer the only thing i would add is as the recovery continues and incremental revenue is added that s obviously going to be beneficial and i think we re seeing that in europe so hopefully that s helpful steve i think we feel pretty good about the direction we re headed on the covenant question i think the two key things to think about are one the relief that we got with respect to the springing covenant itself goes through the end of the year and so we ll report our first covenant calculation at our march 31 compliance date and the second piece of the was a pushback of the step down in the springing covenant measurement and that push down was out to september of 2022 so i think those are the two things to think about in exchange for that we do have to maintain 150 million minimum liquidity but i think you can see from our liquidity guidance we feel very comfortable about that the trajectory of the business we ve actually upped our liquidity guidance to 475 million to 525 million by the end of the year so i think we feel pretty good with where we are with respect to the covenant relief and i would add it s a springing covenant so we could always pay off the drawn amounts under the facility and we are looking like we have the liquidity to do that should we choose that path as well operator your next question comes from the lance vitanza with cowen lance vitanza cowen and company analyst hi thanks guys for taking the question and great job on the quarter william thanks for your leadership obviously been a difficult time my question for you is it sounds like your new role i think you mentioned it would include the evaluation of strategic considerations i e m a so i m wondering can you give us an update on what the m a environment looks like today with the covid recovery so well developed i d imagine it s possible to buy and sell assets again am i right about that i mean away from clear channel are you seeing deals get done and then if you could comment perhaps on whether you ve ruled out any types of transactions or perhaps you could help us focus on what types of transactions we would be most likely to see buy or sell region versus region size core versus noncore that kind of thing william eccleshare chief executive officer president director right how much detail do you really want me to give you let me say first away from clear channel as you say i think the m a environment is certainly getting more active people are undoubtedly seeing markets return valuation gaps are narrowing and there s a lot more going on right now than there was this time last year for very obvious reasons so yes it s more active and yes my new role certainly will involve me in looking at strategic opportunities for the business across our footprint i don t really think you would expect me to give any kind of indication of where we might be looking to transact or what kinds of transactions we might look at we re very conscious that in february of last year we said on our earnings call then that we would look to focus the business more on the higher margin assets and that remains our strategy so that can lead you to some fairly obvious conclusions i would think about the geographies that we would be looking at but as to timing i don t think we would want to say anything more at the moment other than that things are certainly getting more active and we will continue to evaluate all opportunities as they appear and as we would consider that they would deliver shareholder value i think i should just leave it at that lance vitanza cowen and company analyst that s great and my another question is just and not to be the pepper in the punchbowl here but what about the delta variant i mean it doesn t sound like you re worried about it but why doesn t that risk derailing the recovery in your view william eccleshare chief executive officer president director yes i mean i think i m what i would say appropriately worried about it any variant of this virus is concerning to us and we ve all seen too much over the last 15 16 months to be in any way complacent what i would say is what i ve observed and we ve had more experience of it in europe than in the u s so far what i ve observed and what i think is confirmed by all of the analysis although the delta variant is highly infectious it does appear that the vaccines do offer some significant resistance and are resulting in significantly lower hospitalizations as a result of as a result of that i think it is highly probable that governments will continue to resist imposing any further restrictions and as you ll know in the u k which has been the most affected by the delta variants so far in the u k our government has taken a very conscious decision to unlock the economy and remove restrictions at the very time that infections from the delta variant were increasing and they ve done that because they feel confident around the hospitalization rate so look i m not an epidemiologist i m not an expert on the topic but i would say based on what we know today our views about the second half of the year stand as stated and reflect a confidence in the recovery if something changes in the way in which the vaccines protect against the delta variant then all bets are off but that s how i see it at the moment lance vitanza cowen and company analyst thank you so much guys operator your next question comes from the line of jim goss with barrington research jim goss barrington research associates analyst thank you i have a couple of question also first going back to the margin question would you say the domestic margins should have a sustainable target level north of 40 as recover in all areas and you ve got the benefit of digital and you also have potentially some cost and expenses that may have been cut during the pandemic that you might be able to keep under control in the future that would be the first question scott wells executive vice president chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas brian do you want me to speak to that or do you want to take that one william eccleshare chief executive officer president director i think brian is going to take it brian d coleman executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer yes i m sorry scott i ll take it and then obviously you can have some color and add in if you d like look 40 sounds like pre covid level margins in the u s and i think that that s certainly something we ll strive for we do have some tailwinds from cost saving initiatives that we ve put in place and other things but we also headwinds from such things as portfolio mix so i think the first thing that has to happen is we have to get back to the revenue level but even once we get back to the revenue level we ll really need to work on keeping the cost savings in place to get back to that 40 level because we do have to make up for some portfolio mix changes and that s just the nature of the business that even if revenues go back to 2019 it doesn t mean your business make up is the same and so those are kind of the pushes and pulls we likely will need to continue to work at it to get back to the 40 level but we won t be far off as we continue to recover from covid scott do you have any additional color you d like to add scott wells executive vice president chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas i mean i think the only other thing i d call out is that seasonality does matter in this business and so it may not be 40 every quarter as we think about that as things play out but i think your answer is right on jim goss barrington research associates analyst okay thanks though and one other thing maybe i ll touch on the increase for digital was significantly greater than the increase for billboards and more than would be accounted for by platform changes and i m wondering if there are certain advertisers who are considering both formats in various areas and what are the factors behind your decision making and as to what which appropriate for them and is this starting to create a little better pricing power on the digital side as you re seeing that utilization improve scott wells executive vice president chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas so i ll take a run at this from the u s and then william if you want to add anything internationally we can touch on that as well so i guess first and foremost as you look at the recovery you got to remember how things fell too because our printed assets did not fall nearly as far as digital did and so part of why you re seeing the big growth in digital now is because it s comping against significantly worse numbers if you go back and look at our q2 of last year digital was hit much harder than printed in terms of your question about advertisers making decisions i think there s a variety of things going on and foremost digital has an immediacy to it and so with advertisers reacting to things rolling out across the country digital has given them a very convenient way to activate in markets as markets get more secure more stable and people get out on the streets more and things like that i think we re developing different use cases for digital whether it s in the programmatic use case or roadblocks or something that we re doing more and more of there are just different use cases for it that advertisers use whether it s for a film release or for a new product launch or trying to sustain momentum in a place like a cpg type product where they re looking to heavy up digital gives them the ability to do it so i do think digital it has been a premium product since we developed it it remains a premium product it s on some of our best locations that we ve converted to digital and so i do think it s something that we receive very attractive economics for and in this business whenever you have demand strong you see that dynamic william i don t know if you d add anything incremental to that as well william eccleshare chief executive officer president director no i think you ve nailed it scott thank you jim goss barrington research associates analyst and lastly are there any broad categories showing greater resilience you ve mentioned a couple of the consumer technology media are there some that are really driving the recovery right now for you scott wells executive vice president chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas again sort of from a u s perspective we went out and got a number of new categories active during covid and what we re seeing now as things build back is some of the industries that were hit really hard during covid are coming back so theatrical is probably the most obvious in terms of film releases we ve had a number of good strong film releases this year and a really good pipeline of film releases coming so they ve come back amusements have come back you ve seen travel and leisure come back those are all categories that were hit really hard and that s building on top of some things like in home improvement real estate categories that we actually were able to develop pretty successfully during covid so it s a good time in the business right now have traditional advertisers coming back building on top of some new categories that we ve done a lot to develop during covid jim goss barrington research associates analyst okay thanks and congratulations scott that s it operator thank you there are no additional questions at this time i would like to turn it back over to mr eccleshare for closing remarks william

maher chairman and chief executive officer thank you jill and good morning to all who ve been able to join our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call today this morning i am joined by our president joe lebel and chief financial officer mike fitzpatrick as always we appreciate your interest in our performance and are pleased to be able to discuss our operating results with you this morning we will cover our financial and operating performance for the quarter and provide some color regarding the outlook for our business please note that our earnings release was accompanied by a set of supplemental slides that are available on the company s website we may refer to those slides during this call after our discussion we look forward to taking your questions in terms of financial results for the second quarter gaap diluted earnings per share were 0 49 another strong quarter for the company earnings reflect a continuing economic recovery with the bank demonstrating improved credit trends a modest pickup in net interest income and a committed loan pipeline that indicates our commercial banking expansion is gaining traction core earnings approximated gaap earnings this quarter regarding capital management the board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0 17 per common share and approximately 0 44 per depository share of preferred stock the common share dividend is the company s 98th consecutive quarterly cash dividend the 0 17 common share dividend represents just 35 of earnings the common share dividend remains at a conservative payout ratio that will be evaluated later in the year as the post pandemic earnings trajectory is more established over the past three quarters robust earnings have driven a 1 increase in tangible book value per share tangible stockholder s equity to tangible assets remain strong and now exceeds 9 our balance sheet remains inflated as we carried 1 1 billion or almost 10 of the entire balance sheet at cash as cash at quarter end the excess cash is a direct result of positive trends in our business it should provide an incredible opportunity to build earnings over time average deposit costs for the quarter decreased by 10 basis points to 27 basis points and ended the quarter at just 24 basis points in all time low point much of the decrease in deposit costs is linked to a rotation from high cost cds to non interest bearing accounts on a year to date basis cds have decreased by 416 million and were largely replaced with non interest bearing accounts that have increased by 372 million the company continued share purchase activities during the second quarter purchasing 500 000 shares at a weighted average price of 21 and 0 93 during the quarter the board authorized an additional 3 million shares to be added to the repurchase program leaving a quarter end capacity of slightly more than 4 million shares available for repurchase or a 6 7 of the current outstanding share base before we discuss the outlook for our business i ll spend a minute reviewing market conditions in some of our operating areas during the second quarter local economic conditions continue to strengthen most notably in new york city where manhattan has begun to show signs of activity clients throughout our geographies report strong demand for products and services with labor and supply chain issues continuing to restrain output overall our client base is an excellent financial position as indicated by record low levels of delinquencies and positive trends in all other credit metrics the new jersey shore continues to be our strongest market as the shore season looks to be one of the best on record looking internally our employees have also been exceptionally resilient having completed a core systems conversion earlier this month that upgraded our back office infrastructure for the first time in decades that project has set the stage for additional advancements in business process automation and employee efficiency more importantly the conversion finished well ahead of schedule and without client disruption in addition to the long term benefits that we will achieve from modern core systems this transition will allow us to remove the final redundant systems in the bank the country bank core application said this september an important efficiency project our forward focus remains on deploying liquidity building on our digital capabilities and improving operating efficiency to provide a more complete context for our efforts in these areas we will be holding an investor day event next week the event will be available in person at our red bank new jersey administrative offices and also available online so we hope many of you can join us we will be walking through our progress since the last investor day in 2018 discussing the post covid landscape and detailing our plans to increase loan growth capitalize on the shift to digital and improve the efficiency of our retail distribution network at this point i ll turn the call over to joe for a discussion regarding progress this past quarter including an update on our expansion of the commercial bank joseph j lebel president chief operating officer thanks chris loan originations of 447 million were lower than our q1 activity which set an all time record for the company positive momentum is evident with the pipeline at all time highs lead by the commercial bank and continued strong activity in our residential mortgage business more impressively our new baltimore commercial team hit the ground running with 40 million in loan originations in q2 all regions have active calling efforts and pipeline activity through quarter end we have added 16 new commercial lenders in the last nine months including seven in 2021 we ve also weighted regional credit team members in the baltimore market to supplement our lenders as well as a new regional president and senior credit officer and our boston lpo and are actively hunting for more talent in both geographies efforts continue to add seasoned successful lenders in our existing footprint as well we are excited about second half loan growth as we have discussed in prior calls despite the ultra competitive pricing and credit environment in the residential business originations have been solid with activity only limited by the scarcity of available housing for sale while i don t expect record originations as we had in 2020 due to the shortage of available properties for sale this continues to be a sound product and provides diversification and a stable low risk component of our loan portfolio we don t expect to grow this book substantially but continue to book quality loans to add to the portfolio and offset amortization after growth of 116 million in q1 the loan portfolio contracted 52 million for the quarter including 27 million in pay offs from ppp loans the commercial book has grown 250 million year to date while the consumer book has declined largely from normal amortization coupled with 97 million in residential loan sales as we forecasted in q1 adding the new geographies will begin to pay dividends via increasing loan portfolio growth in q3 and q4 our existing markets continue to build pipelines as the pandemic recedes turning to the margin core nim was essentially flat contracting two basis points largely due to the impact of the low rate environment putting cash to work is difficult in this environment but the record pipeline and loan demand in new markets should accelerate and help both margins and net interest income in the second half of the year we continue to focus on changing the mix of deposits as chris noted earlier and on reducing the cost which was 24 basis points at quarter end we will continue to drift lower as another 392 million in cds mature in quarters three and four we exited 154 million in cds in quarter two while adding 87 million in non interest bearing deposits core deposits now stand at 90 of total deposits operating expenses increased 907 000 exclusive of merger related and branch consolidation expenses due primarily to higher compensation related to new hires and benefit costs we expect some increase in opex in q3 and q4 as the new hires and related overhead get fully added into the run rate before reducing in q1 2022 as chris noted we closed four branches in early q2 and continue to analyze the effects of the pandemic on our customers behaviors in our branches online via mobile and our customer care center we expect to provide more details on our plans for delivery of banking services in all of these channels on our investor day scheduled for august 5th with that i ll turn it back to chris christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer thanks joe at this point we ll move to the q a portion of the call questions and answers operator and our first question will come from frank schiraldi of piper sandler please go ahead frank schiraldi piper sandler analyst good morning i wanted to ask about the ultra competitive atmosphere out there as i think you referred to joe is that the biggest risk to loan growth in the back half of the year and i would imagine the competition is just getting fiercer given it seems like everybody is talking about a pickup in loan growth in the back half of the year thanks christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer that s right i think you are right i think that liquidity in the market drives certain folk s activity i do think that i can t speak for others i do think for us the addition of the new folks as well as the expanded geographies will help us but as chris mentioned earlier the core markets have done remarkably well we ve seen some resilience in new york continued growth in philadelphia i will tell you and i ll give you an example of what you would consider to be competition but probably what i would refer to is something that s not typically competition and that s of freddie and fannie right so fannie mae is very aggressive in the marketplace with banks on long term finance of permit multifamily loans and it s not uncommon to see them aggressively in the mid twos today for 10 year money which is just a fascinating environment to be in i don t know how long that occurs but they ve extended amortizations have been very aggressive and the market is very good so we ve also seen some clients opt to monetize instead of refinancing or do other things but that s all right i m still very bullish on our prospects frank schiraldi piper sandler analyst okay and then just second one from me is on capital deployment you got a pretty big authorization out there now so you got to think you look at repurchases that back but i just wonder if you can maybe talk about that the priority for buybacks versus potential deployment through m a and just kind of remind us of what you are looking for on the dl side and if you ve looked at any of the deals that have recently been inked out there in jersey joseph j lebel president chief operating officer so there is a couple of things on that frank i mean i think you make a good point about capital management and m a in the share buyback we want to have optionality here so having the authorization with the buyback allows us to repurchase shares more quickly we have in the past two quarters and we certainly have the capital and the earnings capacity to do that and at today s price we re very comfortable the dilution and earn back levels are quite modest so we have a strong appetite for our own shares and that s probably the best m a you can ever do looking beyond that though the market has been active and we can t comment on individual deals but i will tell you that there are some very high quality institutions that are looking for partners because it s the smart thing to do now and we want to make sure before we commit our capital in repurchases and push that too far that we re exploring all opportunities around m a on the m a side we have not been shy in the past but the things we look for in m a are a little different than what we would have looked for in the past so if i go back to the first few deals we did it was really about funding our balance sheet and we were looking for organizations that provided super high quality funding at low funding costs obviously with 1 1 billion in cash and the momentum we have in our business the maturity of our treasury products we are less interested in securing funding is a reason to go out and do m a that said we love commercial banks we re building our commercial bank business so if we found an opportunity to further that we wouldn t be shy about it so i think when you think about capital management we want to get through probably the next quarter or two and make sure we understand the m a landscape and if we have not identified something that makes sense then we re going to go ahead and have the opportunity to push down and buy back shares more quickly i d also say that just an aggregate as you saw the deals that were done i thought they were all really well constructed and properly structured deals we have to be very thoughtful about the realities of our currency and our price to book and what we are willing to tolerate in terms of an acquisition and we re going to be very balanced and disciplined about that we re protecting book value i am really pleased it s moved up 1 in the last three quarters we want to be careful about how we use them frank schiraldi piper sandler analyst sure and then just a follow up to that is there any sort of can you just remind us of what you re willing to tolerate on the dilutions last earn back side joseph j lebel president chief operating officer so that hasn t changed so our general outlook is that you start saying ideally you d like to see your earn back within three years and the reason for that is in a three year horizon you can really tell what the economic conditions are and there is less risk looking at over that horizon that said i think the three to five year earn backs in some cases i d say they are kind of rare could be appropriate if there is a very strategic opportunity that also really makes a change to your earnings per share can really provide faster earnings per share and then on the other side if you re not getting enough earnings momentum then even three years could be too much dilution so we look at the dilution on a sliding scale as it relates to how many accretions you re getting back out of the deal so if you re going to stretch beyond three years you better have eps momentum that is worth that stretch otherwise keep it to three years or less so i hope that helps frank schiraldi piper sandler analyst yes thanks for all the color joseph j lebel president chief operating officer thanks frank operator the next question comes from michael perito of kbw please go ahead michael perito kbw analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions i wanted to start on the loan growth side i appreciate all the color i guess kind of a simplistic question but as we think about the expectation for net growth to accelerate in the back half of the year i know you guys are going to probably provide more color next week but just is that an expectation of originations increasing or the closing rate of the pipeline changing or pay offs moderating or maybe a mixture of all three just trying to understand what s beneath that assumption a little bit better as we saw kind of the slower growth quarter over the past 90 days christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer let s say first mike the pay offs have been reasonably stable so we re not seeing them either accelerating or decelerating it s kind of a normal level of amortization so we ve engineered the company for meeting the markets and the producers and all that is to get ourselves to a net growth number certainly in the range of 250 million per quarter hopefully in the third quarter but certainly by the fourth quarter and that s so call it about 1 billion a year in loan growth that pace is what we ve resourced the company to do and it was very important to us that we resource that kind of an effort with new bankers in new markets because we know how competitive the world is going to be and if we had limited ourselves to saying i want to grow a billion a year and we re just going to stick in new jersey i think that would have been a much tougher task looking at even just as joe mentioned the folks in baltimore chipped in last quarter with 40 million and that s a big help so we have to kind of answer your question concisely we re trying to get the repetitive loan growth to be in the range of 250 million a quarter and we might be able to hit that in the third quarter especially given the pipeline as joe mentioned we have a 630 million pipeline at the end of june some of that is lines to credit so you re not going to get full drawdowns during the quarter but still it s our biggest pipeline ever and we ve just pretty bullish michael perito kbw analyst helpful thank you for that and then just two other quick ones from me one just on non interest income any thoughts your term about where that kind of core run rate could trend i mean is there room for kind of some rebounds like swaps and things that maybe mortgage is given where rates are in the third quarter christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer definitely the swaps are really just a function of loan closings so a certain portion of your commercial loans will go swap that yield curve is moved a little bit so it s not quite as attractive as it was a year ago but i do think as you see loan volumes increase you re going to see swaps increase and it was a particularly low quarter for swaps for us so i think that s a big opportunity also very pleased to note i know we put it in the release but i ll just note that we will not be subject to the durban cap for another 12 months so that won t be effective for us until july 1 of 2022 one of the nice line items we had this quarter and i think it s a continuing trend as debit card income came up so i think that s a positive and should probably only build so those are the two hot spots the deposit fees have been flat they were hurt a little bit in the pandemic some of that is overdraft fees and we re not relying on that being an engine of growth it s never been a particularly hot line item for us so i think there is an opportunity and i would also point the performance we had in nasdaq it is still not an aggregate large number but it s starting to produce numbers now that are meaningful to us and we have a very strong growth in nasdaq that s our hybrid robo advisor so up to 130 million in aum and grew about 30 this past quarter so the customer adoption has been great there michael perito kbw analyst and can you just remind me chris real quick do you expected durban impact approximately once it kicks in next year christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer it s a little hard as the debit card fees go up and the mix of fees changes because it doesn t the cap doesn t apply across all transact applies across all transaction types but some transaction revenues are already below the cap so it really does not apply our best guess at this point is that it could be say 6 million or 7 million depends a little bit on how fast the deadline grows between now and next july 1 michael perito kbw analyst and that s pre tax annualized christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer correct michael perito kbw analyst and then just lastly from me joe i think you mentioned that you expect to opex to step up in the back half of the year i have two more questions there i guess one obviously as a lot of bankers is it jump up in kind of the 1 5 million to 2 million range kind of adequate to capture in all that overhead and any other digital investments you re making number one and then number two you mentioned i think that you expect to step down in early 2022 so should we read into that that a lot of the hiring that you guys budget more plan for has taken place and that pipeline is a little less active now than maybe it was six months ago joseph j lebel president chief operating officer just a couple of moving pieces and parts so as you point out the hires we made we ve got to get full quarter expenses on them and there are a couple of more hires we will not be hiring at the pace we have been hiring at so that s kind of tapering off so the expenses will drift up a little bit because of that then we have two catalysts one will show a little bit in the fourth quarter the other beginning in next year the first catalyst is the country bank conversion which i referenced so today that core application set between the people supporting it and the application set itself costs us about 2 million a year so getting that deconverted in the third quarter there ll be some trailing expense in the four quarter but that s a nice tailwind and then the second thing is we re going be talking next week about our overall investment in expense management in both digital and retail network and that s going to provide a tailwind as well and we ll be able to walk you through how that happened so in terms of i know you guys all have models and you re trying to think about this quarter next quarter we could peak as high as 54 million by the fourth quarter before beginning to trend down in absolute numbers in the first quarter so that s kind of the order magnitude and may not be quite that high but that s probably the outer range for q4 michael perito kbw analyst that s very helpful thank you guys for taking my questions i appreciate it christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer thanks mike operator the next question comes from erik zwick of boenning and scattergood please go ahead erik zwick boenning and scattergood analyst good morning everyone christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer good morning erik erik zwick boenning and scattergood analyst just two questions for me today the first one impressive to see the build in the commercial pipeline and just looking at the yield as well it looks like the commercial pipeline yield has stayed pretty constant over the past three quarters that of three and three quarters percent level looking at the origination yields in that portfolio for the past two quarters it s come in lower than the pipeline nad yield i m just curious is that a reflection of the competition that you re seeing that what you re actually able to close is a little bit lower or is there something else at play there joseph j lebel president chief operating officer i think it s a combination of factors erik one is absolutely competition there are negotiations that go on even after you approved transactions given the environment that we re in and i think the other thing is that we ve done we have seen the yield curve go down a bit so that plays into it by the time loans or closed versus when they ve been approved and then it s the mix so as chris mentioned earlier depending on what your closing and what s being funded so we tend to do a variety of construction projects those don t always fund at the same time those tend to be higher yielding projects of the end loans or lower yielding and the construction loans aren t fully funded that can impact the actual dollars and cents a bit but as we remind our lenders and we tell them at this stage anything is better than 10 bps of the fed so we re willing to be we re blowing to be more aggressive for the types of credits that we like and you know our credit appetite so i m happy to be in the negotiating play in the market that we re at erik zwick boenning and scattergood analyst thanks joe i appreciate the color there and then just looking at the balance sheet i noticed that the equity investments were up 41 million in the quarter and i know it s not a primary source of revenue for you guys but you ve been opportunistic from time to time and made a nice trade in some bank investments last year just curious is that increase here in q2 does that reflect some new investments and if so maybe you can provide any color to what those might be michael j fitzpatrick executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah eric it s mike it is pretty straightforward last year we had you recall we were investing in common tock of regional banks and we sold out of those positions beginning of the year now we re investing in preferred stock of financial service companies so that s the all of the 40 million in growth is related to that strategy erik zwick boenning and scattergood analyst got it thanks mike thanks for taking my questions today joseph j lebel president chief operating officer thanks erik operator and our next question will come from dave bishop of seaport research partners please go ahead dave bishop seaport research partners analyst yeah good morning gentlemen thanks for taking my questions christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer morning dave dave bishop seaport research partners analyst hey chris a quick question for you in terms of the capital deployment you mentioned the strong capital positioning but just curious as it relates to maybe targeted return to capital shareholders inclusive of buybacks and dividends any sort of ratio you re targeting there for tce ratio remind us or just sort of maybe managing toward thanks christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer sure probably the best way to answer that is to think about the long term tce ratio so we re right where we d like to be in the mid eights so we think as you start to approach 9 then maybe you re getting a little too much capital and as you start to approach 8 you better start to manage your capital more carefully so and because of our preferred stock the tangible equity ratio is 9 so between tce and the tangible equity ratio 8 5 to 9 that is certainly starting to get to the point where we feel we ve got a bunch of excess capital the other important thing is we do not need any capital for organic growth for the foreseeable future and what i mean by that is we have 1 billion of cash to deploy so as we deploy that 1 billion of cash we don t actually need any more capital to underpin it and all while we re doing that we re going to be producing additional capital right the internal generation of capital would be even higher so i think our capital ratios are understated because of the cash they actually feel to be more higher level than we typically look at so as i mentioned before we want to make sure in a market that is this active with m a if we could deploy that cash effectively that would be a great way to do it but if not we re going to try and get it back to our shareholders so we re going to look both at the common dividend and at buybacks you can see the additional 3 million shares we put on certainly a very direct signal that we feel we could do meaningful repurchases provided we have exhausted the alternatives through acquisition from organic growth dave bishop seaport research partners analyst got it and then maybe a question on credit here obviously with the economic backdrop at least in the current quarter the current informing the allowance for credit losses here just curious as you do expect some positive trends in terms of just net loan growth here just curious maybe at what rate ratios loans you d be reserving out as you do grow the balance sheet thanks christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer i think when you think about the way cecl works and our quantitative loss history we have been operating the bank to be pretty conservative on the credit side for a long period of time so our credit losses run about 70 lower than our peer group over if you look at us over say a decade so we think that our portfolio gives us the opportunity to not have to reserve all that heavily and in fact under cecl it s hard to construct the big reserve on a book like ours interesting fact is at the end of the quarter if you look within our acl more of our acl is qualitative than quantitative it s hard to get that number up so as you think about new growth for a long period of time we ve been running it probably at normalized say a 70 basis point reserve level if i were not saying that s going to be the exact number but if i were to pick a number say how should you be reserving against net loan growth it s probably somewhere in that area certainly sub 1 based on our credit performance dave bishop seaport research partners analyst got it appreciate answering the questions thanks christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer thanks dave operator the next question comes from russell gunther of d a davidson please go ahead russell gunther d a davidson analyst hey good morning guys just a question on the hi question on the margin so if i heard you right it sounds like with the loan growth that is expected the margin should improve so fair to characterize the reported nim this quarter as a trough and then longer term you ve talked about 320 to 340 guide the yield curve is become more inhospitable since you laid that out competition has intensified any shift in how you re thinking about that from a timing or magnitude perspective christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer you re right to point out russell the yield curve plays into that so we saw a little setback in the yield curve since our last quarterly discussion so i think it may take us a little longer to get up to the numbers we were talking about previously that 325 or better i m still highly confident we re going to get well into the threes and even the last time we spoke the difference between 325 and 350 is really what is the yield curve going to give us so we think that this deployment of cash is a four five quarter event by the end of that i guess we re hopeful that we might have little more steepness in the yield curve and so but we would need a little more steepening of the yield curve to get above the 3 25 yqou re absolutely right russell gunther d a davidson analyst okay got it that s very helpful guys that s it for me thank you christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer thanks russell operator the next question comes from christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott please go ahead christopher marinac janney montgomery scott analyst thanks good morning chris and team i wanted to drill down on slide 7 just to talk about technology expenses so should we relate that mix change that you ve kind of articulating to one that the other core expenses will be slow while technology rises and would you look at technology as kind of a sub component of the efficiency ratio or other asset based metrics over time christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer obviously we think it s a very important metric because it s not just what you re spending but how you re spending it and our position this goes back years now is to make sure that we re following where our customers want us to be spending the money so they want to make sure they ve got cutting edge digital apps and things like that so you can see how that both in absolute dollars and as a percent the technology increases expense has increased over years and i think it will continue to increase but at a slower rate so i think it s going to moderate now the core lift was a big deal i mentioned the country bank to about 2 million a year interestingly the vast majority of that is people related not systems so the it number will come down it s probably 30 of that right the rest is going to be people so i think you re going to see a slower growth rate but you will still see growth and it s our customers especially corporate treasury things like that they re demanding more and more every quarter what we have been doing and this will dovetail nicely into our comments next week is we ve deliberately been investing in those digital capabilities and reducing the investment in channels that our customers are using less look at the 58 branches that we ve consolidated today so in terms of we don t have a particular benchmark i would point out and this is a curiosity more than anything that proportionately we re spending on it about the same as jp morgan chase to give you some one benchmark now obviously they ve got a slightly larger balance sheet so little more spending than we do but i do think the point is that you should be a heavy investor in it if you plan to be around for the future russell gunther d a davidson analyst good chris thanks for that additional color i appreciate it then just a quick follow up on the new england boston initiative how large would you like that market to be over time and should we think of it like a baltimore and philadelphia or is it too early to tell christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer i will make a couple of comments but then i want joe to talk to the kind of tailwind we ve been able to find which we are just thrilled about the way we look at the expansion of the commercial bank is it has to be led by talent and you can never be sure exactly what talent you re going to find and in which markets these are all great markets right i mean we can get it an amtrak train and go north or south a couple of hours and touch literally millions of people in some of the best banking markets on the planet so the markets are not the question it s a the question is how can you find the people and the people delivering the relationships you need and you know as we work through the process we didn t know how successful we were going to be baltimore became a priority because frankly the talent we found in the market was exceptional and we could bring it on board and we thought that boston would be a slower process for us but again we had a happy opportunity to bring some talent on but joe maybe talk a little bit about the backgrounds of the folks you hire especially dan and tom joseph j lebel president chief operating officer look dan griggs is the regional president for boston who came on board at the end of q2 really just a few days before the end of june he ran a multi billion dollar business for td up there david heller senior lender up there is a former bmo harris u s bancorp lender very successful in that marketplace michael marcucci is our newly hired senior credit officer from santander very strong all season folks been around a long time as i tend to tell our regional officers as they go into these markets what do they need to do a lot of them ask us what do we need to do i d tell them just look at we re going to be patient we re going to be thoughtful but look at what we ve built in 3 5 years in philadelphia in a few years in new york that s the blueprint hire the right people put people in positions to be successful give them some autonomy and support them appropriately and you can grow i think we talked about it in the last quarter philadelphia is now 1 billion in loans outstanding and just under four years so and new york is about 1 5 so there is the opportunity that lies in front of these folks it is the reason we pick these markets we have markets that are dense and vibrant and you just have to fill them up with the right talent and again it s only a few folks in boston we re actively looking for more there christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer so i guess chris to answer your question directly if we don t think we can get to a billion dollars we re not going to be getting into a market may take us a couple of years to do that and each of the markets we re going into could eventually over years be a multi billion dollar market so we re not going to go into a market unless we think it has that potential and you know our investments are not going to be sizable unless we feel we ve got the talent and we had some extraordinary hires so we re really pleased russell gunther d a davidson analyst great thank you joe thank you chris i appreciate it christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer thanks chris operator and the next question will come from matthew breese of stephens inc please go ahead matthew breese stephens inc analyst good morning i wanted to go back to the pipeline i was hoping you could comment on which geographies you re seeing the greatest strength in you re contributing to that pipeline and then maybe you could comment a little bit on the robustness of the pipeline versus the team that you now have on the field is this the type of origination horsepower that we should get used to or is this an exceptional level for the team you have christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer i actually think the pipeline is low compared to what i expect going into really probably by q4 q1 we met new lenders matt it takes some period of time to acclimate not only to your own culture but also to acclimate their prior clients and prospects to new opportunities at a new bank so i do think the pipeline is going to grow i can t speak in totally about the resi book because a resi is driven by the rate environment and the activities but resi has been fairly consistent the last few years in the commercial pipe i do expect it to grow at the end of the quarter the vast majority of the pipe was from our existing markets central and southern new jersey philadelphia and new york not a lot yet in boston or baltimore other than you saw the 40 million that baltimore guys put on our baltimore lenders came on at the end of may that s you expect them to take another quarter or two to really ramp so i m really bullish on our opportunities in the new markets with the folks that we ve hired matthew breese stephens inc analyst as you ve gone through the historical pipeline could you just give us some idea of what the success rate is the pull through rate on pipelines joseph j lebel president chief operating officer typically for us the residential pipeline pull through rate is substantial it s well over 90 probably pushing 95 the commercial pipeline is probably in the low to mid 80s once it gets to the point we re conservative in the way we report pipeline in commercial the commercial pipe is only reported as approved so the pipeline you see is only the approved pipeline it does not include any of our work in progress stuff and credit underwriting and we do that on purpose christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer those are real commitments matt they re not a work in progress so the pull through rate on both sides is pretty strong the one thing that does happen from time to time and want to be careful in the 630 million we have about 150 million of commercial lines joseph j lebel president chief operating officer construction projects christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer so the draw downs on that will be a little bit lower but that s still a very healthy pipeline and as joe pointed out we do expect the pace of lending to pick up even beyond that matthew breese stephens inc analyst okay another changing factor here beyond just the yield curve is just the competitive landscape a lot of your former competitors and peers are either involved in deals or being sold themselves so how do you think about balancing the market expansion d c baltimore boston with what might be a newfound opportunities right in your home state and nearby christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer i think it s you have to look at all that stuff and there is going to be in each of the bunch of deals that were announced right in the last six months different sizes different kinds of banks with a few of them and i m not going to name them we think there might be more disruption and opportunity some of the other ones we don t think there s going to be that much difference or that much opportunity so our existing folks are in the core markets that we ve been in for years they have their mission cut out for them and they re going to execute and won t need to be an either or i think it should be in hand but i m comfortable that our folks know where they expect to see opportunities and look baltimore itself was an outgrowth of the pnc bbva deal without that deal we wouldn t have that team so and we wouldn t be in baltimore joseph j lebel president chief operating officer and matt we ve added new lenders in the existing markets because of some of the disruption and i mentioned last quarter that we stood up a construction vertical which is already paying dividends for us led by a former very senior level banker in our current market environment so we re approaching them from all fronts matthew breese stephens inc analyst got it i appreciate that two other quick ones the new buyback authorization is pretty robust just curious in terms of appetite and given where the stock is should we expect execution on full or near full amount of the authorization over the balance of the year christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer i think you should expect that overall thing we re going to be pretty aggressive at the current price the earn back metrics are extremely good for us there are times though that can be hard to execute you can have all the authorization you want but there are rules to how many shares you can buy back in different periods and if you can find a block seller that can be a bit of an issue but you re right that we purposely wanted to send the message that we think our capital position earnings outlook would both support a much faster amount of buybacks and i think we could do these things going the m a stuff happens in seasons you ve seen a bunch of announcements we ve been watching the market carefully we are going to be careful not to be distracted by opportunities that might move the needle a little bit but won t make a material difference if it s not a material opportunity for us we rather buyback our own shares and continue with organic but that doesn t mean we re not looking at m a we re happy to do that too we just have to find the right thing matthew breese stephens inc analyst okay last one from me just the tax rate year to date is quite a little bit higher could you just recalibrate that for us what s a good run rate michael j fitzpatrick executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah matt it s mike it s about 24 i mean it s the state part the federal is pretty consistent but the state between new jersey new york etc has been bouncing around last year new jersey had some increase in rates and surtax and this year that happened in new york starting in q2 they had a surtax that s why the q2 number came up a little bit because of new york so it s i d still say 24 24 5 something like that some of these surtaxes are mostly surtaxes are temporary supposedly but time will tell christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer i would just point out too matt one of the reasons we took the strategy of diversifying a little bit out of new jersey is by a long shot are highest tax states so the income we derive in new jersey is the least efficient so it doesn t hurt to have some growth elsewhere matthew breese stephens inc analyst great okay i appreciate it thank you very much see you next week christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer all right thanks matt appreciate it operator the next question comes from don koch of koch investments please go ahead donald l koch koch investments analyst i got three quick questions one you ve sort of given some local color on but a major competitor has been that was always struggling has been taken off the board is that going to be a blessing or a curse or you are going to have a new group of people that will fight more fiercely or do you think you can really pickup not only market share but some much better talent christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer so we would assume you re probably referring to the investors announcement from earlier this week donald l koch koch investments analyst yeah christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer look we have a lot of respect for the folks at investors and to think about what they built in the time since they took the company public and so we wish them the best and we think of them as really just incredible competitors right and sometimes you compete with people and you have a great deal of respect for them in any deal and it s too early to tell what changes might come in that deal or there is the sterling webster deal and there are others like it it s too early to tell exactly where the opportunities will be but it tends to be that there are more opportunities not fewer opportunities when these things happen just because everyone loan officers customers start to reexamine what s important to them our business model is geared 100 to compete with the largest banks out there so we go to market everyday trying to win clients from wells bofa td pnc and others so in general terms anytime a bank is bought by a giant competitor that can be good for us but we don t count anybody out and the people and investors are remarkable so i m not i wish them all the best and i m not sure things are going to change very much donald l koch koch investments analyst second quick question i got one more after that is that you have done a wonderful job in this branch rationalization 58 over a period of time 4 in the last quarter that should be a tremendous burst of focus so that do you think you are going to continue to work on that is that right or does that type of run rate is something we can expect christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer we re absolutely going to continue to work on that and we ll have more detail on that next week at the investor day and just to give you the power that if you look at net operating expenses on our balance sheet as a percent of assets in the last five years they have fallen almost 70 basis points down to about 1 75 so you can see that as we ve switched and the way we like to look at it is we are following our customers to digital so even our customers are telling us every day that they want better solutions easier ways to bank with us and we have put a lot of money into that it s now 18 5 of our operating expenses are it so as a result what you have to do is over invest in those new channels and you have to rationalize your investment in the channels that get less use but interestingly we re building new branches too we have a new branch concept that is going quite well we ve got a couple of them up and running already we are been in the process of building the next two as well so i think it s you invest in every channel but your investment levels just have to reflect what your customer needs are donald l koch koch investments analyst and finally my last question and i know i ve brought this up couple of times with mike the last time i looked your immediate footprint in new jersey has about 9 million souls your greater footprint has posted the 20 million people but especially in new jersey half of those people on the western coast of florida every winter yyou ve got to have some kind of presence to follow that or that migration will go to the locals in that region some beachhead or something that sort of keeps your customers because eventually those new england or those northeastern states with the high tax rate blue governance is going to florida in the last 30 years has gone from 7 million to 23 million it s now larger than new york you ve got to follow that money somewhere christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer we absolutely agree with your point that limiting ourselves to new jersey is a mistake right and in terms of how we get the geographies i think a little bit is opportunistic overtime i will say that you d be astounded and we will have more details to share on this next week in digital digital has changed the game in a lot of ways including when customers decide to switch banks so one of the biggest successes is we ve had in digital is reducing the number of customers who leave us so customers move to florida they move to california they go to all sorts of places but the likelihood of them leaving oceanfirst is down materially over the last three or four years so maybe there ll be a day for that down in florida but for now we ve bitten off a lot in baltimore and boston we want to make sure we get those right donald l koch koch investments analyst okay thank you you did a nice job nice quarter christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator and the next question will come from william wallace of raymond james please go ahead william wallace raymond james analyst hi thanks i ll try to be brief i just wanted to circle back on the cash deployment and margin commentary this sort of concepts of getting into the 3s on nim are we just talking about purely a function of deploying the cash that gets you there or are there underlying trends whether it s funding relief or pricing benefits that are going to be drivers of margin expansion christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer it s really the mix shift that has to drive it if you think about deposit costs they are at 24 basis points they continue to go down and they ll go down a little bit more but we re not going to make it on the funding side and given the competitive market conditions we have rational expectations about loan yields so we re not going to be picking up our loan yield is not going to move up materially so as a result it s really just replacing the 10 basis points of cash with loans with little over 3 william wallace raymond james analyst okay great that s what i thought i just wanted to make sure that s my only question thank you christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer thanks wally operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to chris maher for any closing remarks christopher maher chairman and chief executive officer thank you with that i d like to

generated revenue of approximately 3 billion the highest quarterly sales of any period in our company s history our sales increased significantly over last year when the pandemic interrupted the global economy our adjusted eps of 4 45 was the highest on record for any quarter our success is the result of the extraordinary efforts of all of our team members across the world they have shown their dedication and resilience to overcome the challenges that we have faced we greatly appreciate what they have been able to achieve our second quarter results were significantly stronger than we had anticipated across all of our businesses with sales building on a momentum from our first period in the quarter our operating margin expanded to their highest level in the last four years as we leveraged our operational and sg a expenses the actions we have taken to simplify our product offering enhance our productivity and restructure our costs are benefiting our results we ve delivered almost 95 million of the anticipated 100 million to 110 million in savings for our restructuring initiatives across the enterprise we continue to respond to rising material energy and transportation costs by increasing prices and optimizing manufacturing and logistics during the quarter most of our manufacturing ran at capacity or we were limited by material supply and labor availability raw material constraints and many of our operations led to unplanned production shutdowns during the period overall we ve successfully managed interruptions that impeded our normal operations as well as regional manufacturing and customer closings related to covid regulations in local areas our inventory levels increased slightly in the period primarily reflecting higher material costs rising freight cost and limited shipping capacity impacted our material costs availability of imported products local shipments to customers and international exports presently we do not anticipate near term abatement of these constraints all of our markets continue to show strength with robust housing sales and remodeling investments across the world commercial projects are increasing as the global economy improves and businesses gain confidence to expand and remodel inventory levels in most channels remain low and our sales backlogs are above our historical levels to improve our sales mix and efficiencies we will introduce more new products with enhanced features and lower production complexity in the second half of the year to alleviate manufacturing constraints we have approved new capital investments of approximately 650 million to increase our production with most taking 12 to 18 months to fully implement in the second quarter we purchased 142 million of our stock at an average price of 2 08 sic 208 for a total amount of approximately 830 million since we initiated the program with our strong balance sheet and historically low leverage we re reviewing additional investments to expand our sales and profitability jim will now cover the second quarter financials james f brunk chief financial officer thank you jeff for the quarter our sales were 2 954 million an increase of 44 as reported and 38 on a constant basis all segments showed significant year over year growth versus q2 of 2020 which was a period we were most impacted by the pandemic shutdowns gross margin for the quarter was 30 5 as reported or 30 7 excluding charges increasing from 21 4 in the prior year the increase in gross profit was a result of higher volume and productivity improved price mix reduction of last year s temporary shutdowns due to the pandemic and favorable fx partially offset by the increasing inflation sg a as reported was 16 9 of sales or 16 8 versus 19 7 in the prior year both excluding charges as a result of strong leverage by the business on the sharp increase in volume the absolute year over year dollar increase was primarily due to higher volume normal operating costs previously curtailed by the pandemic impact of fx increased product development costs and inflation operating margin as reported was 13 7 with restructuring charges of approximately 7 million our restructuring savings are on track as we have recorded approximately 95 million of the planned 100 million and 110 million of savings operating margin excluding charges 13 9 improving from 1 7 in the prior year the increase was driven by the stronger volume improved price mix productivity actions the reduction of the temporary shutdowns and favorable fx partially offset by the higher inflation and increased product development costs interest for the quarter was 15 million other income other expense was 11 million income primarily a result of a settlement of foreign non income tax contingency and other miscellaneous items income tax rate as reported was 16 and 22 5 on a non gaap basis versus a credit of 2 5 in the prior year we expect the full year rate to be between 21 5 and 22 5 that leads us to a net earnings as reported of 336 million or an earnings per share of 4 82 earnings per share excluding charges was 4 45 percent or 4 45 excuse me turning to the segments the global ceramic segment had sales of just over 1 billion an increase of 38 as reported or 34 on a constant basis with strong geographic growth across our business led by mexico brazil and europe operating margin excluding charges was 13 2 a significant increase from the low point of 2020 at 0 5 the earnings improvement was a result of strengthening volume and productivity favorable price mix and a reduction of temporary shutdowns partially offset by increasing inflation flooring north america had sales of just under 1 1 billion for a 35 increase driven by a strong residential demand with commercial channel continuing its growth versus prior year but still below historic levels the segment experienced solid growth across all product lines led by residential carpet lvt and laminate operating income excluding charges was 11 2 and similar to global ceramic a significant increase from the 2020 margin trough the operating income improvement was also driven by the increase in volume strengthening productivity improvement in price mix with a reduction in temporary shutdowns partially offset by higher inflation lastly flooring rest of the world with sales of just over 830 million a 68 improvement as reported or 50 on a constant basis as continued strength in residential remodeling and new home construction drove improvement across all product groups led by resilient panels laminate and our soft surface business in australia and new zealand operating margin excluding charges of 19 7 and similar to our other segments was a significant increase from prior year s low point of 11 9 and again the main drivers were consistent in that they had higher volume favorable impact from price mix with a reduction of temporary shutdowns favorable fx partially offset by increasing inflation corporate and eliminations came in at 12 million and expect full year 2021 to be approximately 45 million turning to the balance sheet cash and short term investments are approximately 1 4 billion with free cash flow of 226 million in the quarter receivables of just over 2 billion an improvement in dso to 53 days versus 64 days in the prior year inventories for the quarter were just shy of 2 1 billion an increase of approximately 160 million or 8 from the prior year or increasing 85 million or 4 compared to q1 2021 inventory days remain historically low at 99 days versus 126 in the prior year property plant and equipment were just shy of 4 5 billion and capex for the quarter was 113 million with d a of 148 million full year capex has been increased to approximately 700 million to strengthen future growth with full year d a projected to be approximately 580 million overall the balance sheet and cash flow remained very strong with gross debt of 2 7 billion total cash and short term investments of approximately 1 4 billion and a leverage at 0 7 times to adjusted ebitda and with that i will turn it over to chris wellborn to cover our operational review w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer thank you jim for the period our flooring rest of the world segment sales increased 68 as reported and 50 on a constant basis operating margins expanded to 19 7 due to higher volume pricing and mix improvements and a reduction of covid restrictions partially offset by inflation flooring rest of the world outperformed our other segments with all our major product categories significantly as residential sales expanded in all regions we have implemented multiple price increases in most product categories to cover inflation in materials and freight raw material supplies are problematic and have impacted our lvt production and sales the most we anticipate material and freight challenges will continue to impact our business in the third quarter sales of our high end laminate continue to grow dramatically as our proprietary products are being widely accepted as waterproof alternative to lvt and wood we are beginning to introduce our next generation of laminate at premium levels with collections featuring handcrafted visuals we are increasing our production in europe with new capacity coming online and further capacity expansion projects are being initiated our laminate business in russia and brazil are growing strongly as we enhance our offering and expand our distribution we recently completed the acquisition of a laminate distributor in the u k that will improve our position in the market our lvt sales growth was strong during the period and would have been higher if material shortages had not interrupted manufacturing to compensate for material inflation we have increased prices and we expect further increases will be required as our costs continue to rise we are significantly expanding sales of our rigid lvt collections with our patented water tight joints that prevent moisture from penetrating the floor our manufacturing operations have made substantial progress improving throughputs material costs and yields our production in the third quarter will continue to be limited by material availability our sheet vinyl sales rebounded strongly as retail stores opened in our primary markets our sheet vinyl distribution in russia has expanded and we are maximizing production to meet the growing demand our wood plant in malaysia has been idle since the government instituted lockdowns to address surging covid rates wood is a small product category for us so the sales impact in the third quarter will be limited we are awaiting permits to complete the acquisition of a plant that reduces wood veneers to lower our cost our australian and new zealand flooring businesses delivered excellent results with sales and margins exceeding our expectations the residential business was strong with hard surface products leading the growth carpet sales are strengthening with our national consumer advertising enhanced merchandising and the launch of a new high end wool and triexta collections that improved our mix most of our facilities operated at a high level with increased volumes benefiting our results as in all of our markets commercial sales have not recovered to their pre pandemic levels though the australian government has locked down specific regions to contain the spread of covid it has not meaningfully impacted our business our european insulation sales grew even though chemical shortages limited our production our margins are recovering after we implemented price increases to cover rising material costs we have announced an additional price increase for the third quarter to offset further raw material inflation we anticipate chemical supplies to remain tight and could impact our future sales to expand our existing insulation business in ireland and the u k we have signed an agreement to acquire an insulation manufacturer which is pending government approval our panels business is running at full capacity and so far we ve been able to manage material shortages without interruptions to our operations we have raised prices and improved our mix with higher value decorative products to enhance our results we are expanding our offering of premium products as well as our project specification team to enhance our panel offering we are commissioning a new line that creates unique surfaces and visuals to differentiate our offering in the market for the period our flooring north america segment sales increased 35 and adjusted margins expanded to 11 2 due to higher volume productivity pricing and mix improvements and fewer covid interruptions partially offset by inflation our business trends continued from the first quarter with sales growth being driven by residential remodeling and new construction commercial sales continued to improve though the channel remains below pre pandemic levels through the period our order rate remains strong and our sales backlog remains above historical levels we are maximizing output at our facilities to support higher sales and improve our service during the quarter our production levels were hindered by local labor shortages and material supply particularly in lvt sheet vinyl and carpet ocean freight constraints delayed receipt of our imported products impacting our sales inventories and service levels we implemented price increases as a material and transportation cost increase and we have announced additional pricing actions as inflation continues our restructuring initiatives are improving efficiencies as planned and we should realize additional savings in the third quarter our residential carpet sales continued their growth trend across all channels with consumers investing in home improvement projects sales of our proprietary smartstrand franchise expanded with our new collections being well accepted our everstrand polyester collections are expanding by providing enhanced value styling and environmental sustainability our carpet sales have been limited by personnel shortages in our operations and we are implementing many actions to increase our staffing and productivity we have improved our efficiencies by rationalizing low volume skus and streamlining our operational strategies our commercial sales have improved as businesses increased remodeling and new construction projects both carpet tile and hard surface products grew with healthcare senior living education and government recovering faster though down slightly from record levels the june architecture billing index had a fifth consecutive month of expansion indicating the continued strengthening of new commercial development and renovation projects with realistic visuals and waterproof performance our premium laminate collections are growing substantially to support higher demand we have implemented many process improvements to maximize our u s production and are importing product from our global operations our laminate expansion remains on schedule and should be operational by the end of this year our new line will produce the next generation of revwood which is already being introduced in europe to support the growth of our laminate business our u s mdf operation completed investments to increase our volume and lower our cost our new waterproof ultrawood collections are being launched as a high performance alternative to typical engineered wood floors our lvt and sheet vinyl sales continue to increase with growth in the residential retail and new construction channels our lvt and sheet vinyl growth and plant productivity were impacted by disruptions in supply that stopped our operations and delays in imported lvt caused by transportation constraints we have enhanced our lvt offering with more realistic visuals proprietary water tight joints and improve stain and scratch resistance our u s operations implemented process enhancements that have increased our speeds and throughput when material availability increases we should see further improvements in our domestic manufacturing which will support our recent product launches for the period our global ceramic segment sales increased 38 as reported and 34 on a constant basis adjusted margins expanded to 13 2 due to higher volume productivity pricing and mix improvements and fewer covid disruptions partially offset by inflation our ceramic businesses around the world have greatly improved with strength in the residential channel and increasing commercial sales all of them have low inventories which impacted our sales growth and service levels we have initiated expansion plans to increase our capacity in mix in mexico brazil russia and europe our ceramic businesses continue to raise prices to cover material energy and transportation inflation our u s ceramic business is strengthening and we are implementing price increases to cover material and freight inflation we are improving our product mix with new shapes sizes and service structures we are reengineering our products to improve material cost and productivity our restructuring projects have been fully implemented and are growing the expected providing the expected benefits our countertop sales and mix continue to improve as we expand our premium offer with new technologies in the period a mechanical failure temporarily reduced production which has been repaired we have initiated the expansion of our plant to further grow our countertop business our mexican and brazilian ceramic businesses are very strong with our residential business in both regions at historically high levels and commercial still recovering due to capacity constraints our facilities could not fulfill customer demand so we are allocating our production we have executed multiple price increases to offset energy and material inflation we are expanding operations in mexico this quarter and we have initiated new investments to increase capacity in brazil our european ceramic business delivered strong sales and profitability as pricing product mix and productivity improved our margins we increased sales of our premium products including slabs small sizes outdoor and antibacterial collections commercial sales trends are starting to improve though they remain below historical levels we are selectively increasing prices to recover material energy and freight inflation during the period our operations ran at high levels with improved efficiencies and increased throughputs we continue to rationalize low volume skus to optimize our operations to support our sales of high end collections we have initiated expansion projects some of which will take through next year to complete our ceramic sales in russia were robust across all channels with our direct sales to customers through our own stores and new construction projects outperforming we have announced price increases to cover rising inflation during the period our manufacturing operations ran at capacity to respond to accelerated sales with inventory remaining below historical levels due to present capacity limitations we are focusing on optimizing our product mix we have initiated expansion plans with new production expected in the second half of next year sales of our new sanitaryware products are expanding primarily through our owned and franchised retail stores as our manufacturing ramps up with that i ll return the call to jeff jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer thanks chris the global economy should continue to improve due to low interest rates government stimulus and the success of covid vaccines around the world flooring sales trends remain favorable with residential remodeling and new construction at high levels and commercial projects strengthening in the third quarter we expect our strong sale to continue with our typical seasonal slowing from the second quarter we will expand the introduction of new products with additional features and increase our investments to enhance our future sales and mix material energy and transportation inflation is expected to continue and will require further pricing actions to offset most of our facilities will operate at high utilization rates though ongoing material and local labor constraints will limit our production our global ceramic and flooring rest of the world segments will observe the european vacation schedules in the third quarter which reduces production and increases cost in the period in many countries future government actions to contain covid remain a risk and could impact our business given these factors we anticipate our third quarter adjusted eps to be between 3 71 and 3 81 excluding any restructuring charges we entered this year with uncertainty about covid the economic recovery home renovation and new construction our business is stronger than we had anticipated and we are increasing investments to support additional growth and improve efficiencies longer term housing sales and remodeling are expected to remain at historical high levels apartment renovation should accelerate as rent deferment expires and investments in commercial projects should continue to strengthen we re expanding our operations and introducing new innovations to maximize our results our balance sheet is strong and we re exploring additional internal projects and acquisition opportunities we ll now be glad to take your questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of eric bosshard with cleveland research your line is open eric bosshard cleveland research analyst good morning jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer good morning eric bosshard cleveland research analyst the wondering two things first of all in terms of the increased capital and the increased capacity investments that you talked about over the next 12 to 18 months you ve got some stuff that shows up at the end of this year but in terms of product categories or regions where you have the most conviction where are you adding capacity jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer it s we re adding capacity in the constrained parts of the business all over the world so what we re adding our production has been but at the same time one of the things we re still limited by constraints so some of the limitations are labor and materials rather than capacity to fix to run it and then we also have the problems with the delayed products from imports the 650 million that we re going to put in the biggest pieces are in laminate ceramic and countertops but there s a number of other areas that they include and when you get through with that the capital forecast for the year for this year is being raised to 700 million and 450 million of the 600 million will be in next year s eric bosshard cleveland research analyst okay that s helpful and then secondly in terms of the third quarter the earnings guidance is helpful just wondering if you could help us at all in terms of the sales guidance your commentary of typical seasonal slowing does that make does that suggest that we should look at 3q revenues relative to 2q revenues to reflect the normal 2q to 3q step down or is there something that would change the way that that path has traveled historically jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer so let s see the third quarter we expect sales trends to continue from the second quarter the operations will still run strong we re assuming that business and residential keep going and commercial improvement residential the european the non u s business especially europe always slow with the normal holiday period as we go through and you might not know but the non u s businesses over time have become a larger part of our results and the holidays have become a bigger impact over many years as we keep expanding outside the u s so and with that we still have material supply labor transportation that all are constraining the business we don t think the pricing actions we have are enough our inflation keeps coming so we expect to keep putting in more increases in prices in it and then just to try other things as you think of the third quarter what you have is manufacturing costs in the united states are impacted by holiday in the 4th of july which is in the third quarter rather than second you have the holidays which impacts not only the cost of not operating but the sales also drop off as we go through so that i mean that s the biggest pieces of it the best i can lay out for thank you eric bosshard cleveland research analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mike dahl with rbc capital markets your line is open mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking my question jeff first question i wanted to follow up on the capex and just clarify i think you said 450 million of the 600 million i don t know if you meant 450 million of the 650 million but just trying to figure out that next i guess the question would be when you look out to 22 between the carryover from these new investments and your normal capex how should we be thinking about capex in 22 and to the point about not all these constraints are physical capacity some of it s labor some of it s materials i guess capex is a very long term decision and these are potentially in some cases temporary constraints or even temporary demand tailwinds how do you think about that balance and the conviction to add the capacity jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the pieces that are temporary constraints we re not increasing those we are leaving those alone the things we are increasing are things that we have exceeded our capacity what happened is this year the sales are much higher than we anticipated coming into the year so with that we hadn t planned on having the capacity to support the growth that we re having this year and so to get to the money first is the 650 million is in addition to the capital that we had in the plan for this year so this year the capital before was around 550 million if i remember james f brunk chief financial officer yes that s correct jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer so i m not sure i got the number exactly right but it was around 550 million of the 650 million that we raised this year to 700 million and then approximately about 450 million of that of the 600 million will go over to next year and then we re going to go through our final planning in the rest half of this year we haven t finalized the budget for next year yet so we ll have to decide with what we re going to add more or less than we ve already done as we go through and again just all through the original presentation we made we tried to lay out for you the different pieces and i ll name a few the ceramic businesses in mexico brazil russia europe are all being increased we have the laminate businesses in the united states and russia i mean in europe are all being increased we have the countertop business is being increased in the united states and there s a number of other ones that are here so we re putting the business in shape to grow more in the future and support what s going on in the world mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay that s really helpful my second question just back on the price cost i guess your comments that the current pricing actions aren t quite enough given the escalation in costs and you re implementing more pricing how should we think about the lag and what s embedded in guidance do you assume that it ll be price cost negative in 3q before a catch up in 4q will you stay ahead of cost in 3q or is it neutral just a little more color on kind of order of magnitude of cost and whether or when you ll be back to price cost neutral or positive jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer let s start out with the second quarter we were able to cover the inflation which you ll see in the numbers that we publish later we ve raised prices across the business we keep announcing new increases our energy materials freight continue to rise we don t know where it s going every week we wake up with new increases so we keep adjusting as required as we go through and so we think we ve announced enough for what we know about at this point and the timing of them and how they work together we ve put all that into the estimate that we think we re going to get them close and then with the mix thing you do see as we raise prices in the marketplace some customers in both residential and commercial have budgets and when they have budgets they start trading down looking for something that stays in the budget so that s just a normal process that occurs in all of this mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks jeff appreciate the color operator our next question comes from the line of adam baumgarten with zelman your line is open adam baumgarten zelman analyst hey good morning everyone just maybe jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer good morning adam baumgarten zelman analyst just maybe touching on the laminate business it appears there s been a really kind of meaningful surge in demand there over the last it seems like a year or so how much of that is due to some of the technological advances that you ve seen and how much of that is due to maybe shortages in lvt supply jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer let s start out with first what happened is you had lvt growing dramatically and one of the main features of it was waterproof and what s happened is in the marketplace there are multiple options and if you go into retailers today they start talking about waterproof flooring as a category when they start showing products of which our laminate with the technologies we have is a good or better alternative than many other ones in the waterproof category so that s causing it to grow it s also been growing in going into different channels it s being used if you watch any television shows the remodeling pieces they re using laminate and remodeling in new houses today which they with a much higher rate than they have in the past and then separate from all of that we really do have unique technologies that give us differentiated features and visuals that separate our products from the market and we have a much higher portion of the premium market because of it both in the u s and europe as it w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer which is the reason why we re adding the capacity at the end of this year in the u s and that s why we had it planned as part of the 650 million that jeff talked about both in the u s and in europe in the future years adam baumgarten zelman analyst got it and then just on that mix down comment you made jeff are you seeing it more pronounced in certain categories over others jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer it s hard to tell i mean it s all moving around and some people just have budgets and they trade down in other cases you ve seen the same thing as people buy homes the remodeling part of the business tends to be a higher value customer than new construction where they re mass building homes so and then the apartments are lower so there s all kinds of mix changes going on adam baumgarten zelman analyst got it thanks operator our next question comes from the line of susan maklari with goldman sachs your line is open susan maklari goldman sachs analyst thank you good morning everyone my first question is jeff i know you gave some third quarter guidance in your comments but can you help us think about how the third quarter versus the fourth quarter may come together this year just given the comps that we re facing and some of the seasonality that you talked about in the business any kind of color or guidance there for the next few quarters would be helpful jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer let s see so again the third quarter we do expect the same sales trends to continue that operations are running again at high levels with all the constraints we don t know how they re going to happen in the third quarter we ve built in our best guesses of supply and labor and transportation but it s a moving target as it as you go from there into the fourth quarter it is typically softer as people go into the holidays they don t tend to buy as much flooring during christmas and then this year we have 6 less days and a 6 less days will impact the sales and the margins as we lose the absorption from the lower days in the period as it then this year versus last year and this is a guess because we don t know what s going to happen we re expecting at this point a more normal seasonality with more increased vacations people taking with lower holiday spending on remodeling and reduced utilization of the plants but we re going to have to see how it happens at the end of the year compared to last year when we had the rebound that we did but it s difficult to predict at this point and then we also as we get to the end of the year last year we constrained the new products dramatically and now we re going to invest more in new products and sales in order to enhance next year susan maklari goldman sachs analyst okay that s very helpful color my follow up question is in the last few quarters you have purchased about 400 million or almost 400 million of your stock when you think about the capital allocation the increased spend on capacity that you announced today where do buybacks kind of fall within that what s your appetite to continue buying back the stock at these levels jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer well given our balance sheet we have a lot of options and at the moment we bought 140 million last quarter i think we have about 170 million still open on the acquisition but the primary pieces are where we started the constrained businesses and reducing costs which is the 650 million we ll do more of that when we finalize the plan for next year in the second half of this year to keep broadening the product offering innovation we found a few bolt on acquisitions you saw we ll see more of those and then we re looking for other acquisitions to either step change the business or go into new markets or align product categories and then share back s one of the options now with the balance sheet we can do more than one thing susan maklari goldman sachs analyst okay all right thank you for that good luck operator our next question comes from the line of michael rehaut with jpmorgan your line is open michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst hi thanks good morning everyone jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer good morning michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst just wanted to clarify some of your earlier comments jeff around how to think about the third quarter you mentioned that you expect sales trends to continue but at the same time an increase in vacation time particularly in europe i think there might be an ability to misinterpret those statements if you say sales trends it s a little bit more qualitative and maybe uneven on a year over year basis but i think people are just trying to understand on an absolute dollar basis are you suggesting that on an absolute dollar basis 3q revenue should be similar to 2q or indeed as i think you were trying to say at least in global ceramic and flooring rest of the world we should be modeling in some type of sequential dollar decline due to the big cases jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i think what s confusing is i d say the sales trends are continuing which means i believe the businesses have the same strength that will go like that the second part is there is a seasonality which i m not sure all of everyone understands our european businesses have european and non u s businesses have become a much larger part of our business they impact the business more today than they did five years ago or before because of the acquisitions and enhancements of the business we ve done so when they step down that whole category steps down which will reduce the sales level in total from the third quarter and have a negative impact on the sales and margins and it will be lower because of it as it has been in prior years and it s not the business changing it s the normal seasonality now separate from that last year was also unusual and what happened last year with covid we and our plants and our facilities and our customers we shut down a lot in the second quarter and what happened is many of the people we have the people taking their vacations in the second quarter so when the business started getting better in the third quarter we didn t do the normal shutdowns because we used the vacation pays and things in the second quarter and then the same thing happened people didn t go on vacations like they did so the third quarter was unusually high because the whole vacation structure of both our production our customers vacations for people was different so the comparison is unusual in this third quarter last year to third quarter this year michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst okay i think i understand second question i just wanted to circle back also and clarify a little bit to the best possible on the capex outlook for 22 it sounds like you re basically saying that of the 650 million 450 million is expected next year so you re doing roughly 200 million of that this year so that s a delta of another 250 million higher sequentially year to year are we going to take from that that the total capex all in should be something closer to 900 million to 1 billion jim i don t know if a better way to answer this is just kind of reviewing with us your basic maintenance capex but i think we re looking at a decent range of outcome i think as long at least as people are trying to figure this out so any type of better range would be helpful jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer you understand when we told you the plan next year what we did this year we stopped in the middle of the year and said this is not as we have planned and we can t wait until our normal planning period in order to start changing the capacities to support our business so we took everybody and we identified the things that we knew we wanted to do and went ahead and did it we still have to go through the planning process to decide what we want to do more than that next year and we haven t done it there is the normal maintenance and safety which is typically call it around 200 million could be more or less and then on top of that we haven t decided yet so we can t give any direction michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst okay one last clarification on the tax rate if i could you guided to 21 5 to 22 5 does that include the benefit in the second quarter because that would kind of point you to a mid 20s tax rate or does it exclude that benefit james f brunk chief financial officer that excludes that benefit so the non gaap rate in q2 was 22 5 the full year is the 21 5 to 22 5 i would expect based on seasonality of the tax rate for q3 to be slightly higher than q4 michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst okay thank you james f brunk chief financial officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from the line of keith hughes with truist your line is open keith hughes truist analyst thank you you had talked in the release about second quarter being a record quarter which is correct if you look within flooring north america your revenues are about or at slightly above the 2017 peak the margins are still below i guess my question is what s the difference versus then what do you need to do to get those back up to the historic peaks in operating margin jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the margins did improve as you said from volume pricing and costs there are things that are going on so now the in the peak period we had commercial sales which are higher we didn t have all this inflation we re fighting now we didn t have labor shortages we didn t have material shortages we are running short runs in the factories trying to keep the service as well as we can which is causing we re jerking the factories around creating inefficiencies as we go through and the in addition in some of the markets the competition is more fierce today than it was then keith hughes truist analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of stephen kim with evercore your line is open stephen kim evercore analyst thanks very much guys nice results and appreciate the outlook here the capacity expansion program i wanted to get a sense for how much of a sales opportunity you think that 650 million might offer you and then as it does come in over the next 12 to 18 months a lot of times there s some start up costs that come with that and i just want to make sure we re thinking about that modest offset properly i remember just looking back from 2014 to 17 you kind of ran 10 million to 15 million a year not a lot and i just wanted i know you executed really well on during that period of time i just want to make a get a sense for what the offset might be as this capacity comes online is that a reasonable range to be thinking about jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer so the capacity the 650 million will translate into somewhere around 6 to 7 of our total business sales round numbers to give you a high level direction and yes there s always start up costs that come along with it on the other hand all of this is known technologies being put in existing facilities or existing businesses it could be a building next door not too far away so we shouldn t have some of the learning curves that we had to pay for in the other ones stephen kim evercore analyst yes no that s very helpful yes it makes a lot of sense i wanted to talk about flooring rest of the world obviously it s been a big contributor to the upside positive upside surprises we ve been seeing for about four quarters now i think this business has been really the fastest grower and i know this is an area that has many different business lines in it i know you ve called out a number of them and i know that you ve also added a lot of capacity there over the years but the step up that we ve seen in the last four quarters was pretty significant and so what i wanted to try to understand is do you attribute the step up we ve seen in sales in flooring rest of the world excluding the impact of acquisitions but just the actual step up being organic to be the bringing on of certain capacity or certain business lines that were not there previously or do you see it as just post covid there was this big surge in demand really pretty much across the business and your capacity was there waiting for it and it just got still because of this generalized demand jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer as you said the rest of the world performance is strong sales and income are at high levels the operations most of the operations are running near capacity which is helping our cost structures our product mix is improving from actions we ve been taking one after the other to improve the mix we are aggressively trying to raise prices to align with the pieces as we go through so then you have the different parts so if you go back to some of the investments we ve put in over the years we put a new plant in russia in sheet vinyl well that plant is now running seven days a week two years ago we d start it up a few years ago we bought the australia new zealand business we ve been putting efforts to change their product line upgrade their product offering we they were just trying to get in hard surface we have the hard surface business we ve put in all kinds of new product offerings and pieces and we re growing our share dramatically in hard surface in that marketplace in sheet vinyl we re the leader in sheet vinyl in the european marketplace most of our business is in the residential it s doing well we put a plant in russia to make sheet vinyl we talked about and laminate our laminate business we keep introducing new innovations as we do that we keep improving our mix we also bought a few years when we bought ivc a few years ago it s taken us a few years they had a laminate business we ve been able to dramatically improve the sales and margins of it over the years as it the wood panel business that we have is running wide open the margins are improving it s at high levels because there s shortages in wood panels so it s at a high level our insulation business we ve put in multiple plants we ve acquired other ones so we have a strong insulation business and it s doing well even though we re chasing really high chemical costs so we re benefiting from a lot of things stephen kim evercore analyst yes really just sounds like the fulfillment of your longer term plan that you ve had there and been executing as we go forward into the future it seems like there s still a lot of growth opportunities for flooring rest of the world should we be expecting that segment to continue to outpace the other segments on a volume growth basis jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer it s going to be hard to keep up the growth rate they ve been at as it i mean those are exceptional what they re doing we re investing in in the 650 million we re putting a new laminate line which will add about 125 million 150 million of new capacity in laminate we keep investing in the other pieces we re trying to grow it as much as we can i don t think it can stay at the growth rates of that and then one more thing in all the businesses just remember commercial everywhere is low commercial is a higher margin business for us and as the commercial business comes back the margins there are going to enhance the pieces and we have capacities that in some places only make commercial products stephen kim evercore analyst yes no for sure yes we have that to look forward to thanks appreciate it operator our next question comes from the line of kathryn thompson with thompson research your line is open brian thompson research analyst hey it s actually brian on for kathryn i guess i wanted to start with you mentioned that sales were significantly stronger than anticipated going into the quarter i guess is there any specific segment or product to call out here kind of is it a case of the strong getting stronger or was there kind of more than expected momentum in areas that had previously been weaker like say commercial jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i m sure we re like everybody else in the world given what s going on with covid and what s happening and then you have the huge uptick of people staying at home huge housing lease sales projecting forward how strong it s going to be and not we projected what we thought it would be coming into the quarter and it surprised us how strong it was and maintained itself in the united states and across the entire world and the same thing going forward estimating and we talk about it in the fourth quarter we really don t know if the business will stay strong like last year or go back to historical ways and fall off there s a big difference in what can happen depending on which we see and our crystal ball is no better than yours brian thompson research analyst i guess would you characterize it as the residential side was stronger than expected or the commercial or a combination of the two jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the residential is driving the whole thing but commercial is improving quarter to quarter and picking up and i think it s the commercial is probably a little bit better than we had expected but i mean we had anticipated it getting better brian thompson research analyst okay understood and i guess second question want to i guess ask about labor i guess labor shortages and specifically on the installers i guess we had a few of our contacts point to installers as their biggest concern for growth going forward and how much of that is a concern for you guys especially given the investments you re making to increase production understand there s demand level out there but is there the is there going to be the labor force at the installer level to support that growth in a year or two jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer we sure hope so but you have it right everybody has listen labor is a problem with every company and every industry if we could ship twice as much to our customers they couldn t install it so you re correct there s limitations in the whole stream as it goes through but for the most part they re installing everything that we can ship them brian thompson research analyst got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of phil ng with jefferies your line is open phil ng jefferies analyst hey congrats on a really strong quarter and great execution guys jeff i guess material shortages will certainly free up in time so that will help but you mentioned you re sold out in certain products i m just curious how much headroom do you have for growth next year as you kind of ramp up on this capacity jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer so let s see it s different by different businesses and categories as you said presently in some of the businesses labor is a major problem and others it s transportation we actually have stuff and can t get it moved around to the customers fast enough in other cases we have imported products that s delaying it we have capacity in some businesses other businesses pick one brazil we re running wide open and we re quoting dates months out as it as an example as it we re trying to improve our mix and we re trying to keep through passing the prices but until we get the new capacity in in the second half of next year they re maxed out and so we do have that s an example of one we have pieces like that we have other ones that if we can get people to show up for work that we could increase our production dramatically as it these various ways of giving people money around the in the u s is disincentivizing people and sometimes when they get the checks they just don t show up for the next two days phil ng jefferies analyst got it that s super helpful jeff i was curious to hear what you re seeing and hearing from your different channel partners we ve certainly seen the builders rein in orders lately but and we ve seen some normalization of trends in retail so curious how have orders patterns been tracking between these channels and when we look out is it going to have an impact on mix jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer we see that let s go through the pieces we see the housing sales continuing at high levels i know there s ups and downs in it but relative to historical it should continue at high levels the houses that were purchased over the last year they are all in various stages of remodeling when you buy a new home an existing home you typically don t remodel the whole thing it goes in stages so that will take a while to play out going forward you have some things with policies with the government people who haven t been paying their mortgages at some point some of those houses are going to turn over and that s going to increase the remodeling sales somewhat you have people in the rentals that haven t been paying rents at some point some of those are going to change over and they re going to have to remodel them for the next people you have the commercial parts of the business companies are getting more confident or not and they re starting to invest more it takes time to put it in the budgets time to start them there s a void for a while on new construction that got stopped so there s going to be a void to when it comes back and there s a lot of upside in it and it s a more profitable business because the products are more unique and differentiated so all the trends look good as far as we can see them on the other side short term we don t know if we have enough materials to run the place tomorrow in some cases and so we wake up and the materials are supposed to come in and something happens we just shut the plant down we have you come in and we have people just aren t showing up for work like they normally do as it the people we re hiring it s more difficult to train and it takes longer and there s more turnover so the a huge amount of moving parts and we re managing them all but it makes day to day in the short term hard to predict phil ng jefferies analyst got it that s great jeff appreciate it operator our next question comes from the line of laura champine with loop capital your line is open laura champine loop capital analyst thank you jeff i really wanted to follow up on the comments you just made it seems like your inventories are tight in terms of units because of all these production complications do you have line of sight as to when you ll have your inventories and unit terms back where you want them and what s the plan to offset these production difficulties jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer let s see first we are struggling with the labor we talked about and the material flows the what we expect to happen doesn t happen and so we re making as much as we can given those constraints and we re taking actions that we can take to influence them as best we can we need the inventories higher in order to hit the service levels as you said if the demand stays high there s a chance that given all these constraints we won t be able to build much inventory until we hit the end of the year as it or it could be further and it depends on the constraints and the availability on the other hand if something happens and the materials come in faster and we can get people to operate the facilities we could increase the outputs on the other hand there s a positive we really can t tell how strong the demand is going to be and as we in the earlier comments you heard me make we don t know whether the end of the fourth quarter is going to look like last year and stay strong or it s going to go back to the normal seasonality that we see so we re just we make plans month to month and we keep changing them as they happen and it s i can t give you a clear answer because that s the reality of the what we re living in laura champine loop capital analyst do you think that gross margins are sustainable given that you ve taken a lot of pricing and that s got to be a tailwind but you ve probably given up some in productivity as you just mentioned how should we think about your gross margin trajectory into next year jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the goal is to improve the business at the top line and improve the margins as we go through the margins this year will be up substantially with the higher demand and improved costs the second quarter was a really high period because everything was running wide open as we go out next year we think it s going to improve but it really depends on demand and material pricing and competitive environment which is really hard to predict these days we think we re going to do better we re putting everything in place to do better we are improving our own internal things that are under our control we re investing in new things we are expanding our production where everything is limited and we re doing the right things to grow the business if we get a little help from the world we could be in a really good position laura champine loop capital analyst got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of truman patterson with wolfe research your line is open truman patterson wolfe research analyst hey good morning and thanks for taking my question first just wanted to touch on m a could you all discuss the environment and the potential pipeline there and could you just possibly balance these thoughts with the organic or the decision to invest in organic capital investments of the 650 million i imagine in the product categories you re expanding in just there s not a lot out there but wanted to get your updated thoughts jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the two are really not related the internal investments are where we see the trends of our business what we think the demand is going to be our ability to sell it in a marketplace and that s the basis of our investments the acquisitions we re continuing to investigate opportunities the conditions are improving there s a little less options at the moment because people perceive them the business improving valuations are high so it s a little more difficult in this environment as we announced we have agreements to acquire some smaller bolt on businesses we are ready to buy the other businesses if we can identify the right ones at the right valuations that we think are good for our long term and if you have any suggestions call me truman patterson wolfe research analyst fair enough any key geographies or products jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer it s more around we get the most benefit out of ones that are in our present geographies that we can leverage between the two those give us the most benefit for longer term going into new geographies with the right group gives us a base to go into that business and we can use it as a growth proposition to go into new markets and then the same thing with new products if we can find the right products into the same geographies that are related to us that tie in with what we know and how we do it we can leverage them and then we re still considering at some point we think we could add another leg to the business and go into another product category at some point to keep growing the business so we have the right talent we have the people and we have the money we just have to find the right propositions truman patterson wolfe research analyst okay and i m just hoping on this next question you can just give us either a tour around the world or your product portfolio we re hearing a very strong pricing power and incremental price hikes in the channels just hoping you can maybe quantify some of that by product or geography jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the pricing i m trying to answer it generically all of the businesses that we have are having dramatic increases in costs our competitors are in the same position as we are we also have limited materials and our competitors also have those same problem so the market competition is in a spot where everybody is pushing it through more aggressively given those conditions across the world as it and how long it s going to last like that i can t say but as long as the business is like it is that s what s enabling us to push through the pricing truman patterson wolfe research analyst okay thank you for that operator thank you ladies and gentlemen in the interest of time and i would now like to turn the call back over to mr lorberbaum for closing remarks jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer

and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call angela kleiman and barb pak will follow me with prepared remarks and adam berry is here for q a on today s call i ll start with our second quarter results which were driven by a strengthening economy and positive and also to underlie a robust recovery on the west coast i ll also discuss the status of reopening the west coast economies and related factors concluding with an overview of the west coast apartment transaction markets and investments our second quarter results were ahead of our initial expectations entering the year as the economic recovery from the pandemic occurred faster than we expected with a strong economy and high vaccination rates we are now confident that the worst of the pandemic related impacts are behind us as noted on previous calls our strategy during the pandemic was to maintain high occupancy and scheduled rent both necessary for rapid recovery to that end net effective rent surged during the second quarter along with year over year improvement in occupancy other income and delinquency the recovery and net effective rents continued unabated in july and we are now pleased to announce that july net effective rents for the essex portfolio have now surpassed pre pandemic levels with our suburban markets leading the way while the downtowns are improving but still generally below pre pandemic levels obviously these higher rents will be converted into revenue as leases turn and angela will provide additional details in a moment having passed the midpoint of 2021 and looking forward we made a second set of positive revisions to our west coast market forecast which can be found on page s 17 of the supplemental driving the changes is an increase in 2021 gdp and job growth estimates to 7 and 5 up from 4 3 and 3 2 respectively from our initial forecast as a result we now expect our average 2021 net effective rent growth to improve to minus 0 9 from minus 1 9 from the beginning of the year to put this into perspective consider that our net effective rents were down about 9 year over year in q1 2021 given our current expectation of minus 0 9 rent growth for the year year over year net effective market rents are now forecasted to increase about 6 in the fourth quarter of 2021 cash delinquencies were up modestly on a sequential basis at 2 6 of scheduled rent for the quarter and well above our 30 year average delinquency rate of 30 to 40 basis points the american rescue plan of 2021 provides funding for emergency rental assistance which was allocated to the stage for distribution to renters for pandemic related delinquencies during the second quarter collections of delinquent rents from the american rescue plan were negligible as the pace of processing reimbursements has been slow since the program launched in march we expect that to improve in the coming months we expect delinquency rates to return to normal levels over time as more workers enter the workforce and eviction protections labs on september 30 in both california and washington at this point only about 7 million of the 55 million in delinquent rent shown on page s 16 of the supplemental has been recorded as revenue given uncertainty about the timing of collections no additional revenues are contemplated in our financial guidance even with the approved job and economic outlook the reopening process was gradual through the second quarter with full reopening declared in mid and late june for california and washington respectively the unemployment rate was still 6 5 in the essex markets as of may 2021 underperforming the nation through q2 we have regained about half of the jobs lost in the early months of the pandemic employment in the essex markets dropped over 15 in april 2020 and while job growth in our markets outpaced the nation in the second quarter we are still 7 9 below pre pandemic employment compared to 4 4 for the u s overall we see the gap is an opportunity for growth to continue in the coming months as we benefit from the full reopening of the west coast economies we believe that many workers that exited the primary employment centers during pandemic related shutdowns and work from home programs will return as businesses reopen and resume expansion that was placed on hold during the pandemic as we proceed through the summer months we edge closer to the targeted office reopening dates set by most large tech employers in early september as recent reports about apple and google suggest the covid 19 delta variant could lead to temporary delays in this reopening process our survey of job openings in the essex markets for the largest tech companies continues to be very strong as we reported 33 000 job openings as of july a 99 increase over last year s trough new venture capital investment has set a record pace this year with essex markets once again leading with respect to funds invested providing growth capital that supports future jobs generally economic sectors that sell before this during the pandemic are now positioned for the strongest recovery and the reopening process led by restaurants hotels entertainment venues travel and so many return to office plans which remain focused on hybrid approaches will continue to draw employees closer to corporate offices given that many workers won t be required to be in the office on a full time basis we expect average new distances to increase as we highlight on page s 17 1 of our supplemental this transition has already started in recent months as our hardest hit markets in the bay area once again experienced net positive migration from beyond the norcal region in particular since the end of q1 the submarket surrounding san francisco bay have seen positive net migration that represents 18 of total move outs over the trailing three months compared to minus 8 a year ago these inflows are led by residents returning from adjacent metros such as sacramento and the monterey peninsula as well as renewed flow of recent grads graduates arriving from college towns across the country a notable positive turnaround from last year in seattle cbd we ve seen similar or even stronger recent inflows and we re likewise experiences experiencing a strong market rent recovery on the supply outlook we provided our semi annual update to our 2021 forecast on s 17 of the supplemental with slight increases to 2021 supply as covid related construction delays shifted incremental yields from late 2020 into 2021 we expect modestly fewer apartment deliveries in the second half of 2021 with more significant declines in los angeles and oakland while it is still too early to quantify recent volatility in lumber prices and shortages for building materials may impact construction starts and the timing of deliveries in subsequent years multifamily permitting activity in essex markets also continues to trend favorably declining 200 basis points on a trailing 12 month basis as of may 2021 compared to the national average which grew 230 basis points median single family home prices in essex markets continued upward in california and seattle growing 18 and 21 respectively on a trailing three month basis the escalating cost of homeownership combined with greater rental affordability from the pandemic have increased the financial incentive to rent we suspect these trends will continue given muted single family supply and limited permitting activity and i believe these factors will be a key differentiator for our markets in the coming years compared to many u s markets with greater housing supply turning to apartment transactions activity is steadily accelerated since the start of the year with the majority of apartment trades occurring in the low to mid 3 cap rate range based on current rents generally investors anticipate a robust rate recovery especially in markets where current rents are substantially below pre pandemic levels with the recent improvement in our cost to capital we have turned our focus once again to acquisitions and development while remaining disciplined with respect to ffo accretion targets with respect to our preferred equity program we continue to see new deals although the market is becoming more competitive lower cap rates from pre pandemic levels have produced higher than anticipated market valuations which in turn has resulted in higher levels of early redemption that concludes my comments it s now my pleasure to turn the call over to our coo angela kleiman angela l kleiman senior executive vice president and chief operating officer thanks mike my comments today will focus on our second quarter results and current market dynamics with the reopening of the west coast economy the recovery has generated improvements in demand and thus pricing power our operating strategy during covid to favor occupancy while adjusting concessions to maintain scheduled rents enabled us to optimize rent growth concurrent with the increase in demand resulting in same store net effective rent growth of 8 3 since january 1 and most of this growth occurred in the second quarter a key contributor of this accomplishment is the fantastic job by our operations team in responding quickly to this dynamic market environment while market conditions have improved rapidly during our second quarter driving our second quarter results to exceed expectations i would like to provide some context for why sequential same property revenues declined by 90 basis points compared to the first quarter the two major factors that drove the decline were 50 basis points of delinquency and 50 basis points in concessions delinquency in the first quarter was temporarily lifted by the one time unemployment disbursements from the stimulus funds as expected in the second quarter delinquency reverted back to 2 6 of scheduled rent versus the 2 1 in the first quarter on concessions the nominal amount increased from higher volume of leases in the second quarter relative to the first quarter of this year to declare concessions in our markets have declined substantially and are virtually none existent except for select cbd markets our average concession for the stabilized portfolio is under one week in the second quarter compared to over a week in the first quarter and over two weeks in the fourth quarter although concessions have generally improved in the second quarter they remain elevated ranging from 2 5 to 3 weeks in certain cbds such as cbd la san jose and oakland given the extraordinary pandemic related volatility in once in concessions over the past year and a half i thought it would be insightful to provide an overview of the change in net effective rents compared to pre covid levels as of this june our same store average net effective rents compared to march of last year was down by 3 1 since then we have seen continued strength and based on preliminary july results our average net effective are now 1 5 above pre covid levels it is notable that this 1 5 portfolio average diverged regionally with both seattle and southern california up 5 8 and 9 3 respectively while northern california has yet to fully recover with net effective rents currently at 8 below pre covid levels on a sequential basis net effective rents on new leases have improved rapidly throughout the second quarter and preliminary july rent increased 4 7 compared to the month of june led by cbd san francisco and cbd seattle both up about 11 not surprisingly these two markets were hit hardest during the pandemic and are now experiencing the most rent growth moving on to office development activities which we view as an indicator of future job growth and accordingly housing demand in general the areas along the west coast with the greatest amount of office developments have been san jose and seattle currently san jose has 8 1 of total office stock under construction and similarly seattle has 7 7 of office stock under construction notable activities include apple leasing an additional 700 000 sqft and linkedin announced recent plans to upgrade our existing offices in sunnyvale in the seattle region facebook expanded their bellevue footprint by 330 000 sqft and amazon announced 1400 new web services jobs in redmond we expect in the long term areas with higher office deliveries such as san jose and seattle will have capacity for greater apartment supply with our impacting rental rates while these normal relationships were disrupted during the pandemic we anticipate conditions to normalize in the coming quarters lastly as the economic recovery continues to gain momentum we have restarted both our apartment renovation programs and technology initiatives including actively enhancing the functionality of our mobile leasing platform and smart rent home automation thank you and i will now turn the call over to barb pak barb m pak executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks angela i ll start with a few comments on our second quarter results discuss changes to our full year guidance followed by an update on our investments and the balance sheet i m pleased to report core ffo for the second quarter exceeded the midpoint of the revised range we provided during the nareit conference by 0 08 per share the favorable results are primarily attributable to stronger same property revenues higher commercial income and lower operating expenses of the 0 08 the 0 03 relates to the timing of operating expenses and g a spend which is now forecasted to occur in the second half of the year as angela discussed we are seeing stronger rent growth in our markets than we expected just a few months ago as such we are raising the full year midpoint of our same property revenue growth by 50 basis points to minus 1 4 it should be noted this was the high end of the revised range we provided in june in addition we have lowered our operating expense growth by 25 basis points at the midpoint due to lower taxes in the seattle portfolio all of this resulted in an improvement in same property noi growth by 80 basis points at the midpoint to minus 3 year to date we have revived our same property revenue growth at the midpoint up 110 basis points and noi by 160 basis points as it relates to full year core ffo we are raising our midpoint by 0 09 per share to 12 33 this reflects the stronger operating results partially offset by the impact of the early redemption of preferred equity investments which i will discuss in a minute year to date we have raised core ffo by 0 17 or 1 4 turning to the investment markets as we ve discussed on previous calls strong demand for west coast apartments and inexpensive debt financing has led to sales and recapitalization of several properties underlying our preferred equity and subordinated loan investments resulting in several early redemptions during the quarter we received 36 million from an early redemption of a subordinated loan which included 4 7 million in prepayment fees which have been excluded from core ffo year to date we have been redeemed on approximately 150 million of investment and expect that number to grow to approximately 250 million by year end this is significantly above the high end of the range we provided at the start of the year however this speaks to the high valuation apartment properties are commanding today which is good for essex and the net asset value of the company as for new preferred equity investments we have a healthy pipeline of accretive deals and we are still on track to achieve our original guidance of 100 million to 150 million in the second half of the year as a reminder our original guidance assumed new investment would match redemptions during the year however the timing mismatch between the higher level of early redemptions coupled with funding of new investments expected later this year has led to an approximate 0 10 per share drag on our ffo for the year moving to the balance sheet we remain in a strong financial position due to refinancing over 1 3 of our debt over the past year and a half taking advantage of the low interest rate environment to reduce our weighted average rate by 70 basis points to 3 1 and lengthening our maturity profile by an additional two years we currently have only 7 of our debt maturing through the end of 2023 given our laddered maturity schedule limited near term funding needs and ample liquidity we are in a strong position to take advantage of opportunities as they arise this concludes my prepared remarks i will now turn the call back to the operator for questions questions and answers operator thank you ladies and gentlemen at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session our first question comes from the line of nick joseph with citi please proceed with your question nick joseph citi analyst thanks maybe just starting to follow up on the comments you just made on the preferred equity and the mezz loan in terms of the pipeline today are you seeing any compression on yields or expected returns or any changes to the competition there adam w berry executive vice president and chief investment officer hey this is adam to answer your question yes we re seeing compression on cap rates we re seeing it s a much more competitive market now with proceeds going well above where we re typically comfortable and rates going significantly below where we ve been in the market so to some yeah well we are seeing the absolute compression on valuations nick joseph citi analyst thanks and then in terms of the early redemptions that you ve seen i mean is there a risk of further early redemptions that could at least create an air pocket on the earnings side barb m pak executive vice president and chief financial officer hi nick this is barb at this point i think we factor that all in based on what we know today and probably almost in august so i think we factored that into the current guidance so i m not expecting any more redemptions at this point for the rest of the year nick joseph citi analyst thanks operator our next question comes from the line of rich hill with morgan stanley please proceed with your question rich hill morgan stanley analyst hey good morning guys i wanted to just come back to sort of trends that you re seeing in your markets and i appreciate all the color and commentary you gave us but i m hoping you can compare and contrast what you re seeing in your market specifically versus maybe what someone typically thinks about in san francisco los angeles the broader west coast urban markets so specifically are you seeing people still continue to migrate in are you seeing people migrate out what are those trends in your markets that give you confidence relative to maybe some of the urban market trends michael j schall president and chief executive officer hi rich this is mike i think i ll handle that one and others may want to comment as well but i think we feel really very good about what s happening here noted in my comments that were fully recovered with respect to market rents versus pre pandemic levels while only recovered about half the job so far so i think that s a powerful place to start and as we look around the west coast we feel great about what s happening and we expect good times to continue that consumer is super optimistic they ve saved money via covid versus covid by not traveling and a variety of other things the millennials are forming households and there is a lot of hiring here on the west coast so that s why we talked about the top 10 tech companies and how many open positions they have they come a long way in the past year after what we perceive is them pulling back amid covid on their expansion plans i think that they are now turning that corner have turned that corner hiring more people pursuing things that they put on hold a year ago and so everything feels like it s it s in good order at this point in time as you go to the cities the main driver of job growth at this point in time has been the recovery of all the industries that have been so dramatic so dramatically affected a year ago including the leisure hospitality restaurants filming in southern california etc and as we look at the world we re looking at whether we believe these industries are poised for future growth and we think absolutely they are we think that we re in affluent areas affluent areas demand services you re starting to see those services to come back in terms of restaurants and variety of other areas and so we see this turning around nicely and again i wouldn t have expected to be fully back with respect to brands at a time when we ve only recovered about half the jobs that we lost makes sense rich hill morgan stanley analyst yeah it makes perfect sense i will just wait and see if anyone else is going to follow up that s perfect mike as we look forward and at the risk of asking you to guide which i m not we had this obviously pretty significant trough that came late last year and earlier this year is it sort of reasonable to think that 2022 will be the mirror image of that and then maybe we can we may be even continue to push rents above a normal trend over the medium term michael j schall president and chief executive officer it s a good question and barb will look at me very straightly if we start talking about 22 at this point in time so and you know how we are we tend to be pretty careful in terms of guidance and so we don t want to go too far out there but i would say that i would expect certainly the return to office to be a good thing for the downtown locations because most of the top 10 tech companies or most of tech companies in general have announced a hybrid type of approach which means that people are going to have to be closer to the offices to show up let s say plus or minus three times per week as a result of that the people that moved to the hinterland the most suburban parts of our portfolio probably you re going to need to come back and i think about ventura i don t want to pick on ventura because you said great but it s a long way on a commute pattern from ventura into where the jobs are in la and i don t think people are either going to want to do that three times a week so i think that kind of frames the dynamics those that had a year given the pandemic to make a different choice about where to live i think will likely make a different choice going forward now that there is more clarity about what the company is going to do with respect to their work from home or return to office programs rich hill morgan stanley analyst okay barb m pak executive vice president and chief financial officer the only other thing i would add is leases we re signing today we will have half a impact to the rent this year to our rent roll and that will carry forward into next year too i mean look as angela mentioned we had a strong july and so that is going to only affect part of this year s numbers rich hill morgan stanley analyst yep i got it thank you guys i m not sure that s entirely what i wanted but i appreciate the response thank you michael j schall president and chief executive officer sorry operator our next question comes from the line of joshua dennerlein with bank of america please proceed with your question joshua dennerlein bank of america analyst hey guys hope you re all doing well just kind of curious what your mark to market is in your portfolio and maybe if you have it by region like seattle northern california and southern california barb m pak executive vice president and chief financial officer are you talking about wesley e commerce joshua dennerlein bank of america analyst yeah wesley sorry barb m pak executive vice president and chief financial officer no that s alright well in terms of the loss lease we actually are in a much better position and at a level even better than pre covid so if we look at july loss of lease for the essex portfolio it s now at 7 4 and so and that of course varies cro at a highest at about 12 southern california in the middle of the pack at about 8 and northern california at the lower side as well as 3 5 joshua dennerlein bank of america analyst okay awesome and in your guidance range are you assuming as far as like a recovery for the rest of the year and and rate for the northern california market michael j schall president and chief executive officer i ll start the second half of the year as each we have to turn leases in order to impact our same store our revenue and so as you get toward the end becomes less relevant and more relevant obviously next year so take a transaction in october you only have three months of that new lease in 2021 the rest is going to be in 2022 so there is an inherent lagging concept with respect to what s going on with market rents which angela just talk about versus how it shows up on the income statement so i think that s important in terms of just look at that market rents we tried to provide a little bit of color on that and with respect to s 17 what we re trying to to get out that overall our economic rent growth on s 17 is at minus 0 9 and that s 1 12th of every month throughout the year so january 2021 versus january 2020 plus february through the year divided by 12 is what that number represents so we start of the year at a rate in the minus 9 to minus 10 range and that implies to get the 0 9 minus 0 9 on s 17 that the fourth quarter will be plus 6 and that does not anticipate a lot of rent growth between now and then which is pretty typical we typically hit the peak of market rents in july at the end of the peak leasing season and then it flattens out for the rest of the year so that s what s assumed in those numbers joshua dennerlein bank of america analyst great thanks for the time michael j schall president and chief executive officer thank you operator our question comes from the line of austin wurschmidt with keybanc please proceed with your question austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst great thanks guys it seems possible that your markets could experience an extended leasing season it s certainly come up on other calls and some seem pretty optimistic about the prospects but clearly as you identified there are some risk to take into consideration so just wondering kind of how you went about your back half guidance and did you assume typical seasonality or sort of that another leg up in demand in the late summer early fall timeframe michael j schall president and chief executive officer yeah this is mike and i agree with you we did not we assume more or less the typical trend with respect to market rent so kind of peaking in july and not a lot of growth for the rest of the year if as we think about it however there are some things that are different for example will the tech companies continue hiring normally what happens is hiring tails off at the end of the year companies get business plans at the toward the third and fourth quarter and then they start implementing them in the first quarter that s what really drives the peak leasing season so the question here is will companies continue hiring at a higher level given covid than they have in the past i think there is a very good chance that that could happen also this work from home and return to office concept could have an impact on that as well if more people are moving back into the more urban areas from the people that were displaced as california and washington we re shutting down a year ago if those people continue to come back late later this year that could possibly push rents higher in the second part of the year so we ve again assumed based on our experience and what typically happens in normal curve with respect to rents but there are some things that are different here and so we could end up with being surprised with the positive side austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst okay that s very helpful and then angela i think you mentioned that you re starting the restarting the redevelopment program could you give us kind of the scale of that or the annual run rate and then maybe offer up some additional details on sort of the economics that would be really helpful angela l kleiman senior executive vice president and chief operating officer sure austin we normally pre covid our run rate was about in terms of units about 4 000 units a year and what we did was scaled back significantly last year so second half of last year we only renovated about 600 little 600 units 650 units so the target the restart for the second half of this year is to double that so to achieve close to 1300 units this year we are looking at a couple of large developments for future for next year that will have greater opportunities but in terms of just the return on investments we re actually looking at ranges pretty unconsistent with pre covid levels and so while cost has gone up but rents have gone up as well concurrently so we think we re in a pretty good spot austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst and what are those numbers on the economics angela l kleiman senior executive vice president and chief operating officer they tend to range depending on the asset and the scope and the market but i ll give you a range that might be a little bit better than a hard number they tend to range stay in the high single digits to the high double digits so it s a pretty wide range austin wurschmidt keybanc capital markets analyst got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of amanda sweitzer with robert w baird please proceed with your question amanda sweitzer robert w baird analyst thanks good morning following up on some of your comments on ramping up your development spending can you just provide an update on areas you re targeting for this potential product projects as well as underwritten yields you think you could achieve adam w berry executive vice president and chief investment officer hey amanda this is adam you referring to redevelopment or development amanda sweitzer robert w baird analyst i thought you mentioned ramping up development along with acquisitions earlier in the call but i could be mistaken adam w berry executive vice president and chief investment officer okay yeah i m happy to take that one so on development yeah given where our stock is trading and given some opportunities that we re seeing out there now where we can make sense of accretive transactions we are definitely looking at ramping up the development pipeline i d say our main areas of focus would be primarily northern california seattle though i see is probably the two best markets in that respect but we re looking throughout our portfolio and throughout our footprint for sort of amanda sweitzer robert w baird analyst and then any change in terms of underwritten yield do you think you could achieve on those projects versus pre covid levels adam w berry executive vice president and chief investment officer so yeah good question so what we re seeing we ve underwritten several dozen deals over the last few months the deals that we see going down primarily cap rates have definitely compressed so on the development side we re seeing on trended grants return on cost of about 4 to 4 25 basically so it s still a gap between where existing deals are trading which are on 3 25 to 3 5 we re going to look at numbers higher than that we have not we wouldn t transact at call to development yield but we re going to we would be looking at the 4 5 to high fours amanda sweitzer robert w baird analyst thanks i appreciate the time operator our next question comes from the line of rich anderson with smbc please proceed with your question richard anderson smbc analyst thanks good morning everybody so i m interested in this 17 supplemental or s 17 i should say the migration trends that you referenced in your prepared remarks is that everything or is it predominantly kind of close in like monterrey sacramento type of net migration or in migration and does it net out people that are leaving california entirely is this the full number number one and number 2 what do you think about this 18 is this like a sort of a knee jerk response to working remotely but closer to the office in that probably this is peaking out at this time and it starts to come back down what s the ceiling on this graph do you think barb m pak executive vice president and chief financial officer all right this is barb yeah 17 1 the 18 is a net number if you look back a year ago we did have out migration and that s what s showing in the negative 8 and now we have people moving back and they re really coming from sacramento and some of the outer lying areas within california but we re also noticing people moving in from college town so people recent college grads are coming here for jobs and it s really geographically dispersed i mean there is no discernible pattern from where they re coming from it s kind of all over and we do think that it does speak to the strength of our markets and people coming back and returning after the services have reopened and the economy has reopened now we re seeing the people return so we think it s a good sign and a good leading indicator you should note that this seattle in our portfolio looks similar as well we re seeing a big in migration in seattle as well so we didn t show it here but it s bay area and seattle both have a similar chart where there is a big influx and i think you re seeing it in the rent growth that angela spoke to and san fran being up 11 in the cbd and and the norcal and some of the other suburban markets in norcal having bigger sequential rent growth more recently is partly due to this in migration michael j schall president and chief executive officer rich that kind of make a broader comment and i would say the broader comment is that the migration out of the west coast our view was largely driven by business is being shut down and putting people in the position of not having a paycheck and effectively forcing them to move to somewhere else and i know that the sort of it doesn t fit the narrative the narrative is that all these people wanted to leave california i think the reality is completely different from that and therefore i go back to my basic comment which is do we feel comfortable with the businesses that are here and with job growth going forward and when you look at the components of that ok the hotels are now mostly open here on the west coast the restaurants are opening and but we were still at 50 of capacity a month or two ago so we open completely on june 15 but that process has been relatively slow and i think that s why job growth has lagged the u s as we ve come out of the pandemic and but i guess the key point here is most of the migration that occurred was not voluntary migration it was caused by shutting down businesses and then if you look at the flip side of that are those business is likely to reopen given covid is mostly behind us and we feel 100 absolutely convinced that that will occur and so when we look we have some more broader information on migration in general and a lot of the same things that we talked about a year or two ago are still in place the inflows into our markets tend to be the high cost east coast metros and the outflows tend to be into lower cost western areas so those trends really haven t changed all that much but barb this s 17 1 is trying to address specifically the cadence of what s coming in what s going out and to your point yes everything of course everything is in there here to try to push a narrative that is not reality because if we do that we re going to shoot ourselves on the foot so there is no evidence i think of essex trying to be overly optimistic and so we re trying to communicate what s really happening out there and what we re really seen richard anderson smbc analyst it wasn t implying that i just you mentioned sort of near in areas and michael just want to make sure i was looking at the same thing so the second question 15 20 years ago mike schall and keith guericke were heroes with 10 plus growth in california was the place to be now if you at that point made some investments in the sunbelt you d be a hero so the tortuous past at least for now but i assume you re a reversion of the mean is your mind that certainly it sounds like what you re saying and do you see now as a particularly interesting time to be investing in your markets for all the reason you just described but also is particularly special because of what s happened outside of california and washington and what you think might come back and that that will be sort of a narrowing of the performance gap over the next several years michael j schall president and chief executive officer yeah hey it s great question rich and our board is pretty focused on this geographic diversity issue and some of the challenges that we ve had more recently with respect to regulation and other things but we don t want to get too far away from sort of this longer term pattern because we it isn t like we re going to grow every year the same conditions change but we remain focused in our analysis on which areas have the highest caters of rent growth over time and it may surprise you because you can say the west coast is dropped off of that more recently yes but if you look back let s say 15 years because i have these numbers right out of our strategic plan in front of us seattle led all the major markets bond with a 5 6 15 year rent growth cagr from 2014 to 2019 so to the pre covid level and northern california was pretty close to that and we start going down the list and certainly boston and miami are pretty attractive in that respect to as northern new jersey but then there are a lot of markets that really have fallen well below that and so our whole thesis here has been let s try to identify the things that promote long term rent growth and let s invest in those markets and we can as you know we ve looked at some things on the east coast before and we ll continue doing that but i guess as we think about english let me just make a simple comparison let s compare san jose with austin and you know there are series of about the same size same population austin has about 20 000 multifamily units in construction where san jose has about 8 000 we also don t produce very much housing or for sale housing in san jose and the median price is well over 1 million so as an apartment owner we look at that and say are we better off being in san jose or in austin and we conclude that it is better to be in san jose i mean austin has to get extraordinary amounts of growth over and above san jose which of course is driven by the tech companies which are doing really well and they hire a lot of people so i guess i would say the bloom is not off the west coast yes we grew really fast from 2011 through 2016 when by the way we had job growth in the 4 to 5 range on the west coast and then it slowed down because of affordability issue because you can t have rents grow twice as fast as incomes over long periods of time without creating affordability issue so there is a long term approach to the business and i think that that making vast portfolio decisions based on with all the unique circumstances in covid would be misguided richard anderson smbc analyst really great color thanks mike appreciate everybody michael j schall president and chief executive officer thanks rich operator our next question comes from the line of neil malkin with capital one securities please proceed with your question neil malkin capital one securities analyst hi everyone good morning to you just first mike and it seems like you a lot of your prepared comments the risks of covid or the delta variant throwing a wrench into the recovery seemed like maybe i m understanding wrong like a lower or i mean that you re really not maybe waiting a lot and i guess my question on that part is are you have you thought about the delta variance how it s spreading a lot quicker i think i ve just seen studies that say like vaccinated people can also get it as well like as easily as nonvaccinated and the markets that you re in most likely to reach reshutdown or reimplement restrictions if cases rise hospitalizations rise etc so given that s likely to happen as the fall what kind of waiting do you kind of give to that notion of a potential hiccup from reimposed restrictions michael j schall president and chief executive officer yeah it s a good question and an important question and i guess i would say unfortunately we have no way to really figure out what covid might do going forward and but we re definitely aware of the risks one thing that i think is a little bit different in california clearly we ve got population densities that are pretty high and so the risk of covid is perhaps greater given that and i think the government are actually sort of a very good job here of trying to promote vaccination rates in the essex markets and i think our vaccination rates are pretty high relative to the rest of the world so the information i have is that the people with at least one shot that are 12 years and older we re in california washington about 82 vaccinated versus 67 for the us so i think that what s happened here as we ve tried to the government has tried to react to that risk by really pushing the vaccination rate and they ve done a very good job of that so i think that lowers our exposure to some extent but no doubt areas with high population density have a different covid risk than some of the other areas and in this case i think it s been dealt with effectively neil malkin capital one securities analyst okay so that s really helpful stat thank you for that other one for me is your previous comment you talked about not making i guess rash decisions or thinking about things on a historic level and i guess if you look at two large peers you would like to say names but coastal players have recently announced pretty significant capital plans in raleigh charlotte atlanta dallas austin and i would imagine they have boards and a lot of stakeholders that they probably consulted with before they allocate a lot of capital so kind of with that being said does that i mean you give credit for that at all i mean does that does it make you think maybe a little bit more about that i mean you referenced that permitting is down in your markets and you maybe that is like a good thing maybe that s like a bad thing of people are focusing their growth prospects and capital elsewhere michael j schall president and chief executive officer yeah it s a good question and very valid this is why we spend so much time in our prepared remarks talking about on with the top 10 tech companies we created that index so that we could keep our eye on where are the open positions for the top 10 tech companies are they moving more to some of these other locations and if so what do we do about it so i didn t mean to imply actually that we re so focused on 15 year tankers of rent growth so definitely the historical information is important but we re trying to supplement that in a hundred different ways with a ton of data sources that are either confirming or raising questions about what the future looks like that s why you re angela was talking about how much office construction if you re going to build office buildings presumably there re going to be employees in there and we re going to need to build apartments to house those employees i mean these are all indicators of what s happening in the future keeping our eye on the top 10 tech companies and their hiring trends again both within california and outside of california super important in that regard again i go back to the industries what are the driving industries and what are the industries and sort of drive the entire machine we can it s certainly not the hospitality and the restaurant workers that are driving it they are really the result of affluent wealthy areas demand ill services and guess what they pay a lot more than in other places of the country because of that and so i think what s happening here is we re draw in the process of all those people that were just placed from shutting down the restaurants and other services we re going to need to draw them back into the area but i think that given the demand for those services and given the wealth it is been created here by the tech community by motion pictures in southern california and other people that want to live near a beach let s say those services are in demand and they re going to come back at some it will take a little bit of time perhaps to do that but again we re trying to say ok let s stay focused on what are the drivers of the economy here and again as i look at it and hopefully everyone will agree tax not going away or hasn t gone away certainly all the information that we ve given out with respect to the tech companies over time confirms the thesis that they re here they re not going away they continue to invest in our markets motion pictures in southern california you can t shoot film films where you require 50 100 people on a set during covid completely shut down demand for content not going away anytime soon therefore there is a very good chance that is going to resume and i can go on beyond that but i think that that s a point if the drivers are intact the things that follow the demand for services restaurants etc will follow and the thesis of the company in terms of job growth remains intact and then if you don t produce enough housing supply i review that as a good thing neil malkin capital one securities analyst okay well i really appreciate it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from alexander goldfarb with piper sandler please proceed with your question alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst hey good morning so mike two questions first the data on s 17 that is superb so if like if we were out in the bay area like a month ago and saw san francisco sort of empty are you seeing that with this 18 increase that now like san francisco would be active and all of the apartment reits that have reported this quarter who have all shown the san francisco to be the weak link that will you re saying that we will see that changed substantially in the next few quarters michael j schall president and chief executive officer alex so you re referring to be this move it back to the inner bay area portfolio on 17 1 alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst yeah michael j schall president and chief executive officer well i would say that the trend has reversed and move it back to the bay area has begun i would yeah i caveat that i think most of that is the these service businesses restaurants and leisure hospitality is the leader in terms of jobs coming back that was the area that was most severely disconnected during the pandemic but and then we have coming out us in the not too distant future the tech companies and the return to office program so i think if that continues that trend and again there are a lot of restaurants that converted to take out only mode i think we ll go back to a more normal type of situation where those restaurant workers continue to come back as well so yeah i think it s it s met being not as fast as we want to again i go back to the initial premise which is we ve gotten all the rent there all the rents back to where they were pre covid with half the employment i think that s a pretty powerful statement alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst okay if i m just trying i guess mike if you look at like manhattan i know you guys are not in new york city but the city came back a lot quicker than many expected even though work from home only whatever percent of buildings have people in them but city rents and the occupancy rates have rebounded strongly whereas san francisco and seattle downtown respectively we re still lagging so i guess i m curious if your view is that within a few quarters we will see the downtown of san francisco and downtown of seattle rebound strongly like we ve seen in new york based on what you guys are showing in this attachment s 17 michael j schall president and chief executive officer yeah it s a good question alex so new york if you look at trailing three month of job growth in new york it was 10 2 san francisco was 5 2 and san jose was 5 2 so you have a pretty dramatic underperformance with respect to overall job growth so i attribute that to again the west coast needing to open up yet we were still well into june at like 50 of capacity in restaurants and that type of thing whereas i m assuming that new york i don t know exactly what they did but it is something to cause a fairly dramatic difference in terms of their resurgence and employment that hasn t happened yet on the west coast i think it s coming but we re just a little bit slower than some of the other metros including new york alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst okay and then the second question barb on the guidance you said that because of the mismatch in terms of accelerated debt and preferred equity redemptions versus what you guys can put out there is about a 0 10 drag so is that 0 10 only in nareit ffo but not in company ffo or is it in both barb m pak executive vice president and chief financial officer this is ed could the prepayment penalties are fees that we receive this year about 7 5 million those are only internal also non core ffo but what i m referring to is just a timing issue we ve been redeemed gotten money back early so we don t have any of the interest income from those investments and we haven t put any money back to work and so that s the 0 10 that i m referring to michael j schall president and chief executive officer we re looking at since that prepayment penalty is just really compensated us for having our money outstanding for a certain period of time i m advocating with barb to change out so that it s not a non core item because we it s really we have a minimum earned preferred return and unfortunately it s showing up in the non core category rather than core alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst yeah that mike that was going to be my point you guys are very productive on this and whether you get paid out over time or you get it redeemed early but they pay up and pay a penalty for that that is core part of your business so that was my question is why you would exclude the positives that come from this platform and i mean it sounds like you guys are having that internal debate but i mean you re successful at it and no point and not really showcasing the earnings potential there barb m pak executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it s where we have looked at it we have a sense of follow gaap accounting rules and so it s more complicated than it appears on the surface but yes there is an internal debate internally but what we booked year to date has all been noncore for the prepayment alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst okay listen thank you michael j schall president and chief executive officer thanks alex operator our next question comes from the line of john kim with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question john kim bmo capital markets analyst thank you regarding northern california and the recovery i think angela mentioned in the prepared remarks that july effective rents are still 8 below pre covid levels and i m not sure if that was a market rent concept or for essex but i was wondering if you re going against easier comps given you were more aggressive on concessions beginning in the third quarter last year and if the recovery could be faster than we think michael j schall president and chief executive officer yeah i ll let angela to comment on the number for san jose but i would say what s happened here is and we had colors on previous calls that have said hey with negative job growth how are you able to maintain high levels of occupancy in the cities and obviously a great question and the answer is that was of course that we drew people because the price point was lower we drew people from other places into some of the better locations so they improve their location given lower rents and so now you look at this equation we re 96 occupied people starting to come back and there is no availability and therefore market rents are doing what they re doing so i think a lot of this is really driven by our strategy during the pandemic and now it will be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of years because market with market rents now back to where they were pre pandemic level you have what is the movement within the portfolio yield both in and out of those locations that have much higher rents so in the case of san jose san francisco and oakland there is still substantially below the prior rent so there s still reason to believe that those the people that moved in given lower rents will stay but that may uncouple over the next several years and so was that 8 figure that angela quoted was that for essex or the market overall angela l kleiman senior executive vice president and chief operating officer that was for essex john kim bmo capital markets analyst okay mike you mentioned cap rates in your markets are low to mid 3 which sounds like it s compressed about 50 basis points at least from last quarter can you comment on the assumptions that you think the market is placing now that s changed whether it s rental growth or exit cap rate and whether or not you agree with those assumptions or i believe the rationale michael j schall president and chief executive officer i ll start with the comment and the comparison in the last quarter and then give back to adam to talk about cap rates more generally but i think last quarter what we said was in some of the hard hit areas that buyers will performing some rent recovery so it probably wasn t a whole 50 basis point reduction it was really that they were using really the current net effective rents they were assuming a bit higher rent level so that reconciles part of that but adam you want to talk about cap rates in general adam w berry executive vice president and chief investment officer yes sure so i think the general assumption that buyers are making is that there will be a full recovery and by that i mean with rents greater than pre pandemic levels and we re already seeing those rents that we ve already talked about during the call so it s in the low threes i think pretty robust rent growth over the next few years and then probably knowing out is what i is the various people i ve talked to that with our modeling and then non exit caps i think this is as aggressive as ever so i don t think there s much assumption that there is a big expansion on the exit side so it underwriting has has definitely gotten more aggressive john kim bmo capital markets analyst is there a big difference between your markets or urban versus suburban adam w berry executive vice president and chief investment officer yeah good question so going kind of north to south seattle we ve seen we ve actually seen a pretty big pickup in transactional volume and that s probably among the most aggressive markets that we re seeing in the cbds on kind of current net effective rents we re seeing high twos to low threes and in the markets that really just too much of a hit on rents we re seeing those like maybe in the 3 25 to 3 5 range and that is much more suburban outer markets and then going down very little in northern california is traded so that the hard to really opine there but it s in that probably low threes range and then down to san diego orange county those markets performed better from a rental aspects so those cap rates on current net effective aren t quite as low as what we ve seen in those harder hit markets so it s probably closer to that 3 4 3 5 kind of range and very little in la traded as well so it s down in the kind of low threes but there is very few data points thanks for the color operator our next question comes from the line of brad heffern with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question brad heffern rbc capital markets analyst hey everyone on the federal funds i think you mentioned in the prepared comments that there was a negligible amount received to date and that there really isn t much in the guide either i was curious if you had any figures around maybe what you have applications out for some sort of risk assessment of what you might receive on that angela l kleiman senior executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah hi its angela here so out of i think we reported that we have about 55 million of delinquencies out there and we ve applied for about 18 million and to date we ve received 4 million of it so about 20 some percent recovery rate as far as we can tell it s really more of a slow going because california just has a more complicated and slower reimbursement process so in our view the 18 million we don t view that 18 million as having significant risk from that perspective the reason we didn t bake it into our guidance for this year is really the timing is the question and just given that the rate of the reimbursement has just been much slower so that s really the key driver of why it s now in this year s guidance brad heffern rbc capital markets analyst okay got it and that 4 million i assume that s largely been this month just given you said there wasn t in the sort of negligible in the first half is that right angela l kleiman senior executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah yeah for the most part of this month brad heffern rbc capital markets analyst okay got it and then just one administrative sort of one if i could in the press release there was a 6 3 blended rate number for july but then in the commentary i heard a 4 7 number i just wanted to verify what those two things we re talking about angela l kleiman senior executive vice president and chief operating officer oh sure so the 4 7 is a sequential month to month so what i was trying to do is provide a real time picture of what s happening in our markets so comparing july to june of this month it s already up sequentially 4 7 on a net effective basis and so what s in our supplement they blended lease rate is a year over year so that compares july of this year to july of last year brad heffern rbc capital markets analyst okay perfect thank you operator our next question comes from the line of alex kalmus zelman and associates please proceed with your question alexander kalmus zelman and associates analyst hi thank you for taking the question looking at your southern california occupancy is quite high and we ve heard a lot this quarter from others that the delinquencies are in their portfolios or sort of concentrated in this part of the country so i m just curious what would happen if once the moratoriums are up does that affect the occupancy levels on a physical basis in your mind or how do you see that playing out there michael j schall president and chief executive officer yeah this is mike it s a good question yes we agree with the others that southern california and really specifically los angeles is a big part of the delinquency the largest part of the delinquency and therefore there is some question about what might happen but it s not a huge percentage and we expect to work with our residents to the extent we can and so i don t think it will have a huge impact on occupancy overall so but it remains to be seen because we can t envision exactly what that scenario is going to look like and so we but it s just not enough i think to really severely impact us alexander kalmus zelman and associates analyst got it thank you very much and just thinking about the regulations on your rent increases that are in place when you re sort of internally discussing the difference between holding occupancy or pushing rate is there any momentum to say you d rather keep the base rates pretty high to then expand a little more there and maybe lose a little occupancy as a sacrifice or is still hold occupancy as a primary driver michael j schall president and chief executive officer it s different by in each region and so there is a 1 000 different pieces of that equation because there s been so much movement in rent and so we re going to so the answer is going to very varied by region and so it s difficult to generalize throughout the portfolio but we think that we will be able to work with residents we ve tried to do that in the past that will continue going on in the future and certainly with respect to any of the delinquency that s not covered by some of these programs to make good on the covid related delinquencies we will try to work with our residents that we as we have in the past again it s a little bit difficult to try to figure out exactly what that means from different areas because sets of regulations and a variety of different places from emergency orders to stay rent control and the like and so it s sort of a case by case basis it s difficult to generalize alexander kalmus zelman and associates analyst okay no problem thanks for the color there michael j schall president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john pawlowski with green street advisors please proceed with your question john pawlowski green street advisors analyst thanks for keeping the call going adam i appreciate on the cap rate commentary i m trying to square there is really low cap rates to the commentary about ramping or being more positive on external growth because from the cap rates quoted feels like you guys are trading at nav discount so can you maybe just help square the external growth appetite and the prevailing private market pricing adam w berry executive vice president and chief investment officer sure yeah i mean you hit the nail on the head it s the reason why we haven t been super active on the external growth side but these are the most of the transactions that have gone down and have not been accretive and your point from an nav standpoint not accretive as well we re seeing a few more opportunities out there that will fit and our stock is reasonably up although still i d say when you re looking at the low threes that s still that puts us in the trading below nav range so we are underwriting everything being more aggressive where we feel like we can make some make a difference on growth accretion as well as ffo but i guess you you know that that s why we haven t done much so far michael j schall president and chief executive officer john i would add to that this is mike obviously i would add that we re closer now than we were 30 year or 45 days ago somewhere we re getting close i mean debt rates have come down quite substantially as you know and so there at least is a hope that we will be more active look at it a lot of deals adams talked about a lot of deals and so we re pricing things out and trying to make make the numbers work and again we re going to remain disciplined to nav of the company versus what we re seeing out there in the transaction area we picked up the fundamental behind the success of the company over long periods of time john pawlowski green street advisors analyst okay now understood things are moving quickly maybe just at a more mike pace up prevailing private market pricing today if you had to double down on the market you had to exit the market what are the kind of the top and bottom fix michael j schall president and chief executive officer yeah i ll let adam deal with that one adam w berry executive vice president and chief investment officer good question yeah thanks john so double down i m a big fan of seattle in general i mean i would say east side especially given the jobs picture there even though supply is slightly elevated i think the jobs picture there is significant and it s a lot of tailwinds to exit a market you have all of our markets but maybe hamid so we re definitely interested in actually getting better that s one property now i joke yes ventura has had a pretty good run here as of late and it continues to do fine but again if we had to pick a market but like i said we we are focused on our entire footprint and so we ll will go in where we see opportunities john pawlowski green street advisors analyst all right thanks so much michael j schall president and chief executive officer thanks john operator there are no other questions in the queue i d like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks michael j schall president and chief executive officer okay very good thank you doug appreciate that and i want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today i appreciate your time and we know we covered a lot of ground if there are any follow up

for joining us i hope everyone on the call is safe and well our long term strategic focus on our consumers digital and dtc capabilities and product and design innovation especially in performance categories is fueling robust demand for our market leading brands earlier this morning we reported strong financial results for the second quarter that significantly exceeded 2020 and our expectations and also easily beat 2019 revenue was approximately 632 million a record high for q2 representing growth of 81 versus 2020 and a double digit increase compared to 2019 the wolverine michigan group s revenue was up 63 year over year and the wolverine boston group s revenue was up 111 both groups were up double digits compared to 2019 adjusted earnings per share for the company was 0 67 our order backlog remains at historically high levels and momentum in the business continues to accelerate despite the macro covid related supply chain headwinds facing our industry and many others certainly our proactive approach to combat these headwinds has been very effective and is also reflected in our strong q2 results given the company s excellent performance and the trends in the business we have again raised our outlook for fiscal 2021 and now expect revenue in a range that is 150 million higher than we anticipated in our original february guidance delivering meaningful growth over 2019 at both the high and low ends of the range our brand portfolio strategy and international distribution base is also fueling accelerated momentum as the company is not dependent on any single geographic region consumer group or distribution channel we have positioned our consumers at the heart of our strategy and that has changed the nature of our company with approximately 2 3 of our brand revenue now positioned in performance product categories like hiking running and work categories that are tightly aligned with today s consumer trends at the same time the company has developed a strong dtc focused global distribution model year to date our dtc e commerce business has more than doubled in revenue relative to 2019 and our dtc stores are up nearly 20 versus 2019 together with the dtc channels operated by our distributor partners around the world about 1 3 of our global revenue is now generated through direct consumer dialogue and interactions enabling enhanced brand shopping experiences a wealth of direct consumer insights and data in a more efficient business model we see this accelerated momentum continuing for the foreseeable future while consumer lifestyle changes related to the covid pandemic have significantly bolstered demand for performance product categories the underlying trends are long term in nature existing prior to the impact of the pandemic and are expected by industry and consumer trend experts to persist consumers have become increasingly focused on health and wellness over the last several years and running hiking and the outdoors have served

new runners say they plan to continue running in the future participation in the outdoors and hiking in particular has also increased every year during the same time frame up by a high single digit cagr even before last year s 16 spike adding nearly 21 million new hikers in the u s alone this spring and summer national parks are shattering attendance records more people are continuing to get

up emea more than doubled in q2 and presents a meaningful growth opportunity in both performance and lifestyle fueled by the saucony originals italian product design and marketing hub saucony s runway for growth remains significant in q2 our work business accounted for nearly 20 of total revenue and continued to deliver strong growth with wolverine the leader in the u s work boot category up over 70 cat footwear up nearly 50 and with strong contributions from our smaller brands as blake indicated we expect consistent strong growth in the work category with the continued growth of merrell saucony wolverine and our other work brands our performance business almost doubled versus 2020 an increase of nearly 40 over 2019 the sperry brand rebounded year over year in q2 with triple digit growth the brand s dtc business was up nearly 50 in the quarter driven by the excellent performance of sperry stores the brand s full price business continues to perform well with gross margin expanding well over 400 basis points in the quarter sperry s new float collection of fun and affordable injected version of the boat shoe vaulted into the brand s top selling styles expanding price tiers for the brand and reaching a younger consumer the boat category has shown positive growth particularly in men s and sperry gained market share in this key category from a fashion standpoint there are clear indications that we are at the forefront of a boat shoe trend sneakers was the brand s largest category and biggest growth driver in q2 up more than 2 5 times over last year driven by new collections like salt and existing franchises refreshed with trend right materials and colors moving forward sperry anticipated accelerated growth in its performance active and athleisure business in spring 22 the brand will launch its new sperry sport collection which responds to macro consumer trends with more trend right performance based products in the coming months sperry plans to build on our energy created by recent collaborations with rowing blazers netflix s other banks and good humor and popsicle ice cream and product capsules with john legend and rebecca minkoff the brand also intends to leverage the easy on off trend with the launch of the new moc sider and the cozy float collection extending the success of the float franchise into the fall winter season we expect continued strong year over year growth from sperry in the back half of the year finally during the second quarter our consolidated dtc business grew in the high teens compared to 2020 up nearly 70 versus 2019 stores grew up almost 20 compared to 2019 up significantly versus last year s lockdown hampered business e commerce grew almost 100 over 2019 and was essentially flat to last year s record quarter looking at the back half of the year the product lines are very strong across the brand portfolio which will also drive growth in the digital channel we believe the strong product coupled with improved merchandising practices and healthier inventory positions will drive growth in the second half as well as next year we will continue to invest in digital and ai to improve site experience and drive conversion gains in the next couple of months we will launch our first mobile app with merrell as well we have pivoted to a more dynamic e commerce development model to enable faster implementation of enhancements and new capabilities which will also help us extend improved functionalities to our international sites more quickly e commerce has more than doubled 2019 revenue year to date although consumers have started to shift some of their purchasing back to stores as markets reopen our dtc e commerce business and the online business of our wholesale customers still represented almost half of our revenue in the u s i m now going to hand it off to mike to review the second quarter financial results and our increased 2021 outlook in more detail mike michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer thanks brendan and thanks to all of you for joining us let me start by reviewing the company s second quarter financial performance and some of the key drivers of our over delivery and then i will cover our improved outlook for 2021 second quarter revenue of approximately 632 million represents growth of 81 compared to the prior year while merrell saucony and sperry were the strongest performers nearly all brands in the portfolio delivered substantial growth all regions grew nicely in the quarter with the u s and emea meaningfully beating expectations adjusted gross margin of 44 5 improved 230 basis points versus the prior year due to a favorable product mix and higher average selling prices merrell and saucony both easily exceeded gross margin expectations in the quarter another indication of their strength in the marketplace adjusted selling general and administrative expenses of 201 8 million or 72 million more than last year and 35 million more than 2019 primarily due to increased revenue volume increased marketing investment and more normalized incentive compensation costs most major expenses levered better than expected as a percent of revenue including our increase in marketing investment adjusted operating margin was 12 6 for q2 an improvement of 750 basis points over last year and 150 basis points versus 2019 very strong leverage on the company s revenue growth resulting from gross margin expansion and healthy operating expense management adjusted diluted earnings per share were 0 67 compared to 0 08 in the prior year reported diluted earnings per share were 0 53 versus a loss per share of 0 02 last year and reflect specific covid related costs and certain litigation defense costs in both periods let me now shift to the balance sheet at the end of the quarter inventory was down approximately 14 compared to last year a nice improvement compared to the 21 decline at the end of q1 our inventory position continues to strengthen as we make some progress against the supply chain headwinds impacting the broader industry in q2 we generated 25 4 million of cash flow from operating activities the company finished the quarter with 306 million less debt compared to the prior year and total liquidity of approximately 1 1 billion including 346 million of cash on hand and nearly 800 million of revolver capacity our bank defined leverage ratio continued to improve ending the quarter at a low 1 2 times the company s balance sheet is extremely healthy i will now provide an update on our outlook for 2021 the company outperformed in q2 and the trends in our business are very strong our order book remains at historically high levels and continues to provide good visibility to our global wholesale and distributor businesses into 2022 our direct to consumer businesses are performing well including steady improvement from our store fleet this momentum coupled with the consistent strength of global consumer trends that align well with our brand portfolio give us confidence to raise our outlook for fiscal 2021 the company now expects fiscal 2021 revenue in the range of 2 34 billion to 2 4 billion growth of 31 to 34 compared to the prior year this represents an increase of 150 million from our original outlook in february and results in growth of 5 6 versus 2019 at the high end of the range we now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of 2 20 to 2 30 reported diluted earnings per share are now expected in the range of 1 85 to 1 95 and include net litigation defense costs and incremental air freight costs caused by the covid specific disruption in the supply chain the global economic environment continues to improve but pandemic related volatility remains we have factored into our outlook the current headwinds that we have visibility to today including logistics costs and supply chain delays in this dynamic marketplace our team has done a remarkable job to improve our ability to service the accelerated demand we continue to see for our brands our balance sheet is very strong and the company is poised to lean forward as we deliver higher growth in 2021 with very strong prospects for 2022 and beyond with that i will hand it back over to blake for some closing remarks blake blake w krueger chairman of the board chief executive officer thanks mike our accelerated growth and strong financial performance in q2 are a testament to the company s strategic focus and increasing brand investments over the last several years we ve invested behind digital marketing technology talent and e commerce as well as product innovation and design these investments are paying off our brands have numerous growth opportunities in front of them the company s balance sheet is strong and we are confident as we plan for double digit growth in 2022 the advantageous position we find ourselves in today is a credit to our team s expertise and relentless work the global marketplace continues to be dynamic and fast changing and our people and company are excelling in this environment i d like to close by thanking our team members around the world for their tremendous efforts and making this a pivotal year for the company with that i ll now turn the call back over to the operator operator operator your first question comes from the line of steve marotta with cl king associates please proceed with your question questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of steve marotta with cl king associates please proceed with your question steven marotta cl king associates analyst good morning everybody thanks for taking my question appreciate it mike can you talk a little bit about the current supply chain disruptions the length of time the difficulty in getting product here and how that affects your outlook for the second half sales and earnings cadence again from a quarterly basis thanks michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer sure yes i mean the industry is definitely dealing with this challenge across the board here at the company i think we ve done a great job of managing and being proactive where we can be to offset some of those risks as you re seeing in the outlook which has improved here in the back half of the year we have a well known disruption in some of the vietnamese factories that we re in but even with some of that downside exposure which is reflected in our outlook as we mentioned we feel confident that we can continue to deliver growth in the back half of the year and i think as we look at the position we have with our inventory today continues to improve by the end of the year we would expect our inventory positions to be up nicely over last year and over 2019 levels and so i think again the aggressive position we re taking in terms of buying inventory and some of the tactics we ve deployed have helped us kind of navigate what s been a really choppy supply chain situation steven marotta cl king associates analyst that s helpful thank you brendan you mentioned that you have indications that we re currently on the bubble of a new boat shoe trend can you talk a little bit about in detail what those indications are and how quickly you think that could touch fire thanks brendan hoffman president director yes we just i mean it s really exciting for us to see that with sperry i mean we re really just seeing it on our own website we re hearing it from our retail partners that they re seeing the uptick seeing it really strong in men s right now and all the data points we get and the information we get from our semi group show it as well so really feeling confident that we re at the precipice of that trend which obviously only enhances everything we re doing with sperry blake w krueger chairman of the board chief executive officer yes steve i d also say that i think this was the second quarter in a row we saw that category increase in the market here in the u s where we get information steven marotta cl king associates analyst ill jump back the queue thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jim duffy with stifel please proceed with your question jim duffy stifel analyst thank you good morning everyone hope you guys are doing well unidentified speaker yeah jim duffy stifel analyst mike i wanted to focus for a moment on the sg a just as it relates to potential for leverage with any revenue upside in the back half of the year versus 2019 year second quarter sg a growth accelerated you mentioned some incentive compensation and incremental marketing expense for modeling versus 2019 should we expect leverage in the back half of this year is the incentive compensation all trued up to appropriate levels or is there more of that to come in the back half of the year michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer yes there s more of that to come jim in the back half i mean we we allocate and expense that over the full year and expect now based on the performance of the business which is obviously exceeding our expectations on the top line and the bottom line that our incentive comp results will be very positive and more normalized we re also investing pretty heavily in our e commerce business in our direct to consumer businesses across the channels so you re seeing a shift from 2019 to 2021 in the way that we re investing in the business but also just the nature of the direct to consumer business model right which is at a much higher level we ve more than doubled it in the first half of the year we re still on track to do that for the full year so the shift in sg a expense has a lot to do with our focus on direct to consumer and that business model requires a higher level of variable sg a jim duffy stifel analyst understood moving up to p l as it relates to the gross margin outlook some clear inflationary pressures i joined the call late maybe you mentioned this in the prepared remarks but did you speak at all to pricing power just given the demand strength that you re seeing across the industry blake w krueger chairman of the board chief executive officer yes i mean right now we frankly we believe the consumer has been paying higher prices throughout most of this year there s been significant less promotions across the industry that has really seemed to have no impact on demand at least the demand as we see it for our family of brands so we think there s pricing power yet available we think there will be price increases in the industry input costs going up obviously logistics costs going up we ll start to see some of those price increases yet this year you re seeing it in some industries like toys and some other consumer categories and then you ll see some more selective price increases judicious price increases in 2022 jim duffy stifel analyst mike do you have a view for product cost inflation from your channel partners as we look out to 2022 michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer we do i think the on the product side on the input cost side i think we ve been able to manage that pretty well especially for the spring season jim in that first half of the year so good visibility to that obviously the challenges and some of the cost pressures are coming more from the logistics side on distribution side of the supply chain where we ve seen pretty tremendous increases in freight rates both inbound and outbound so we re i think that s a cost pressure that we factored in as we start to plan our spring business and think about 2022 but on the input cost side or the product cost side it s been managed very well jim duffy stifel analyst thank you very much guys michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer thank you jim operator your next question comes from the line of jonathan komp with baird please proceed with your question jonathan komp baird analyst hi thank you first mike can i just clarify i know the guidance for earnings is now adjusting for 0 35 of items can you just maybe highlight what s included in that currently michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer right we have the litigation costs that we continue to have related to the legacy issue that we ve spoken about in the past and that continues to be included in our non gaap adjustment and we ve included mostly airframe some other covid specific costs that that we ve adjusted out consistent with the last several quarters jonathan komp baird analyst okay and the airfreight is it still i think you said 15 million to 20 million last call and do you think that continues beyond this year at all or just current thoughts on the level and if it will continue michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer it s hard to predict that right now jon i mean obviously we re seeing a demand for that this year and have provided a little bit more coverage for that just given the uncertainty of the supply chain but as far as how that how that plays out next year it s hard to predict i will say that i think our brands across the portfolio have taken a much harder position on inventory a much stronger position i should say more aggressive to position us better for the spring demand and fall demand for next year supply chain teams are getting well ahead of that i think that will be indicated in our strong year end inventory position so that will help take some pressure off of some of the air freight demand that we re seeing this year jonathan komp baird analyst okay that s helpful color thank you and then i want to ask a broader question on the revenue outlook for this year q2 was up double digits against 2019 it looks like the second half you re assuming more low to mid single digit growth versus 2019 so can you just maybe frame that up q2 did you have some benefits from shipments that were going to happen in q1 or any other factors as we think about the second half that s driving your outlook there and maybe as a follow up any more detail on how you re thinking about 22 given the comment about double digit growth thank you blake w krueger chairman of the board chief executive officer yes i ll take the first part of your question i think right now we re in a normalized position pretty much what we predicted in q1 occurred we had a poor over from q1 into q2 and about the same same amount from q2 into q3 so q2 really represents a very strong performance on a normalized basis it s at this time given some of the logistics issues it s a little hard to predict exactly the split between q3 and q4 but we expect strong growth in the back half of the year when we look ahead we ve been receiving orders much earlier from our wholesale partners and international distributors for 2022 product so as a company we re sitting today with a lot more insight and visibility into next year s business levels demand by geographic regions and at the wholesale level and so this is something that is a bit unusual i think all retailers appreciate the fact that they need to place their orders a little bit earlier if they re going to be assured of of product for the coming year given some of this year s disruption so that s really enabled us to some confidence look at double digit growth next year brendan hoffman president director yes and i think just that s also helping the last question on supply chain and airfreight for next year getting orders in earlier are allowing us to work with the retailers on new expedited ways get goods to them whether it be what we call the fast boat whether it be door to dock where we re shipping it right to them so i think as we look at 2022 we ll be much better prepared both from our side and their side to mitigate the cost we had to incur this year jonathan komp baird analyst all right thank you very much brendan hoffman president director thanks jon operator next question comes from the line of erinn murphy with piper sandler please proceed with your question erinn murphy piper sandler analyst great thanks good morning i guess my question is still on the global logistics outlook could you share what your vietnam exposure is currently and then are you needing to shift production for some of the temporal factory closures or are you just writing out the disruption and then i have a couple of follow ups blake w krueger chairman of the board chief executive officer yes i mean there s been some closures as we all know in southern vietnam around primarily around hochiman city for and vietnam is certainly a significant source for the industry as a whole and for us as well at the moment less than half of our vietnam factories were closed factories are starting to reopen after the kind of 2 week government shutdown we don t know exactly what the future will hold but we ve factored all of our current outlook in all the current facts into our guidance for the rest of the year and this is i guess the shutdowns in vietnam are largely two weeks in nature and so there wouldn t be with that kind of shorter time frame of disruption or closure there wouldn t be any significant shift in production to other countries or factories brendan hoffman president director we have people on the ground there as throughout asia so it s something we re managing every day right now erinn murphy piper sandler analyst and just to clarify is it similar footwear companies have somewhere between 25 and 40 exposure to vietnam is that in the zip code for you guys as well michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer yes on the high end of blake w krueger chairman of the board chief executive officer probably at the high end we d be around 40 if you look back on a historical basis michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer the good news there erinn is we but we do source a lot of our products right so we re already in other factory locations and other factory or in other countries for source of supply so if this worsens then we ll have dual source capabilities to manage through it erinn murphy piper sandler analyst got it and then maybe brendan for you you ve been prioritizing e commerce across the portfolio can you share a little bit over the next kind of 12 to 18 months other areas of investment you re focused on i know that merrell app is coming up soon any other kind of brands that you re really focused on kind of supercharging their e commerce capabilities brendan hoffman president director well i think from a brand standpoint it s all of them will benefit by the investments we re making on replatforming technology data collection data mining certainly saucony right now is top of mind for us with their growth and some of the catch up there they re doing a fantastic job on their e commerce growth and really prioritizing saucony com and both performance and originals so so there for sure sperry a lot of their rebound is coming by being able to tell their story directly through sperry com and then have that cascade through through their other partners so i would and then in the workout group we re seeing huge growth there as well so that s becoming a very viable channel so i would really say erinn it s pretty wide based which is exciting and we ll continue to make investments to fuel that both customer facing and kind of behind the scenes with some of the technology erinn murphy piper sandler analyst got it and then just last question for me is around m a i m curious how you both are prioritizing m a as you look forward are you looking at a lot of deals just curious given where the balance sheet is right now and how you re prioritizing that versus organic growth opportunities ahead thanks brendan hoffman president director well yes of course we re putting available cash all that s necessary into to organic growth and paying down debt and returning capital to our shareholders but we continue to be very active in the m a as we have been historically we have a pretty well established set of criteria we use we are looking at not just potentially footwear brands but also businesses that might bring some new strategic competes like apparel critical integrated brands digital brands so we frankly remain pretty active in kicking the tires and taking a look at properties we have a long track record of success and bringing brands into the company and growing them erinn murphy piper sandler analyst thank you michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer thanks erinn operator your next question comes from the line of sam poser with williams trading please proceed with your question sam poser williams trading analyst thanks for taking my question good morning everybody i was just wondering in the back half of the year you flowed through versus 19 in q2 i mean pretty dramatically your revenue was up 11 and your eps was up like 28 but the back half of the year isn t your guidance for the flow through doesn t seem to be near as good as it is in q2 can you give us some color on why that is and what might change that because you mentioned that you were getting very good response to your digital marketing and so on and so forth michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer yes no i think the expectations for kind of the effectiveness of those investments still remains really strong sam a lot of the flow through in the back half has to do with some of the supply chain costs that we ve been talking about and and those are meaningful and they re very much back half weighted too so that s important and we re there are some areas of conservatism built into that because of the uncertainty but overall really when i think about the drivers here in the first half year performance versus the back half it s really the back half weighting of the incremental supply chain costs sam poser williams trading analyst and how many of those i mean the airfreight covid related airfreight and stuff i mean how are you going to delineate what is regular operations versus onetime in nature there michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer yes yes we ve done that based on the outlook that we provided and the separation of those topics but i mean we have ocean freight logistics other logistics costs distribution costs several other costs related to supply chain that are having a heavier weight on the back half of the year unrelated to air freight sam poser williams trading analyst thanks and then just i was wondering if you could just give us i know it comes out in the queue but if you could give us your the channel information for the michigan group and the boston group prior to the few coming out blake w krueger chairman of the board chief executive officer yes i don t have that in front of us sam right now i would tell you that we all of our channels including wholesale grew versus 2019 i don t have the split out between michigan group and boston group right in front of me we can probably get you that information but pretty solid performance across board by channel and by geographic region as well michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer and the profit flow through was very strong on both sides on both groups because we saw growth from all the brands and we saw really nice leverage really across the board too there so there s really no distinction between the two groups when it comes to profit performance or flow through sam poser williams trading analyst and then lastly on the gross margin i mean so your the airfreight coming out of the margin so how should we think about the growth for the back half or the full year given what you re telling us is it going to be like 200 basis points less than what it was in the first quarter or first half of the year i mean how should we think about that michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer yes again just to reiterate like we said many times we re only excluding what we re considering extraordinary air freight costs we ve got 10 million of airfreight costs in the results that we re referring to and i d say for the full year our gross margins will be down a little bit from the first half performance which they typically are based on just the gross margin performance in the fourth quarter et cetera but the margins for the full year we re expecting to be in that 43 to 43 5 range and operating margins approaching 12 for the full year brendan hoffman president director and i think just it s not we re not changing the level of promotions i mean we re selling things at full price as blake said that s continuing into the back half of the year just some of the input costs that hit margin that michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer input we have and a more more normalized mix in the back half which just changes the margin profile a little bit but yes sam poser williams trading analyst but just to confirm are you expecting things to normalize at all more toward promotional activity or how are you judging sort of the promotional seasonal promotional activity in the back half versus what you saw in the front half brendan hoffman president director we re selling things at full price it will be an interesting christmas without all the deep discounts that it s going to be a great pallet cleanser for the industry so we re excited at the aurs we re seeing both in our own channels and through our retail partners sam poser williams trading analyst okay well thank you guys very much and continue the good job unidentified speaker thanks operator next question comes from the line of mitch kummetz with pivotal research please proceed with your question mitch kummetz pivotal research analyst yeah thanks i guess i ve got a few first off i just wanted to follow up on jon komp s question earlier because he was asking about shifts and previously you were pretty specific about the slippage q1 to q2 q2 to q3 i think it was 40 million for each is that still kind of what you saw in the quarter and what s expected for the third quarter blake w krueger chairman of the board chief executive officer yes when i say it was basically a net wash basically what we the information we gave you in q1 came to fruition so we had a little bit of a poor over from q1 to q2 and a similar cover from q2 to q3 our overperformance in q2 was fundamentally driven by accelerating demand and also a lot of the proactive steps we took in the supply chain area earlier in the year so that really drove our performance mitch kummetz pivotal research analyst okay and then so you raised your sales guidance by 100 million i know it s 150 million from earlier in the year but from where it was last quarter this quarter it s gone up 100 million how much of that 100 million was upside in the quarter versus a better outlook for the back half and then with regard to upside in the quarter can you maybe specifically say what surprised you positively compared to what you were anticipating internally michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer i d say that on the guidance mitch it s about 50 what we over delivered in the quarter and 50 in the back half of the year better outlook better higher confidence in delivering on the supply chain all the things that blake mentioned about demand though that continues to be the strongest metric and order book has strengthened since the last call we had so our outlook on demand is very strong where we have caution and the outlook has to do with the supply chain as you would expect but even with that we have enough confidence to raise the outlook like we did so mitch kummetz pivotal research analyst okay and then lastly go ahead sorry michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer no no that s all i had to say okay and then on sperry i know you gave kind of the 2 year numbers on merrell and saucony i m not sure if you gave it on sperry i heard kind of a 40 but i don t know if that was in reference to work boots or sperry what was the 2 year growth on sperry and i m curious how that compared to the first quarter blake w krueger chairman of the board chief executive officer yes i mean in q2 sperry would have been down mid teens compared to 2019 i d have to look up q1 and get back to you mitch michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer that was a nice improvement in q1 mitch and i think we re going to continue to see that gradually improve in the back half of the year as well mitch kummetz pivotal research analyst okay thats helpful thank you very much goodluck operator your next question comes from the line of jay sole with ubs please proceed with your question jay sole ubs analyst superb thanks so much like i just want to follow up on the comment you made i think a couple of times in the prepared remarks about double digit growth for 2022 can you just maybe elaborate that a little bit more is that a number versus 2019 is that a number versus the new updated guidance for 2021 that you just gave and sort of what are going to be the main drivers and are we talking about double digit being 10 is it more like 15 20 maybe can you frame that up for us a little bit more that would be helpful blake w krueger chairman of the board chief executive officer well i probably won t go beyond double digit this morning but we have unprecedented visibility into our order book for next year right now certainly at a greater level than we ve ever had historically and demand remains very strong across the portfolio pretty much what we experienced in q2 so with a high level of confidence we re looking ahead with double digit growth versus 2020 not 2019 2021 excuse me but not the prior year so it looks very strong right now and it s across merrell saucony sperry across our work brand jay sole ubs analyst got it and just brendan hoffman president director go ahead jay sole ubs analyst no please go ahead brendan hoffman president director i was just going to add something on sperry just that relates also to the last question with first 2019 in our own channels we re up against 2019 in sperry so i think that s a board leading indicator because that s where we re able to tell the message and talk directly to consumer i think the wholesale business will we re seeing that bounce back and i think that s another positive sign as blake talks about 2022 as the emergence of sperry jay sole ubs analyst got it and then maybe if we can talk about sell through little bit because obviously there s a lot of fiscal stimulus in march and april but did you see the sell through for the brands collectively improve throughout the quarter and sort of what s your read on back to school and what does that mean for say your kids business your kids business and obviously the portfolio overall blake w krueger chairman of the board chief executive officer yes i would say right now in general i wouldn t bet against the consumer saving rates have tripled stimulus money continues the consumer has been locked up for 18 months they want to travel they want to frankly buy some stuff and experience some stuff that they haven t over the last 18 months so right now we see continuing strong demand we see a strong back to school it s hard to predict what the covid situation is going to be like on back to school but right now it looks like in the united states almost all k 12 children will be returning to in classroom experience and so we continue to see strong consumer demand brendan hoffman president director yes and just on the kids our e commerce this month in our kids group is double last year so that s a real strong sign of back to school is happening jay sole ubs analyst got it great thank you so much unidentified speaker thanks jay operator your next question comes from the line of dana telsey with telsey advisory group please proceed with your question dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst good morning everyone and nice to see the progress on the results as you think about the order book that you talked about it sounds like there s an acceleration globally any way to expand on that you re seeing overseas what you re seeing in the u s and how you re thinking about the upcoming holiday season thank you blake w krueger chairman of the board chief executive officer yes i would say as we look at q2 first of all our growth was really evenly split between the u s a and international markets as you know dana about half of our pairs are marketed in international markets so we are seeing strong demand across virtually every country and international market at the same time including the u s so we think it s going to be a good back to school season we think it s going to be a good holiday season for consumer soft goods and our brands in particular so we re energized right now the backlog would reflect that too dana so when you look at the nice distribution of demand across the business for our distributor businesses and third party markets our own businesses in europe and canada so the backlog metrics or trends that we re seeing are very strong across the regions dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst got it and then inventory levels how do you think inventory levels and where do you see them being at the end of the third and the end of the fourth quarter michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer again we re very excited about the fact that we re starting to turn that corner right now we were down about 14 at the end of q2 which frankly was a little bit lower than expected but our revenue obviously outperformed right so we were able to really turn at the end of the quarter turn around a lot of goods and get them out the door so that was very positive and our ability to service the business in q2 was much stronger than q1 we d expect inventories to be up year over year at the end of q3 and then by the end of the year up strong double digits based on our current outlook supply chain can always impact those projections but at this point based on what we have on order what s on the water and what we re already securing in the warehouses we feel good that inventory positions are going to continue to strengthen throughout the balance of the year dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst thank you blake w krueger chairman of the board chief executive officer your welcome operator your next question comes from the line of susan anderson with b riley fbr please proceed with your question susan anderson b riley fbr analyst hi good morning nice job on the quarter i m curious on sperry just a follow up on all the comments thanks for all the details there and i m just curious like the last time you saw a strong boat trend maybe if you could talk about when that last time was and then just kind of the performance you saw on sperry and then also it sounds like it s performing better at retail than wholesale or are you seeing those wholesalers yet start to indicate they want i guess more orders for the brand brendan hoffman president director yes i ll take the second part first and then let blake comment on the trends historical trends i mean my comment was our own channels are always going to be the leading indicator because we control those we control the inventory we control the messaging we re seeing tremendous enthusiasm it started i think i mentioned in the last call started for holiday with the we added some new players in the sperry team and the new product launches have gotten a tremendous reaction so we re starting to see those online in our retail stores and we ll see that lift the wholesale performance as we get to the back half of the year and certainly into 2022 but i ll let blake comment blake w krueger chairman of the board chief executive officer yes if you look back the u s has always had a boats category resurgence from time to time we re probably in the very early innings of that right now historically that s lasted for several years when it starts so we re trying to be there in the market with fresh bulk to product like the float and several other offerings from john legend on down and the early signs are good we ve had growth in the u s in the category the last couple of quarters so that s also very encouraging susan anderson b riley fbr analyst great thanks and then also can you maybe talk a little bit about just the product offering for sperry for this fall do you have anything new coming out or maybe talk about the boots for fall brendan hoffman president director we have a lot of new product i mean blake just mentioned float we have the co lab with john legend that launches in september we re doing some really cool events and concerts around that john and i did something with footwear news last month that was very well received and we have sperry sport launching for holiday and spring of as well as updates to the existing franchises so i think the product line has never been stronger i ve gotten great responses from some of my industry friends about what they re seeing and some of the previews i ve given them so as i mentioned the wholesale accounts are really excited about what they re seeing for the back half of 21 and into 22 and i think it s a credit to the team and the product development pipeline susan anderson b riley fbr analyst great that sounds good and then just one more question on the orders overall the orders for fall it sounds like you feel very good about that i guess i m curious it sounds like they must have accelerated from the first half particularly as a lot of wholesalers are seeing themselves stuck without product maybe if you could talk about just the magnitude i guess of the orders if you could and then are there any early reads for spring 22 orders blake w krueger chairman of the board chief executive officer yes i would say in general we don t give out specific backlog information but as we ve said demand built throughout q2 has continued to build really throughout the first half of this year our order backlog continues to build for 2022 which gives us confidence to focus and plan today for a double digit increase next year so it s extremely strong indications as reflected in our order backlog brendan hoffman president director yes and i almost don t want to use the word accelerate because i think it s the new normal we ve reached new levels of demand for a lot of our brands so some of it s an acceleration but a lot of it is just the new baseline that we re building off of susan anderson b riley fbr analyst thanks that sounds good thanks so much good luck in the back half brendan hoffman president director thank you blake w krueger chairman of the board chief executive officer thank you susan operator your final question comes from the line of laurent vasilescu with exane bnp paribas please proceed with your question laurent vasilescu exane bnp paribas analyst hello good morning thanks for squeezing me back in mike i wanted to ask about the full year guidance the high end implies about 125 million incremental revenues over fy 19 and remind me but i think e commerce is going to reach your own e commerce is going to reach 500 million effectively let s say about 250 million just trying to understand the puts and takes here on how are you thinking about the wholesale business for fy 21 versus fy 19 and any nuances would be appreciated by brand michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer again i think for us the focus on our digital business has been pretty prominent and that shift has been consistent over the last several months so that growth in e comm that you referenced is really important to the overall performance of our brands across really the whole portfolio so that continues to be the case we re seeing our wholesale trends continue to improve and they were very strong in q2 up low single digits over 2019 levels in our own markets so and again as the performance the strongest categories for us are the ones that we ve mentioned here several times around outdoor performance running and work those are going to continue to carry the day here for the balance of this year and be the strongest drivers of the overall growth versus 2019 but the lifestyle brands are closing the gap so we re seeing progressive improvement in those brands from the first half of the year into the second half of the year and have higher more positive outlook for that category in 2022 laurent vasilescu exane bnp paribas analyst that s very helpful thank you for that and then following up on erinn s question with regards to vietnam i think you do break out the range percentage range in your latest esg report but obviously that s at the company level maybe can you give us some some color on like which brands have a greater exposure to vietnam i would assume it s maybe some of the performance but maybe you can give a little bit more color on that that would be very helpful michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer it s across the brands and again we have a good amount of work boot business in vietnam along with those performance brands that you mentioned so i would say that it doesn t necessarily impact any particular brand but we re constantly monitoring that and i would say obviously for our larger businesses they re more exposed from a volume standpoint just because they re bigger but not necessarily because we have more concentration of those constructions in vietnam and other places again i want to emphasize we do have a nice diversification of sourcing supply outside of vietnam right now and we ve moved some of our production back into china even in this year just to provide that dual sourcing capability and risk mitigation and it s serving us pretty well right now but we re keeping a very close eye on what s happening in vietnam and we ll continue to monitor that to the extent it impacts our outlook laurent vasilescu exane bnp paribas analyst very helpful and then last question great to hear about the double digit growth for fy 22 just to make sure is that just fully organic that s not anticipating any m a is that correct michael d stornant senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer that is correct blake w krueger chairman of the board chief executive officer that is correct that s correct laurent vasilescu exane bnp paribas analyst thats great thank you blake okay best of luck operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached

chief executive officer thank you sofya good morning everybody and welcome to our call i m pleased to announce another outstanding quarter for newell as we further built on the strong momentum from the past three quarters we delivered 25 core sales growth 59 normalized operating income growth and 87 normalized eps growth in the quarter versus prior year we have now given four consecutive quarters of core sales growth and experienced five consecutive quarters of domestic consumption growth based on first half 2021 sales momentum we are raising our top line outlook for the year during the second quarter core sales growth exceeded 25 as we lapped significant disruption from the pandemic importantly even on a two year stack basis core sales grew low double digits both in the second quarter and during the first half showing the underlying momentum in the business i m especially pleased that once again we saw broad based top line strength across each of our eight business units and across major channels with every region growing at a double digit rate while performance in north america was excellent as core sales grew almost 22 international markets once again shone registering nearly 35 core growth in the second quarter and almost 31 in the first half with particular strength in latin america seven of our top 10 beloved brands including coleman graco oster sharpie yankee candle paper mate and first alert grew at a strong double digit pace yankee candle stood out as its sales nearly doubled versus last year we delivered strong top line results even in businesses such as food and home appliances that faced tough comparisons versus prior year as a result of demand spikes at the same time it was extremely encouraging to see the continued rebound in writing as it has come roaring back folks roaring back from a channel perspective e commerce sales growth moderated to a mid single digit trend accounting for about 20 of newell s global net sales versus peak penetration of around 24 a year ago during the quarter we saw a resurgence in consumption in brick and mortar as recent progress on vaccine rollout and increased mobility brought people back to the stores in fact growth in brick and mortar outpaced digital as the retail industry lapped significant pandemic related store closures and lockdowns from the second quarter 2020 given our ongoing investment in omni capabilities we are well positioned to capitalize on consumer demand regardless of which channels consumers choose to shop we do however believe that over time digital penetration will continue to move up despite the potential for quarterly fluctuations as channel dynamics settle the u s economy is continuing to regain its footing we generally saw healthy consumption during the second quarter there has been some normalization in trend across businesses in the u s that experienced significant spikes in demand a year ago such as home appliances and food at the same time consumption accelerated in writing which was the victim of the pandemic last year recent consumer behavior reinforces our belief that home as the hub theme will persist well after the pandemic the home has become central to people s lives and has truly become a sanctuary a part time office a part learning center a kid s activity zone and the kitchen a family hub newell is well positioned to capitalize on the home as hub phenomenon not only due to the composition of our business portfolio but also because of all the work we ve done to reinvigorate our iconic brands and innovation funnels that enhance life at home and outside seven out of our eight business units grew core sales at a double digit rate and we made notable progress on market share across a number of categories let s start with home fragrance whose sells in the second quarter nearly doubled versus last year as the business lapped retail store closures and significant disruption in our manufacturing operations due to the pandemic net sales increased at a strong double digit pace relative to 2019 as well overcoming the unfavorable impact from yankee candle store closures and exit from our fundraising business home fragrance was once again the star of the show delivering the highest level of top line and consumption growth within our portfolio as we continue to gain market share particularly in scented candles and expanded our distribution both in the u s and emea although we expect the scented candle category to continue to moderate results from a recent survey among scented candle users showed that used frequency remains high with almost 33 of those surveyed aiming to use the product more often in the next six months i m very excited about the long term prospects of home fragrance which is our most omni channel business it has strong gross margins and strong growth potential the food business remained on a solid footing across all regions as core sales increased low double digits against a very difficult base period comparison as anticipated pos decelerated in the quarter as the category softened but remained significantly ahead of the 2019 level as our strong brands continue to take significant share in food storage fresh preserving and kitchen organization categories i m delighted to share some of the recognitions our brands have received this year as consumer reports named foodsaver as the best vacuum sealer for 2021 and good housekeeping chose rubbermaid brilliance as best food storage for 2021 and as 1 editor s choice for best nonstick in 2021 it is so exciting to see those accolades especially at a time when the kitchen is so important to our consumers and our innovation machine has been in full gear this is another terrific quarter for home appliances business core sales growth exceeded 15 even as it lapped a high single digit growth comparison once again latin america stole the show as we continue to leverage our e commerce presence to reach consumers with particularly strong results in chile peru and argentina as expected consumption in the u s is moderating against elevated levels from a year ago but remained significantly ahead of 2019 our needle mover launch of mr coffee iced from fall 2020 continues to generate demand supported by the social media campaign switch up your brewtine we further broadened distribution during the second quarter with new on trend colors mr coffee also introduced the steam espresso maker to capture consumers heightened interest in specialty and espresso beverages mr coffee s consistent share gains on the back of innovations and great price value is impressive top line momentum in our writing business accelerated nicely on a sequential basis core sales growth for this business exceeded the company s total result with every region delivering terrific growth against a suppressed base in the year ago period the rebound across most writing categories as more schools return to in person learning to finish out the school year in combination with share gains in key categories such as pens presentation markers permanent markers and highlighters translated into terrific consumption in the u s for us consumption was up in other parts of the world as well newell s share of the gel pen segment increased over 700 basis points to 26 as our consumption nearly doubled behind our needle mover innovation sharpie s gel boy do i love that pen which continues to delight consumers and bring incremental dollars to the category we also have pos growth in other markets such as australia new zealand and in the u k in the second quarter the office channel also grew versus last year but as expected it has not fully come back to pre pandemic levels due to the prevalence of flexible work arrangements we are encouraged by the second consecutive quarter of strong pos growth in writing and remain optimistic about the back to school season with robust merchandising plans in place based on the latest available information in person instruction which is the gold standard is expected to make a comeback this year according to school opening tracker by a leading industry source for the upcoming school year 96 of k 12 student body in the u s is in school districts that have already announced they will offer in person education of course uncertainty remains to some degree given the recent spread of the delta variant while we are closely monitoring the situation we remain bullish on this back to school season and believe we are well positioned to win as we continue to grow sales and overall share during the second quarter strong double digit core sales growth for our baby business was nearly identical to that of writing fueled by broad based momentum across all the regions a double digit increase in consumption which reflected share gains by graco in a rapidly growing category a benefit from stimulus funding as well as an easy comparison all contributed to such a strong result in the u s we think that improving mobility and higher appetite by u s consumers to go on overnight trips by car this summer bode well for demand in car seats the biggest subsegment of the baby gear category in our baby business we continue to innovate in this category earlier this year graco introduced a snugride snugfit a new line of infant car seats with integrated anti rebound bar that provides an extra layer of safety for families we re also excited by a new report from the institute of family studies that just came in that suggests that the u s may be witnessing a surprising rise in births potentially a result of government stimulus checks and flexible work arrangements is there a baby boom going on folks our commercial business unit delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of core sales growth just shy of double digits with strong top line momentum across all regions higher domestic consumption of material handling refuse cleaning outdoor organization and hand protection and scouring products helped to mitigate declines in washroom solutions which started to cycle against a significant surge in demand late in the second quarter 2020 we re seeing signs of reopening related demand in verticals such as foodservice hospitality as well as travel and entertainment and also the builder channel is really beginning to surge but somewhat offset by softness in washroom solutions and use of sanitizers core sales for the connected home security business also accelerated to a strong double digit growth rate lapping significant disruption in the year ago period the team is navigating through some supply constraints as it relates to chip shortages just like other businesses that were negatively impacted by the pandemic last year we saw significant acceleration in outdoor recreation as core sales increased 25 with growth in every region and every major category coleman the largest brand in this business unit delivered terrific results as one of the largest contributors to the company s top line growth this quarter while the call of the outdoors campaign has already bolstered the outdoor equipment category this quarter we also saw a resurgence in sales growth for our on the go beverage and technical apparels businesses driven by robust demand in beverage contigo s newly launched product lines are off to a strong start and are driving share gains in the hydration category the power of our strategic vision the strength of our brand and business portfolio and the focus on the turnaround have been brought to life through strong resilient and agile execution in an ever changing and fluid operating environment we delivered outstanding top and bottom line results during the second quarter and first half of 21 both relative to the year ago period as well as 2019 we have gained considerable momentum on our turnaround let me illustrate we brought together a world class leadership team who has helped unlock the passion of our people we invested in omni channel capabilities that have been instrumental in capturing consumer demand across all channels substantially strengthened our innovation and marketing muscle leveraging consumer insights and foresights sharpened brand positioning for many of our top brands established joint business plans with key strategic retail partners instituted a new hybrid organization model that brings our domain experts close to our customers and consumers while leveraging the center for scale and efficiencies made productivity a way of life providing both fuel for margin enhancement as well as reinvestment in the business to drive sustainable and profitable top line growth reduced complexity be it consolidation of erp systems or reduction in websites or skus and we have made meaningful progress in taking our overheads improving cash conversion cycle and strengthening the balance sheet importantly we ve become very skilled at managing our eight business unit portfolio and assigning clear roles to the individual businesses and some sub businesses for instance we focused on the food commercial and home appliance business units in 2020 to leverage covid related consumer trends and as some of these trends moderated we are shoring up writing and home fragrance in 2021 our strategy is to ensure that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts as we approach the second half we faced a tough macro operating environment with unprecedented inflationary pressures that we expect will top 0 5 billion as well as extraordinary externally driven supply chain challenges notwithstanding the situation i am proud of our team s resilience execution of progress and ingenuity so much so that we raised our top line guidance for the year and continue to project normalized operating income and eps growth on a full year basis looking ahead i can confidently state that we are a much stronger company than before and well positioned to drive sustainable and profitable growth in the years ahead and add significant shareholder value i d like to express my sincere and profound gratitude to all our 31 000 employees and frontline worldwide for their tenacity in delivering another great quarter our best days are truly ahead of us with that over to chris peterson now please go easy on him with the questions it is his birthday happy birthday chris onwards and upwards christopher h peterson chief financial officer and president thanks ravi and good morning everyone second quarter results were outstanding as the integrated set of strategies we put in place several years ago continue to drive strong financial results across all key metrics before getting into the details i want to provide a little color on the current operating environment and proactive choices we are making we delivered better than anticipated results in q2 as consumer demand across our categories remained robust and our supply chain teams did a heroic job navigating a choppy operating environment to give a little perspective on the supply environment we continue to face a number of externally driven supply challenges as a reminder in the second quarter of 2020 our supply chain was significantly pressured as a result of government mandated closures across many of our facilities due to the pandemic that was a low point for the business and we are in a much better position today with our factories distribution centers and retail stores open more recently however our teams have worked tirelessly to overcome various supply challenges surrounding longer lead times for sourced products trucking capacity in the u s as well as labor shortages raw material and component availability covid related disruptions across ports as well as consumer demand spikes following stimulus payments have exacerbated these issues early on we took a number of proactive actions to mitigate the impact from these dynamics including building inventory on top selling skus allowing for longer in transit times as part of our planning process accelerating the pace of automation where feasible and being creative with increased incentives to attract and retain employees in factories by raising wages further enhancing benefits and working conditions and providing employee development programs among other actions the complexity reduction work that we executed as part of the turnaround has put us in a much better position to deal with these challenges while we have successfully navigated these dynamics and created more agility within our supply chain it certainly has not been easy and the challenges are ongoing the other changing dynamic has been inflationary pressure we have seen continued escalation inflation largely driven by increasing resin prices ocean freight costs source finished goods pricing due to a strengthening chinese yuan and labor wage pressure these factors are not unique to newell and are affecting everyone in our industry to put it in perspective we currently expect inflation to amount to nearly 560 million in 2021 this is about 200 million worse than what we expected just three months ago and 350 million worse than we expected at the beginning of the year we are taking a number of actions to mitigate this significant inflation spike including a more aggressive push on productivity savings continuing to tightly manage costs optimizing promotional spend driving operating leverage from stronger top line growth and taking additional selective pricing later this year in categories where we are seeing the greatest impact the net result is that we are maintaining our eps outlook for the year which calls for strong operating profit growth despite the significant increase in inflationary pressure in the u s we have now announced price increases across seven of our eight business units these pricing actions do not fully offset the inflationary cost pressure as we are using productivity savings and operating leverage as offsets as well as we start to think about 2022 we expect this headwind to become a tailwind as inflation is largely in the base we benefit from carryover pricing and we continue to drive productivity savings and manage costs tightly moving on to second quarter performance we delivered very strong results as demand exceeded our expectations this yielded the better than anticipated outcome on top line that also flowed through to the bottom line the company s net sales increased 28 3 year over year to 2 7 billion core sales grew 25 4 as we lapped a 12 6 decline from a year ago favorable foreign exchange more than offset the headwind from business and yankee candle retail store exits we saw broad based strength during the quarter with each of our eight business units in all four geographic regions growing core sales in the first half of the year grew 23 3 on a 2 year stack basis which helps smooth out noise from the year ago figures we grew core sales in the low double digits both during the quarter and in the first half normalized gross margin expanded to 32 7 from 31 6 in the year ago period the benefit from fuel productivity savings favorable business mix and pricing more than offset a more than 700 basis point headwind from inflation primarily related to resin sourced finished goods transportation and labor costs normalized operating margin expanded 240 basis points year over year to 12 6 gross margin improvement in combination with sales leverage and disciplined overhead cost controls more than offset the impact of an increase in advertising and promotion expense normalized operating profit grew 59 year over year to 341 million net interest expense decreased by 6 million year over year to 65 million reflecting about a 700 million year over year reduction in outstanding debt the normalized tax rate was 15 2 above the year ago level of 11 2 due to a higher rate impact last year from discrete tax items second quarter normalized diluted earnings per share were 0 56 nearly doubling year over year now turning to our segment performance core sales for the commercial solutions segment increased 16 6 with strong growth in both the commercial and connected home security business units core sales for home appliances increased 15 3 primarily driven by latin america the home solutions segment increased core sales 33 7 with double digit growth in both the food and home fragrance businesses core sales for the learning development segment increased 31 6 which reflected similar level of strong growth in both the writing and baby business units lastly the outdoor rec segment increased core sales 25 given the meaningful business disruption from the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020 we think it is informative to compare the company s current results to the second quarter of 2019 newell s net sales exceeded the 2019 level by 9 2 as results were higher across every segment other than learning development which was only slightly lower year to date through q2 newell generated operating cash flow of 76 million as compared to 132 million a year ago while operating income increased substantially versus last year that was more than offset by a temporary increase in working capital to support strong demand in 2021 and managed through longer lead times we continued to accelerate our cash conversion cycle in the second quarter which improved by about 14 days versus the year ago period we ended q2 with a leverage ratio of 3 1 times a meaningful improvement from 4 6 times a year ago and very close to our target of 3 times the year over year step down in newell s leverage was driven by a combination of a net debt reduction of over 700 million as well as an almost 30 increase in trailing 12 months normalized ebitda we have over 2 billion in available short term liquidity including 637 million of cash on hand which is a very strong position before sharing our outlook for the third quarter and full year let me walk you through our underlying assumptions as they have changed relative to late april the macros in the u s are generally healthy and the consumer is still flushed with cash as a result of the stimulus benefits as well as the enhanced child tax credit more recently however with the surge in the delta variant across various geographies uncertainty around the pandemic remains our outlook for the remainder of 2021 includes a much higher than previously contemplated forecast on top line growth a significant year over year increase in advertising spending substantial escalation and inflationary pressures with some offset from pricing and continued traction on productivity previously discussed supply chain constraints as well as much more difficult comparisons as we lap a 6 core sales growth comparison from the back half of 2020 we are still forecasting a much stronger first half relative to the second half of 2021 our upwardly revised top line forecast for the full year 2021 implies that core sales will increase versus 2020 and 2019 in the third quarter as well as for the full year and will be up versus 2019 in the back half let s discuss the full year outlook in detail our revised net sales guidance for 2021 is 10 1 billion to 10 35 billion an increase from 9 9 billion to 10 1 billion previously which implies 8 to 10 year over year growth we now forecast core sales growth of 7 to 10 which compares favorably to our previous outlook of 5 to 7 reflecting better than anticipated results in q2 as well as an improved outlook for the balance of the year currency is still expected to be a tailwind to top line helping to more than offset the year over year headwind from closure of yankee candle retail stores and other minor business exit we now expect a flattish normalized operating margin in 2021 around 11 1 our forecast implies that normalized operating profit increases in the high single digit to low double digit range which would be a great outcome given the magnitude of inflationary pressure we are absorbing we continue to plan for higher advertising expense versus 2020 to support new product launches and omni channel investments our outlook continues to assume a high teens normalized effective tax rate and a modest uptick in shares outstanding we are maintaining our normalized earnings per share forecast at 1 63 to 1 73 our operating cash flow guidance for full year 2021 also remains the same at approximately 1 billion driven by improvement in the company s cash conversion cycle for the third quarter we are forecasting net sales of 2 7 billion to 2 78 billion with core sales flat to up 3 we expect q3 to be the peak quarter for inflation pressure which will significantly weigh on the company s margin performance we are forecasting normalized operating margin of 10 3 to 10 8 as compared to 14 9 in the year ago period as inflation and a meaningful increase in advertising and promotion spending will more than offset the benefit from volume leverage productivity and pricing we expect to realize discrete tax benefits in q3 so that the normalized effective tax rate will be in the mid single digit range this translates into normalized earnings per share in the 0 46 to 0 50 range we have made tremendous progress on our turnaround as demonstrated by our strong financial results as we look forward we are pivoting from complexity reduction to driving operational excellence in everything we do we remain laser focused on executing our strategy which we believe shows a clear path to creating long term shareholder value operator let s now open the call for questions and answers questions and answers operator our first question comes from lauren lieberman with barclays lauren rae lieberman barclays bank analyst so i first off i mean the decision the proactive decision that you all made with regard to supply chain are just remarkable and the resilience of the business that you were able to exhibit this quarter and your plans for the full year but since you brought up 22 and some of the cost headwinds net of pricing becoming tailwinds i wanted to also ask about top line in 22 not for guidance not for numbers but just how you re thinking about some of these very tough comparisons you have versus a very strong and healthy consumer environment with people getting as you said investing in home as the hub so as you look forward any help you could offer on how we should think about top line development plans that you have whether it s for innovation or to continue to stimulate category growth i think would be helpful ravichandra k saligram president and chief executive officer thank you lauren let me start off clearly it s a bit premature to offer a perspective on guidance and i know you re not looking for that nevertheless it s still difficult because we re now entering into we re coming sort of out of the pandemic but the delta variant is sort of lurking around and so the second half will be an important determinant having said that i think as i said in my prepared remarks the company is in far better shape than we have been in many years our brands are much stronger we ve put a lot of focus on innovation our writing category is very strong in fact i d say all our businesses now are in pretty good shape remember we just talked i think a year ago where i had big questions about home appliances and outdoor i m really feeling very good about what the home appliances team has done their real strength is in international particularly in latin america if you look at this quarter the fact that it was up so high and that is what so we should look at newell not just as a u s business but as a global business given 1 3 of our business or so is international and we re now going to put a lot more focus on international as well and just you ve seen how we re growing so i would say long term we re still committed to having modest top line core sales growth i can t give you a view on 22 in particular but i think the key is and there s the whole issue about the portfolio right where if we have very strong growth in one and some other businesses not doing as well you leverage like i said this year writing and home fragrance but i think the good news is i m now seeing innovation across all our businesses the little baby uptick was encouraging the thing i know you re always interested in the old baby business and not only the innovations but just to see there is the slightest hope on birth rates going up and then the 0 to four remains constant so when i look at all of that it s tough to give a sense but look we re very committed to being a growth company and that is probably the best i can do for you versus giving numbers i would hate for people to just think all the bumps we have had are just due to covid i really want us to show that we are a sustainable and profitable growth company lauren rae lieberman barclays bank analyst okay that s really helpful thanks so much operator we ll take our next question from kevin grundy with jefferies kevin michael grundy jefferies llc analyst question for chris just on the guidance and not to be too near term with this but i think some of the concern of maybe what s hitting your stock a bit is what s implied for the fourth quarter when we look at the strong q2 what you re guiding to in 3q and then what you have for the full year it implies that the fourth quarter will be down mid single digits and understand the comp is more difficult than what you ve had in the past couple of quarters it still implies at the 2 year stack or 2 year average decelerates a bit chris maybe just provide a little bit of color on that and then i have a broader follow up christopher h peterson chief financial officer and president sure so let me address that straight away so as i mentioned in the prepared remarks we are in a more uncertain situation because of the delta variant so we ve chosen to provide a wider guidance range on top line than we normally would we did not guide for q4 specifically we guided for q3 and for the full year and obviously you can do the math to get through the implication but we are very much thinking about our guidance as a prudent guidance range and we are shooting for the higher end of our guidance range but given the external dynamics and the uncertainty we felt like it was prudent to maintain a wide range in this environment ravichandra k saligram president and chief executive officer chris may i add something there there are a couple of things recognized in q4 last year we had amazon s prime day that got shifted to q2 so there s a little bit of that shift but right now our visibility is closer to q3 and that s why we felt confident and that s what you should really look at is that we ve even for q3 despite the very strong comp last year the fact that we ve guided for growth and as chris said we re hoping to be on the higher side as opposed to the lower side and look even when we look at consumption i mentioned that q2 we saw healthy consumption growth where we ve just had the july numbers and we ll continue to see consumption growth so i m optimistic i think it s tough for us to give a real handle on q4 so we re just taking the prudent steps so i would not look at sort of q4 the arithmetic and say wow there is some huge trend change going on kevin michael grundy jefferies llc analyst got it that s helpful and then just a quick follow up on the pricing front maybe just remind us what portion of the portfolio you ve taken pricing on and the potential to take additional pricing in the remainder of the portfolio and i guess as it pertains to the latter understand there needs to be a cost justification but it s sort of hard to envision many categories where there s not a cost justification maybe you can just comment on that and then i ll pass it on christopher h peterson chief financial officer and president yes so we ve taken pricing in seven of our eight business units we re broadly pricing about over 80 of our portfolio we re taking pricing on and what i will say is that the pricing is not a single event because of the escalation of inflation as i mentioned when we started the year we thought that inflation was going to be a 210 million headwind at the end of the first quarter we thought it was going to be 360 million and now we re forecasting 560 million and so we ve taken sort of around the pricing that went into effect that in late june early july we ve announced or are announcing pricing additional pricing that s going into effect in the fourth quarter in october november and the combination of that i think is not fully pricing for inflation because we re also using productivity and operating leverage and cost controls to offset but we are pricing for a significant part of inflation which we think is prudent and so far our discussions with the retailers have gone reasonably well but we re managing it day in and day out kevin michael grundy jefferies llc analyst okay thank you both good luck operator our next question comes from wendy nicholson with citi wendy caroline nicholson citigroup analyst my first question i guess i have two but they re interrelated so first question is on category growth and obviously i think ravi you called out some of the great growth in the outdoor segment and how some of that i think is being fueled by obviously changed consumer behavior but also incentives and whatnot but i m wondering if you were getting any sense from your retail customers that wow everybody who wanted a new coleman chair or coleman cooler already has it and so is there any sign of slowing demand in that channel even if your market shares are good i m just interested in category growth if you will and then second i guess maybe for you chris on the pricing front some of your categories i mean my jaw dropped when you said you gained i think 700 points of share in gel pens i mean that s awesome but i assume competition is going to react to that so as you put through that pricing can you talk about kind of what you re modeling or expecting or starting to see from a competitive perspective maybe as some folks react to your share gains ravichandra k saligram president and chief executive officer so let me start with the consumption trends and then chris can address on the pricing so look we re seeing category growth in many of our businesses so you re seeing really like baby is a good example where you re seeing double digit category growth but having said that we re doing even better and that s by gaining share because of the strength of the graco brand and all the innovations that we are launching and i think the one of the factors because we always go to what is the underlying reason you re seeing a lot more i think people were cooped up last year start getting vaccinated feeling bolder to start driving into overnight trips therefore buying car seats this whole grandparents effect where people are trying to they re sometimes they re now they ve been at covid together so they re buying car seats so i think you re seeing the categories going up and the stimulus certainly helped and with the stimulus there has been a tendency to go to some of the premium brands and the leaders and graco has really benefited so that s a great example of that and specifically on outdoor we re doing a lot of great work and i think we re seeing the benefits of that even more this year because coleman was in a turnaround i think the team has done a great job on soft coolers for instance they ve come out with some nice steel belted coolers the whole dome tents that they ve come out with the onesource there have been a lot of innovations that have helped and if we look at category by category we ve certainly done well the thing that has really been a tough problem for us on the coleman brand has been keeping pace with demand we have been chasing demand because we get a lot of stuff from asia and so this is one where we ve had a real tough time keeping pace so the demand is certainly there and it s been so when we think about the second half too the supply thing is more in our minds rather than any worries about our brands at all now some of the consumption on like food and appliances in the u s there was some slowdown because last year they were up so much but then the good news is look food every one of our brands we re gaining share that just goes to the power of the strength of our brands and what our teams are doing and the innovations chris over to you christopher h peterson chief financial officer and president and on the pricing side we ve done a tremendous amount of work looking at elasticity models for pricing looking at the specific cost inflation and the thing that s important here i think is that the cost inflation that we re facing is not unique to us it s something that the entire industry is facing so and we re not fully pricing to recover because we re using the ramp up that we have in productivity savings we re going to generate productivity savings this year of 3 5 to 4 of cost of goods which is a very strong result on top of what we did last year and that s helping to partially mitigate and so as we take the pricing generally what we re hearing and we re monitoring it day by day is that the whole industry is moving prices up now in any particular category there could be a competitor that tries to lag us or maybe they price ahead of us and so that s what we re monitoring sort of on a day to day to make sure that we don t wind up with a sustainable price gap but our strategy is not to gain market share by undercutting people on price our strategy is to gain market share by coming out with very strong product innovation that offers a superior consumer value and that s when you hear us talk about market share gains it s not because we re trying to undercut anybody on price it s because we re driving innovation that s compelling for the consumer and for the retailer wendy caroline nicholson citigroup analyst fair enough makes great sense thank you operator we ll take our next question from bill chappell with truist securities william bates chappell truist securities analyst thanks good morning wendy caroline nicholson citigroup analyst good morning bill william bates chappell truist securities analyst just want to dig a little bit deeper on writing and development especially as we kind of go into the key third quarter in the release you said obviously consumption or sales were we re still below 2019 levels and that makes sense april may most of us and even june july still working from home but it seems like most businesses are kind of targeting a post labor day return kind of delta variant aside schools here in georgia and elsewhere i mean start in the next few weeks so trying to understand is there a pent up two questions there one do you think there s pent up demand just from the past 12 18 months where you could be well above 2019 levels especially on the office side schools seem like they would just kind of return to normal and then two everything we hear throughout the industry is supply sources and supply chain constraints do you have the bandwidth or the supply available to meet that need if there is that kind of surge or could there be out of stocks or issues where you can t capture the full demand over these next 3 four months ravichandra k saligram president and chief executive officer so bill i ll take the first one and then have chris deal with the second look our fervent wish is to try and get back to 2019 levels on writing and the team is really focused on that having said that the you pointed out the whole there is the office component of this now despite the fact that you re hearing all the stuff on the media and people going back to september but the delta variant is also creating already you ve seen some companies announce shifts through october we went to npd and looked at the survey they had done a very good where we saw i think they re forecasting that at least 1 3 of people will continue to be hybrid for a while so that does have an impact having said that it s still early days because look the back to school season has just taken off and we re still going into the height of it and the fact that as we said on writing it the core sales exceeded the company s average of 25 gives us great and look while it was below 19 it s just a little it s not we feel pretty good about the trends consumption is also up and then our market share is up overall writing not just gel pens so when i look at all of that i feel very bullish about writing and the last thing that you mentioned which we ve seen through the studies there are a lot of schools that have advanced by say five days to 7 so that s a positive thing and then colleges it s sort of this two freshman class that s coming in so i think we feel pretty good about what s happening on this business and believe me that team is very focused because they want to show that this is a top notch business christopher h peterson chief financial officer and president on the supply chain we are very well positioned on the writing business the vast majority of what we sell in writing is manufactured in the u s so we re not in this business dealing with ocean freight port issues availability of raw materials and components as we are on some of our other businesses and so we believe we re well positioned to respond and capitalize the upside the other thing i would point out is that is a positive is some of our competitors in writing are not as well positioned where they re not manufacturing in the u s and they re suffering from some supply issues and so supply could turn out to be a real benefit for us on the writing business versus at least one of our major competitors william bates chappell truist securities analyst got it that s helpful and just a follow up a couple of years ago the plan in part was divest some businesses use the cash do major share repurchase and that obviously changed i think for the better and holding on to some assets and not really doing a whole lot in share repurchase but now i mean hard to believe you re getting to the almost underlevered compared to your peer group and i know the biggest cash flow generating quarters are in the next 2 so is there a thought from you or the board of rethinking about stepping up share repurchase as we move into this kind of cash flow period christopher h peterson chief financial officer and president yes i think as we think about capital allocation the way we re thinking about it remains the same which is we expect number one to continue to drive very strong operating cash flow our first priority is to reinvest back in the business and we re looking for very strong return projects to do that that are well above our cost of capital we plan to maintain our current dividend we are getting close to the leverage target that we set of 3 0 times or 3 1 and i think beyond that we ll start to look at things like share repurchase as well as tuck in acquisitions to the extent that we think they can be significant value accretive to the company and so we re excited to get to our target on the balance sheet and we think that does open more flexibility as we go into the next few years ravichandra k saligram president and chief executive officer and bill one thing you ve mentioned dispositions look i think one of the things we i think we have good connections now we have a good portfolio that and i think we re getting more and more skilled at leveraging different aspects and we actually feel hey maybe it s too premature to declare that the turnaround is over but we certainly are thinking about what we want to be when we grow up and starting to think about our long term plans and really assigning roles for each businesses so i don t think i think the decisions we ve made on keeping the businesses we have is a good one and now it is a question of taking each one of these businesses to their full potential whatever that role might be william bates chappell truist securities analyst great thanks so much operator our next question will be taken from olivia tong with raymond james olivia tong cheang raymond james analyst wanted to talk first about your level of visibility on getting to your top line targets given obviously the supply chain challenges because obviously we re not just talking consumer demand but also the increased difficulty in satisfying that demand because of the externals you sort of touched on this with respect to writing but kind of curious on the rest of your key businesses where you stand with respect to that and i would imagine with respect to supply chain that two things one sort of major categories what your competition looks like again you talked about that with writing but kind of curious on the other categories and then also what you re seeing from them with respect to pricing is the magnitude similar is the timing similar and if not where do they differ christopher h peterson chief financial officer and president yes so on the supply chain as i mentioned in my prepared remarks it is a challenging external environment and the challenges are largely due to ocean freight availability of containers length of time it takes containerships to move from asia to the u s trucking capacity in the u s labor availability in the u s some raw material and component availability depending on the business unit and then you couple that with the consumer demand spike that we re trying to navigate and meet i think that we ve done our teams have done a really a heroic job of meeting and navigating through this environment but our guidance does contemplate that this environment remains difficult for the remainder of the year so we are not expecting an improvement in the external environment but we do expect us to continue to navigate it i think the good news is that this is not an environment that s unique to newell this is an environment that all of our competitors face i mentioned on writing that i think we re better positioned than at least one of our major competitors the balance of our categories i think we re largely similarly positioned and so we don t see major gaps in our external pressure versus our direct competitors external pressure on the whole so that s how i would characterize the supply chain and i think our part of the reason why we ve given a wide guidance range is recognizing the variability and the uncertainty of that supply environment including the ramp up of the delta variant which can have an impact on that as i said we re shooting more for the top half of our guidance range but we think it s prudent to maintain the guidance range given the variability in the external environment ravichandra k saligram president and chief executive officer yes i think one thing to add is overall more than 1 3 of our products are sourced from asia and that s why we do have some effects i mean the external effect is really the bigger issue as chris pointed out and so yes it s going to remain a bit of a challenge still christopher h peterson chief financial officer and president and your question on pricing i think it s different because we compete against many different competitors it s different by category in terms of what we re seeing but broadly we re seeing the industry take prices up because the inflation environment is affecting everybody and again it s not unique to us there can be timing differences in any particular category with a particular competitor and we re navigating that i think reasonably well and closely monitoring it as we go forward here olivia tong cheang raymond james analyst got it and then just one follow up on margins can you just give us a sense of sort of order of magnitude with respect to the increase in costs raw material cost inflation that sticks around for a while versus some of the supply chain disruption that hopefully is relatively transitory maybe if you could just break that down to the quarter and then the full year and how you think about the contribution from improving mixes and offset in addition to obviously the productivity things that you talked about christopher h peterson chief financial officer and president yes so i think on the inflation side is there are really four factors that are driving inflation increased resin costs sourced finished goods which is largely a function of the chinese currency strengthening versus the u s dollar transportation cost which is in our case is largely ocean freight related and then labor pressure the interesting thing about that is resin is probably the biggest impact out of those 4 out of our 560 million that we re talking about this year and one of the services that doesn t out front forecast on resin is ihs and at least their forecast is that we re at peak resin prices right now and resin prices are likely to come down significantly over the next six to 12 months now we re heading into hurricane season and so i never want to predict whether there s going to be a hurricane that hits the texas or louisiana coast but by all accounts it feels like the resin environment is sort of peaking at the moment and is likely to get better as we head over the next six to 12 months again on sourced finished goods it s hard to predict the chinese currency strengthened versus the u s dollar but has been relatively stable more recently and so we will begin to lap that unless there s another devaluation of the u s dollar i think ocean freight is likely to remain a challenge for the next six to 12 months because of the capacity constraints that carriers and containers have but this is not unique to newell but again it feels like that is transitory in nature and then i think labor costs is likely to be a sustaining inflationary pressure but that probably is the smallest of the four that i mentioned so we think we re navigating the peak inflation environment well we re excited that driving low single or i m sorry high single digit to low double digit operating income growth is what our guidance implies for this year despite this inflation and we think that the productivity savings that we ve got the cost management that we ve got and the top line momentum that we have positions us well as the inflation pressure starts to ease going forward olivia tong cheang raymond james analyst thanks so much really appreciate it operator we ll take the next question from peter grom with ubs peter k grom ubs investment bank analyst so i just wanted to ask around the kind of q3 margin ratio maybe just a follow up to olivia s question i mean what does the guidance embeds from a segment mix perspective you ve been pretty open about the mix tailwinds from a normal writing year so any commentary there would be really helpful and then just the advertising commentary chris you mentioned up significantly is that just a significant change versus what you were embedding in after q1 or is that just kind of a broader comment around year over year and then just is there just any way to think about or quantify the magnitude for advertising the advertising embedded in your q3 guidance christopher h peterson chief financial officer and president yes so on the q3 guidance i ll try to tackle them so if you recall last year at this time we were coming out of our supply chain being shut down and so our a p that was in the third quarter last year was artificially low this year we are in a much better supply situation than we were last year and so we have basically reinstated a p we also have much stronger innovation in the market this year and so advertising costs are up significantly this year versus last year both in dollar terms and in percentage terms on the inflation front in q3 as i mentioned we do expect inflation to be peaking in q3 of this year so our of our 560 million the biggest impact is to the third quarter on inflation and that is a fairly dramatic impact we are mitigating that to a significant extent through productivity actions and through cost containment and some volume leverage but that s what s driving and embedded in the q3 sort of margin guidance peter k grom ubs investment bank analyst okay great thank you ravichandra k saligram president and chief executive officer thank you very much i think we

ottawa canada reports from canada say canadian prime minister justin trudeau will schedule snap elections in september two years ahead of schedule trudeau believes he can strengthen his party s hold on power due to the success of high vaccination rates and a post pandemic rebound which he hopes will translate to increased votes the 49 year old trudeau would face his third election as prime minister trudeau s liberal party won a majority in 2015 however in 2019 elections he lost enough seats to force his party to form a coalition government to regain a majority the liberals would need to win another 15 seats in the 338 seat house of commons to be able to govern on their own a september vote would be an election of inches not giant steps we re looking at 15 seats or so according to allan tupper professor of political science at university of british columbia at vancouver as quoted by reuters failure would be not to win a majority and repeat the status quo tupper said trudeau however is gambling with his own future analysts believe that if trudeau and the liberals do not receive a majority of seats party members might seek a new leader of note the opposition conservative party remains behind the liberals in the polls polling suggests the liberals could win a majority in september as canadians return to a life free of covid and the economy is boosted by billions of government dollars current polling show the liberals winning 34 percent of the vote in september which would not allow them to form a majority government however trudeau is betting on winning a greater majority of votes in early 2021 45 percent of adults said the covid 19 response by the canadian government was by far the top issue for voters by the third quarter however it had fallen to the ninth most important issue according to a july 16 angus reid poll in canada covid 19 case numbers have fallen as have hospitalizations and deaths also vaccination levels are among the highest in the world
