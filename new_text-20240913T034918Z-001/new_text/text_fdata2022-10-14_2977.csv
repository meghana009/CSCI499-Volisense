iran is storing around 60 million barrels of sanctioned oil on board tankers operated and owned by the national iranian tanker company nitc a senior official from the firm told the straits times the official who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak for the state owned shipping firm said iran is utilising 80 per cent of its fleet for storing oil while the rest of its tankers transport crude from deep water anchorages in malaysia to china nitc is the biggest tanker operator in the islamic republic organisation of the petroleum exporting countries member iran had been pumping massive amounts of oil into its tankers over the past several months in anticipation that it would get relief from economic sanctions the west has imposed severe sanctions on iran in an attempt to slow down its nuclear programme which it believes is being developed for military use in 2015 an agreement was reached by a coalition of western powers whereby iran would limit its uranium enrichment activity however in 2018 then us president donald trump ditched the deal saying iranian leaders were not doing enough to curb the country s nuclear activities ballistic missile programme and regional influence and reimposed sanctions that have crippled iran s economy recent attempts at indirect talks on an accord formally known as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa have also broken down forcing teheran to revert back to covert oil sales the aim of the jcpoa is to keep iran from expanding its nuclear programme which many in the west suspect is for the sole purpose of developing nuclear weapons the official who was in singapore for a conference said the bulk of the fleet is currently anchored off kharg island a key iranian crude export terminal shipping brokers estimate that nitc has around 60 to 65 tankers the bulk of which are supertankers iran generally does not release official trade data and there is no definitive figure for its oil exports or how much oil it is currently storing on its ships in 2020 the united states government s office of foreign assets control blacklisted nitc for allegedly giving financial support to the islamic revolutionary guard corps qods force the qods is the branch of the revolutionary guards which operates outside of iran s borders members of the qods force have fought in support of president bashar al assad in syria s civil war and backed iraqi security forces in their battle against islamic state militants in recent years last month the us treasury department imposed sanctions on a network of companies involved in what it said was the sale of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of iranian petrochemical and petroleum products to south and east asia the action targeted iranian brokers and front companies in the united arab emirates hong kong and india it said washington has also increasingly targeted chinese companies over the export of iran s oil as the prospects of reviving the nuclear pact have dimmed mr emril jamil senior crude analyst at refinitiv a unit of the london stock exchange group said iran is now getting desperate and selling the sanctioned oil at much lower prices as it fights to defend market share in china china is now iran s biggest client and with competition from the russian barrels teheran has no choice but to cut prices he added before russia invaded ukraine in late february around half of russia s crude and petroleum product exports went to europe according to the international energy agency now russia whose oil is shunned by the european union is the third largest supplier of crude oil to asia after saudi arabia and the united arab emirates after it began to divert shipments elsewhere at discounted rates russia has also become the largest supplier to china having sold close to 1 77 million barrels per day in september representing around 17 per cent of that nation s market mr jamil said it is rare to see direct oil shipments from iran to china according to refinitiv data just two supertankers were seen to have sailed from kharg island to china in august the vessels were carrying about two million barrels of crude each ms emma li a senior analyst at data intelligence firm vortexa said china imported about 600 000 barrels per day bpd of iranian crude in the third quarter slightly higher than the same period in 2021 which it had assessed at 550 000 bpd source the straits times

senior officials from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and their allies opec have offered a variety of explanations for last week s decision to reduce their collective production target the most common is that the organisation is being proactive and pre emptive ahead of a possible downturn in the global business cycle and petroleum consumption uncertainty surrounding the economy and oil market was cited in the group s oct 5 press release announcing production targets would be cut by 2 million barrels per day with effect from november other comments from ministers and officials in recent weeks have focused on the need to balance production and consumption avoid an unplanned increase in inventories boost investment or preserve spare capacity some of these arguments are stronger than others but the idea of holding some capacity in reserve so output can be increased during some future emergency is based on faulty logic especially when inventories are already low in trying to keep inventories low through the cycle opec risks worsening any global recession and overtightening the market during the next upturn inventories and spare capacity inventories and spare capacity are alternative shock absorbers dampening short term price swings caused by unanticipated changes in production or consumption if consumption is unexpectedly strong or there is a sudden loss of output caused by sanctions sabotage or accident the first impact is a depletion of inventories or call on unused capacity conversely if demand disappoints or supply grows faster than forecast the first impact is inventory accumulation or idling of additional capacity inventories and spare capacity are in some sense substitutes for each other the problem is that petroleum inventories around the world have already depleted to the lowest levels for more than a decade u s petroleum inventories including the strategic reserve have depleted in 86 of the last 118 weeks by a total of 480 million barrels and are at the lowest seasonal level since 2004 u s distillate stocks have depleted in 69 of the last 118 weeks by a total of 66 million barrels and are at the lowest seasonal level since weekly records began in 1982 on a monthly basis stocks fell to the lowest seasonal level since 1996 and before that 1954 in july the most recent month for which data is available european distillate inventories have fallen by 122 million barrels over the last two years and are at the lowest seasonal level since 2002 singapore distillate stocks have fallen by 9 million barrels since late 2020 and are at the lowest seasonal level since 2006 inventories have fallen so low they can no longer play much of a role as shock absorbers in the event of stronger than expected consumption or a sudden loss in production severely depleted inventories the extreme backwardation in brent futures prices is a symptom global petroleum inventories have become uncomfortably low brent s six month calendar spread has softened into a backwardation of less than 9 per barrel from almost 22 in the aftermath of russia s invasion of ukraine but the spread is still in the 98th percentile for all trading days since 1990 a signal the production consumption inventory balance is expected to remain tight extreme backwardation implies the need to stem the two year depletion of inventories and rebuild them to more comfortable levels by accelerating production and or restraining consumption balancing risks amid uncertainty when spare capacity and inventories are both low the volatility reducing course is to put whatever spare capacity there is into production immediately to accumulate inventories pre emptively spare capacity can play a more useful role accumulating inventories before a positive consumption shock or a negative production shock than immediately afterwards if put into production extra capacity can accumulate a stock of extra petroleum inventories over multiple months whereas in the aftermath of a shock it can only supply a much smaller increase in daily flows the more volatility reducing policy for opec last week would have been to leave production unchanged and allow inventories to rise modestly to more normal levels if over production persisted for more than a few months and inventories ended up on course to rise above normal there would be plenty of time for the group to reduce output by cutting production pre emptively opec is preventing inventories normalising leaving them too low to avoid future shocks from higher consumption or lost output in the event that the global economy avoids a recession china s growth accelerates or there is a major interruption to russian oil supplies inventories will be too low to respond and it will be too late to rebuild them proactive or reactive policy the proactive production cuts announced last week stand in contrast to the second quarter of this year when inventories were falling and prices rising rapidly in that instance opec resisted calls from the u s government and other policymakers to boost output faster preferring to wait and react to any future supply disruption rather than use reserve capacity to build inventories opec decision making has been proactive in responding to rising inventories and falling prices but reactive or passive in response to rising prices and falling stocks even if the group presents its decisions in terms of balancing production and consumption its actions reveal a preference for lower inventories and higher prices political and economic fallout the opec decision has thrust the group into the heart of the diplomatic and economic maelstrom whether that was its intention or not saudi diplomats and surrogates insist the kingdom was acting only in its own interest to protect prices and maximise revenues in the context of a deteriorating global economy most economic forecasters anticipate global growth will slow sharply in the remainder of 2022 and into 2023 which will induce a slowdown in oil consumption growth but the timing duration and depth of the next downturn remains uncertain as does any reduction in oil consumption either in absolute terms or relative to trend u s treasury secretary janet yellen has described the opec decision as unhelpful and unwise because it risks keeping prices for consumers high even as the economy weakens worsening recessionary pressures the planned cut has also been denounced by policymakers in the united states as a diplomatic snub after president joe biden met with saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman in july as a result biden is re evaluating u s relations with saudi arabia the white house spokesman told reporters on oct 11 source reuters editing by kirsten donovan

the house democrats and rinos behind the theatrical january 6 kangaroo court on thursday put on their final and most dramatic act before the upcoming november midterms concluding the hearing with a unanimous resolution to subpoena former president donald trump as if that s the magic ticket to saving democratic candidates across the country who are already in line for the slaughter advertisement regardless the hearing sparked a near immediate response from the former president who in a series of three truth social posts responded to the main topics of today s hearing excoriating them in the process thursday s house j6 committee hearing marked the ninth such event since the entire charade began earlier this year trump first responded to the sham committee s airing of never before seen footage of house speaker nancy pelosi d calif and then senate minority leader chuck schumer d n y huddling in the basement of the capitol building during the jan 6 protests the committee highlighted several scenes in which pelosi can be seen consulting with various officials regarding a military and police response to the protests it s thought by some that the house committee aired the footage to sort of vindicate the democratic speaker who many still believe is responsible for the chaos that occurred that day due to a lack of proper response before and during the unfolding dangerous event as trump noted in his post this footage was shot by alexandra pelosi the speaker s documentary filmmaker daughter who was present to capture her mother during the historic day per person familiar w the footage jacqueline alemany jaxalemany october 13 2022 why didn t crazy nancy pelosi call out the troops before january 6th which i strongly recommended that she do it was her responsibility but she didn t like the look crazy nancy failed the american people trump wrote advertisement in his second post trump took another jab at the unselect committee for completely ignoring the possibility that voter fraud could have taken place before during and after the 2020 election the unselect committee knowingly failed to examine the massive voter fraud which took place during the 2020 presidential election the reason for what took place on january 6th trump wrote the former president in his third post asked a question echoed by several pundits in the wake of today s hearing which was technically reclassified as a business meeting why did the committee wait until its final hearing to call trump forward as a witness that s pretty much the opposite of the entire point of an investigation why didn t the unselect committee ask me to testify months ago why did they wait until the very end the final moments of their last meeting because the committee is a total bust that has only served to further divide our country which by the way is doing very badly a laughing stock all over the world the former president wrote any honest observer can deduce that the house j6 committee used the subpoena vote as a political weapon to muddy trump s name ahead of the midterm elections and especially ahead of the 2024 presidential election trump will likely let out a hearty laugh when he tears their subpoena in half and tosses it in the wastebasket as the j6 committee is widely predicted to be disbanded after republicans take majority control of the lower chamber no matter what they try in the meantime trump will cite executive privilege or worst case take the fifth to avoid testimony and that will spark legal battles that will outlast the life of the committee itself proving this is nothing less than a massive waste of taxpayer time and money advertisement cnn msnbc and a handful of establishment media outlets will run with the story for a day or two but at the end of the day a majority of americans are far more concerned with president joe biden s record high grocery and gas prices than they are with something that happened nearly two years ago i d tell the j6 committee nice try but it really wasn t

budget re drawn after days of open revolt among tory mps and an emerging market consensus that another u turn is on the cards however according to the bbc the chancellor has now cancelled planned meetings in the us and is leaving a day early for crunch talks in the uk over the mini budget in the early hours of friday morning the national broadcaster as well as the times and the financial times began reporting that mr kwarteng had cancelled appointments at the imf meetings and was flying home the pa news agency has contacted the treasury for comment the prime minister s key pledge to scrap the planned increase in corporation tax from 19 to 25 is widely seen as a likely casualty in the coming days as ms truss seeks to save her embattled premiership it comes amid reports that senior tories are plotting the possibility of replacing ms truss with a joint ticket of rishi sunak and penny mordaunt with the times newspaper also reporting that party grandees are considering replacing her with a unity candidate chancellor of the exchequer kwasi kwarteng aaron chown pa downing street on thursday did not deny that the potential exists for a reversal on the corporation tax policy one of the landmark promises made by ms truss in her pitch to become tory leader it came amid reports that talks were under way between no 10 and the treasury on abandoning elements of the 43 billion tax cutting plan speculation was fuelled further when the chancellor in an interview with the telegraph only said let s see when asked about the expectation from financial markets that the government could ditch its corporation tax promise friday is set to be a crunch day in the financial markets with the bank of england s emergency bond buying scheme due to come to an end officials stepped in two weeks ago after the mini budget sent markets into chaos amid concerns over higher borrowing costs triggering concerns in particular about the fate of pension funds a growing expectation on thursday of a government u turn on corporation tax appeared to reassure the finance industry after bank of england governor andrew bailey spooked the markets by insisting that the emergency support would not be extended mr kwarteng also insisted to the telegraph that there would be no real cuts to public spending appearing to double down on comments made in the commons by the prime minister on wednesday but he told the paper let s face it there are difficult choices within that you have to prioritise you have to make sure that you know the public is getting value for money and i make no apologies for that there has to be some sort of fiscal discipline in the same interview he was insistent that his party could still be trusted with the public finances we re conservatives fiscal discipline runs right through our dna he told the paper the government s plans revolve around securing an increase in economic growth with a target of an annual rise of around 2 5 in gross domestic product gdp the crucial date will be october 31 when the forecasts presented by the office for budget responsibility obr alongside the chancellor s statement will give an assessment on whether such a plan is realistic mr kwarteng on thursday was insisting that his position was safe telling broadcasters in washington i am not going anywhere it comes amid speculation in westminster about the fate of the chancellor only a few weeks into the job if his financial plans are torn up in the coming days chancellor kwasi kwarteng has insisted his position is safe jacob king pa former tory chancellor and party grandee ken clarke said that ms truss could not be able to make mr kwarteng a scapegoat but it comes amid mounting anger and unrest within the conservatives about the crisis of recent weeks newly elected foreign affairs committee chair alicia kearns told lbc s tonight with andrew marr that she wanted the prime minister to succeed but added her voice to calls for a change of course on the mini budget she said the markets are not woke the markets are not left the fact they are not lefty anti government the fact they have been spooked is something that should be taken incredibly seriously former veterans minister johnny mercer also tweeted that the situation needs a course correction from no 10 get on and do it we all know it s coming but amid reports of a coronation of a new leader to save the tories from a crushing defeat at the next election some warned against such a drastic move one senior tory told pa that any move to replace ms truss would be completely bonkers and

began reporting that mr kwarteng had cancelled appointments at the imf meetings and was flying home the pa news agency has contacted the treasury for comment the prime minister s key pledge to scrap the planned increase in corporation tax from 19 to 25 is widely seen as a likely casualty in the coming days as ms truss seeks to save her embattled premiership it comes amid reports that senior tories are plotting the possibility of replacing ms truss with a joint ticket of rishi sunak and penny mordaunt with the times newspaper also reporting that party grandees are considering replacing her with a unity candidate chancellor of the exchequer kwasi kwarteng aaron chown pa downing street on thursday did not deny that the potential exists for a reversal on the corporation tax policy one

could ditch its corporation tax promise friday is set to be a crunch day in the financial markets with the bank of england s emergency bond buying scheme due to come to an end officials stepped in two weeks ago after the mini budget sent markets into chaos amid concerns over higher borrowing costs triggering concerns in particular about the fate of pension funds a growing expectation on thursday of a government u turn on corporation tax appeared to reassure the finance industry after bank of england governor andrew bailey spooked the markets by insisting that the emergency support would not be extended mr kwarteng also insisted to the telegraph that there would be no real cuts to public spending appearing to double down on comments made in the commons by the prime minister on wednesday but he told the paper let s face it there are difficult choices within that you have to prioritise you have to make sure that you know the public is getting value for money and i make no apologies for that there has to be some sort of fiscal discipline in the same interview he was insistent that his party could still be trusted with the public finances we re conservatives fiscal discipline runs right through our dna he told the paper the government s plans revolve around securing an increase in economic growth with a target of an annual rise of around 2 5 in gross domestic product gdp the crucial date will be october 31 when the forecasts presented by the office for budget responsibility obr alongside the chancellor s statement will give an assessment on whether such a plan is realistic mr kwarteng on thursday was insisting that his position was safe telling broadcasters in washington i am not going anywhere it comes amid speculation in westminster about the fate of the chancellor only a few weeks into the job if his financial plans are torn up in the coming days chancellor kwasi kwarteng has insisted his position is safe jacob king pa former tory chancellor and

grocery shoppers at a store in rosemead calif higher prices for food contributed to an annual inflation rate of 8 2 in september frederic j brown afp getty images that turkey you re planning for the big family get together is going to give you a nasty peck on the pocketbook so will the flour for the gravy and the butter for the rolls the latest government report on consumer prices released thursday showed poultry prices are up a whopping 17 from a year ago flour is up 24 butter and margarine are up 32 the pain did not stop with the traditional holiday menu almost across the board inflation showed few signs of slacking and in areas central to most consumers everyday lives prices are rising at faster rates than many americans have seen in their lifetimes the results could include a recession changes in consumers spending patterns and standards of living and political upheavals in next month s pivotal national elections it s pretty insane said laura shouse a small business owner in huntington beach referring to soaring prices especially of the organic grass fed foods that she buys shouse s answer for this thanksgiving buy a smaller bird than usual have more family and friends bring side dishes and pick a little more from her booster garden during these times the most immediate result of the new price report is that the federal reserve is now almost certain to give interest rates another boost perhaps even going beyond the three quarter percentage point increases it has announced for the last several months u s stocks initially tumbled on the inflation news then surged ending the day sharply higher after one of the biggest market swings in years analysts were stunned by the huge reversal with some speculating that perhaps the report wasn t as bad as it appeared or that the market was already down too much i think it simply got too cheap said christopher rupkey chief economist at fwdbonds in new york for consumers however it was hard to see a silver lining higher interest rates for example will push new car prices still higher increase the cost of buying a house and further lift already soaring rents on houses and apartments adding to the blow consumers who stashed away substantial nest eggs during the covid 19 lockdowns have drawn down those savings which means overall spending power is likely to shrink continued inflation is also eating into the wage gains many americans have made a recession would add to the problem with more layoffs and less hiring just when the experts thought inflation might be cooling as gas costs have come down from their summer highs the latest numbers show it s still raging across the economy the annual inflation rate at 8 2 in september was just a notch below august and stayed near a four decade high the government said thursday and so called core inflation which excludes volatile food and energy items hit a new 40 year high last month now an issue that many people could all but ignore in the recent past is turning into something that s hurting them in just about every corner of their personal lives thursday s report showed pockets of relief for consumers prices of clothes appliances and used cars actually declined over the month but there s been no letup in the sticker shock for new cars and trucks which had been fueled by a shortage of the computer chips that today s cars can t run without new vehicle prices are up 19 from two years ago and to add insult to injury consumers auto insurance costs surged last month joining the double digit inflation club moreover people may be reluctant to travel over the holidays as gas prices after falling from more than 5 a gallon nationally in june have been creeping higher and are now back to nearly 4 in california regular gas on thursday averaged a whopping 6 20 a gallon the cost for medical care rose sharply last month and so did veterinary services transportation services rose as repair shops raised their prices and airfares went up further these higher costs are squeezing many more people some of whom are tapping their credit cards and home equity lines to make up the difference between their paychecks and rising prices in september the average hourly wages for all private sector employees were up 4 9 from a year earlier well short of the year over year change in prices for retirees the september inflation numbers brought separate welcome news that social security recipients will see an 8 7 bump in benefits next year the biggest increase in more than 40 years the social security administration s annual cost of living adjustment is based on the government s consumer price index in the prior year s third quarter this year the increase was 5 9 although higher medicare premiums ate up some of those gains the upcoming raise should provide some relief to the 70 million social security beneficiaries i m looking forward to it said tom stapleton a retired workplace training consultant who lives in glendale people dependent on the federal government s retirement or supplemental income programs have been hit especially hard by soaring prices for necessities such as food our folks think that will quickly be offset by the rise in cost of living so at best stabilizing said renée ward founder of seniors4hire org an orange county based organization that helps older workers nationwide find employment still she said of the step up in social security payments that s a good thing all things considered at least it won t drive us further back americans may express their unhappiness over inflation at the polls next month the unsettled economy has been a primary reason for president biden s low approval rating and with control of congress at stake in the midterm election republicans have seized on what has been the biggest economic issue for policymakers business leaders and consumers washington s emergency pandemic programs approved during the trump and biden administrations turbocharged spending that boosted demand for goods even as manufacturing and delivery problems limited supplies which helped fuel inflation supply chain bottlenecks have since eased but with the reopening of the economy and the still sizable amount of excess savings american consumers are getting out more and spending on travel eating out and other services and many businesses have been able to pass on their higher costs for supplies labor and other expenses to customers that has also helped keep job growth robust employers in september created 263 000 additional jobs about three times more than what s needed to keep pace with the workforce population growth the unemployment rate last month matched a half century low of 3 5 up to now layoffs have been mostly limited to tech firms and sectors such as real estate and finance which are always highly sensitive to changes in interest rates in the rest of the economy most businesses have been reluctant to let employees go given the tight supply of workers and the still solid demand from consumers nonetheless the hot labor market and broader economy may be cooling given the higher interest rates the threat of ever rising oil prices and the war in ukraine which are slowing trade and adding to uncertainty the fed wants both job growth and overall economic growth to slow down enough to drive inflation back to its 2 target and the central bank is planning to keep raising interest rates until it gets the results it wants even at the risk of causing a recession for now most economists are still hopeful that the u s will avoid a serious downturn thanks to the still solid labor market and relatively healthy financial condition of most households at this time i believe the worst case scenario is a mild recession said bernard baumohl chief global economist at the economic outlook group in princeton n j at least some business owners would agree among them daniel swenson klatt a former middle school teacher turned entrepreneur the 60 year old has been running butter bakery cafe in minneapolis for the last 17 years like many other shops his breakfast and sandwich place has benefited from the reopening of the economy and in august swenson klatt felt like things were going back to the pre pandemic days he started getting orders again from a neighborhood theater for cookies and treats served during intermission wow maybe we re back he thought to himself but september was a whole different story he saw fewer customers and more of them were being cautious moreover he had to close his cafe on saturdays during the entire month because he didn t have enough cooks he pays his employees 16 25 an hour to start his costs for materials and supplies were up 15 to 20 from a year ago and have nearly doubled for paper goods such as bags and cups prompting butter bakery to add a packaging charge for customers still swenson klatt doesn t sense that his customers are bracing for a deep recession nor is he panicking it s been a crazy period coming out of the pandemic he said and we re all trying to find that normal again this story originally appeared in los angeles times

u s secretary of defense lloyd austin attends a briefing during the second of two days of defense ministers meetings at nato headquarters on thursday oct 13 2022 in brussels belgium omar havana getty images tns moscow and nato are both proceeding with nuclear exercises even as tensions escalate over russian president vladimir putin s threats to use all means available including atomic weapons to defend land he claims to be russian the drills come as russia steps up its missile attacks on ukraine nearly eight months into its invasion and as its troops struggle to make headway on the ground putin has recently moved to annex parts of ukraine and is mobilizing as many as 300 000 russian reservists the difficulties facing russia s military in ukraine have raised concerns that putin could yet resort to some sort of nuclear strike although u s and european officials say they have detected no change in moscow s nuclear posture or any unusual movement of its atomic stocks the russian defense ministry said in a statement thursday that it conducted exercises involving an unspecified number of yars mobile ground based missile systems with troops testing how to hide them from aerial reconnaissance systems and protect them from saboteurs on the ground more than 3 000 troops and about 300 vehicles took part according to the statement it s unclear if those drills will continue into friday or beyond moscow has not yet stated if it plans to conduct a grom strategic nuclear exercise which traditionally takes place in october and generally involves submarines planes and missiles russia did not hold the drills in 2021 due to the covid 19 pandemic although grom exercises were held in february of this year shortly before it invaded ukraine on feb 24 belarusian president alexander lukashenko watched those strategic tests with putin from a monitoring center at the kremlin asked about the potential for another russian nuclear exercise soon nato secretary general jens stoltenberg replied we have monitored russian nuclear forces for decades and of course we will continue to monitor them very closely what i can say is that this exercise the russian exercise is an annual exercise an exercise where they test their nuclear forces he told reporters thursday in brussels we will monitor that as we always do russia has conducted other military drills since its invasion of ukraine and they were not a prelude to bigger action against kyiv still if i were going to hide an attack that s how i would do it exercises said william alberque director of strategy technology and arms control at the london based international institute for strategic studies he noted russia had previously used exercises to mask preparations for attacks including in its invasion of georgia in 2008 in the case of ukraine russia did not attempt to hide its military buildup on the border before it went in moving from exercise to an operation could be fairly swift making the window to assess and react to any switch very tight according to a european defense official who asked not to be identified talking about sensitive matters meanwhile around 14 members of the north atlantic treaty organization will take part in steadfast noon starting monday and located in the western part of europe more than 621 miles from russia s border according to a nato official the exercise which runs for two weeks will test a mix of more than 50 fighter escort and surveillance jets as well as tankers needed for a nuclear mission but will not use any live bombs the drills will involve flights from an air force base in the northeast of belgium to test procedures related to the dropping of nuclear bombs belgian broadcaster vrt nws reported citing a person it did not identify asked at a briefing earlier in the week whether there were concerns the nato drills could further raise tensions with russia stoltenberg said it would send a very wrong signal if we suddenly now canceled a routine long time planned exercise because of the war in ukraine speaking to reporters in brussels on wednesday u s defense secretary lloyd austin said allies continue to monitor for any shift by russia toward using nuclear weapons we ve not seen any indicators at this point that would lead us to believe that austin said but again it s not something we look at once and leave alone this is something we remain focused on 24 hours a day seven days a week 2022 bloomberg l p visit bloomberg com distributed by tribune content agency llc

a new report card on the nation s largest grocery chains shows that most are getting a failing grade on their policies toward eliminating routine antibiotic use in the store brand meat and poultry they sell the superbugs in stock report produced by a coalition of public health animal welfare and food safety groups finds that of the nation s top 12 grocery chains 8 received an f grade for their antibiotic policies and meat sourcing practices for meat and poultry products sold under their private labels the highest grade awarded was a c previous reports by the antibiotics off the menu coalition have focused on us restaurant chains and their policies and practices regarding antibiotic use in the beef they serve with the aim of encouraging the industry and consumers to put more pressure on meat suppliers to reduce antibiotic overuse in beef cattle consumer pressure has been a significant factor in getting the poultry industry to significantly reduce antibiotic use the authors say grocery stores where roughly 50 of meat products sold in the united states are bought are another venue where pressure can be applied grocery stores are a primary way that people purchase meat and they re one of the main ways consumers get information about the meat that they re buying report contributor matt wellington of the us pirg public interest research group education fund told cidrap news they can have a real impact here if they step up and commit to sourcing meat raised without overusing antibiotics approximately two thirds of the medically important antibiotics those antibiotics that are also used in human medicine sold in the united states are used within the livestock sector but they are often used for more than simply treating sick animals while us meat producers aren t allowed to use medically important antibiotics to promote animal growth they are allowed to use them for disease prevention a practice that critics say contributes to the development and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria and covers up for practices that increase the disease risk for animals lack of policies reporting verification the report analyzes the antibiotic use policies and practices of grocery chains and grades them on steps taken to reduce antibiotic overuse in their private label meat products which is where the authors say the chains have the most oversight and leverage according to the report private label meat products accounted for 25 of total meat products on shelves across the grocery industry in 2021 the grades were based on the following criteria whether the chains had a meaningful publicly available policy that prohibits the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion or disease prevention in meat sold through their private labels the strength of the language in the policy whether the policy applied to all major meat groups beef turkey chicken pork whether the policy is tied to a deadline and linked to broader animal welfare commitments the companies were also graded on their responses to a survey that asked additional questions about antibiotic use policies lead author annette manusevich of world animal protection said that to get an a grocery chains would need to have an animal welfare policy that requires all suppliers of private label meat and poultry to have a clear policy to eliminate medically important antibiotics for disease prevention a policy that prohibits close confinement of animals and painful procedures a requirement that meat suppliers track and report antibiotic use and independent third party verification we were looking for more transparency more auditing and more clear policies that really stress the elimination of medically and medically important antibiotics for disease prevention purposes she said few of the grocery chains met those criteria of the 12 target received the highest grade earning a c with a time bound antibiotic use policy that applies to each species of animal products sold under their private label and is linked to broader animal welfare concerns ahold delhaize the parent company of stop and shop food lion and other grocery chains received a c for a policy that applies across animal species but target didn t provide any information on what portion of meat it sells through its private labels meets its antibiotic use commitments while ahold delhaize s policy had no timeframe for implementing the policy across its meat and poultry supply chain and neither chain has taken steps to verify whether its meat suppliers are complying with their policies among the other chains reviewed costco and meijer received a d and eight including kroger aldi walmart and trader joe s received an f the report found that these companies some of which are among the top five in the country based on annual revenue had no publicly available policy on antibiotic use in meat products we believe the grocery stores have a vital role to play in building a more humane and sustainable food system that protects our health and our resources and animals as well manusevich said evaluating them has shown that there is a great deal of improvement that can be made in this sector regarding antibiotic policies providing a kick start for grocery chains the report argues that clear policies and third party verification by grocery chains on antibiotic use in their meat supply is important because while some meat products sold in grocery stores have labels such as raised without antibiotics or no antibiotics ever and consumers typically pay more for those products those labels don t have an enforcement mechanism in fact a recent study found that in 42 of raised without antibiotics certified feed yards at a single cattle slaughter facility at least one animal tested positive for antibiotics the products that grocery stores stock the information provided in stores and even the placement of products often dictates the purchasing decisions of the consumer the report states it is their responsibility to provide consumer safe food options and meat and poultry products that contribute to the rise and spread of antibiotic resistant infections are misaligned with this obligation going forward the report calls on grocery chains to make firm timebound commitments to phase out routine antibiotic use for disease prevention across all meat supply chains work closely with meat producers improve data collection regarding how meat suppliers are using antibiotics and share those data with the public they also urge consumers to encourage grocery chains to sell only meat raised without routine use of antibiotics wellington says the goal is to kick start grocery chains into understanding the importance of antibiotic resistance which recent research estimates was directly linked to nearly 1 3 million deaths in 2019 and is getting worse we re talking about preserving the foundations of modern medicine and they have a role to play in doing that he said

fed officials worried more about doing too little on inflation than too much federal reserve officials agreed they needed to raise interest rates to a more restrictive level and then maintain them there for some time to meet their goal of lowering broad based and unacceptably high inflation a readout of last month s policy meeting showed many u s central bank officials emphasized the cost of taking too little action to bring down inflation likely outweighed the cost of taking too much action the minutes of the sept 20 21 meeting said with many of them also stressing the importance of staying the course on the inflation fight even as the labor market slowed at last month s meeting fed officials raised interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point for the third straight time in an effort to drive inflation down from 40 year highs and fed chair jerome powell vowed afterward that they would keep at it until we re confident the job is done that said the minutes also contained a hint of a downshift in the pace of future monetary tightening with several policymakers saying it would be important to calibrate the pace of further rate hikes to reduce the risk of significant adverse effects on the economy nothing indicates a departure from the view expressed in fed policymaker forecasts that another 75 basis point rate hike is likely coming next month with a further half percentage point hike in december wrote gregory daco chief economist at ey parthenon still there is an increasingly perceptible desire to taper the pace of rate hikes in the context of elevated global economic and financial market uncertainty in the midst of a globally synchronized but uncoordinated tightening of monetary policy since last month s meeting policymakers have been united in emphasizing the urgent need to address inflation which they fear risks becoming embedded even if their aggressive policy tightening comes at a cost of higher unemployment the minutes underscored that view several policymakers the minutes said underlined the need to maintain a restrictive stance for as long as necessary with a couple of these participants stressing that historical experience demonstrated the danger of prematurely ending periods of tight monetary policy designed to bring down inflation at the same time several policymakers also nodded to the eventual need to ease up noting that as policy moved into restrictive territory risks would become more two sided reflecting the emergence of the downside risk that the cumulative restraint in aggregate demand would exceed what was required to bring inflation back to 2 among those several were a few that thought the downside risk was heightened by the potential headwinds from tighter monetary policy and weaker growth globally fed vice chair lael brainard earlier this week appeared to take a bit of that view on board making no bones about the need to drive rates high enough and keep them there for long enough to bring down inflation leavened with some caution around rising risks as other global central banks raise rates they ve been talking about how they re willing to risk a recession in order to bring inflation back under control but its possible that as the recession risks increase they may lose their nerve a little bit said chris zaccarelli chief investment officer at independent advisor alliance in charlotte north carolina turning point the last several weeks have marked a turning point for financial markets that for much of the year had clung to a conviction that the fed would swiftly reverse course next year and cut rates in the face of slowing growth and higher joblessness fed officials have pushed back on that expectation saying they expect to leave rates elevated for some time after they have finished lifting them as markets have fully digested the fed s hawkishness the result has been crushing losses for u s stock markets rapidly rising yields on government debt and a surging dollar that has aggravated weak conditions in overseas markets policymaker projections released at last month s meeting show the fed s target policy rate currently in a range of 3 00 3 25 its highest since 2008 rising to the 4 25 4 50 range by the end of this year and ending 2023 at 4 50 4 75 the year end 2022 projection suggests one more 75 basis point hike is likely at the central bank s remaining two meetings of the year recent inflation data has shown little to no improvement despite the fastest pace of rate hikes in 40 years and the labor market remains robust with wages increasing solidly as well7 after the release of the minutes on wednesday financial markets continued to reflect expectations for the fed to raise interest rates along the path signaled in policymakers projections but investors are also betting that by late 2023 the fed will reverse course and begin cutting rates source reuters

the food and drug administration on wednesday confirmed a nationwide shortage of the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medication adderall more than two months after some pharmacies reported difficulties filling prescriptions the shortage affects the immediate release form of adderall a stimulant that helps manage adhd symptoms the fda said in a statement that it was in frequent communication with all manufacturers of amphetamine mixed salts and one of those companies teva is experiencing ongoing intermittent manufacturing delays teva pharmaceuticals is the country s largest manufacturer of adderall it first reported delays in filling orders in august attributing them to a labor shortage on its packaging line that it said had since been resolved spokesperson kelley dougherty said thursday that teva expects inventory recovery in the coming months teva has active supply of both branded adderall and its generic version and continues to produce and refill the channel regularly at levels above historical demand it is possible that some people may encounter a backorder intermittently based on timing and demand but these are only temporary she said in a statement dougherty added that teva expects intermittent delays through end of year the supply from the other adderall manufacturers isn t enough to meet the need the fda said the fda suggested that patients should work with their health care professionals to determine their best treatment option which may include alternatives like the drug s extended release formulation the shortage has been a mess for people who take adhd stimulants said dr gabrielle shapiro a psychiatrist and a professor at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai in new york shapiro who sees patients of all ages said the challenge is particularly acute for children who have been off their medication as the new school year has started parents are panicked their children are being sent home from school or told they cannot come back if they are not on their meds said shapiro who is also a member of the american psychiatric association s council on children adolescents and their families i have high school students that are trying to take their sats and do their applications for college and they can t focus they can t get them done i have high school students that are trying to take their sats and do their applications for college and they can t focus they can t get them done psychiatrist dr gabrielle shapiro adderall is a controlled substance regulated by the federal drug enforcement administration dougherty said teva is working closely with our manufacturing facility and the dea to see what additional volume we may be able to support in the future emily hoffman 34 of seattle said she has ping ponged between pharmacies trying to find one with adderall in stock recently she said she had to go a week without her medication the fact that it s controlled means you can t ask for the prescription early she said i have to call when i m down to my last pill or two at parker s pharmacy in baton rouge louisiana sales director tylan jones said that he has been able to fill adderall prescriptions for current patients but that there have been delays he has had to turn away patients from other pharmacies because there isn t enough supply for both current and new customers and pharmacies are subject to limits on how much of a controlled substance they can distribute we don t want to neglect our patients that we re currently filling here so unfortunately we have to send some patients on their way jones said patients sometimes get very frustrated aggravated sometimes even aggressive he said but i would say usually it s just patients are disappointed and anxious while adderall has been in short supply before the fda reported a shortage from september 2019 through this may jones said this shortage has been unusually difficult it is something we ve seen before but not to the severity this bad before he said the shortage has hit pharmacies differently some pharmacies have been having trouble filling adderall prescriptions since the summer a survey by the national community pharmacists association conducted from july 25 through aug 5 found that roughly 64 of about 360 independent pharmacies that responded were having difficulty obtaining adderall large pharmacy chains cvs and walgreens told nbc news in late august that they weren t experiencing widespread problems although many people who had unsuccessfully tried to fill their prescriptions at those pharmacies voiced frustration on social media at the time cvs said thursday it was aware of intermittent shortages of generic amphetamine medication in the supply chain as for the patients who say the shortages have stretched as far back as august cvs health spokesperson matt blanchette said only we are working with our patients to meet their needs walgreens didn t answer questions about its current adderall supply other than to reiterate that the fda had confirmed a nationwide shortage questions about supply and availability need to be directed to manufacturers it said a crucial tool in managing adhd adhd is a neurodevelopmental condition marked by inattentiveness impulsivity and or hyperactivity that is severe enough to interfere with school work and other aspects of life the centers for disease control and prevention estimates based on data from 2016 to 2019 that about 10 of children are diagnosed with it with boys more likely to receive diagnoses adderall and other stimulant drugs are commonly used to manage adhd and demand is higher than ever adderall prescriptions dispensed in the u s spiked to 41 4 million last year up by 10 4 from 2020 according to iqvia an analytics provider for the life sciences industry experts say more awareness about adhd has contributed to the increase although there is also concern that stimulants have been overprescribed because the drug can be abused if it s taken improperly or without a prescription in may walmart and cvs announced they would stop filling prescriptions for controlled substances from telehealth startups such as cerebral and done health which prescribe stimulants and gained footing during the pandemic for those who need it shapiro said going without adhd medication can be disastrous they ll feel badly about themselves she said you have a kid that was doing well in school doing their homework and all of a sudden they re bouncing off the wall

chancellor kwasi kwarteng is set to return from the international monetary fund s imf annual meeting in washington to london this weekend where he is likely to find a significant section of his mini budget re drawn after days of open revolt among tory mps and an emerging market consensus that another u turn is on the cards however according to the bbc the chancellor has now cancelled planned meetings in the us and is leaving a day early for crunch talks in the uk over the mini budget in the early hours of friday morning the national broadcaster as well as the times and the financial times began reporting that mr kwarteng had cancelled appointments at the imf meetings and was flying home the pa news agency has contacted the treasury for comment the prime minister s key pledge to scrap the planned increase in corporation tax from 19 to 25 is widely seen as a likely casualty in the coming days as ms truss seeks to save her embattled premiership it comes amid reports that senior tories are plotting the possibility of replacing ms truss with a joint ticket of rishi sunak and penny mordaunt with the times newspaper also reporting that party grandees are considering replacing her with a unity candidate chancellor of the exchequer kwasi kwarteng aaron chown pa downing street on thursday did not deny that the potential exists for a reversal on the corporation tax policy one of the landmark promises made by ms truss in her pitch to become tory leader it came amid reports that talks were under way between no 10 and the treasury on abandoning elements of the 43 billion tax cutting plan speculation was fuelled further when the chancellor in an interview with the telegraph only said let s see when asked about the expectation from financial markets that the government could ditch its corporation tax promise friday is set to be a crunch day in the financial markets with the bank of england s emergency bond buying scheme due to come to an end officials stepped in two weeks ago after the mini budget sent markets into chaos amid concerns over higher borrowing costs triggering concerns in particular about the fate of pension funds a growing expectation on thursday of a government u turn on corporation tax appeared to reassure the finance industry after bank of england governor andrew bailey spooked the markets by insisting that the emergency support would not be extended mr kwarteng also insisted to the telegraph that there would be no real cuts to public spending appearing to double down on comments made in the commons by the prime minister on wednesday but he told the paper let s face it there are difficult choices within that you have to prioritise you have to make sure that you know the public is getting value for money and i make no apologies for that there has to be some sort of fiscal discipline in the same interview he was insistent that his party could still be trusted with the public finances we re conservatives fiscal discipline runs right through our dna he told the paper the government s plans revolve around securing an increase in economic growth with a target of an annual rise of around 2 5 in gross domestic product gdp the crucial date will be october 31 when the forecasts presented by the office for budget responsibility obr alongside the chancellor s statement will give an assessment on whether such a plan is realistic mr kwarteng on thursday was insisting that his position was safe telling broadcasters in washington i am not going anywhere it comes amid speculation in westminster about the fate of the chancellor only a few weeks into the job if his financial plans are torn up in the coming days chancellor kwasi kwarteng has insisted his position is safe jacob king pa former tory chancellor and party grandee ken clarke said that ms truss could not be able to make mr kwarteng a scapegoat but it comes amid mounting anger and unrest within the conservatives about the crisis of recent weeks newly elected foreign affairs committee chair alicia kearns told lbc s tonight with andrew marr that she wanted the prime minister to succeed but added her voice to calls for a change of course on the mini budget she said the markets are not woke the markets are not left the fact they are not lefty anti government the fact they have been spooked is something that should be taken incredibly seriously former veterans minister johnny mercer also tweeted that the situation needs a course correction from no 10 get on and do it we all know it s coming but amid reports of a coronation of a new leader to save the tories from a crushing defeat at the next election some warned against such a drastic move one senior tory told pa that any move to replace ms truss would be completely bonkers and premature while a staunch ally of ms truss sir christopher chope insisted on bbc newsnight that she would not be forced by the anti growth coalition into a humiliating retreat on corporation tax if we were to increase corporation tax having said that we re not going to that would be totally inconsistent with the prime minister s policy of promoting growth growth and growth he said

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure

criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

last week opec said it would reduce its oil production target by 2 million barrels daily with actual cuts of between 1 and 1 1 million bpd the announcement pushed prices higher by the end of the week the resulting oil price rally had run out of steam and prices were once again sliding on recession fears and these fears might mask how the oil market tips into a shortage when the cartel said it would be cutting production opec officials explained the reasons for the decision had to do with anticipating a drop in demand and saving spare production capacity for the eventuality of a sudden output outage such as one in russia following the eu embargo entering into effect at the end of the year for example the u s signaled it saw the move as a political one amounting to a snub by riyadh which will be one of three opec members actually reducing production and a declaration of siding with russia the latter riyadh already did six years ago when opec was born so it shouldn t have come as a surprise but the snub appears to have come as a shock to washington prompting president biden to threaten consequences of a yet unidentified nature related france sends germany natural gas to ease its energy crisis while the white house ponders its options some analysts have noted that the move of opec would tighten an already tight oil market recession worry seems to be reigning in oil markets right now but the risk of an oil shortage is there and none other than opec has been warning about it most vocally saudi arabia in the face of its energy minister meanwhile there is more bad news global oil inventories are in a decline that would be difficult to reverse this is what reuters john kemp noted in a column this week saying u s inventories have shed 480 million barrels in the past two years to reach the lowest level for this time of the year since 2004 the situation with fuel inventories is even more worrying with u s distillate inventories down to the lowest since records began in 1982 and european distillate inventories at the lowest since 2002 distillate inventories in singapore are also at a multi year low shedding 9 million barrels over the past two years the fall in distillate inventories is perhaps even more concerning than the decline in crude stocks because distillates are used to make diesel fuel and diesel fuel is used in the freight transport of goods which is vital for every economy a reserve depletion means price hikes and price hikes mean good fuel for inflation still despite the precarious state of global oil and distillate inventories saudi arabia just said this week that the decision to reduce output was a purely economic one in an official response to u s accusations the saudi foreign ministry issued a statement that said the kingdom clarified through its continuous consultations with the u s administration that all economic analyses indicate that postponing the opec decision for a month according to what has been suggested would have had negative economic consequences whatever the motives for the decision it has been made and those unhappy with it have few options at their disposal for punishing those that made it oil prices remain subdued meanwhile although analysts updated their fourth quarter price forecasts after the opec decision advertisement again this is largely because the fear of recession has been fuelled by a stable flow of pessimistic forecasts the latest coming from the imf this week indeed the immediate future of the global economy does not look good and when the economic outlook is bad so is the oil price outlook yet a shortage of oil could certainly change this especially when it coincides with an oil embargo and a price cap by irina slav for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com

leader to save the tories from a crushing defeat at the next election some warned against such a drastic move one senior tory told pa that any move to replace ms truss would be completely bonkers and premature while a staunch ally of ms truss sir christopher chope insisted on bbc newsnight that she would not be forced by the anti growth coalition into a humiliating retreat on corporation tax if we were to increase corporation tax having said that we re not going to that would be totally inconsistent with the prime minister s policy of promoting growth growth and growth he said

washington d c soldiers are leaving the army national guard at a faster rate than they are enlisting causing concerns that the u s may not meet military requirements for local and overseas deployments this decline in recruitment comes as many states are facing hurricanes fires and continued demand for national guard units to serve overseas including combat tours in syria and training missions in europe for nations worried about russia the total annual loss in guards personnel is some 7 500 service members which is due to a combination of recruitment shortfalls and a rising number of soldiers who are opting not to reenlist at the end of their tours the losses are in line with the trend affecting the entire u s military with all branches struggling this year to meet their recruitment goals they also reflect the need to change how the military recruits and retains citizen soldiers and airmen who must combine their regular full time jobs and their military duties major general rich baldwin chief of staff of the army national guard said the current staffing challenges are the worst he has seen in the last 20 years though he said the impact on the guard s readiness is minimal and manageable according to reuters meanwhile general daniel hokanson head of the national guard bureau acknowledged that both the army and air guards have failed to meet their recruitment goals the army guard s authorized total is 336 000 troops and the air guard is 108 300 baldwin also noted that as operations in iraq and afghanistan began to decline several years ago states started to see higher than expected losses in personnel today we have a much lower overseas deployment tempo than we have been used to and almost all of the covid 19 support missions have been ramped down he said as quoted by reuters however guard officials are looking for ways to entice service members to join or re enlist a critical change would be to provide guard members with healthcare coverage as some some 60 000 do not have health insurance hokanson said noting that the cost of providing health care coverage to those who do not have it would be about 719 million a year other changes include expanding educational benefits and giving guard members a financial bonus for bringing in new recruits he added we need to make adjustments based on the current environment because for the long term our nation needs a national guard the size that we are or maybe even larger to meet all the requirements that we have hokanson said as reported by reuters

described his struggle to explain a simple point of economics to the woman in overall charge of his annual budget for overseas bureaux the point he was trying to get across to her was that the pound s recent plunge against the deutsche mark i told you this was years ago would mean she d have to allocate more sterling to the berlin office whose clerical and cleaning staff were paid in that old pre euro german currency for what seemed like hours the woman with the purse strings was baffled until at last the cloud of confusion appeared to lift from her brain oh i see she said our pounds buy fewer deutsche marks so we ll have to spend more of them to cover our wages bill in berlin by george she s got it thought my friend the foreign editor and he left her to adjust her budgets for the following year accordingly but then minutes later there came a tap on his office door and she reappeared hang on a moment she said if the deutsche mark is strong then why does the berlin office need more money surely it needs less clearly her eureka moment had passed as quickly as it had come my friend buried his head in his hands and explained it all over again until finally the message sank in as i say the poor woman s bewilderment struck me as hilarious when i heard about it all those years ago in my arrogant youth but believe me i don t find it remotely amusing any more for the pity of it is that i m fast becoming exactly like her how i laughed many years ago when the foreign editor of the london based paper for which i then worked described his struggle to explain a simple point of economics to the woman in overall charge of his annual budget for overseas bureaux stock image misery indeed every time a new economic crisis like the current one blows up i read and re read the idiots guides in the newspapers struggling afresh to get my head around the reasons why we find ourselves in this mess you know the sort of stuff it s all about gilt yields derivatives put options call options petrodollars the supply side interest rate swaps and fluctuations in exchange rates and the money supply these are things i once thought i more or less understood when they were explained to me patiently though i m not at all sure that i ever quite grasped the meaning of a derivative even when it was described to me in baby talk today however it s a very different story true there are still moments when i think as i read those idiots guides ah yes i ve got it now but then i put on the kettle for a cup of tea and by the time it has boiled i find i ve completely forgotten everything i thought i understood and i have to start reading again from the beginning oh the misery of feeling my mental powers decline with every passing month as i fast approach my 70th year how many like me i wonder find ourselves almost daily trudging upstairs to retrieve our spectacles from the bedside table only to find the moment we reach the bedroom that the purpose of our mission has totally slipped our minds how many of us constantly forget our computer passwords or find it increasingly impossible to follow the convoluted plots of the latest detective thrillers on tv in the past i ve always attributed my mental deterioration simply to the passage of the years and the corrosive effect on my brain cells of a lifetime spent drinking much more alcohol than the nanny state and its agents recommend but i m delighted to see that many of us now have a new excuse for our forgetfulness and any difficulties we may experience in understanding concepts that were once well within our grasp such anyway appeared to be the message of this week s headlines proclaiming that fathers brains shrink when their children are born the theory as put forward by the university of california is that our brains change physically when we become parents in order to help us empathise with the new arrival if i understand the research and i readily admit that i almost certainly don t since it s all about cerebral cortices neuroplasticity and synaptic connections the idea is that we start thinking a bit more like babies so that we get on with them better our brains change physically when we become parents in order to help us empathise with the new arrival according to new research stock image or does it just mean that parenthood changes the shape of our brains to make us soppier more inclined to coo over our infants and perhaps more tolerant of those sleepless nights and streaks of posset down the backs of our shirts search me all i know for sure from long and bitter experience is that fatherhood definitely shrinks the wallet whatever the truth however the upshot of this research appears to be that it s not just mums who experience baby brain it s dads too no wonder then that as a father of four and grandfather of two with more on the way i find it increasingly hard to grasp the complexities of the city and the economy from now on i ll put it down simply to the possibility that my brain has shrunk a little bit more with the birth of every new utley there are one or two truths about the economy and finance however which nobody needs a huge brain to understand how extraordinary then that so many of our legislators on both sides of the commons seem wholly incapable of grasping them for a start this country simply cannot afford to go on printing and borrowing money at anything like the rate we ve seen over the past few years we are already 2 4 trillion in debt for heaven s sake with the bills for interest alone already larger than the defence budget and mounting terrifyingly by the day surely it must be clear even to the tiniest brain that there are only two possible ways out of this hole either the government must take urgent steps to expand the economy so as to make us better able to repay what we owe or it must cut back its spending radically or preferably both you don t need a giant brain to understand that each new pound they print with nothing to back it up makes every pound in our pockets worth a fraction less stock image desperate yet every suggestion of ways to promote growth even those as blindingly obvious as authorising fracking offering businesses and entrepreneurs tax incentives to invest here or relaxing the building and planning restrictions that deter every kind of economic activity is met with howls of angry protest even from the tory benches as for the wailing and gnashing of teeth that greets any hint of a cut in government spending it can be heard all the way from westminster to land s end and john o groats yet we all know that unimaginable sums are wasted by the state every day why on earth for example should millionaire pensioners be offered winter fuel handouts and free travel it s as if every benefit ever introduced by a vote hungry politician is now regarded by mps as a basic human right so instead of endorsing any constructive plan to tackle the country s woes parliament simply buries its collective head in the sand leaving the authorities to go on printing money in a desperate attempt to keep the economy afloat meanwhile you don t need a giant brain to understand that each new pound they print with nothing to back it up makes every pound in our pockets worth a fraction less in my arrogant youth before my own brain started shrinking i thought you d have to travel far and wide to find anyone as hilariously ignorant of basic economics as the lady in charge of fixing the budgets for those overseas bureaux but at least she got the point in the end don t you wish we could say the same of the people we elected to represent us

both rep mike garcia r santa clarita and his democratic challenger christy smith stood before separate groups of local voters on thursday to discuss the issues pertinent to their campaigns while garcia was invited by senior pastor david hegg to speak before a slew of local religious leaders at grace baptist church as part of a pastors leadership breakfast thursday morning smith sat in front of an audience of students faculty and community members at college of the canyons garcia the incumbent who has beaten smith twice in previous elections said during his early morning question and answer session that should the voters choose him once again come this nov 8 general election he planned to continue to advocate for his constituents in terms of enhancing national security and battling rising inflation and the cost of living in the district i look at this as a service role i do work for you i work for the three quarters of a million folks that i represent said garcia and i work for this country i would literally give my life for this beautiful country this constitution garcia then went on to discuss what he sees as moves away from the country s judeo christian foundation my opponent has made this about abortion this year and i won t go into the details about it because it s not necessary but she s basically hitting me because i m pro life said garcia the reality is that when you ask the average american voter in our district right now especially what s on their mind they re worried about inflation they re worried about the economy they re worried about the fact that the stock market is at a three year low that mortgage rates are at a 10 year high that our debt is at a record high 41 trillion garcia went on to champion his work he says he and his team had done to help local veterans with their issues regarding the veterans administration how he helped more than 100 people leave afghanistan and helped with busting illegal cannabis grows in the antelope valley the congressman also defended his position in which he joined with house democrats on house resolution 8404 a bill that would codify same sex marriage into law if passed by the senate in light of the recent supreme court reversal of roe v wade the supreme court in 2015 made the decision that same sex marriage is constitutional both sides of the aisle the conservative judges reaffirmed it as well in some cases garcia said in defense of his vote they cite the 14th amendment that basically says we all have equal access to the same liberties and pursuit of happiness and access to the same rights when it comes to legal rights such as marriage at the end of breakfast hegg asked the other pastors in the room to come forward and pray for the congressman during her conversation at coc smith touched on a number of issues pertinent to her campaign such as gun control climate change and revitalizing an economy she says has prevented young people from buying homes and gaining jobs that were available to those in preceding generations first of all many of them can t afford to be married and purchase houses earlier like my generation said smith but beyond that they worry about what the long term prospects are of living in a global community where there is a high likeliness of significant water shortages and climate induced trauma that happens communities time and time again smith went on to say that it is up to the current generation of leaders to ensure that the next generation is left with a livable planet a functional democracy with everyone having the right to vote and where there are solutions to homelessness smith also stated that improving upon traffic issues in the local community means ensuring that there are high paying jobs locally for residents meaning they won t have to travel to metropolitan areas for work and that public transportation is more readily available efficient and reliable however smith said that while she will be working to ensure that local constituents see funding come into the district she also emphasized a need for the 27th congressional district representative to be playing a role in national politics as well we have to protect our democratic institutions they are at risk right now and they will be at risk in the next presidential election cycle said smith adding that more voting rights protections need to be passed for the country in some states in this country vital protections for minority and marginalized communities have been stripped away and they were fought too hard for by many many generations of people for us to let that go smith also said that another priority for her would be to look at how voices are being shouted down due to one side having unlimited resources and restoring a sense of truth and honor to our government i have heard from so many people in this community whose primary concern is how do we knit our communities back together after the division that has been present for the last several years smith said and that is the work that i am really excited to do and i m fortunate to say can start in this election cycle when we re out knocking on doors having these conversations and encouraging people to use their votes garcia is slated to have a conversation at college of the canyons at 3 p m tuesday the conversation is open to the public and will be held in the valencia campus university center room 258
