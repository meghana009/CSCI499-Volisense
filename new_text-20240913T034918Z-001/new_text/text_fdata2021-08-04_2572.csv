so today i announce a new approach which we re calling the key to nyc pass the key to new york city when you hear those words i want you to imagine the notion that because someone s vaccinated they can do all the amazing things that are available in this city this is a miraculous place literally full of wonders and if you re vaccinated all that s going to open up to you you ll have the key you can open the door but if your unvaccinated unfortunately you will not be able to participate many things that s the point we re trying to get across the key to nyc pass will be a first in the nation approach it will require vaccination for workers and customers in indoor dining in indoor fitness facilities indoor entertainment facilities this is going to be a requirement the only way to patronize these establishments indoors will be if you re vaccinated at least one dose the same for folks in terms of work they ll need at least one dose this new policy will be phased in over the coming weeks so we ve been working with the business community getting input we re going to do more over the next few weeks the final details of the policy will be announced and implemented in the week of august 16 will then spend most of a month educating people going out to businesses receiving calls from businesses answering questions and concerns making sure everyone understands the new approach and then on september 13 during that week will begin inspections and enforcement the key to nyc pass this is an easy approach because to confirm vaccination all you need is your vaccination card or the nyc covid safe app or the excelsior app from the state any of those will do so it s simple just show it and you re in advertisement more than 110 million covid 19 vaccines sent to 60 countries us says share copy link copy the u s has donated and shipped more than 110 million doses of covid 19 vaccines to more than 60 countries ranging from afghanistan to zambia the white house announced tuesday president joe biden highlighted the milestone in remarks updating the public on the u s strategy to slow the spread of coronavirus abroad saying the u s donations are more than the rest of the world combined to lower and middle income countries vaccinate america and help vaccinate the world biden said that s how we re going to beat this thing the announcement comes amid a rise in infections in the u s fueled by the highly contagious delta strain of the virus which led u s public health officials last week to recommend that even people who have been fully vaccinated against covid 19 resume wearing face coverings in some public indoor settings biden has promised that the u s will be the arsenal of vaccines for the world but while notable the 110 million doses the u s has donated largely through a global vaccine program known as covax represent a fraction of what is needed worldwide the white house said in a statement tuesday that u s at the end of august will begin shipping 500 million doses of pfizer vaccine that it has pledged to 100 low income countries by june 2022 the 110 million donated doses came from u s surplus vaccine stock as the pace of domestic vaccinations slowed amid widespread vaccine hesitancy in the country roughly 90 million eligible americans aged 12 and over have yet to receive one dose of vaccine biden had pledged to ship more than 80 million doses overseas by the end of june but had only been able to share a fraction of that due to logistical and regulatory hurdles in recipient countries the pace of shipments picked up significantly through july under biden s sharing plan about 75 of u s doses are shared through covax which aims to help lower and middle income nations with the balance being sent to u s partners and allies the white house insists that nothing is being sought in return for the shots contrasting its approach to russia and china which it alleges have used access to their domestically produced vaccines as a tool of geopolitical leverage

sure you might have to actually pay u s taxes on those crypto trades but at least it will be easier to figure out how much you owe a new push by congress to require crypto brokers to report transactions to the internal revenue service could create some unwelcome tax bills but could clarify rules for traders and users of bitcoin and other digital tokens potentially strengthening the system in the long run people in the industry say the new rules a last minute addition to the 550 billion bipartisan infrastructure package now being considered by the u s senate would also force businesses to disclose trades of digital assets of more than 10 000 the provisions are designed to raise 28 billion 3dsculptor fotolia the measures add to increased scrutiny the irs has recently applied to traders of bitcoin ethereum and other digital assets the agency has promised it will issue new rules that clarify how those virtual currencies should be taxed people who trade digital currencies must pay income taxes on any gains even if some crypto investors have been ignoring their tax obligations but even for those who want to follow the law it can be difficult to keep track of what s owed filing taxes on crypto trades can create huge headaches especially for those who conduct multiple transactions each year while traditional stock brokerages are already required to send detailed tax forms to clients crypto exchanges aren t even if firms wanted to help their clients file taxes it s not always clear how to do that under the current regulations in addition tax obligations can pop up in surprising places people who use digital currencies to pay for things like say a tesla or a pizza are supposed to pay taxes on any increase in value of the crypto they spend it s a key difference between using digital currencies and actual fiat currencies such as the u s dollar to conduct commerce andrew johnson a project manager at a large national bank has invested tens of thousands in crypto and uses a dedicated service to figure out what he owes in taxes he s been using cointracker which he learned about through a youtube channel that he trusts most would benefit from a tracking service to help with taxes he said for me i decided it was worth the cost to not have to manually track all the trades i did which could take hours or days cryptocurrency exchanges and others in the industry have raised concerns that the u s senate is rushing the rules into effect without consulting them first some wondered whether the new rules and regulatory attention would encourage mainstream investors to join the space or hurt the appeal of cryptocurrencies by killing its anything goes ethos some portion of crypto investors may start to have second thoughts about the tax consequences said michael bailey director of research at fbb capital partners it s almost like crypto is a really fun party but it s getting late and a few people are starting to look at their watches as they think about the next morning for years the irs has been warning taxpayers to report cryptocurrency transactions on their tax returns more recently the agency has made clear that fighting tax evasion through digital currencies is a top priority the irs has started collecting vast amounts of data on blockchain transactions has subpoenaed crypto exchanges and worked on coordinating enforcement with foreign governments last year the irs added a yes or no question to the front page of the 1040 income tax form asking whether filers had sold or exchanged virtual currencies the jurisdiction of u s law enforcement only reaches so far and crypto traders who prize secrecy could flee to offshore exchanges or take other measures to avoid being spotted by the irs however the u s has already shown it can crack down on foreign tax evasion by for example forcing banks in switzerland and elsewhere to divulge details on american clients even if parts of the crypto universe remain hidden it may be difficult to move those assets onshore and turn them into legitimate wealth if a u s taxpayer is into crypto for the ability to underreport income from sales or transfers chances are someone in a chain somewhere may have to disclose it said julio jimenez an attorney who is principal in the tax services group at marks paneth llp all this isn t necessarily a bad thing for law abiding investors in digital assets if they end up with clearer rules and easier to understand annual statements from crypto firms i think it will have a positive effect on the industry said brett cotler an attorney at seward and kissel llp in new york who specializes in blockchain and cryptocurrency while exchanges and fintech firms that deal in digital currencies may have to spend money upgrading reporting and compliance systems it will improve customer service he said johnson the crypto trader said he thinks the new rules will help legitimize the crypto ecosystem and foster international growth while at its heart crypto assets have been a means of moving value outside of government controlled rails i still understand the need for regulation in the crypto space in order for wider adoption to take place he said with assistance from natasha abellard and laura davison

so will it be stagflation after all it is already clear that inflation has entered the financial system those who claim that this cannot be true because treasury bonds aren t showing it fail to mention that treasury bonds are the most manipulated asset class on the planet after all it s rather difficult to argue that treasury bonds can discount or measure much of anything when the fed is spending over 1 trillion buying them every year technically all they are reflecting is what 1 trillion worth of fed asset purchases can get you in terms of manipulation meanwhile we are getting signs of inflation everywhere capri which owns michael kors versace and other fashion brands just announced it will be raising prices considerably chipotle is raising prices 4 to cover increased labor costs proctor gamble which manufactures consumer goods like gillette razors and tide detergent announced it will be raising prices in september general mills which produces cereals like cheerios announced inflation costs are up 7 this year whirlpool which manufactures appliances ranging from refrigerators to dryers and washers will raise prices by 12 to offset inflation it says inflation could cost the company 1 billion this year and on and on so we know inflation is here the question now is whether or not the economy will continue to strengthen or roll over creating a 1970s style stagflation it now appears it might be the latter as three stock market sectors with close ties to the real economy show us first and foremost are industrials xli these are companies that either produce actual things like tractors cranes hvac systems etc or that are involved in real economic activity mail shipping as such they represent a good gauge of how strong the real economy is doing during economic expansions these businesses receive more orders xli has gone nowhere since late april and this is despite the prospect of a multi trillion infrastructure bill from the federal government and 120 billion in qe from the fed next up are materials xlb these are companies involved in producing things like concrete copper steel and the like during economic expansions these companies receive more orders as they are the primary suppliers of commodities needed for construction manufacturing and the like here again the chart is odd given the macro backdrop the biden administration is hoping to sign a 1 2 trillion infrastructure bill sometime in the next few weeks and yet xlb is 5 off its highs indeed you could easily argue that the only reason xlb didn t collapse last week was the prospect of this infrastructure bill finally we have amazon amzn we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the consumer accounts for 75 of the u s economy as the largest online retailer in the u s amzn presents a great window into consumer spending after disappointing results for 2q21 amzn shares collapsed they have now gone nowhere since july of 2020 this is not what you would expect from a raging economy so inflation is here and the economy appears to be rolling over that would mean a stagflationary environment which would be the absolutely worst environment for the massive fake bubble the fed has created with that in mind we ve reopened our stock market crash survival guide to the general public within its 21 pages we outline which investments will perform best during a market meltdown as well as how to take out crash insurance on your portfolio these instruments returned triple digit gains during 2008 we are making just 100 copies available to the general public to pick up your copy of this report free swing by phoenixcapitalmarketing com stockmarketcrash html best regards graham summers chief market strategist phoenix capital research

so today i announce a new approach which we re calling the key to nyc pass the key to new york city when you hear those words i want you to imagine the notion that because someone s vaccinated they can do all the amazing things that are available in this city this is a miraculous place literally full of wonders and if you re vaccinated all that s going to open up to you you ll have the key you can open the door but if your unvaccinated unfortunately you will not be able to participate many things that s the point we re trying to get across the key to nyc pass will be a first in the nation approach it will require vaccination for workers and customers in indoor dining in indoor fitness facilities indoor entertainment facilities this is going to be a requirement the only way to patronize these establishments indoors will be if you re vaccinated at least one dose the same for folks in terms of work they ll need at least one dose this new policy will be phased in over the coming weeks so we ve been working with the business community getting input we re going to do more over the next few weeks the final details of the policy will be announced and implemented in the week of august 16 will then spend most of a month educating people going out to businesses receiving calls from businesses answering questions and concerns making sure everyone understands the new approach and then on september 13 during that week will begin inspections and enforcement the key to nyc pass this is an easy approach because to confirm vaccination all you need is your vaccination card or the nyc covid safe app or the excelsior app from the state any of those will do so it s simple just show it and you re in advertisement more than 110 million covid 19 vaccines sent to 60 countries us says share copy link copy the u s has donated and shipped more than 110 million doses of covid 19 vaccines to more than 60 countries ranging from afghanistan to zambia the white house announced tuesday president joe biden highlighted the milestone in remarks updating the public on the u s strategy to slow the spread of coronavirus abroad saying the u s donations are more than the rest of the world combined to lower and middle income countries vaccinate america and help vaccinate the world biden said that s how we re going to beat this thing the announcement comes amid a rise in infections in the u s fueled by the highly contagious delta strain of the virus which led u s public health officials last week to recommend that even people who have been fully vaccinated against covid 19 resume wearing face coverings in some public indoor settings biden has promised that the u s will be the arsenal of vaccines for the world but while notable the 110 million doses the u s has donated largely through a global vaccine program known as covax represent a fraction of what is needed worldwide the white house said in a statement tuesday that u s at the end of august will begin shipping 500 million doses of pfizer vaccine that it has pledged to 100 low income countries by june 2022 the 110 million donated doses came from u s surplus vaccine stock as the pace of domestic vaccinations slowed amid widespread vaccine hesitancy in the country roughly 90 million eligible americans aged 12 and over have yet to receive one dose of vaccine biden had pledged to ship more than 80 million doses overseas by the end of june but had only been able to share a fraction of that due to logistical and regulatory hurdles in recipient countries the pace of shipments picked up significantly through july under biden s sharing plan about 75 of u s doses are shared through covax which aims to help lower and middle income nations with the balance being sent to u s partners and allies the white house insists that nothing is being sought in return for the shots contrasting its approach to russia and china which it alleges have used access to their domestically produced vaccines as a tool of geopolitical leverage

capital a return of capital may occur for example when some or all of the money that you invested in the fund is paid back to you a return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the fund

average net asset value nav per share the fund will calculate the average nav per share from the previous three full months immediately prior to the distribution based on the number of business days

prepared remarks there will be a question and answer session in which dan and bob will join us as well finally we posted a supplemental slide deck on our website this morning which we refer to on this call with that let me turn it over to our chief executive officer jimmy brock jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer thank you nate and good morning everyone we capped off the first half of 2021 by delivering another strong quarterly performance in q2 on the operations front despite two longwall moves in the quarter we delivered a solid cash cost performance additionally we once again demonstrated our ability to achieve strong cash flow performance by generating north of 50 million in free cash flow in q2 of 21 and increasing the unrestricted cash on our balance sheet by more than 50 million as well we reduced the leverage on our balance sheet and reaffirmed our ability to raise a significant amount of long term capital through the recently completed tax exempt financing on the pamc expansion project on the marketing front we continue to execute our strategic shift into the export markets and we also strategically layered in some financial hedges in the api2 market to secure revenue visibility and capture some of the recent export market strengths for 2022 on the safety front our bailey preparation plant consol marine terminal and itmann project each had zero recordable incidents during the second quarter of 2021 however our total recordable incident rate or trir at the pamc finished q2 21 higher than what is typical for us although the severity level on each of these incidents was very low we strived to perform each day at zero incidents and our year to date trir at the pamc remains significantly below the national average for underground bituminous coal mines now let me start with our most exciting news this quarter and provide an update on our itmann metallurgical coal project we have been very clear that one of our major strategic goals is to diversify our revenue streams and reduce the percentage of revenues associated with power generation markets this project is a very important step in that direction as most of you know in early 2019 we announced the commitments of the development of our itmann mine project which is a low vol metallurgical coal mining operation in wyoming county west virginia however due to the unprecedented demand and earnings decline associated with the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 we made the capital allocation decision to pullback spending on this project in order to focus our discretionary capital toward repurchasing our second lien notes in the open market which were trading well below par value at that time now as our debt has continued to trade up to near par levels and as our free cash flow generation has significantly improved i am very pleased to announce our decision to recommence the itmann project despite the significant pullback in project expenditures the past 12 to 18 months were instrumental in repositioning the project we used this time to complete initial development mine to shore up our confidence in the reserve and we optimized plans for the preparation plant to create an additional upside potential we evaluated several options for the preparation plant first build a brand new facility from scratch second purchase an existing plant at a nearby location and truck the coal for process or third identify an existing preparation plant for sale that could be relocated to our itmann side based on our analysis the third option made the most economic sense and we are moving forward with relocating a higher capacity and state of the art preparation plant to the itmann project side which is expected to start up in 2022 by relocating the plant we eliminate potentially long lead times on equipment and avoid inflationary pressures from steel and other construction materials we expect to produce 900 000 plus tons of high quality low vol coke and coal annually from our itmann number five mine once were at full run rate production we expect this to be a low cost operation with a long reserve life of 20 plus years of production at maintenance capital levels while the overall project capital cost has increased slightly due to the reoptimized plants for the prep plant we believe this can be more than offset by the expanded capacity afforded by the prep plant and improved cost structure due to the inclusion of a highly efficient rail load down the prep plant where we are relocating will have a processing capacity that is nearly double that at the plant originally envisioned for itmann opening up the opportunity for us to process up to 750 000 to one million product tons of third party coal in addition to the coal from our itmann mine we expect this will create additional growth opportunity and higher revenue potential compared to the original project plan with that now let me provide an overview of the coal markets we continue to execute on our multiyear transition of diversifying our sales mix and increasing our exposure to nonpower generation markets following a record export sales volume in q1 of 21 we successfully placed a new record 3 2 million tons in the export market in q2 of 21 representing nearly 55 of our total shipments in the quarter additionally 47 of our tons sold were used in the industrial or metallurgical nonpower generation applications as we continue to diversify our way from traditional power generations as you can see on slide five we have continued to steadily diversify our global customer base and end use markets since our span in 2017 and in the second quarter of 2021 our overall export volume as a percentage of total sales volume went up roughly 22 percentage points versus full year of 2017 this improvement was driven by a sharp increase in the portion of our tons going into the industrial markets which has risen by 33 percentage points versus 2017 we continue to focus on our strategy of further reducing our exposure to a declining u s coal market for power generation with a heightened focus on increasing our industrial business we believe that with our quality of coal and cost structure at the pamc coupled with an ownership of consol marine terminal we are very well positioned to take advantage of developing and sustaining opportunities in the export market demand for our product continued to strengthen in the second quarter of 2021 on the back of economic recovery and improved electric power and export demand henry hub natural gas spot prices averaged 2 95 per million btu during the quarter a 73 increase compared to q2 of 20 additionally average pjm west day ahead power prices continued to improve and in q2 of 21 61 above the year ago quarter spot pricing trends were especially encouraging given that we were in the shoulder season pricing has continued to improve since the end of the second quarter henry hub natural gas prices are now in the 4 per million btu range for august deliveries with calendar year 2022 now well above 3 per million btu prior to 2021 you d have to go back to 2018 to find a month in which henry hub averaged 4 or more and prior to that all the way back to 2014 we remain optimistic that overall market conditions will continue to improve due to accelerating global economic recovery and a relatively muted supply response on the export front we have seen sustained improvements in the seaborne thermal coal market since the end of the third quarter of 2020 pet coke prices continued to remain supportive as a result of reduced oil production propping up demand and pricing for northern app coal in high cv markets api2 spot prices also continued to rise in the second quarter of 2021 largely driven by hot and dry weather strong lng pricing and a limited supply response and ended the quarter improved by 82 compared to q2 of 20 as such we layered in commodity derivative contracts in the api2 market for calendar year 2022 which mitesh will provide more color on shortly additionally we completed four term deals in the export market during the quarter with durations from one to two years in length and we recently contracted a cargo of pamc coal to china for the first time since 2018 from a marketing perspective it is encouraging to see that demand for our coal has continued to improve since the low point in q2 of 20 we continue to maintain the vast majority of our core customer base and continue to see improvement in our customers contracting appetites our sales teams remains opportunistic in its marketing strategy and increased our contracted position by 9 4 million tons since our last earnings release bringing our contracted position to 24 6 million tons in 2021 and 10 9 million tons in 2022 now let me review our q2 21 operational performance in detail coal production at the pennsylvania mining complex came in at 5 9 million tons in q2 21 compared to 2 4 million tons in q2 of 20 the vast improvement despite the aforementioned multiple longwall moves in q2 of 21 was due to a continued increase in demand for our products since the covid related trough and demand that bottomed out during the year ago quarter as a result productivity at the pamc measured as tons per employee hour improved by an impressive 46 7 in q2 of 21 compared to q2 of 20 on the cost front our average cash cost of coal sale per ton was 28 02 in q2 of 21 compared to 25 90 in q2 of 20 although this seems impaired keep in mind that the 25 90 per ton did not reflect the 32 million in mine idling cash cost incurred during the year ago quarter when adjusted for that q2 21 cash costs significantly outperformed the prior year period even without accounting for that idle cost our year to date average cash cost of coal sold per ton was improved by nearly 15 versus the first half of 2020 our operations team continues to focus on maintaining tight control over cash expenditures as we move forward the consol marine terminal achieved a throughput volume of 3 8 million tons during q2 of 21 compared to 1 6 million tons in the year ago period the significant increase was again due to improved demand in the seaborne markets compared to the trough of the covid 19 related decline in coal demand in q2 of 20 the terminal throughput volumes reflects a pace of over 15 million tons per annum and marks the second consecutive quarter with an annualized run rate north of 15 million tons terminal revenues for the quarter came in at 17 4 million compared to 15 9 million in the year ago quarter despite the major increase in throughput tonnage the impact on revenue was somewhat lessened due to the take or pay contract that was in place in the prior year period cash operating costs came in at 5 3 million versus 3 8 million in the year ago quarter with that i will now turn the call over to mitesh to provide the financial update mitesh thakkar chief financial officer thank you jimmy and good morning everyone i will start with an update on the progress we have made on our key financial priorities i will then review our second quarter 2021 results and our full year 2021 guidance as we have discussed in the past our financial priorities remain maximizing free cash flow generation maintaining strong liquidity and reducing outstanding debt while these remain on north star we are now also selectively allocating capital toward strategic initiatives such as our itmann project after accomplishing a significant milestone of achieving a net leverage ratio below 2 times at the end of 1q 21 we further reduced our leverage to 1 7 times at the end of 2q 21 this was despite our recently completed tax exempt bond offering which we previously highlighted would increase our leverage in the near term due to the treatment of restricted cash under our credit agreement however if we include the restricted cash our leverage ratio as of june 30 would have dropped to 1 54 times while we have more work to do on our balance sheet front we have several initiatives underway or recently completed that we believe will create long term value for our shareholders first we continue to make strides on our overall debt reduction goal as we made total debt payments and repurchases of 18 million in 2q 21 this included open market repurchases of outstanding second lien notes where we spent 4 8 million to retire 5 million at a slight discount to par we view these buybacks as a good use of capital even as the market price of our second lien notes have rallied back to trade at near par levels second we made the discretionary decision to execute an 18 4 million early buyout option on an existing operating lease for a set of longwall shares this decision not only saves us nearly 900 000 per month in operating lease expense for the next 12 months but also eliminates the buyout requirement in 2q 22 at fair market value given where steel prices are currently this fair market value would most likely have been elevated and could have been close to or more than the 18 million fixed early buyout amount we executed the early buyout also reduces the operating lease liability on our books which rating agencies include in their leverage calculations third as highlighted last quarter we continue to find ways to tap alternative sources of capital by successfully securing 75 million of tax exempt solid waste disposal revenue bonds at the beginning of the second quarter we received reimbursements from qualified expenses in the amount of 21 5 million in 2q 21 which dates back to the initial inducement date in mid 2020 additionally we have 53 5 million in restricted cash associated with this financing that will be used to fund future spending on the refuse disposal areas at the pamc and will reduce our leverage ratio over time from a strategic standpoint this transaction gives us additional financial flexibility and helps to de risk a portion of our future refinancing efforts by pushing 75 million of maturity in 2028 the transaction is also a testament to our ability to access long term capital it gets even more exciting when you consider that the commodity environment and our balance sheet has only strengthened since the closing of this transaction we also expect this as a future financing avenue that could be available to us fourth to capitalize on the strength in the export market we initiated a targeted revenue hedging strategy during the second quarter of 2021 so far we have layered in two million metric tons of commodity derivative contracts in the api2 market for calendar year 2022 at a weighted average price of 79 34 per ton these financial hedges ensure strong netback core prices for us for the approximately two million tons of physical contracts we signed during 2q 21 for 2022 which are also tied to api2 prices the good news for us is that api2 prices and other export market pricing indicators continue to strengthen and we still have an additional 13 plus million tons of coal sales uncontracted for 2022 we anticipate a significant portion of these sales will go into the export markets fifth on the legacy liabilities front under our current actuarial assumptions we have a fully funded status on our defined benefit pension plan at this point we do not have any funding requirements for the foreseeable future and have significantly lowered our exposure to equity market volatility as we move forward we ll continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet while implementing our targeted growth and diversification strategy this includes our commitment to completing the itmann project we expect this project to require an additional 65 million to 70 million of capex to complete given the increased processing capacity and new train load out at the preparation facility this is an addition to the 24 million already spent on the project to date since its inception in early 2019 recommencing this project is not an either our decision relative to our debt reduction priority we still expect to continue to reduce our outstanding debt on our balance sheet and unrestricted cash this project like all financial decisions went to our rigorous capital allocation process excluding any third party revenue we expect it to generate a rate of return north of 25 over the life of the project assuming an australian premium low vol coking coal price of 160 to 170 a ton which is consistent with the actual trailing 10 year average price and the current forward strip for 2023 to 2025 we believe the returns on the itmann project will exceed our weighted average cost of capital even at long term average australian premium low oil prices of 130 a ton we are very excited about this project and its earnings and free cash flow potential with that let me now recap the second quarter results before moving on to our 2021 guidance ceix reported a very strong financial performance for 2q 21 with net income of 4 2 million or 0 12 per diluted share which included 20 4 million of unrealized mark to market losses related to commodity derivatives and adjusted ebitda of 84 4 million this compares to a loss of 18 million or 0 69 per diluted share and adjusted ebitda of 34 2 million in the year ago quarter in 2q 21 we generated 94 6 million of cash flow from operations which included 25 6 million of positive working capital changes driven by a significant reduction in our accounts and notes receivable balance additionally we spent 43 7 million in capital expenditures which included the previously discussed 18 4 million for the discretionary operating lease buyout and we received 3 4 million in proceeds from asset sales this resulted in free cash flow generation of 54 4 million in 2q 21 this highlights the ability of our business to generate free cash flow in challenging markets and capture a meaningful upside in stronger markets as a result of our free cash flow generation we have increased our unrestricted cash position by nearly 56 million in the quarter and now have an unrestricted cash position of 146 million which is the highest level since 2q 19 including the restricted cash position of 53 5 million our cash and cash equivalents balance is over 200 million now let me provide you with our updated outlook for 2021 due to our strong first half 21 operational performance and outlook for the remainder of the year we are increasing our expected sales volume for 2021 to 23 5 million to 25 million tons up from our previous guidance of 22 million to 24 million tons additionally due to the efforts of our operations team to drive costs down despite inflationary pressures so far this year we are adjusting our expected average cash cost of coal sold per ton to a range of 27 to 28 per ton down from our previous guidance of 27 to 29 per ton on the pricing front we currently have a 2021 contracted position of 24 6 million tons at an expected average price of 44 02 per ton the improvement compared to our prior guidance reflects the strength in the current pricing environment on the additional contracted volumes we have layered in as well as an improvement in the assumed pjm west power forwards finally we are increasing our capital guidance due to the decision to recommence the itmann project and the completed lease buyout to a range of 160 million to 180 million as always we will continue to reassess our guidance ranges each quarter and adjust them as necessary with that let me turn it back to jimmy to make some final comments jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer thank you mitesh before we move on to the question and answer session let me take this opportunity to provide a recap of our accomplishments in the second quarter and reiterate our priorities as we move forward first we continue to prioritize strengthening and enhancing our balance sheet by improving our liquidity and financial flexibility despite shrinking access to capital for coal companies we have had good success in identifying and tapping alternative sources of capital second despite significant inflationary pressures we continue to keep costs at our operations under control through efficiencies reduced discretionary spending and creativity in our supply chain management program the team continues to look for ways to effectively drive costs down without sacrificing the effectiveness of our operations by rightsizing our operations we ve taken some slack out of the system allowing our four operating longwalls at the pamc the ability to essentially run full out this drives efficiency and results in a sustained reduction in our average cash cost of coal sold per ton compared to our historical averages third our consol marine terminal is one of the most strategically valuable assets in our portfolio the terminal will be essential for executing our longer term strategic shift into the export market which we expect will derisk our domestic exposure and allow us to capitalize on growing international demand for our high cv product year to date we shipped more than 50 of our total sales volume into the export market which highlights the value of owning our own terminal and is a huge differentiator for us compared to our peers finally we re extremely excited to be in a position to restart the itmann project we view this project as the next phase of our strategy which focuses on targeted growth and diversification as an additional avenue to increase value for our shareholders this project is strategically important as it will diversify our portfolio by adding a new metallurgical coal product stream to the mix and it aligns well with our current operations by being low cost high margin and high quality before handing the call over i want to reiterate that we are extremely proud of our accomplishments to date and believe we have a lot of opportunity in front of us to build upon our strategic priorities our capital allocation process world class asset and employees have helped us to come out of 2020 prime to excel in 2021 and beyond there s always more work to do but we continue to focus on our goal of strengthening our balance sheet and creating long term value for our shareholders with that i will hand the call back over to nate for further instructions nathan tucker director finance and investor relations thank you jimmy we will now move to the questions and answers session of our call at this time i d like to ask our operator to please provide the instruction to our callers questions and answers operator and the first question comes from nathan martin with the benchmark company please go ahead nathan martin the benchmark company analyst good morning guys congratulations on the first half performance jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer thank you nate nathan martin the benchmark company analyst maybe i ll start on the cost side first you guys obviously lowered your guidance by i guess 0 50 a ton at the midpoint but even if i run costs in the second half flat with your second quarter results of 28 which at the high end of your revised full year guidance you end up right at the low end of that new guidance range is there something that pushes costs higher here in the second half or maybe is there a chance you could possibly outperform there jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer nate if you remember on our last earnings call i said that we expect to come in at the lower half of our cost guidance and as we look forward there s still some uncertainties in the market out there i mean we have a contracted position for 2021 that s up significantly than on our last earnings call but still we have two longwall moves in the second half of the year one in each quarter whereas in that first quarter we didn t have any and inflationary pressures from some of the commodities that we produced with we see those could come to us so as mitesh mentioned in his comments we ll reevaluate and look at it but our goal is to keep a tight lease on cost where we can and then let the operations team do what they do best and they figure out ways to lower cost as we continue to produce but the reason that we lowered it 1 is because of our performance to date and then as we look forward with one longwall move in each quarter we think we ll have an opportunity to still come in toward the lower end of that guidance and that s what our goal will be mitesh thakkar chief financial officer and nate i think inflation is a big part of a little bit of cautiousness here as you know all raw material prices have been higher since the beginning of the year so i think that is something that we continuously monitor i think our supply chain team has done a good job of managing that so far but there s always some buffer related to inflation as we go through the year as things continue to be very strong in the commodity landscape nathan martin the benchmark company analyst got it i appreciate those thoughts guys and then maybe shifting over to the pricing side looks like you re essentially fully contracted for this year meaning additional 400 000 tons or so at the high end of revised guidance should we assume those tons would likely go to the export market and then if we look forward to 2022 i think you layered on an additional five million tons or so there can you talk about the mix of those tons and give us an idea of what prices they were layered in thanks robert braithwaite vice president marketing and sales yes sure nate this is bob just to kind of highlight 2021 as we mentioned earlier we have now 24 6 million tons sold the additional volume we had to get to the upper end of the guidance i would suggest that that s likely going to go into the export market there s still about a 5 to 10 arbitrage versus what the domestic prices are today even at 4 gas i would suggest that the prices you re seeing in the publications cold desk reference and they call it the mid 50 range we re still seeing an arbitrage in the export market so it s likely that those volumes will go there as far as 2022 is concerned we did contract an additional 5 3 million tons since our last earnings call about 80 of those volumes were contracted into the international market so sitting here today of the 10 9 million tons a little over four million tons of those are contracted to go exports and based on where we sit today i would suggest that our export volumes will be pretty much similar to if not a little bit higher in 2022 than what we expect to export in 2021 and again that goes based on jimmy s comments of our strategic shift and then also again based on the price arbitrage that exists today nathan martin the benchmark company analyst i appreciate that color bob and just any early thoughts on potential production levels in 2022 given the positive quarter view of the market jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer yeah i think as we ve always said we ll run to the market thus far we ve been able to run our four longwalls full out we would want to continue that into 2022 and then depending upon what future forecasts we see there we could run some additional shifts or something but i would expect our tonnage for 2022 to be very similar to what we have in 2021 with possibly some upside nathan martin the benchmark company analyst got it thanks for that jimmy and then just a real quick one to shift to itmann i appreciate all the color you guys are given on the projects and the updates there i guess how do we think about production ramp i m assuming we ll have to wait for the prep plant completion before we see any meaningful production which i think you guys would say may be mid to second half 22 can you kind of talk about that and then maybe your decision to relocate the existing prep plant with additional capacity maybe just any thoughts on the appetite you see to fill that excess capacity thanks daniel connell senior vice president strategy sure nate this is dan regarding the first part of your question on the production ramp we have been fortunate in being able to continue our development mining here at a reduced rate for the past number of months and we ll continue that as we build out the plant so that puts us in really good position when the plant becomes available targeting kind of the q3 2022 timeframe to very rapidly ramp up and bring both of the additional sections on that we will need to scale up to full production so i think our plan would be that during the second half of next year we can move from kind of the controlled development mining that we ve been doing to something very close to if not achieving full production during 2022 the decision to relocate the plant is one that as jimmy mentioned we ran a lot of analysis on we had time to give that a thorough look given kind of the pause in the project during last couple of months so we feel like we ve vetted that plan very well there are a number of reserves kind of in the vicinity of where this prep plant is being built that are have yet to be developed and we actually have some development mining going on nearby it and then in some of the upper seams as we speak that we ll likely be looking for a home so we feel optimistic about the opportunity to pull third party tons into the plant based on economics should help to improve the product wins that we can produce coming out of itmann and to be clear the economic numbers that we ve been reporting do not assume any upside from those third party tons so we have we based our decisions on just kind of an itmann base case and we view the third party tons as upside to that plan jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer yeah and nate just to add to that one of the things when we were looking at the preparation plant which is a big decision as far as us ramping up to full production the 900 000 tons plus that we had mentioned we would not want to do that until we re processing our own coal and we can get that through so when we looked at the preparation plant one of the key factors there on our initial plan we were going to build a much smaller plant that would be somewhere around 350 tons an hour and then we were going to if we got all the third party business everything we would add that second piece on well we re buying this plant and relocating it we have that from day one and then some of the increase in capital was because of the trained load out that we re going to have that s going to give us the ability to not only move our coal very efficiently on the rail line but also any third party coal that we have coming into there so i remain very very excited about the itmann project i m happy that we put ourselves in a position to whereas we can recommence it and i think it s going to be a nice return and be a nice project for our shareholders nathan martin the benchmark company analyst got it i appreciate that those additional thoughts that makes sense and then just finally i think mitesh obviously you went through some quick irr numbers for itmann and i might have missed some of those but have you guys done kind of any payback period calculations for the project and what that might look like at various net price decks thanks mitesh thakkar chief financial officer sure i think it depends on what met price do you use i mean some of these cases the payback period could be as little as two to three years i ll let dan address some more specific payback periods if you will daniel connell senior vice president strategy sure no i mean i think as we mentioned nate during the remarks we ve kind of run the project economics using a price strip that s consistent with both the 10 year average historic met prices and the current forward strip and that puts you kind of in the payback range that mitesh mentioned i think in terms of roi numbers we said north of 25 obviously if you run the numbers at the current market and assume that it holds out here for a couple of years payback period becomes quite short and these are paybacks the roi numbers just to clarify are based on total project capital costs since inception if you look at the numbers on a go forward basis may become more attractive than what was before mitesh thakkar chief financial officer i think that s an important point that i want to highlight that all these economics that we ran are on total project cost basis it s not just a go forward capex that we used for analysis even though today if you are making that decision you should look at go forward because that s more applicable we wanted to make sure that the project economics hold nathan martin the benchmark company analyst got it i appreciate all that information guys thanks again for the time today and best of luck in the second half jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer yeah thanks nathan operator the next question comes from lucas pipes with b riley securities please go ahead lucas pipes b riley securities analyst thanks very much and good morning everyone jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer good morning lucas pipes b riley securities analyst i may have missed it earlier but jimmy you mentioned the spread between the international and the domestic market and i wondered can you elaborate on what that spread is today i e what is seeing for export tons what is pricing for domestic tons and then do you have a view on what might trigger these prices to which obviously would be great to see the domestic pricing move up so i appreciate your thoughts on there thank you robert braithwaite vice president marketing and sales yeah lucas this is bob right now i d say the arbitrage versus kind of the published marks the published marks are call it mid 50 levels for prompt right around 50 levels for coal strip 22 the volumes we ve locked in to date on the international side the arbitrage is roughly around 5 or 10 and that does not include any again terminal revenues that we receive as well so that s kind of the level we re at today going forward i still view that this market has legs for at least another 12 to 18 months i mean the supply response just is not there not only in coal but gas space as well and inventories are significantly below their averages in fact i read an article just last week that gas reserves in europe are the lowest they ve been in over a decade and then when you look at pet coke prices continue to trend upward and now 90 up year on year so again i think this market has legs on a continued the back of a continued post pandemic recovery and just a relatively muted supply response jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer yeah and i would add lucas going forward when we re looking at gas prices where they are today and i can t reiterate enough the supply response just hasn t been there so i think i agree with bob i think the market does have legs into the coming years particularly on the international market and that will help drive some of the domestic pricing as well so we feel like it does have legs with demand increasing for electricity gas prices where they are and a muted supply response lucas pipes b riley securities analyst thank you very much bob and jimmy for that perspective in terms of your capital allocation you re clearly shifting well you re shifting toward growth with itmann good to see that and i wondered from here on out what are your priorities is it more so on the capital is it more on the debt side buying back maybe more we saw at your transaction on the capital lease side what are some of the opportunities and mitesh maybe if you could speak to any limits or restrictions you may have would very much appreciate your perspective thank you mitesh thakkar chief financial officer so let me start by saying that we are in a very strong position today and are constantly reviewing our capital allocation priorities to ensure that they are consistent with changing market conditions and provide us the best risk adjusted return in line with our strategic priorities and the attractive rates of returns that we just talked about for itmann project we relaunched it makes a lot of sense for incremental dollars that we are spending also as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we still have some wood to chop as far as deleveraging is concerned now debt repurchases are not as attractive as they used to be before but given that we want to de lever and the fact that we still have an 11 paper out there that allows us to be opportunistic in that area i think you ll continue to see us pay down our debt or repurchase in the open market because as i said earlier it s not an either or decision for us as far as deleveraging is concerned and itmann is concerned the steps that we are taking with deleveraging and growing our met coal business are all geared toward one goal and that is really to create significant value for our shareholders whether it comes from growth or from having larger equity value in the enterprise the good news is that the market is offering us the opportunity today to launch and execute on multiple of these initiatives and returning capital to our shareholders is one of them right we are constantly reviewing it and hope to provide you an update in coming quarters as we execute on our near term goals as well with respect to the operating leases i don t see any big opportunities right now on that front we saw one in the second quarter and executed on it which i feel was one of the best projects so to speak when you think about from a rate of return perspective we ran the dcf some it was a very easy decision to make so i think those are the opportunities we ll continue to look at and continue to deliver on some of our strategic priorities jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer yeah and the good news is for us it s not an either or as mitesh mentioned earlier in his comments with us generating free cash flow at the rate we are per quarter we have an opportunity to do all of these things but i want to reiterate really excited about the itmann project it gives us that diversity in our product stream of having the low vol metallurgical coal in the mix and i think we re going to continue to do the things that we ve done in the past which enhanced the balance sheet provides great liquidity and add a new product mix to our stream lucas pipes b riley securities analyst thank you very much and when i saw those capital lease numbers i thought i should get into the business of lending to you guys really appreciate all the color continued best of luck jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer thanks lucas operator the next question comes from michael dudas with vertical research partners please go ahead michael dudas vertical research partners analyst good morning everyone jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer good morning michael dudas vertical research partners analyst first question maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on your domestic customer base again certainly inventories down demand up how urgent do you feel they are right now especially as where we ve had better economic activity going forward and where gas prices are and any update on your customer base relative to potential coal power plant closures and your exposure there and how that may impact maybe some of your competitive suppliers as those things work through the system robert braithwaite vice president marketing and sales mike right now we are in discussions with several domestic customers not only for the balance of 21 but 2022 as well without a doubt utilities are realizing that spot coal is not readily available as it once was so with that being said i do believe that there will be opportunities to lock in some longer term volumes to ensure they have supply going forward so with that being said stay tuned there but as you mentioned inventories are i would say near critical levels for many of the domestic utilities that we do serve when i say critical levels i m saying sub 10 days of inventory on the ground and with gas price at 4 i don t see that that this will change in the very near future so again it should bode very well for us in our contracting abilities for 2022 as far as closures are concerned as of right now within the next 10 years we have very minimal of our customer base look that has announced that they will retire i would say it s in a neighborhood of 0 5 million to one million total tons that we view at risk obviously as jimmy talked about before is reggie we do have to be concerned about reggie which we re keeping a close eye on that could have some additional impact on us in pennsylvania but again we are continuing to look and focus on shifting some of those volumes already in the export market so that s kind of where we stand today michael dudas vertical research partners analyst i appreciate that secondly moving internationally say to your important market in india and you mentioned about pet coke and could you maybe just a thought on just the dynamics going on in the asian coal market especially with some of the shifts in coal in and out of china and then the lack of supply response again not to predict the future markets but you got pretty strong curves out there relative to say and jimmy mentioned your 2014 and 2018 coal price spikes in internationally how different is it dynamic and what you re seeing here especially as you guys have evolved into a much more important and solid provider coal into those export markets robert braithwaite vice president marketing and sales yeah one thing that benefits us as we mentioned in our remarks our coal being a high btu high calorific value coal does transport very nicely into these markets especially into the asian markets where there is additional transportation as far as this time around versus what happened in call it 2014 as we mentioned the supply response isn t there i mean if you look at the production not only in the u s but look at the production in colombia i mean it s significantly down and they re just not those production basins just aren t coming back is strong plus not only that there s additional build outs internationally i mean india obviously is a targeted market for us they re going they have been going through and continue to go through industrial revolution and then again with the whole australia and china tensions continuing it is opening up doors for us to get bailey coal into china as well as jimmy mentioned we did contract our first cargo there this year which is our first since 2018 so again i think a lot of this is based on just again a post pandemic recovery and muted supply response that we just do not feel is coming back michael dudas vertical research partners analyst understood and finally i guess mitesh on your derivative book that you re creating here is that something that is i assume its opportunistic but as we see that as you managed the pricing markets there s a little bit more exposure to that as you move forward is that something that s going to be part of how you on the marketing and hedging side going forward especially with your more exposure in those export markets mitesh thakkar chief financial officer yeah so mike you re absolutely right i think what we did in the second quarter was more opportunistic but it also demonstrates a tool that we have in future i think one of the things that we have noticed is there was interest in doing api tooling contracts by some of our supplier by some of our customers so we wanted to manage that risk and in hindsight you look at it it almost looks like we could have waited three more months and we would have been a lot better off but i think the goal there was to mitigate the risk and i think we used it appropriately at that time but it also gave us another tool to do some of the things where if we want to if we are seeing that we are not making progress on improving our contracted position but the api2 market is there we can lock in tons there and have some of that book right now that s not the case but that doesn t mean it s not going to be in the future i think our marketing team is very successful in layering in some contracts here in the export markets even on a term basis and not just spot basis which is really good we like that approach much better than using the derivatives but it s a tool that we have we can use michael dudas vertical research partners analyst that sounds great i appreciate your thoughts gentlemen jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer thanks mike operator

in securities exchange comm n v fowler no 20 1081 2021 wl 3083655 2d cir july 22 2021 the united states court of appeals for the second circuit upheld a lower court judgment awarding the securities and exchange commission sec civil penalties disgorgement and injunctive relief in a securities fraud action against a broker engaged in unsuitable and unauthorized high frequency trading the district court entered its judgment following a jury trial finding the defendant guilty of violations of section 10 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 rule 10b 5 promulgated under section 10 b of the exchange act and sections 17 a 1 17 a 2 and 17 a 3 of the securities act of 1933 on appeal defendant asserted that the action was subject to a five year statute of limitations imposed by 28 u s c 2462 despite the parties having entered into tolling agreements defendant also argued that the civil penalties assessed against him were excessive and the disgorgement award failed to properly account for legitimate business expenses as required by liu v securities exchange comm n 140 s ct 1936 2020 after reviewing its text and legislative history the second circuit concluded in this matter of first impression that 2462 is non jurisdictional and therefore the district court had the power to hear the case in light of the parties tolling agreements the decision is important because it reaffirms the enforceability of tolling agreements between the sec and its investigative quarries the court also rejected defendant s arguments alleging improper civil penalty and disgorgement calculations the sec began investigating defendant a financial advisor for j d nicolas in 2014 for conduct that began in 2011 his trading strategy entailed reviewing news reports to identify events he determined stocks had not yet fully absorbed into their price and invested his clients in those stocks defendant s approach resulted in high turnover rates significant transaction fees and unauthorized trades in 2016 the sec and defendant entered into two agreements that operated to toll the five year statute of limitations for the sec to file an action against defendant that would have expired in 2016 until february 28 2017 the sec brought its action on january 9 2017 the jury convicted defendant of making false and misleading statements to investors recommended an unsuitable high frequency trading strategy and engaged in unauthorized trading on february 28 2020 the district court entered a judgement ordering defendant to disgorge 132 076 40 and pay civil penalties of 1 950 000 on appeal defendant pursued his statute of limitations argument by challenging the district court s very power to hear the case he cited to 28 u s c 2462 which provides xcept as otherwise provided by act of congress an action suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine penalty or forfeiture pecuniary or otherwise shall not be entertained unless commenced within five years from the date when the claim first accrued defendant argued that 28 u s c 2462 is jurisdictional meaning courts only have the power to hear cases brought within five years regardless of tolling agreements entered into between parties if so the sec s action would have been time barred in rejecting defendant s challenge the second circuit cited supreme court precedent and explained that filing deadlines should not be described as jurisdictional absent a clear indication that congress wanted the rule to be jurisdictional henderson ex rel henderson v shinseki 562 u s 428 435 36 2011 without a clear statement courts should treat as nonjurisdictional united states v kwai fun wong 575 u s 402 409 2015 defendant asserted that the phrase in 2462 shall not be entertained exhibited congress clear intention to render the statute jurisdictional because the supreme court has described subject matter jurisdiction as the classes of cases a court may entertain fort bend cnty v davis 139 s ct 1843 1848 2019 however the second circuit noted that the court has also explained that most statutes of limitations are non jurisdictional even when the time limit is important most are and even when it is framed in mandatory terms again most are indeed that is so however emphatic expressed those terms may be wong 575 u s at 410 for that reason the court found that the phrase shall not be entertained upon which defendant heavily relied did not itself tell the court that congress intended 2462 to be jurisdictional the court then considered the legislative history of 2462 noting subtle shifts in the statutory language from shall not be maintained to shall not be entertained and a house of representatives committee report that confirmed those changes were made in phraseology only the second circuit thus found no intent to engineer a substantive legal change in the statute and concluded this case was not the exceptional one in which a century s worth of precedent and practice in american courts rank a time limit as jurisdictional sebelius v auburn reg l med ctr 568 u s 145 155 2013 quotation marks omitted the court therefore held that 2462 is a non jurisdictional statute of limitations the parties tolling agreements were enforceable and the district court had the authority to hear the case by holding that 28 u s c 2462 is non jurisdictional the second circuit has for the first time in a precedential decision preserved an important tool for the sec in managing its long term investigations the court also rejected the remainder of defendant s arguments that the civil penalties should not have been applied on a per customer basis were unconstitutionally excessive and the disgorgement award failed to account for legitimate business expenses the clean sweep is an important win for the sec whose broad enforcement powers have come under fire in recent high profile appellate and supreme court cases

update 6 11 p m et and you don t exactly need the enigma machine to translate the handwriting on the wall from the new york times asked at the white house if mr cuomo should leave office mr biden responded bluntly yes he stopped short of calling for mr cuomo to be removed if he refuses to resign let s take one thing at a time mr biden said mr biden a longtime friend of mr cuomo s had avoided addressing the accusations when they arose earlier this year appearing content to stay on the sidelines of a growing rift between the democratic party and the increasingly isolated new york governor and that i suspect is the ballgame that sound you heard from albany was the boom lowered by new york attorney general letitia james on the state s suddenly not presidentially viable governor andrew cuomo an investigation into harassment complaints prompted james s office on tuesday to release a torpedo of a report that very likely sank cuomo s political career from the new york times governor cuomo sexually harassed current and former state employees in violation of both federal and state laws ms james said the independent investigation found that governor cuomo harassed multiple women many of whom were young women by engaging in unwanted groping kisses hugging and by making inappropriate comments ms james said the report revealed a deeply disturbing yet clear picture and conduct that corrodes the very fabric and character of our state government and shines light on injustice that can be present at the highest levels of government as the times points out more trouble is rolling in the local district attorney in albany has asked for the material developed by james office and there was almost immediately talk of impeaching cuomo whose time in office has been marked by his ability to make enemies in and around politics you have to remember back during those glorious days of the early pandemic when cuomo s daily press briefings were both televised and were a useful contrast to the disinformation and chaos in the white house cuomo was the country s stern father laying out the truths the white house either couldn t or wouldn t share his stock rose conspicuously david dee delgado getty images new york attorney general letitia james on tuesday presented the findings from her investigation into sexual harassment allegations against new york governor andrew cuomo however with the election of the president in november charges concerning cuomo s behavior began to pile up particularly in february and march when women came forward on the record to make them in late february lindsey boylan a former economic development official in the cuomo administration became the first woman to outline her claims against the governor ms boylan said mr cuomo suggested they play strip poker on a plane while on a work trip and said the governor kissed her on the lips in his manhattan office a few days later charlotte bennett a former executive assistant to mr cuomo told the new york times that the governor made comments that she took as sexual overtures while they were alone in his albany office last year ms bennett said mr cuomo said he was looking for a girlfriend and asked her whether she was monogamous and had sex with older men cuomo s rapid response to james report succeeded in being rapid but not very well as a response there s a mixture of denial outrage and explanation the latter on the theme of cuomo s admitting that yes he is an affectionate demonstrative italian male given to platonic abbracci which could be easily misinterpreted as proof of this cuomo s response contains page after page of pictures of cuomo and other politicians including presidents obama and george w bush hugging people as though that in any way exonerates him this is not a compelling response and tends to devalue the other parts of cuomo s case including his flat denials subscribe to esquire today and get a weekly newsletter from charles p pierce the print magazine learn more here cuomo s fall is an epic saga of being nice to the people on the way up because you know etc etc he stomped through albany with his own agendas even setting up a personal satrapy within the democratic legislative majorities that confounded the other democrats in april the democrats voted to strip cuomo of the emergency powers that had made him a star in 2020 on tuesday when the ag s report was released he looked around and found himself friendless that is not likely to change as the sands run out on his career which to be honest never was as golden as a lot of people made it out to be

the business he says the company and the industry in general have entered a period of secular growth for moelis co that means the pace of new business is high and its pipeline of deals is as strong as ever moelis also says the fundamentals of m a markets are changing in front of our eyes noting the vast amount of money flowing into private equity and other alternative investments another space

insurance market the insurer is positioned well if the inflationary environment is here to stay cfo dan frey mentioned that the company has natural hedges as part of its business that can mitigate the effects of inflation that s because higher inflation is associated with strong economic activity which leads to the need for higher insurance exposure leading to higher margins for the insurer the

distributable earnings which is considered a non gaap financial measure within the meaning of the applicable rules of the securities and exchange commission or sec distributable earnings does not represent net income or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap or an indication of rmrm s cash flows

calculating distributable earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures therefore rmrm s reported distributable earnings may not be comparable to the distributable earnings as reported by other companies rmrm calculates distributable earnings as net income computed in accordance with gaap

amortization if any c non cash equity compensation expense d unrealized gains losses and other similar non cash items that are included in net income for the period of the calculation regardless of

earnings may be a useful indicator of distributions to rmrm s shareholders and is a measure that is considered by rmrm s board of trustees when determining the amount of such distributions rmrm believes that distributable earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap this measure

the biden administration and public health officials are encouraging all americans to get vaccinated against covid 19 and its variants as the highly transmissible delta variant of covid 19 spreads rapidly across the united states the biden administration public health agencies and lawmakers are doing all that they can to encourage people to get vaccinated according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the vaccines are effective in preventing serious illness or death against covid 19 and its variants now verify viewer ashley wants to know if the government is paying citizens to get vaccinated the question is the federal government paying people to get vaccinated the sources the answer no the federal government is not paying people to get vaccinated however it is providing the covid 19 vaccines free of charge to all u s residents and providing funding to states to use for their own vaccine incentive programs what we found on may 10 2021 the u s department of treasury announced the launch of coronavirus state and local fiscal recovery funds which was established by the american rescue plan act of 2021 to provide 350 billion in emergency funding to eligible state local territorial and tribal governments in an effort to help bring back jobs address the covid 19 pandemic s economic fallout and lay the foundation for a strong equitable recovery according to the department of treasury recipients of this emergency funding could use the money to pay for vaccine incentive programs like cash or in kind transfers lottery programs or other incentives for individuals who get vaccinated under the interim final rule recipients may use coronavirus state and local fiscal recovery funds to respond to the covid 19 public health emergency including expenses related to covid 19 vaccination programs said the department of treasury programs that provide incentives reasonably expected to increase the number of people who choose to get vaccinated or that motivate people to get vaccinated sooner than they otherwise would have are an allowable use of funds so long as such costs are reasonably proportional to the expected public health benefit by the end of may states like maryland new york ohio and oregon had announced vaccine lotteries in hopes of increasing vaccinations in the states in june president joe biden announced the national month of action which was a community based effort to get at least 70 of american adults at least partially vaccinated against covid 19 by july 4 at that time several companies partnered with the biden administration and offered incentives to encourage people to get their covid 19 shots other states like west virginia connecticut and new jersey also began offering a variety of incentives to their residents the centers for medicare medicaid services also announced on june 9 an additional payment amount for administering in home covid 19 vaccinations to medicare beneficiaries who may have had difficulty leaving their homes or were otherwise hard to reach as a part of the biden administration s commitment to increasing access to vaccinations on aug 2 the u s officially hit biden s 70 vaccination goal but that isn t stopping the administration from continuing to work with states and local leaders to encourage more people to get vaccinated during a recent speech at the white house the president called on all states and local governments to use the funding they received to give 100 to anyone who gets fully vaccinated i know that paying people to get vaccinated might sound unfair to folks who ve gotten vaccinated already but here s the deal if incentives help us beat this virus i believe we should use them we all benefit if we can get more people vaccinated said biden

littleton co accesswire august 3 2021 ur energy inc nyse american urg tsx ure the company or ur energy has filed the company s form 10 q for the quarter ended june 30 2021 with the u s securities and exchange commission at www sec gov edgar shtml and with canadian securities authorities at www sedar com ur energy chairman and ceo jeff klenda said we are pleased to announce our results from the first half of 2021 we ended the period with more than 20 million in cash and 285 000 pounds u s produced u 3 o 8 in inventory at the conversion facility we continued to advance regulatory approvals at both our lost creek property and shirley basin project having received all remaining major approvals for shirley basin during q2 our second uranium project in wyoming now stands construction ready the approvals also mean that we have effectively doubled the company s licensed and permitted production capacity as we recognize the eighth anniversary of operations at lost creek we are encouraged by positive catalysts and increased investor interest in the uranium market which in time should allow us to ramp up to full production again while our first priority in ramp up will be to recover the remaining uranium resources in the existing two mine units at lost creek the recent and anticipated regulatory approvals for recovery at the adjacent lc east project will allow us to subsequently expand our planned production into several additional mine units we remain grateful for our dedicated operations and technical staff as they continue to optimize all operational aspects of lost creek lost creek is an exceptional property and we are fortunate to have an experienced and professional team ready to ensure the most efficient return to full production operations when conditions warrant financial results as of june 30 2021 we had cash resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents of 21 5 million in addition to our cash position our finished ready to sell conversion facility inventory value is immediately realizable if necessary we do not anticipate selling our existing finished product inventory in 2021 unless market conditions change sufficiently to warrant its sale during the quarter we received notifications that the principal amount of 893 thousand and accrued interest of approximately 10 thousand were forgiven under the terms of the small business administration paycheck protection program this was treated as a forgiveness of debt on the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended june 30 2021 and a 903 thousand gain on debt forgiveness was recognized in other income lost creek operations lost creek continues to operate at reduced production levels while we await the implementation of the national uranium reserve further relief pursuant to the recommendations of the united states nuclear fuel working group the working group and additional positive developments in the uranium markets the reduced production operations have allowed us to sustain operating cost reductions at lost creek while continuing to conduct preventative maintenance and optimize processes in preparation for ramp up to full production rates these preparations include advanced planning for anticipated drilling and production well installation in our fully permitted mine unit 2 mu2 the wyoming uranium recovery program has approved an amendment to the lost creek source material license to include recovery from the uranium resource in the lc east project hj and km horizons immediately adjacent to the lost creek project this license approval grants the company access to six planned mine units in addition to the already licensed three mine units at lost creek the approval also increases the license limit for annual plant production to 2 2 million pounds u 3 o 8 which includes wellfield production of up to 1 2 million pounds u 3 o 8 and toll processing up to one million pounds u 3 o 8 the wyoming department of environmental quality land quality division continues its review of the application for amendment to the lost creek permit to mine which will add the lc east and km mine units we anticipate that the land quality division review will be complete in 2021 shirley basin project during q2 the state of wyoming and the epa completed their respective reviews of our shirley basin project and issued the source material license permit to mine and aquifer exemption for the project these three approvals represent the final major permits required to begin construction of the shirley basin project the company plans three relatively shallow mining units at the project where we have the option to build out a complete processing plant with drying facilities or a satellite plant with the ability to send loaded ion exchange resin to lost creek for processing as approved the shirley basin processing facility is allowed to recover up to one million pounds u 3 o 8 annually from the wellfield the annual production of u 3 o 8 from wellfield production and toll processing of loaded resin or yellowcake slurry will not exceed two million pounds equivalent of dried u 3 o 8 product situated in an historic mining district the project has existing access roads power waste disposal facility and shop buildings onsite because delineation and exploration drilling were completed historically the project is construction ready all wellfield pipeline and header house layouts are finalized and additional minor on the ground preparations have been initiated in 2021 q3 2021 continuing guidance international recognition of nuclear power s role in achieving net zero carbon emissions goals has resulted in a renewed interest in the uranium sector in 2021 the paris climate agreement calls for net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and the u s has rejoined the agreement under the biden administration which continues to demonstrate support for the nuclear industry our current cash position as of july 28 2021 is 20 8 million in addition to our strong cash position we have nearly 285 000 pounds of finished u s produced inventory worth 9 2 million at recent spot prices our financial position provides us with adequate funds to maintain and enhance operational readiness at lost creek as well as preserve our existing inventory for higher prices our long tenured operational and professional staff have significant levels of experience and adaptability which will allow for an easier transition back to full operations lost creek operations can increase to full production rates in as little as six months following a go decision simply by developing additional header houses within the fully permitted mu2 development expenses during this six month ramp up period are estimated to be approximately 14 million and are almost entirely related to mu2 drilling and header house construction costs we are prepared to ramp up and to deliver our lost creek production inventory to the new national uranium reserve additionally with all major permits and authorizations for our shirley basin project now in hand we stand ready to construct at the mine site when market conditions warrant we

by peter koenig china daily updated 2021 08 04 07 57 jin ding china daily china s success story goes hand in hand with the evolution of the communist party of china the founding of the party on july 1 1921 signaled the start of ending some 200 years of oppression by foreign powers western invasions occupation and exploitation and looting of china s rich natural resources one of the cpc s key objectives was to ensure china would never again be exploited or dominated by western powers the cpc became a force to be reckoned with as it grew stronger by deepening the solidarity forged among communities and regions across china with all pursuing the same goal of independence from colonization and exploitation and the creation of a sovereign communist china with a sovereign socialist economy western attempts to destabilize china over the past several decades the united states the united kingdom and some other western countries have continually sought to destabilize china by interfering in taiwan which is a blatant interference in the country s internal affairs the latest such move includes the us sale of weapons worth 5 billion to taiwan in december 2020 earlier this year the us ambassador to the pacific island of palau palau being one of the handful of states that has diplomatic ties with taiwan became the first us envoy to travel to taiwan in an official capacity since washington severed formal ties with the island in favor of beijing in 1979 in addition the us is promoting closer relations with taiwan through the so called taipei taiwan allies international protection and enhancement initiative act signed in april 2020 which calls for strengthening trade and other relations between the us and taiwan to bring the island closer to international space meaning politically distancing the island territory from the chinese mainland the interferences in china s internal affairs also include the us triggered trade war against beijing the stationing of about 60 percent of the us navy in the south china sea efforts to extend washington s long arm jurisdiction to the hong kong special administrative region baseless accusation of human rights violations in the xinjiang uygur autonomous region and imposing sanctions on chinese entities such efforts are clearly aimed at thwarting china s development and thus checking its peaceful rise evil foreign designs have been thwarted thanks to the steadfast leadership of president xi jinping china has dealt with these interferences carefully always trying to find diplomatic and non belligerent solutions also china has always followed the path of non aggression while moving peacefully forward with the goal of building a multipolar world where people of different countries regions races religions cultures and ideologies can prosper peacefully since the founding of the party china has striven for common global development but unlike the west never tried to influence other countries or promote its ideology or political system what the cpc has achieved in its 100 years of history is truly remarkable its accomplishments include not only maintaining internal solidarity but also winning the chinese people s trust moving peacefully forward realizing food security and providing proper education and healthcare to all not to forget china has lifted about 800 million people out of extreme poverty which no other country has achieved because of the party s leadership today the cpc has about 95 million members making it the largest governing party in the world and thanks to the cpc s leadership china has become the second largest economy in the world in nominal gdp terms and the largest in terms of purchasing power parity these achievements however are considered a threat to the western world by the us which still holds sway over international organization including global economic and financial organizations because of the dominance of the us dollar yet empire is crumbling us dollar slowly losing its sheen the us knows it its strongest asset the dollar is gradually losing sheen the us dollar is still widely used around the world to purchase vital goods and services such as energy food and communications services as well as in other areas of global trade but it is losing its weight in the international financial market the reasons are both political and economic on the economic front the us has created through its 1913 federal reserve act a fiat currency a currency whose flow and volume can be increased at will this allows the us to print money as per necessity including to finance extensive wars and conflicts around the globe and accumulate debts that the us treasury and the fed will never be able to pay back when washington abandoned in 1971 its self designed gold standard through the bretton woods conference in 1944 the us dollar became the de facto new gold standard because the gold standard was based on the value of the us dollar 35 troy ounce about 31 grams instead of on a basket of currencies since everybody needed us dollars for their foreign exchange reserves it gave the us treasury a free hand to increase its money supply almost infinitely when the us in the early 1970s negotiated with saudi arabia then head of the organization of petroleum exporting countries that all hydrocarbons including petrol gas and coal should be traded in us dollars it gave the us another dollar boost to freely print dollars as the entire world needed them to buy hydrocarbon energy even today about 84 percent of all energy consumed worldwide consists of hydrocarbons 2019 forbes in return the us promised saudi arabia that it will always protect it economically strategically and militarily and proceeded almost immediately to build numerous military bases in saudi arabia from which it is now waging different wars in the middle east us most debt ridden country in the world the printing of dollars at random and thus continuous accumulation of new debt has made the us by far the most indebted country in the world its current debt amounts to 49 8 trillion compared with its gdp of about 21 trillion in 2020 that is a 237 percent debt over gdp there is another important component of us debt which the general accounting office calls unfunded liabilities 213 trillion all figures 16 april 2021 us debt clock these exceptionally high ratios have also to do with covid 19 induced debt unfunded liabilities are debt obligations of countries that don t have sufficient funds or assets set aside to repay them these liabilities generally refer to the us government s debt service unpaid interest on debt or pension plans and their impact on savings and investment securities as well as medical insurance and social support coverage for soldiers returning from wars these astronomical debt figures and the dollar s unbacked fiat character are further reducing the world s confidence in the us dollar that the us does not intend to repay its debt was always known but allan greenspan fed chair from 1987 to 2006 confirmed it when in reply to a journalist s question on when will the us repay its debt he said never we just print new money over the past about 10 years the us dollar has been losing its hydrocarbon trade monopoly also other international contracts are no longer finalized in us dollars today china russia iran venezuela and some other countries have stopped using the dollar in foreign trade and instead are trading in their own currencies and increasingly in the chinese yuan why countries around the world started realizing that the dollar is a highly volatile fiat currency an equally important factor for the loss of trust in the us currency is washington s frequent use of dollar denominated international assets and the us banking system to impose draconian and illegal economic sanctions on countries that do not follow its dictates including blocking countries reserve assets placed overseas such nefarious economic and political acts of the us have triggered the end of the dollar s hegemony the diminishing trust in the dollar may further intensify when china rolls out its digital currency which can be used for international trade without touching the us dominated swift transfer and us banking systems the yuan backed by a strong and solid chinese economy is fast gaining the trust of countries around the world and the use of the yuan as an international reserve asset is rapidly expanding the digital yuan could also become an international reserve currency thereby further reducing the demand for the us dollar while the fed is also contemplating issuing a digital currency it is not clear to what extent it can be detached from the dollar and its debt burden but with us global trade waning and china s foreign trade growing it will be very difficult for a declining us economy to catch up with a rising chinese economy for example in the first half of this year china s foreign trade exports and imports increased to 18 07 trillion yuan 2 79 trillion up 27 1 percent year on year with exports jumping 28 1 percent and imports rising 25 9 percent in yuan terms according to china s general administration of customs if anything these developments along with the fact that china has largely contained the covid 19 pandemic within its borders and resumed near normal economic activity testify to the success of the party s able leadership and a sound chinese economy and fiscal policy this is the result of what china calls socialism with chinese characteristics a feature demonstrating the constant evolution of the cpc these facts will further enhance international trust in the chinese economy as well as in china s efforts to help build a more equal more egalitarian and more just multipolar world where countries can safeguard their sovereignty culture and national resources follow their monetary policy improve their foreign relations and live peacefully together chinese vision and the cpc the belt and road initiative is the brainchild of president xi it s based on the same ancient principles that powered the ancient silk road and made it such a huge success and aimed at building bridges between peoples and promoting the exchange of goods and services research knowledge cultural wisdom peacefully harmoniously and in win win style in the 21st century on sept 7 2013 xi proposed the belt and road initiative at kazakhstan s nazarbayev university while speaking about people to people friendship and creating a better future for humankind referring to the ancient silk road xi talked about the history of exchanges and said countries with differences in race belief and cultural background can absolutely share peace and development as long as they persist in unity and mutual trust equality and mutual benefit mutual tolerance and learning from each other as well as cooperation and win win outcomes xi s vision may be shaping the world of the 21st century as it is aimed at connecting the world through land and sea by improving infrastructure and establishing industrial joint ventures including in energy education and research institutions cultural exchanges and much more the belt and road initiative has already been enshrined in china s constitution and since 2017 it has become the flagship of the country s foreign policy the purpose of the initiative is also to construct a unified large market and make full use of both international and domestic markets through cultural exchanges and integration to enhance mutual understanding and trust of member nations ending up in an innovative pattern with capital inflows talent pool and technology database the belt and road of mutual understanding belt and road related investments in more than 150 countries and international organizations across asia africa europe the middle east and the americas have already exceeded 5 trillion the initiative is also aimed at ensuring economies can benefit from their comparative advantages and creating win win conditions for them essentially the purpose of the initiative is to build and deepen mutual understanding and trust among belt and road countries facilitating the free flow of capital across borders and share common development and prosperity in the first six years since xi proposed the belt and road initiative the west was in denial of its existence for it believed the initiative would fail but fail it didn t instead even many european union members including greece italy and portugal have joined it and more are likely to follow as the temptation to participate in the successful and beneficial initiative is overwhelming yet the belt and road initiative is not the only plan that will boost china s economy and standing in the world after facing western aggression denigration and belligerence for decades china is focusing on trade development and cooperation with its asean member partners in november 2020 after eight years of negotiations china signed the regional comprehensive economic partnership agreement with the 10 members of the association of southeast asian nations and japan the republic of korea australia and new zealand the rcep covers some 2 2 billion people and accounts for about 30 percent of the global gdp making it the largest free trade agreement in the world besides under the rcep framework trade deals will be finalized in local currencies and the yuan not in us dollars which makes the rcep a platform for de dollarizing trade first in the asia pacific region and then gradually across the world moving away from dollar based trade would be an effective way of countering the west s sanctions culture or making western sanctions totally ineffective china s emphasis on internal economic development so called horizontal economic development instead of vertical development will help improve domestic production capacity and strengthen infrastructure facilities in order to expand the domestic market and establish an equilibrium between the prosperous eastern coastal region and the vast and relatively less developed hinterland brighter future beckons china after centuries of western supremacy relentless exploitation colonization discrimination and outright enslavement of colored people and destruction of other cultures throughout the world the time has come to veer the future of humankind toward a more peaceful more just and more egalitarian world during the next hundred years under the leadership of the cpc china is set to guide the east into an era of common prosperity good health and hope the new epoch will be one of a multipolar world with win win trade relations it may create new environmental social and technological challenges but it will also trigger a new awakening for social consciousness and solidarity and a key instrument for achieving the major goals of human well being will be the belt and road initiative as it will provide a steady flow of new ideas and creations and promote cultural exchange and mutual learning so the future focus should be on generating renewable energy increasing green areas in urban centers to strike a balance between natural carbon dioxide absorption and oxygen production in order to eventually achieve carbon neutrality and protecting the world s rain forests and water resources there is also a need to keep natural resources and public services healthcare education food supply water and sanitation services electricity and public transport in the public domain promote multi crop agriculture develop artificial intelligence to make production and transport more efficient so as to better serve humanity and adopt public banking as the primary means of socioeconomic development funding all this to build a community with a shared future for mankind the views don t necessarily reflect those of china daily

a public health crisis is not the time for millions of people to be put out of their homes simply because they ve lost their jobs and incomes during a pandemic president joe biden s plan to impose another federal eviction moratorium is surely due in part to intense pressure from left leaning democrats since the supreme court ruled that last fall s centers for disease control and prevention moratorium was unconstitutional those lawmakers warned that a tsunami of evictions impacting mostly low income renters of color would be the inevitable result if biden s administration didn t take action to stop it editorials bug editorials whatever the pressure a moratorium is on solid ground from a public health perspective since the pandemic began policies aimed at limiting evictions cut covid 19 infections by 3 8 and deaths by 11 an analysis by the national bureau of economic research found those are numbers to keep in mind with a pandemic surging anew because of the more contagious delta variant every reasonable step to contain the spread of the variant is called for and biden s plan will impose a ban on evictions until oct 3 in counties that have been hardest hit by delta here in illinois the impact of the biden administration s new moratorium is not yet clear the statewide eviction moratorium is set to expire on aug 31 but that will only mean landlords can once again file court cases to begin the eviction process which typically takes five or six months get relief to renters landlord the next step as biden pointed out monday is for state and local governments to get rental relief into the pockets of struggling tenants and landlords in june 1 5 billion in emergency rental assistance grants were awarded to 290 000 households the treasury department reported more than in all the previous months since the federal government began the program it s a start but there s far more still to be done the money is there biden said but it has to get out the door to do any good congress allocated 46 billion in federal relief money if that money isn t doled out quickly enough a pending eviction crisis threatens to spiral into a foreclosure crisis as well we re thinking in this case of foreclosures on small scale landlords who rely on rental income to pay mortgages property taxes and maintenance that keeps their buildings in good condition for renters in chicago 70 of rental stock is owned by smaller landlords who own fewer than 20 units according to the neighborhood building owners association these are not big corporations an nboa spokesman told us these are people with day jobs renting out two flats three flats courtyard buildings nationwide according to the national association of realtors roughly half of all housing providers are mom and pop operations that could be jeopardized by the disappearance of tenant payments no one tenant or landlord wins if a small neighborhood landlord is put out of business because emergency rent relief got held up in too much red tape and bureaucracy some states have yet to begin taking applications for the relief grants illinois to its credit is not among them so far the state has paid out more than 185 million to over 22 000 renters and landlords the state reports in june illinois was the second highest provider of rental assistance nationwide according to treasury department data opinion newsletter in chicago the city s department of housing has allocated 10 million in federal funds to 1 200 applicants even so illinois still has over 73 000 applications yet to be processed chicago has a backlog of over 25 000 unless rent relief gets to every tenant and landlord who needs it an eviction moratorium is just a temporary fix send letters to letters suntimes com

exchange commission at www sec gov edgar shtml and with canadian securities authorities at www sedar com ur energy chairman and ceo jeff klenda said we are pleased to announce our results from the first half of 2021 we ended the period with more than 20 million in cash and 285 000 pounds u s produced u 3 o 8 in inventory at the conversion facility we continued to advance regulatory approvals at both our lost creek property and shirley basin project having received all remaining major approvals for shirley basin during q2 our second uranium project in wyoming now stands construction ready the approvals also mean that we have effectively doubled the company s licensed and permitted production capacity as we recognize the eighth anniversary of operations at lost creek we are encouraged by positive catalysts and increased investor interest in the uranium market which in time should allow us to ramp up to full production again while our first priority in ramp up will be to recover the remaining uranium resources in the existing two mine units at lost creek the recent and anticipated regulatory approvals for recovery at the adjacent lc east project will allow us to subsequently expand our planned production into several additional mine units we remain grateful for our dedicated operations and technical staff as they continue to optimize all operational aspects of lost creek lost creek is an exceptional property and we are fortunate to have an experienced and professional team ready to ensure the most efficient return to full production operations when conditions warrant financial results as of june 30 2021 we had cash resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents of 21 5 million in addition to our cash position our finished ready to sell conversion facility inventory value is immediately realizable if necessary we do not anticipate selling our existing finished product inventory in 2021 unless market conditions change sufficiently to warrant its sale during the quarter we received notifications that the principal amount of 893 thousand and accrued interest of approximately 10 thousand were forgiven under the terms of the small business administration paycheck protection program this was treated as a forgiveness of debt on the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended june 30 2021 and a 903 thousand gain on debt forgiveness was recognized in other income lost creek operations lost creek continues to operate at reduced production levels while we await the implementation of the national uranium reserve further relief pursuant to the recommendations of the united states nuclear fuel working group the working group and additional positive developments in the uranium markets the reduced production operations have allowed us to sustain operating cost reductions at lost creek while continuing to conduct preventative maintenance and optimize processes in preparation for ramp up to full production rates these preparations include advanced planning for anticipated drilling and production well installation in our fully permitted mine unit 2 mu2 the wyoming uranium recovery program has approved an amendment to the lost creek source material license to include recovery from the uranium resource in the lc east project hj and km horizons immediately adjacent to the lost creek project this license approval grants the company access to six planned mine units in addition to the already licensed three mine units at lost creek the approval also increases the license limit for annual plant production to 2 2 million pounds u 3 o 8 which includes wellfield production of up to 1 2 million pounds u 3 o 8 and toll processing up to one million pounds u 3 o 8 the wyoming department of environmental quality land quality division continues its review of the application for amendment to the lost creek permit to mine which will add the lc east and km mine units we anticipate that the land quality division review will be complete in 2021 shirley basin project during q2 the state of wyoming and the epa completed their respective reviews of our shirley basin project and issued the source material license permit to mine and aquifer exemption for the project these three approvals represent the final major permits required to begin construction of the shirley basin project the company plans three relatively shallow mining units at the project where we have the option to build out a complete processing plant with drying facilities or a satellite plant with the ability to send loaded ion exchange resin to lost creek for processing as approved the shirley basin processing facility is allowed to recover up to one million pounds u 3 o 8 annually from the wellfield the annual production of u 3 o 8 from wellfield production and toll processing of loaded resin or yellowcake slurry will not exceed two million pounds equivalent of dried u 3 o 8 product situated in an historic mining district the project has existing access roads power waste disposal facility and shop buildings onsite because delineation and exploration drilling were completed historically the project is construction ready all wellfield pipeline and header house layouts are finalized and additional minor on the ground preparations have been initiated in 2021 q3 2021 continuing guidance international recognition of nuclear power s role in achieving net zero carbon emissions goals has resulted in a renewed interest in the uranium sector in 2021 the paris climate agreement calls for net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and the u s has rejoined the agreement under the biden administration which continues to demonstrate support for the nuclear industry our current cash position as of july 28 2021 is 20 8 million in addition to our strong cash position we have nearly 285 000 pounds of finished u s produced inventory worth 9 2 million at recent spot prices our financial position provides us with adequate funds to maintain and enhance operational readiness at lost creek as well as preserve our existing inventory for higher prices our long tenured operational and professional staff have significant levels of experience and adaptability which will allow for an easier transition back to full operations lost creek operations can increase to full production rates in as little as six months following a go decision simply by developing additional header houses within the fully permitted mu2 development expenses during this six month ramp up period are estimated to be approximately 14 million and are almost entirely related to mu2 drilling and header house construction costs we are prepared to ramp up and to deliver our lost creek production inventory to the new national uranium reserve additionally with all major permits and authorizations for our shirley basin project now in hand we stand ready to construct at the mine site when market conditions warrant we

with that let me turn it over to our chief executive officer jimmy brock jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer thank you nate and good morning everyone we capped off the first half of 2021 by delivering another strong quarterly performance in q2 on the operations front despite two longwall moves in the quarter we delivered a solid cash cost performance additionally we once again demonstrated our ability to achieve strong cash flow performance by generating north of 50 million in free cash flow in q2 of 21 and increasing the unrestricted cash on our balance sheet by more than 50 million as well we reduced the leverage on our balance sheet and reaffirmed our ability to raise a significant amount of long term capital through the recently completed tax exempt financing on the pamc expansion project on the marketing front we continue to execute our strategic shift into the export markets and we also strategically layered in some financial hedges in the api2 market to secure revenue visibility and capture some of the recent export market strengths for 2022 on the safety front our bailey preparation plant consol marine terminal and itmann project each had zero recordable incidents during the second quarter of 2021 however our total recordable incident rate or trir at the pamc finished q2 21 higher than what is typical for us although the severity level on each of these incidents was very low we strived to perform each day at zero incidents and our year to date trir at the pamc remains significantly below the national average for underground bituminous coal mines now let me start with our most exciting news this quarter and provide an update on our itmann metallurgical coal project we have been very clear that one of our major strategic goals is to diversify our revenue streams and reduce the percentage of revenues associated with power generation markets this project is a very important step in that direction as most of you know in early 2019 we announced the commitments of the development of our itmann mine project which is a low vol metallurgical coal mining operation in wyoming county west virginia however due to the unprecedented demand and earnings decline associated with the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 we made the capital allocation decision to pullback spending on this project in order to focus our discretionary capital toward repurchasing our second lien notes in the open market which were trading well below par value at that time now as our debt has continued to trade up to near par levels and as our free cash flow generation has significantly improved i am very pleased to announce our decision to recommence the itmann project despite the significant pullback in project expenditures the past 12 to 18 months were instrumental in repositioning the project we used this time to complete initial development mine to shore up our confidence in the reserve and we optimized plans for the preparation plant to create an additional upside potential we evaluated several options for the preparation plant first build a brand new facility from scratch second purchase an existing plant at a nearby location and truck the coal for process or third identify an existing preparation plant for sale that could be relocated to our itmann side based on our analysis the third option made the most economic sense and we are moving forward with relocating a higher capacity and state of the art preparation plant to the itmann project side which is expected to start up in 2022 by relocating the plant we eliminate potentially long lead times on equipment and avoid inflationary pressures from steel and other construction materials we expect to produce 900 000 plus tons of high quality low vol coke and coal annually from our itmann number five mine once were at full run rate production we expect this to be a low cost operation with a long reserve life of 20 plus years of production at maintenance capital levels while the overall project capital cost has increased slightly due to the reoptimized plants for the prep plant we believe this can be more than offset by the expanded capacity afforded by the prep plant and improved cost structure due to the inclusion of a highly efficient rail load down the prep plant where we are relocating will have a processing capacity that is nearly double that at the plant originally envisioned for itmann opening up the opportunity for us to process up to 750 000 to one million product tons of third party coal in addition to the coal from our itmann mine we expect this will create additional growth opportunity and higher revenue potential compared to the original project plan with that now let me provide an overview of the coal markets we continue to execute on our multiyear transition of diversifying our sales mix and increasing our exposure to nonpower generation markets following a record export sales volume in q1 of 21 we successfully placed a new record 3 2 million tons in the export market in q2 of 21 representing nearly 55 of our total shipments in the quarter additionally 47 of our tons sold were used in the industrial or metallurgical nonpower generation applications as we continue to diversify our way from traditional power generations as you can see on slide five we have continued to steadily diversify our global customer base and end use markets since our span in 2017 and in the second quarter of 2021 our overall export volume as a percentage of total sales volume went up roughly 22 percentage points versus full year of 2017 this improvement was driven by a sharp increase in the portion of our tons going into the industrial markets which has risen by 33 percentage points versus 2017 we continue to focus on our strategy of further reducing our exposure to a declining u s coal market for power generation with a heightened focus on increasing our industrial business we believe that with our quality of coal and cost structure at the pamc coupled with an ownership of consol marine terminal we are very well positioned to take advantage of developing and sustaining opportunities in the export market demand for our product continued to strengthen in the second quarter of 2021 on the back of economic recovery and improved electric power and export demand henry hub natural gas spot prices averaged 2 95 per million btu during the quarter a 73 increase compared to q2 of 20 additionally average pjm west day ahead power prices continued to improve and in q2 of 21 61 above the year ago quarter spot pricing trends were especially encouraging given that we were in the shoulder season pricing has continued to improve since the end of the second quarter henry hub natural gas prices are now in the 4 per million btu range for august deliveries with calendar year 2022 now well above 3 per million btu prior to 2021 you d have to go back to 2018 to find a month in which henry hub averaged 4 or more and prior to that all the way back to 2014 we remain optimistic that overall market conditions will continue to improve due to accelerating global economic recovery and a relatively muted supply response on the export front we have seen sustained improvements in the seaborne thermal coal market since the end of the third quarter of 2020 pet coke prices continued to remain supportive as a result of reduced oil production propping up demand and pricing for northern app coal in high cv markets api2 spot prices also continued to rise in the second quarter of 2021 largely driven by hot and dry weather strong lng pricing and a limited supply response and ended the quarter improved by 82 compared to q2 of 20 as such we layered in commodity derivative contracts in the api2 market for calendar year 2022 which mitesh will provide more color on shortly additionally we completed four term deals in the export market during the quarter with durations from one to two years in length and we recently contracted a cargo of pamc coal to china for the first time since 2018 from a marketing perspective it is encouraging to see that demand for our coal has continued to improve since the low point in q2 of 20 we continue to maintain the vast majority of our core customer base and continue to see improvement in our customers contracting appetites our sales teams remains opportunistic in its marketing strategy and increased our contracted position by 9 4 million tons since our last earnings release bringing our contracted position to 24 6 million tons in 2021 and 10 9 million tons in 2022 now let me review our q2 21 operational performance in detail coal production at the pennsylvania mining complex came in at 5 9 million tons in q2 21 compared to 2 4 million tons in q2 of 20 the vast improvement despite the aforementioned multiple longwall moves in q2 of 21 was due to a continued increase in demand for our products since the covid related trough and demand that bottomed out during the year ago quarter as a result productivity at the pamc measured as tons per employee hour improved by an impressive 46 7 in q2 of 21 compared to q2 of 20 on the cost front our average cash cost of coal sale per ton was 28 02 in q2 of 21 compared to 25 90 in q2 of 20 although this seems impaired keep in mind that the 25 90 per ton did not reflect the 32 million in mine idling cash cost incurred during the year ago quarter when adjusted for that q2 21 cash costs significantly outperformed the prior year period even without accounting for that idle cost our year to date average cash cost of coal sold per ton was improved by nearly 15 versus the first half of 2020 our operations team continues to focus on maintaining tight control over cash expenditures as we move forward the consol marine terminal achieved a throughput volume of 3 8 million tons during q2 of 21 compared to 1 6 million tons in the year ago period the significant increase was again due to improved demand in the seaborne markets compared to the trough of the covid 19 related decline in coal demand in q2 of 20 the terminal throughput volumes reflects a pace of over 15 million tons per annum and marks the second consecutive quarter with an annualized run rate north of 15 million tons terminal revenues for the quarter came in at 17 4 million compared to 15 9 million in the year ago quarter despite the major increase in throughput tonnage the impact on revenue was somewhat lessened due to the take or pay contract that was in place in the prior year period cash operating costs came in at 5 3 million versus 3 8 million in the year ago quarter with that i will now turn the call over to mitesh to provide the financial update mitesh thakkar chief financial officer thank you jimmy and good morning everyone i will start with an update on the progress we have made on our key financial priorities i will then review our second quarter 2021 results and our full year 2021 guidance as we have discussed in the past our financial priorities remain maximizing free cash flow generation maintaining strong liquidity and reducing outstanding debt while these remain on north star we are now also selectively allocating capital toward strategic initiatives such as our itmann project after accomplishing a significant milestone of achieving a net leverage ratio below 2 times at the end of 1q 21 we further reduced our leverage to 1 7 times at the end of 2q 21 this was despite our recently completed tax exempt bond offering which we previously highlighted would increase our leverage in the near term due to the treatment of restricted cash under our credit agreement however if we include the restricted cash our leverage ratio as of june 30 would have dropped to 1 54 times while we have more work to do on our balance sheet front we have several initiatives underway or recently completed that we believe will create long term value for our shareholders first we continue to make strides on our overall debt reduction goal as we made total debt payments and repurchases of 18 million in 2q 21 this included open market repurchases of outstanding second lien notes where we spent 4 8 million to retire 5 million at a slight discount to par we view these buybacks as a good use of capital even as the market price of our second lien notes have rallied back to trade at near par levels second we made the discretionary decision to execute an 18 4 million early buyout option on an existing operating lease for a set of longwall shares this decision not only saves us nearly 900 000 per month in operating lease expense for the next 12 months but also eliminates the buyout requirement in 2q 22 at fair market value given where steel prices are currently this fair market value would most likely have been elevated and could have been close to or more than the 18 million fixed early buyout amount we executed the early buyout also reduces the operating lease liability on our books which rating agencies include in their leverage calculations third as highlighted last quarter we continue to find ways to tap alternative sources of capital by successfully securing 75 million of tax exempt solid waste disposal revenue bonds at the beginning of the second quarter we received reimbursements from qualified expenses in the amount of 21 5 million in 2q 21 which dates back to the initial inducement date in mid 2020 additionally we have 53 5 million in restricted cash associated with this financing that will be used to fund future spending on the refuse disposal areas at the pamc and will reduce our leverage ratio over time from a strategic standpoint this transaction gives us additional financial flexibility and helps to de risk a portion of our future refinancing efforts by pushing 75 million of maturity in 2028 the transaction is also a testament to our ability to access long term capital it gets even more exciting when you consider that the commodity environment and our balance sheet has only strengthened since the closing of this transaction we also expect this as a future financing avenue that could be available to us fourth to capitalize on the strength in the export market we initiated a targeted revenue hedging strategy during the second quarter of 2021 so far we have layered in two million metric tons of commodity derivative contracts in the api2 market for calendar year 2022 at a weighted average price of 79 34 per ton these financial hedges ensure strong netback core prices for us for the approximately two million tons of physical contracts we signed during 2q 21 for 2022 which are also tied to api2 prices the good news for us is that api2 prices and other export market pricing indicators continue to strengthen and we still have an additional 13 plus million tons of coal sales uncontracted for 2022 we anticipate a significant portion of these sales will go into the export markets fifth on the legacy liabilities front under our current actuarial assumptions we have a fully funded status on our defined benefit pension plan at this point we do not have any funding requirements for the foreseeable future and have significantly lowered our exposure to equity market volatility as we move forward we ll continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet while implementing our targeted growth and diversification strategy this includes our commitment to completing the itmann project we expect this project to require an additional 65 million to 70 million of capex to complete given the increased processing capacity and new train load out at the preparation facility this is an addition to the 24 million already spent on the project to date since its inception in early 2019 recommencing this project is not an either our decision relative to our debt reduction priority we still expect to continue to reduce our outstanding debt on our balance sheet and unrestricted cash this project like all financial decisions went to our rigorous capital allocation process excluding any third party revenue we expect it to generate a rate of return north of 25 over the life of the project assuming an australian premium low vol coking coal price of 160 to 170 a ton which is consistent with the actual trailing 10 year average price and the current forward strip for 2023 to 2025 we believe the returns on the itmann project will exceed our weighted average cost of capital even at long term average australian premium low oil prices of 130 a ton we are very excited about this project and its earnings and free cash flow potential with that let me now recap the second quarter results before moving on to our 2021 guidance ceix reported a very strong financial performance for 2q 21 with net income of 4 2 million or 0 12 per diluted share which included 20 4 million of unrealized mark to market losses related to commodity derivatives and adjusted ebitda of 84 4 million this compares to a loss of 18 million or 0 69 per diluted share and adjusted ebitda of 34 2 million in the year ago quarter in 2q 21 we generated 94 6 million of cash flow from operations which included 25 6 million of positive working capital changes driven by a significant reduction in our accounts and notes receivable balance additionally we spent 43 7 million in capital expenditures which included the previously discussed 18 4 million for the discretionary operating lease buyout and we received 3 4 million in proceeds from asset sales this resulted in free cash flow generation of 54 4 million in 2q 21 this highlights the ability of our business to generate free cash flow in challenging markets and capture a meaningful upside in stronger markets as a result of our free cash flow generation we have increased our unrestricted cash position by nearly 56 million in the quarter and now have an unrestricted cash position of 146 million which is the highest level since 2q 19 including the restricted cash position of 53 5 million our cash and cash equivalents balance is over 200 million now let me provide you with our updated outlook for 2021 due to our strong first half 21 operational performance and outlook for the remainder of the year we are increasing our expected sales volume for 2021 to 23 5 million to 25 million tons up from our previous guidance of 22 million to 24 million tons additionally due to the efforts of our operations team to drive costs down despite inflationary pressures so far this year we are adjusting our expected average cash cost of coal sold per ton to a range of 27 to 28 per ton down from our previous guidance of 27 to 29 per ton on the pricing front we currently have a 2021 contracted position of 24 6 million tons at an expected average price of 44 02 per ton the improvement compared to our prior guidance reflects the strength in the current pricing environment on the additional contracted volumes we have layered in as well as an improvement in the assumed pjm west power forwards finally we are increasing our capital guidance due to the decision to recommence the itmann project and the completed lease buyout to a range of 160 million to 180 million as always we will continue to reassess our guidance ranges each quarter and adjust them as necessary with that let me turn it back to jimmy to make some final comments jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer thank you mitesh before we move on to the question and answer session let me take this opportunity to provide a recap of our accomplishments in the second quarter and reiterate our priorities as we move forward first we continue to prioritize strengthening and enhancing our balance sheet by improving our liquidity and financial flexibility despite shrinking access to capital for coal companies we have had good success in identifying and tapping alternative sources of capital second despite significant inflationary pressures we continue to keep costs at our operations under control through efficiencies reduced discretionary spending and creativity in our supply chain management program the team continues to look for ways to effectively drive costs down without sacrificing the effectiveness of our operations by rightsizing our operations we ve taken some slack out of the system allowing our four operating longwalls at the pamc the ability to essentially run full out this drives efficiency and results in a sustained reduction in our average cash cost of coal sold per ton compared to our historical averages third our consol marine terminal is one of the most strategically valuable assets in our portfolio the terminal will be essential for executing our longer term strategic shift into the export market which we expect will derisk our domestic exposure and allow us to capitalize on growing international demand for our high cv product year to date we shipped more than 50 of our total sales volume into the export market which highlights the value of owning our own terminal and is a huge differentiator for us compared to our peers finally we re extremely excited to be in a position to restart the itmann project we view this project as the next phase of our strategy which focuses on targeted growth and diversification as an additional avenue to increase value for our shareholders this project is strategically important as it will diversify our portfolio by adding a new metallurgical coal product stream to the mix and it aligns well with our current operations by being low cost high margin and high quality before handing the call over i want to reiterate that we are extremely proud of our accomplishments to date and believe we have a lot of opportunity in front of us to build upon our strategic priorities our capital allocation process world class asset and employees have helped us to come out of 2020 prime to excel in 2021 and beyond there s always more work to do but we continue to focus on our goal of strengthening our balance sheet and creating long term value for our shareholders with that i will hand the call back over to nate for further instructions nathan tucker director finance and investor relations thank you jimmy we will now move to the questions and answers session of our call at this time i d like to ask our operator to please provide the instruction to our callers questions and answers operator and the first question comes from nathan martin with the benchmark company please go ahead nathan martin the benchmark company analyst good morning guys congratulations on the first half performance jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer thank you nate nathan martin the benchmark company analyst maybe i ll start on the cost side first you guys obviously lowered your guidance by i guess 0 50 a ton at the midpoint but even if i run costs in the second half flat with your second quarter results of 28 which at the high end of your revised full year guidance you end up right at the low end of that new guidance range is there something that pushes costs higher here in the second half or maybe is there a chance you could possibly outperform there jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer nate if you remember on our last earnings call i said that we expect to come in at the lower half of our cost guidance and as we look forward there s still some uncertainties in the market out there i mean we have a contracted position for 2021 that s up significantly than on our last earnings call but still we have two longwall moves in the second half of the year one in each quarter whereas in that first quarter we didn t have any and inflationary pressures from some of the commodities that we produced with we see those could come to us so as mitesh mentioned in his comments we ll reevaluate and look at it but our goal is to keep a tight lease on cost where we can and then let the operations team do what they do best and they figure out ways to lower cost as we continue to produce but the reason that we lowered it 1 is because of our performance to date and then as we look forward with one longwall move in each quarter we think we ll have an opportunity to still come in toward the lower end of that guidance and that s what our goal will be mitesh thakkar chief financial officer and nate i think inflation is a big part of a little bit of cautiousness here as you know all raw material prices have been higher since the beginning of the year so i think that is something that we continuously monitor i think our supply chain team has done a good job of managing that so far but there s always some buffer related to inflation as we go through the year as things continue to be very strong in the commodity landscape nathan martin the benchmark company analyst got it i appreciate those thoughts guys and then maybe shifting over to the pricing side looks like you re essentially fully contracted for this year meaning additional 400 000 tons or so at the high end of revised guidance should we assume those tons would likely go to the export market and then if we look forward to 2022 i think you layered on an additional five million tons or so there can you talk about the mix of those tons and give us an idea of what prices they were layered in thanks robert braithwaite vice president marketing and sales yes sure nate this is bob just to kind of highlight 2021 as we mentioned earlier we have now 24 6 million tons sold the additional volume we had to get to the upper end of the guidance i would suggest that that s likely going to go into the export market there s still about a 5 to 10 arbitrage versus what the domestic prices are today even at 4 gas i would suggest that the prices you re seeing in the publications cold desk reference and they call it the mid 50 range we re still seeing an arbitrage in the export market so it s likely that those volumes will go there as far as 2022 is concerned we did contract an additional 5 3 million tons since our last earnings call about 80 of those volumes were contracted into the international market so sitting here today of the 10 9 million tons a little over four million tons of those are contracted to go exports and based on where we sit today i would suggest that our export volumes will be pretty much similar to if not a little bit higher in 2022 than what we expect to export in 2021 and again that goes based on jimmy s comments of our strategic shift and then also again based on the price arbitrage that exists today nathan martin the benchmark company analyst i appreciate that color bob and just any early thoughts on potential production levels in 2022 given the positive quarter view of the market jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer yeah i think as we ve always said we ll run to the market thus far we ve been able to run our four longwalls full out we would want to continue that into 2022 and then depending upon what future forecasts we see there we could run some additional shifts or something but i would expect our tonnage for 2022 to be very similar to what we have in 2021 with possibly some upside nathan martin the benchmark company analyst got it thanks for that jimmy and then just a real quick one to shift to itmann i appreciate all the color you guys are given on the projects and the updates there i guess how do we think about production ramp i m assuming we ll have to wait for the prep plant completion before we see any meaningful production which i think you guys would say may be mid to second half 22 can you kind of talk about that and then maybe your decision to relocate the existing prep plant with additional capacity maybe just any thoughts on the appetite you see to fill that excess capacity thanks daniel connell senior vice president strategy sure nate this is dan regarding the first part of your question on the production ramp we have been fortunate in being able to continue our development mining here at a reduced rate for the past number of months and we ll continue that as we build out the plant so that puts us in really good position when the plant becomes available targeting kind of the q3 2022 timeframe to very rapidly ramp up and bring both of the additional sections on that we will need to scale up to full production so i think our plan would be that during the second half of next year we can move from kind of the controlled development mining that we ve been doing to something very close to if not achieving full production during 2022 the decision to relocate the plant is one that as jimmy mentioned we ran a lot of analysis on we had time to give that a thorough look given kind of the pause in the project during last couple of months so we feel like we ve vetted that plan very well there are a number of reserves kind of in the vicinity of where this prep plant is being built that are have yet to be developed and we actually have some development mining going on nearby it and then in some of the upper seams as we speak that we ll likely be looking for a home so we feel optimistic about the opportunity to pull third party tons into the plant based on economics should help to improve the product wins that we can produce coming out of itmann and to be clear the economic numbers that we ve been reporting do not assume any upside from those third party tons so we have we based our decisions on just kind of an itmann base case and we view the third party tons as upside to that plan jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer yeah and nate just to add to that one of the things when we were looking at the preparation plant which is a big decision as far as us ramping up to full production the 900 000 tons plus that we had mentioned we would not want to do that until we re processing our own coal and we can get that through so when we looked at the preparation plant one of the key factors there on our initial plan we were going to build a much smaller plant that would be somewhere around 350 tons an hour and then we were going to if we got all the third party business everything we would add that second piece on well we re buying this plant and relocating it we have that from day one and then some of the increase in capital was because of the trained load out that we re going to have that s going to give us the ability to not only move our coal very efficiently on the rail line but also any third party coal that we have coming into there so i remain very very excited about the itmann project i m happy that we put ourselves in a position to whereas we can recommence it and i think it s going to be a nice return and be a nice project for our shareholders nathan martin the benchmark company analyst got it i appreciate that those additional thoughts that makes sense and then just finally i think mitesh obviously you went through some quick irr numbers for itmann and i might have missed some of those but have you guys done kind of any payback period calculations for the project and what that might look like at various net price decks thanks mitesh thakkar chief financial officer sure i think it depends on what met price do you use i mean some of these cases the payback period could be as little as two to three years i ll let dan address some more specific payback periods if you will daniel connell senior vice president strategy sure no i mean i think as we mentioned nate during the remarks we ve kind of run the project economics using a price strip that s consistent with both the 10 year average historic met prices and the current forward strip and that puts you kind of in the payback range that mitesh mentioned i think in terms of roi numbers we said north of 25 obviously if you run the numbers at the current market and assume that it holds out here for a couple of years payback period becomes quite short and these are paybacks the roi numbers just to clarify are based on total project capital costs since inception if you look at the numbers on a go forward basis may become more attractive than what was before mitesh thakkar chief financial officer i think that s an important point that i want to highlight that all these economics that we ran are on total project cost basis it s not just a go forward capex that we used for analysis even though today if you are making that decision you should look at go forward because that s more applicable we wanted to make sure that the project economics hold nathan martin the benchmark company analyst got it i appreciate all that information guys thanks again for the time today and best of luck in the second half jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer yeah thanks nathan operator the next question comes from lucas pipes with b riley securities please go ahead lucas pipes b riley securities analyst thanks very much and good morning everyone jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer good morning lucas pipes b riley securities analyst i may have missed it earlier but jimmy you mentioned the spread between the international and the domestic market and i wondered can you elaborate on what that spread is today i e what is seeing for export tons what is pricing for domestic tons and then do you have a view on what might trigger these prices to which obviously would be great to see the domestic pricing move up so i appreciate your thoughts on there thank you robert braithwaite vice president marketing and sales yeah lucas this is bob right now i d say the arbitrage versus kind of the published marks the published marks are call it mid 50 levels for prompt right around 50 levels for coal strip 22 the volumes we ve locked in to date on the international side the arbitrage is roughly around 5 or 10 and that does not include any again terminal revenues that we receive as well so that s kind of the level we re at today going forward i still view that this market has legs for at least another 12 to 18 months i mean the supply response just is not there not only in coal but gas space as well and inventories are significantly below their averages in fact i read an article just last week that gas reserves in europe are the lowest they ve been in over a decade and then when you look at pet coke prices continue to trend upward and now 90 up year on year so again i think this market has legs on a continued the back of a continued post pandemic recovery and just a relatively muted supply response jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer yeah and i would add lucas going forward when we re looking at gas prices where they are today and i can t reiterate enough the supply response just hasn t been there so i think i agree with bob i think the market does have legs into the coming years particularly on the international market and that will help drive some of the domestic pricing as well so we feel like it does have legs with demand increasing for electricity gas prices where they are and a muted supply response lucas pipes b riley securities analyst thank you very much bob and jimmy for that perspective in terms of your capital allocation you re clearly shifting well you re shifting toward growth with itmann good to see that and i wondered from here on out what are your priorities is it more so on the capital is it more on the debt side buying back maybe more we saw at your transaction on the capital lease side what are some of the opportunities and mitesh maybe if you could speak to any limits or restrictions you may have would very much appreciate your perspective thank you mitesh thakkar chief financial officer so let me start by saying that we are in a very strong position today and are constantly reviewing our capital allocation priorities to ensure that they are consistent with changing market conditions and provide us the best risk adjusted return in line with our strategic priorities and the attractive rates of returns that we just talked about for itmann project we relaunched it makes a lot of sense for incremental dollars that we are spending also as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we still have some wood to chop as far as deleveraging is concerned now debt repurchases are not as attractive as they used to be before but given that we want to de lever and the fact that we still have an 11 paper out there that allows us to be opportunistic in that area i think you ll continue to see us pay down our debt or repurchase in the open market because as i said earlier it s not an either or decision for us as far as deleveraging is concerned and itmann is concerned the steps that we are taking with deleveraging and growing our met coal business are all geared toward one goal and that is really to create significant value for our shareholders whether it comes from growth or from having larger equity value in the enterprise the good news is that the market is offering us the opportunity today to launch and execute on multiple of these initiatives and returning capital to our shareholders is one of them right we are constantly reviewing it and hope to provide you an update in coming quarters as we execute on our near term goals as well with respect to the operating leases i don t see any big opportunities right now on that front we saw one in the second quarter and executed on it which i feel was one of the best projects so to speak when you think about from a rate of return perspective we ran the dcf some it was a very easy decision to make so i think those are the opportunities we ll continue to look at and continue to deliver on some of our strategic priorities jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer yeah and the good news is for us it s not an either or as mitesh mentioned earlier in his comments with us generating free cash flow at the rate we are per quarter we have an opportunity to do all of these things but i want to reiterate really excited about the itmann project it gives us that diversity in our product stream of having the low vol metallurgical coal in the mix and i think we re going to continue to do the things that we ve done in the past which enhanced the balance sheet provides great liquidity and add a new product mix to our stream lucas pipes b riley securities analyst thank you very much and when i saw those capital lease numbers i thought i should get into the business of lending to you guys really appreciate all the color continued best of luck jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer thanks lucas operator the next question comes from michael dudas with vertical research partners please go ahead michael dudas vertical research partners analyst good morning everyone jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer good morning michael dudas vertical research partners analyst first question maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on your domestic customer base again certainly inventories down demand up how urgent do you feel they are right now especially as where we ve had better economic activity going forward and where gas prices are and any update on your customer base relative to potential coal power plant closures and your exposure there and how that may impact maybe some of your competitive suppliers as those things work through the system robert braithwaite vice president marketing and sales mike right now we are in discussions with several domestic customers not only for the balance of 21 but 2022 as well without a doubt utilities are realizing that spot coal is not readily available as it once was so with that being said i do believe that there will be opportunities to lock in some longer term volumes to ensure they have supply going forward so with that being said stay tuned there but as you mentioned inventories are i would say near critical levels for many of the domestic utilities that we do serve when i say critical levels i m saying sub 10 days of inventory on the ground and with gas price at 4 i don t see that that this will change in the very near future so again it should bode very well for us in our contracting abilities for 2022 as far as closures are concerned as of right now within the next 10 years we have very minimal of our customer base look that has announced that they will retire i would say it s in a neighborhood of 0 5 million to one million total tons that we view at risk obviously as jimmy talked about before is reggie we do have to be concerned about reggie which we re keeping a close eye on that could have some additional impact on us in pennsylvania but again we are continuing to look and focus on shifting some of those volumes already in the export market so that s kind of where we stand today michael dudas vertical research partners analyst i appreciate that secondly moving internationally say to your important market in india and you mentioned about pet coke and could you maybe just a thought on just the dynamics going on in the asian coal market especially with some of the shifts in coal in and out of china and then the lack of supply response again not to predict the future markets but you got pretty strong curves out there relative to say and jimmy mentioned your 2014 and 2018 coal price spikes in internationally how different is it dynamic and what you re seeing here especially as you guys have evolved into a much more important and solid provider coal into those export markets robert braithwaite vice president marketing and sales yeah one thing that benefits us as we mentioned in our remarks our coal being a high btu high calorific value coal does transport very nicely into these markets especially into the asian markets where there is additional transportation as far as this time around versus what happened in call it 2014 as we mentioned the supply response isn t there i mean if you look at the production not only in the u s but look at the production in colombia i mean it s significantly down and they re just not those production basins just aren t coming back is strong plus not only that there s additional build outs internationally i mean india obviously is a targeted market for us they re going they have been going through and continue to go through industrial revolution and then again with the whole australia and china tensions continuing it is opening up doors for us to get bailey coal into china as well as jimmy mentioned we did contract our first cargo there this year which is our first since 2018 so again i think a lot of this is based on just again a post pandemic recovery and muted supply response that we just do not feel is coming back michael dudas vertical research partners analyst understood and finally i guess mitesh on your derivative book that you re creating here is that something that is i assume its opportunistic but as we see that as you managed the pricing markets there s a little bit more exposure to that as you move forward is that something that s going to be part of how you on the marketing and hedging side going forward especially with your more exposure in those export markets mitesh thakkar chief financial officer yeah so mike you re absolutely right i think what we did in the second quarter was more opportunistic but it also demonstrates a tool that we have in future i think one of the things that we have noticed is there was interest in doing api tooling contracts by some of our supplier by some of our customers so we wanted to manage that risk and in hindsight you look at it it almost looks like we could have waited three more months and we would have been a lot better off but i think the goal there was to mitigate the risk and i think we used it appropriately at that time but it also gave us another tool to do some of the things where if we want to if we are seeing that we are not making progress on improving our contracted position but the api2 market is there we can lock in tons there and have some of that book right now that s not the case but that doesn t mean it s not going to be in the future i think our marketing team is very successful in layering in some contracts here in the export markets even on a term basis and not just spot basis which is really good we like that approach much better than using the derivatives but it s a tool that we have we can use michael dudas vertical research partners analyst that sounds great i appreciate your thoughts gentlemen jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer thanks mike operator this concludes our question and answer session i will now turn the conference back over to nathan tucker for any closing remarks nathan tucker director finance and investor relations thank you tom we

democrats in the general assembly have united behind a plan to extend a key eviction protection program that has won praise from both landlords and tenant advocates the push comes after a federal eviction moratorium from the centers for disease control and prevention expired at the end of july housing advocates have expressed concern about a wave of evictions coinciding with the end of the program there are some signs evictions may be picking up again eviction filings in virginia rose in april and may according to a report from the rva eviction lab at virginia commonwealth university published last week the numbers dipped in june but researchers attributed the drop to a customary lag in data reporting housing advocates say the problem would be far more dire without the virginia rent relief program if someone is late on rent landlords can apply to get money from the state through the program or tenants can apply themselves applicants must have lost income due to the pandemic to be eligible the program is a win win according to patrick mccloud executive director of the virginia apartment management association evictions are expensive mccloud said no one wants to evict it is an absolute last resort right now it s optional for landlords to apply on behalf of tenants democratic lawmakers like cia price want to make it mandatory as it was from late november through june that setup won praise from the new york times editorial board as a model for other states where the funds have languished it is unconscionable that there would be evictions when the money is there price said mccloud said he had reservations about the state mandate which he said inserted a third party into contracts between landlords and tenants and he said some tenants ignored notifications about the program forfeiting their chance to get help but mccloud said the program could help drive investment in virginia s affordable housing stock given the stability of state backed rent payments so far the fund has helped over 48 000 households with over 300 million in rent money nearly 700 million remains left to disperse the budget proposed by gov ralph northam that is currently under consideration by the general assembly would allow the program to be extended through june 2022 or until the funds are exhausted kathryn howell co director of the rva eviction lab said increasing the program s visibility to tenants was key to its future success and she said the state was making a solid investment given studies showing the broader costs of evictions we can t just sort of pretend like this doesn t have a long term cost not just to the family but also to our local governments our local hospitals and other infrastructure howell said

second quarter we achieved consolidated earnings of 0 72 per share versus 0 69 last year after excluding from both periods gains on investments held to fund one of the company s retirement plans earnings per share increased by 7 8 on an adjusted basis the second quarter contributed to a strong 2021 year to date where we ve achieved 12 1 earnings growth over last year on an adjusted earnings per share basis in addition we announced a 9 increase in the quarterly dividend last week marking our 67th consecutive calendar year of dividend increases while we await some key decisions from the

our customers the communities we serve our employees our suppliers and ultimately our shareholders i will now turn the call over to eva to review the financial results for the quarter eva g tang senior vice president finance chief financial officer corporate secretary and treasurer thank you bob hello everyone let me start with our second quarter financial results on slide eight excluding gains earned on investments of 0 03 per share and 0 05 per share from the second quarter of 2021 and 2020 respectively adjusted earnings for the second quarter increased by 0 05 per share or 7 8 as compared to adjusted earnings last year this slide presents our reported results before adjustments our water segment s earnings were 0 57 per share as compared to 0 54 per share adjusting for the gains on investments incurred in both quarters earnings at water segment increased by 0 05 per share due to a higher water gross margin generated from new rates authorized by the california public utilities commission and a lower effective income tax rate due to certain flow through and permanent tax items these increases in earnings were partially offset by increase in water treatment costs depreciation expense and interest expense our electric segment s earnings for the quarter were 0 04 per share as compared to 0 03 per share for the same period in 2020 due to an increase in electric gross margins resulting from higher rates as approved by the cpuc earnings from our contracted services segment decreased 0 01 per share for the quarter due to higher construction costs incurred on certain projects our consolidated revenue for the quarter increased by 7 1 million as compared to the same period in 2020 water revenues increased 4 5 million due to full third year step increases for 2021 as a result of passing earnings tax the increase in electric revenues was largely due to cpuc approved rate increases for 2021 and an increase in usage as compared to the second quarter of 2020 contracted services revenue increased 2 2 million largely due to increases in construction activities and increases in management fees due to the successful resolution of various economic price tests turning to slide 10 our water and electric supply costs were 28 million for the quarter an increase of 1 7 million from the same period last year any changes in supply costs for both the water and electric segments as compared to the adopted supply costs are tracking balance income looking at total operating expenses other than supply costs consolidated expenses increased to 3 5 million as compared to the second quarter of 2020 this was primarily due to an increase in construction costs at our contracted services segment resulting from increased construction activity interest expense net of interest income and other increased by 2 million due in part to higher interest expense resulting from overall increase in borrowings and lower gains generated on investments held for retirement plans during the second quarter as compared to last year as previously discussed slide 11 shows the eps bridge comparing the second quarter of this year with last year s second quarter this slide reflects our year to date earnings per share by segment as reported fully diluted earnings for the six months ended june 30 2021 were 1 24 as compared to 1 07 for the same period in 2020 when the 0 04 per share gain on investments held to fund a retirement plan is removed from 2021 year to date earnings this resulted in a 12 1 increase in the adjusted eps for more details please refer to yesterday s press release and form 10 q turning to liquidity net cash provided by operating activities was 41 1 million for the first six months of 2021 as compared to 46 3 million in 2020 this decrease was largely due to timing differences of income and payroll tax payments which were deferred during the second quarter of 2020 as a result of covid 19 relief legislation effect in 2020 but not for this year this was partially offset by an improvement in cash from accounts receivable related to nonresidential customers due in part to improved economic conditions as compared to the first six months of 2020 because of the pandemic our regulated utility invested 75 million in the company funded capital projects during the first six months we estimated our full year 2020 company funded capital expenditures to be 125 million to 135 million at this time we do not expect american states water to issue additional equity for at least the next three years to fund its current businesses with that i ll turn the call back to bob robert j sprowls president and chief executive officer thank you eva i ll now provide updates on the drought in california and on our recent regulatory activity currently the majority of california is considered to be in extreme drought the governor of california has proclaimed the state of emergency for 50 of the 58 counties within the state and signed an executive order asking all californians to voluntarily reduce water usage by 15 as compared to 2020 the cpuc has called on all of california investor owned water utilities to implement voluntary conservation measures to meet this goal in response golden state water has increased its communication with customers regarding the need for conservation and intends to implement voluntary conservation efforts in all of its ratemaking areas and has filed with the cpuc to request authority to establish a water conservation memorandum account to track incremental drought related costs for future recovery regarding our current rate cycle the water segment has an earnings test it must meet before implementing the second and third year step increases in the 3 year rate cycle as we have previously reported we have tightly invested in our capital projects and achieved capital spending consistent with the amount authorized by the cpuc as a result rate increases are expected to generate an additional 11 1 million in the adopted water gross margin for 2021 as compared to the adopted water gross margin in 2020 regarding our cost of capital proceeding which was filed in may of this year we requested a capital structure of 57 equity and 43 debt which is our currently adopted capital structure a return on equity of 10 5 and a return on rate base of 8 18 a final decision is originally scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year with an effective date of january 1 2022 as we discussed in our prior calls golden state water filed a general rate case application for all its water regions and the general office during july 2020 this general rate case will determine new water rates for the years 2022 through 2024 among other things golden state water requested capital budgets of approximately 450 6 million for the 3 year rate cycle and another 11 4 million of capital projects to be filed for revenue recovery through advice letters when those projects are completed we are pleased that the administrative law judge assigned to this rate case has clarified that golden state water can continue to use the water revenue adjustment mechanism or wram and the modified cost balancing account also known as the mcba until our next general rate case application covering the years 2025 through 2027 as part of the response to the covid 19 pandemic golden state water and bear valley electric service have suspended service disconnections for nonpayment pursuant to cpuc orders on july 15 of this year the cpuc issued a final decision on the second phase of the water utility low income affordability rulemaking which among other things extended the existing moratorium on water service disconnections due to nonpayment until further cpuc guidance is issued or february 1 2022 whichever occurs first on june 24 of this year the cpuc issued a final decision to extend the moratorium on electric disconnections until september 30 of this year under the terms of the cpuc adopted payment plans actual electric service disconnections for nonpayment will not incur until approximately december 1 turning our attention to slide 18 this slide presents the growth in golden state water s rate base as authorized by the cpuc for 2018 through 2021 the weighted average water rate base has grown from 752 2 million in 2018 to 980 4 million in 2021 a compound annual growth rate of 9 2 the rate base amounts for 2021 do not include any rate recovery for advice letter projects let s move on to asus on slide 19 asus earnings contribution decreased by 0 01 per share to 0 11 during the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the same quarter last year largely due to higher construction costs incurred on certain projects for the year to date june 30 2021 and asus earnings contribution is 0 04 per share higher than last year due to an overall increase in construction activity and management fee revenue as well as a decrease in overall operating expenses the increase in construction activity for the year to date was largely due to timing differences of when work was performed as compared to the first six months of 2020 we reaffirm our projection that asus will contribute 0 45 to 0 49 per share for 2021 thus far the covid 19 pandemic has not had a material impact on asus operations we continue to work closely with the u s government for contract modifications relating to potential capital upgrade work for improvement of the water and wastewater infrastructure at the military bases we serve in addition completion of filings for economic price adjustments requests for equitable adjustment asset transfers and contract modifications awarded for new projects provide asus with additional revenues and dollar margin the u s government is expected to release additional bases for bidding over the next several years we are actively involved in various stages of the proposal process at a number of bases currently considering privatization we continue to have a good relationship with the u s government as well as a strong history and expertise in managing water and wastewater systems on military bases and we believe we are well positioned to compete for these new contracts i would like to turn our attention to dividends board of directors last week approved a 9 increase in the dividend increasing the annual dividend from 1 34 per share to 1 46 per share this increase is comparable to the compound annual growth rate of 9 achieved by the company in its quarterly dividend over the last five years our long and consistent history of dividend payments date back to 1931 in addition to an unbroken 67 year history of annual calendar year dividend increases currently our dividend policy is to provide a compound annual growth rate of more than 7 over the long term i d like to conclude our prepared remarks by thanking you for your interest in american states water and we ll now turn the call over to the operator for questions questions and answers operator and our first question today comes from agnie storozynski from seaport please go ahead with your question agnie storozynski seaport analyst thank you so i wanted to talk about any feedback you ve received to the cost of capital filings and if you had a chance to review cal waters jersey filing and if there are any takeaways or lessons learned that you might be able to apply to your future grc filing robert j sprowls president and chief executive officer okay so angie a couple of questions there yes so not much is going on on the cost of capital proceeding at this point we haven t had a prehearing conference at this point and so we re waiting for it to actually get started so not much to update you on there with regard to the cost of capital proceeding yes so we are going through california waters filing with the commission and we find it very interesting it appears that they have flattened the tiers a bit in their filing and we ll be very interested to see how that goes through the process we re i think they re a sophisticated company and we expect them to do well and but we ll be watching how this plays out because we ll be having to make a similar filing in june of 2023 or sorry july of 2023 agnie storozynski seaport analyst okay and then separately on asus so i appreciate that you re going to be within the stated earnings guidance for this year but we were i think hoping that there would be some catch up in the level of activity i mean i thought that last year s earnings were heavily impacted by covid this year or largely flattish versus the last year maybe it was my misunderstanding but i thought that there were some projects that were either delayed or not pursued because of covid and then they would happen at a later date but you mentioned that you continue to be engaged in discussions about some additional scope of work so does that mean that basically the government would first need to sign off on some new projects and without that the earnings trajectory is largely flattish for this segment robert j sprowls president and chief executive officer yes so the part of our revenue stream is for new capital work that s being done on the bases and that was part of what was slowed a bit in 2020 we haven t completely come out of that at this point the new capital upgrade work although a bit better this year than last year in terms of the awards we aren t seeing that there is a substantial increase in the awards to this point that would suggest that gee we missed out on some of this in 2020 so we re going to get not only the 2021 new capital upgrade work but some of the 2020 that didn t get awarded we re still hopeful the fiscal year ends on september 30 and sometimes we ll pick up some projects in the last couple of months of the government s fiscal year we ll just have to see but things are better than they were last year somewhat although it s not we re not quite back to the level i would say that we were prior to covid agnie storozynski seaport analyst great thank you robert j sprowls president and chief executive officer thank you agnie operator our next question comes from jonathan reeder from wells fargo please go ahead with your question jonathan reeder wells fargo analyst hi bob and eva wanted to ask quickly on the grc your pending grc how is the timing for final decision looking and how would you characterize the prospects of reaching a settlement whether that s in full or just on part of the items robert j sprowls president and chief executive officer sure jonathan i d be happy to address that question and how are you doing so the judge in the general rate case has moved the hearings from late june july to late september early october and not exactly sure why he did that but what that has done is allowed us more time to work on a settlement with public advocates which we have been working on since may so we are very much engaged in the settlement process i m not sure what else i can tell you other than we re working really hard to get a settlement i m not sure if we can get one but we ve made some real good progress although it s unclear at this point whether we re going to have a settlement eva g tang senior vice president finance chief financial officer corporate secretary and treasurer and jonathan as a result of aljs ruling deferring to adhere advent sorry hearings the puc may not be able to issue a final decision by end of the year because here it will be in october time frame and so probably will push out beyond this year but we have a retroactive rate was to be effective january 1 2022 once the final decision is issued jonathan reeder wells fargo analyst right right yes so i mean bob based on your comments i mean it sounds like the discussion was they are being productive so i mean whether you get to a full settlement maybe that s challenging but i know in the past at times you ve reached at least kind of a partial settlement to kind of streamline at least some of what the hearing asset cover is is that at least kind of a minimum expectation at this point would you say robert j sprowls president and chief executive officer yes perhaps i d just go back to the last two cases that we had filed three years ago we had a full settlement of the grc and then case prior to that we fully litigated the capital budget so those are kind of two ends of the spectrum i guess yes if we re not able to get a full settlement it s possible we could get a partial settlement and just sort of focus on those issues that were quite a distance apart that we take to the evidentiary hearings jonathan reeder wells fargo analyst got you all right well good luck on that certainly robert j sprowls president and chief executive officer yes thank you jonathan reeder wells fargo analyst and certainly good luck on the cost of capital as it finally gets going if i could just shift quickly on asus it sounded based on your prepared remarks and maybe i m putting words in your mouth but were there some inflationary pressures that like impacted the segment by 0 01 in q2 is that accurate do you expect similar headwinds to persist during the rest of 21 and even into 22 potentially compressing with the typical margins achieved on the construction projects are for you robert j sprowls president and chief executive officer yes i mean we did have higher construction expenses perhaps we ll see a little bit of that going forward but we don t think it will be very pervasive in the future quarters jonathan reeder wells fargo analyst okay so i mean when we see those things lumber is up 400 or stuff like that for instruction that you re undertaking based on i guess contracts relationships you have with suppliers kind of stuff like that the pressures are much more manageable in that regard robert j sprowls president and chief executive officer yes i would say that s accurate jonathan we ve got our arms around it we did it did move the needle a little bit in the second quarter but we don t we re not wringing our hands about it going into q3 and q4 jonathan reeder wells fargo analyst great perfect alright that s all for me thanks for taking may question for today robert j sprowls president and chief executive officer thanks jonathan operator and ladies and gentlemen at this time i m showing no additional questions i d like to turn the floor back over to mr sprowls for any closing remarks robert j sprowls president and chief executive officer yes thank you jamie i just want to wrap up today just again by thanking everyone for their participation today

earnings release with that let me hand the call over to kevin kevin m phillips chairman chief executive officer and president thanks steven and good afternoon everyone i d like to start the call today by thanking the entire mantech team for their unwavering dedication to our customers and their critical missions the steadfast focus enabled another quarter of strong results including record profitability we also saw strong q2 bookings which were driven by successful outcomes on the recompete front as well as new awards and contract extensions and expansions we exited the quarter with nearly 10 billion in proposals outstanding another company record this includes both a significant level of new business opportunities but also a higher than average level of recompetes this activity demonstrates the healthy demand we are seeing from customers for our differentiated services and solutions across the business the market environment remained uneven throughout most of the quarter however we are seeing signs of incremental improvement as customers are increasingly returning to normalized operations collectively these trends reflect the impact from pandemic related disruptions which have created a choppy and somewhat slower pace of awards in year to date 2021 exiting the quarter and through the balance of the year we see and expect a robust level of proposal submissions and the current velocity suggests that we may exceed last year s volume the volume of adjudications combined with our ability to continue to take market share will be the key driver for our anticipated bookings and acceleration of revenue growth in the second half of 21 and into next year overall we are seeing strong market demand across the majority of our business and we expect that to continue throughout the second half of this year turning to the defense budget environment congress appears to be making good progress on the fy 22 appropriations however given the fulsome legislative agenda we expect to begin the year under a continuing resolution since our q1 call we have received administrations detailed budget which continues to demonstrate clear alignment between national priorities and mantech s areas of focus this is a reflection of the actions we have taken to continuously position our business for success for example cyber remains a top priority and the budget calls for over 20 billion unclassified spending across defense and federal civilian customers which represents nearly 9 growth year over year cyber demand remains evident across a broad range of capabilities we see a strong focus on zero trust architectures and cyber operations both areas where we have differentiated solutions and capabilities the budget also calls for over 97 billion of unclassified it modernization representing 4 growth year over year the continued it modernization push across the federal government also aligns with mantech s investments and capabilities in analytics automation data at the edge and other key technologies enabling both mission and enterprise operations finally intelligence community spending remained steady at nearly 86 billion and we still have ample market opportunity in this area lastly i want to note that the drawdown of u s military presence in afghanistan remains on track all mantech personnel supporting dod programs in that country have already shifted into other regions mantech has proudly supported the department of defense for multiple decades at the tactical edge we look forward to continued support for our customers in their global missions and are monitoring how their needs are evolving and the implications that it has for our programs and employees now judy will walk through details on our q2 financial performance and outlook judy judith l bjornaas executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks kevin we continued our steady execution in the quarter with a focus on generating sustainable long term value for our shareholders quarterly revenue grew to 649 million up 3 compared to q2 of 2020 direct labor moderated some in the quarter with the return to normalized pto usage and the impact of the additional federal holiday for q2 prime contracts comprised 93 of revenue and the breakout of contract pricing structure was approximately 69 cost plus 18 fixed price and 13 time and material q2 ebitda was 67 million up 19 from q2 of 2020 this resulted in an ebitda margin of 10 4 up a 150 basis points year over year as margins continue to benefit from stronger labor mix and continued lower indirect cost spending net income for the quarter was 37 million and diluted eps was 0 89 up 22 and 20 from q2 2020 respectively adjusted net income was 40 million and adjusted diluted eps was 0 99 up 19 and 18 from last year our effective tax rate was 24 2 in the quarter in line with expectations turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statements cash flow from operations of 75 million in the quarter represented 2 times net income days sales outstanding were 64 days an increase of one day compared to q2 of 2020 at quarter end the balance sheet showed 65 million in cash and 30 million of debt additionally we distributed 15 million in dividends in q2 maintaining steady return of cash to shareholders the board has authorized us to continue our current cash dividend of 0 38 per share to be paid in september we also recently amended and extended our 500 million revolving credit facility and added 600 million in capacity through a delayed draw term loan mantech is taking advantage of favorable debt capital markets and positioning the company with significant flexibility for capital deployment going forward as consistently stated our capital deployment remains focused on m a and we are continuing to actively review opportunities in a very busy market we remain focused on transactions that bolster our capabilities expand our customer portfolio and that best position the company to generate long term value moving on to guidance we are reiterating our previously communicated revenue guidance and increasing our guidance for adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps we will continue to evaluate our expected go forward results which we believe are most impacted by several factors these include the rate at which we are able to successfully win new business and retain recompetes as well as the timing of each the pace of hiring and ramping new and recent contract awards and the level and timing of material procurements as well as the cadence of the normalization of the supply chain our revenue guidance remains 2 65 billion to 2 75 billion representing 5 to 9 growth year over year at the midpoint of guidance a little over 90 of the revenue is expected to come from existing backlog we are increasing the outlook for adjusted net income to be in the range of 146 5 million to 151 1 million with adjusted diluted eps of 3 57 to 3 68 we are also increasing our expected ebitda margin for the year to be 9 3 to 9 4 which represents a 20 basis point to 30 basis point improvement over 2020 year to date margins have been running higher than the full year guide so we anticipate greater volume of lower fee bearing odcs higher and more normalized indirect spending from the acceleration of expenses related to business development and m a efforts as well as increased travel and pto utilization in the second half of 2021 the adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps ranges assume an effective tax rate of approximately 24 and a fully diluted share count of approximately 41 million shares finally cash flow from operations is still expected to be at least 200 million with capital expenditures expected to be around 2 5 of revenue for the year now i will turn it over to matt to cover the business development and operational highlights for the quarter matt tait chief operating officer thank you judy we achieved bookings of 813 million resulting in a book to bill of approximately 1 3 times in q2 some specific highlights from the quarter include winning a 100 million contract to continue providing the navy with range sustainability services for training and test ranges to meet military readiness and environmental requirements we also won an 86 million contract to continue providing cloud engineering devsecops and enterprise it for the u s cis global enterprise finally we secured a new 85 million contract to provide the state department with enterprise it training technology deployment and communications services that support global consular affairs operations these contract awards continue to demonstrate the differentiation and strength of mantech s capabilities in mission and enterprise it and systems engineering additionally 55 of contract awards in the quarter came from classified customers as a result of these bookings our total backlog was 10 2 billion at quarter end representing 10 year over year growth with funded backlog at 1 4 billion we are pleased with the progress we have made during the quarter we look forward to continuing to drive strong results in the back half of 2021 as we help our customers leverage best of breed commercial technologies in support of their missions our success and ability to deliver for customers remain squarely driven by talented employees we have increased our commitment to attracting developing and retaining talent in what has become an even more competitive labor market we have been hard at work ensuring we have best in class highly skilled and highly clear talent in order to deliver our leading solutions we remain focused on our objective to be the employer of choice in our industry which is why we are evolving and improving how our team operates advocating for flexibility to maximize employee success satisfaction and productivity in a new normal over the past few years we have made significant investments bolstering our capabilities and positioning the business in alignment with national priorities including cyber enterprise it digital and platform modernization analytics and other key areas all of which as kevin mentioned are showing steady demand overall i am confident that mantech s service offerings across its various businesses have positioned us to continue to win our focus on driving continued innovation and differentiation is positioning mantech to maximize pipeline conversion into revenue growth we expect to harvest the benefit of those investments in the quarters to come with that let me hand the call back over to kevin for closing remarks kevin m phillips chairman chief executive officer and president thanks matt in closing our results this quarter reflect the efforts by our team to drive strong program execution innovation and attract and develop best in class talent at the same time we remained focused on leveraging our strong balance sheet to deliver long term shareholder value while supporting our customers and their critical missions we are now ready to take your questions questions and answers operator our first question is from matt akers of wells fargo please go ahead matt akers wells fargo analyst yeah hey guys good afternoon thanks for the question i wanted to just ask on the margins and if there is anything else behind sort of the uptick in margins i know what you see there your still off from kind of the normal pace a little bit was that all that it was or was there anything sort of one time that you would point to in that judith l bjornaas executive vice president and chief financial officer there were no real large one time items it continues to be the lower oec volume and the reduced indirect spend is still not caught up back to kind of the pre covid levels matt akers wells fargo analyst got it okay and i guess like thinking about how that will trend here going over the next couple of quarters is it fair to assume q3 is kind of more back to normal than q4 is kind of fully back or just kind of like the way to think about the pacing of the rest of the year judith l bjornaas executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah yeah we re clearly projecting lower margins in the second half of the year some of that is a return to normal spend and some of it is just because of our high percentage of cost plus we re actually trying to uptick some of our r d spending and other investments like that that won t be necessarily recurring in nature but are within our current indirect freight budgets for the year matt akers wells fargo analyst okay got it thanks that s helpful if i could do one more i guess that can you touch on kind of the intelligence business in general and i think some of your peers it sounds like maybe have seen a little bit of a slowdown there recently is that something that you guys are seeing as well matt tait chief operating officer so i think at least for us and maybe some of those questions all speak to i ll say tied to some of the disruptions overall but i d say portions of our portfolio overall we re seeing a little bit of delays in the intel side of the business versus say the others in terms of defense and federal civilian just kind of i ll give you the overarching commentary there matt akers wells fargo analyst got it okay that s helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from matt sharpe of morgan stanley please go ahead matt sharpe morgan stanley analyst kevin judy matt good afternoon and thanks for taking my question judy i just wanted to touch on the organic growth rate cadence here for a moment i believe q1 was about 1 it looks like this quarter more or less was along those lines and you reiterated the guidance range which correct me if i m wrong had 5 embedded in it at the mid point judith l bjornaas executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah matt sharpe morgan stanley analyst so looking at the q3 q4 its inflection in q3 or is this more of q4 weighted and sort of what s driving the back end weighting profile is this odc surge or what can you tell me about it to get me comfortable with that that inflection in the coming quarters judith l bjornaas executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it s a combination of things i would say the biggest is related to some of those odc catch ups kind of ramping q3 and then even more so in q4 as well as just the volume of proposals outstanding where we re hopeful that the government will stay on pace and we ll see a good q3 of adjudications that will potentially drive some growth in q4 going into q2 sorry into 2022 kevin m phillips chairman chief executive officer and president it s kevin let me expand a little bit on that if you look at the 10 billion of proposals outstanding at the end of last year that number was 6 billion for the company and for the first half of this year there s two trends that we ve seen one is an increasing demand as well as resulting submissions of proposals by the customers meaning that they asked for us to provide and compete on bids is not going down it s gone up at the same time the amount of adjudications in raw dollars over the first six months of this year has not stayed at the levels that did for the last two years so that s that adjudication part is reflective of some delays that we think is from covid the choppiness but you put those two together there is just a lot of proposals out there that we think are nearing the end of their adjudication cycle and we ll expect to see outcomes from those booked from here and taken across the industry as a result of that pickup matt sharpe morgan stanley analyst got it that s very helpful and then just on the cash balance and m a it looks like if you did nothing else other than services the dividend as well as the remainder of the revolver outstanding you d end the year with more or less a 150 million in cash on the books and i think with the revision to your credit facility you ve got another 1 1 or so in terms of dry powder so how are you guys thinking about m a flow here in the coming quarters and in particular any commentary around deal size kevin m phillips chairman chief executive officer and president yeah i ll start and then judy can add generally we ve seen an uptick in assets that are available in the market this year at all sizes it just feels very busy in 2021 and so we are active but also the debt availability is there and it s a very good time and very good terms to be able to be in position to have that capacity should we find the right fit and we still stay disciplined the multiples was fairly elevated but it s a good time in the market to have that capacity available which is why we work that and did a great job on that take a bow judith l bjornaas executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah as kevin said it was time to kind of do the amend and extend m a market crazy lots of things so we just felt like it was a good time to have extra capacity should we find the right larger opportunities that makes sense we ll be ready to go matt sharpe morgan stanley analyst got it and then just one more if i may kevin i think you had mentioned that some of your forward deployed staff that were previously in afghanistan might have been redeployed within the region can you just maybe tell us if you re seeing any opportunities associated with sort of an over horizon capability or what you ve been able to redeploy those bodies to matt tait chief operating officer so matt this is matt i ll feel that maybe initially here and from a dod perspective our presence within afghanistan now is complete and i can t really give you the specifics about where our folks have been a redeployed but they have been in support of the national security missions that we do support overseas kevin m phillips chairman chief executive officer and president and now i ll add to that at a very high level we are a mission and tactical edge company and some of the investments we re making around r d and technology relate to our ability to support deployed forces deployed systems and that s an area that s got a heavy amount of focus within the dod writ large based on the change i ll call it a generational change in the strategy from priority counterterrorism to priority countering near peer threats and how that plays out in terms of funding and activity will play out over time but there is a very real and compelling need and we can sense that in the customers so we ll see how it plays out in terms of our support but we ve supported these locations for decades we re proud to do that and we ll continue to do that matt sharpe morgan stanley analyst got it thanks so much i ll get back in the queue operator thank you our next question comes from gautam khanna of cowen your line is open gautam khanna cowen analyst yes thank you i was wondering if i know it s early but would you mind giving us some color on what you think the medium term or longer term organic growth rate may trend to be for mantech i know we re coming off of a big year and we got the pass through dynamic but i m just curious like based on what s in your pipeline what you see the national security needs as being and just putting it all together is it a low to mid single digit organic business medium term or how do you think about it judith l bjornaas executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think in general the pipeline shows that we ve got lots of opportunities out there that we re pursuing as you said it s early to start talking about longer term our goal is always to grow a little bit faster than the budget and so we re feeling good about it but it s there is 10 billion proposals out there and it just is going to depend on how many fall our way gautam khanna cowen analyst judy could you refresh us on sort of the recompete rate next or maybe over the next 18 months as we think about the 10 billion judith l bjornaas executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah there is not a lot of impact remaining in 2021 from recompetes we ve got about 90 plus in backlog with the balance kind of evenly split between recompete and new next year i think in general is a relatively average 20 to 25 recompete but it s a little more front end loaded in the year than we ve seen in the last few years gautam khanna cowen analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next question is from robert spingarn of credit suisse your line is open robert spingarn credit suisse analyst hi thank you kevin you talked about mantech s zero trust capabilities and this is obviously a big focus for this administration can you describe what mantech brings to the table and do you have any partnerships from the leading vendors there may be a crowdstrike or cloudflare i think that both of them have talked about ramping their federal business meaningfully kevin m phillips chairman chief executive officer and president yeah great question and thanks i ll talk about both we re supporting the federal government in operating in a contested cyber environment right that s got the full breadth of cyber operations to cyber defense we ve done that for a long time in terms of both sides of that and policies have and will continue to change in focus on that the cyber defense piece is moving toward zero trust architecture is moving to the cloud there is a lot behind that through the executive order that came out we have within the cyber r d and investments that we ve made focused on zero trust as a core component and within the business as a business we ve also we re also i d say almost complete with the implementation of the zero trust architecture within our own environment not planning execution and we re almost done with that so you put those two together we think that those combined offer at least a path for customers to know it can be done how it can be done and also we have strong capabilities that matt can expand upon around how we would do that and with the clients and customers as well as partners that we have matt tait chief operating officer yeah and i would say that just to add on to kevin s commentary that we actually have we don t typically talk about the specifics of the partnerships that we have but we have a wide breadth of partnerships across the zero trust landscape and we re involved in i ll just say multiple areas of discussions with customers around zero trust and this aligns it s a great question because it really aligns great with our the technical focus areas we have within our 2023 strategy and where we re investing to kevin s point it aligns with i ll say innovations that people are looking for but also i ll say reasonable innovation where everyone gets sold the next best thing on zero trust so it s us helping them as the independent technology agnostic partner to help sort that out to get to real solutions robert spingarn credit suisse analyst do you see a particular timeframe when this really ramps matt tait chief operating officer gosh i ve never been good at for prognosticating the pace of the federal government but the one thing robert that i would say is that the government is in earnest in these conversations where in the past it was more it was i would say not as urgent a dialog so i think that there is a pace to which they want to act upon and it s just and so i think the urgency there and then we ll see in terms of it but in terms of this isn t a the case of whether they want to do it or not it s just a case of them getting through their own acquisition processes to make it happen kevin m phillips chairman chief executive officer and president it is kevin i think if you read the executive order the government has been very clear on what they suggest agencies prioritize and that guidance as it relates to the response to the executive order how it s going to flow is very important but it will also guide these different agencies as to how they re going to do it once funding is afforded in available and you can see an attempt to establish more funding to make that available and make the changes necessary robert spingarn credit suisse analyst okay well thank you for that just a quick one for judy really on the ebitda margin i want to just look at a little bit to the right and see if you think the expansion can continue next year or does it does the renormalization of some of the costs like pto and travel kind of limit that opportunity relative to this year judith l bjornaas executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think we outperformed last year we re on track to outperform this year clearly it s something that we re focused on trying to continue to do we ve said in the past 10 basis points 15 basis points a year hard to say today given the 2021 outperform that we ll be able to do that in 22 but it s clearly a focus robert spingarn credit suisse analyst okay well thank you for that appreciate the color operator thank you our next question comes from brian kinstlinger of alliance global partners please go ahead brian kinstlinger alliance global partners analyst great thanks for taking my question you mentioned you ve got 90 of the midpoint of revenue guidance coming from backlog for the remainder of the year i think how does that compare to the past at this point in the year and how was potential hiring difficulties ramp delays and i guess award delays factored into that judith l bjornaas executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah hi brian it s i think the yeah just to clarify the 90 is for the full year not the second half of the year so obviously the first half of the year now is all backlog so if you re looking at just the second half of the year it s a little bit higher percentage coming from new and recompete and as far as how it compares to prior years it might be a little bit better off but usually by this point in time you kind of have one what you re going to win that s going to have any kind of major impact on the revenue in the year brian kinstlinger alliance global partners analyst right that was why i asked that okay and the only other follow up a small number of questions i missed if you said what new business was of that 800 in change of awards matt tait chief operating officer so this is matt the recompetes add ons and contract extensions with the majority of the bookings for the quarter brian kinstlinger alliance global partners analyst got it okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from tobey sommer of truist securities your line is open jasper bibb truist securities analyst hey good evening everyone this is jasper bibb on for tobey one of your competitors said last week that the majority of their employees will adopt some form of hybrid work over time i was just curious what do you think their service delivery could look like long term and what that would mean for your recruiting margins etc matt tait chief operating officer sure so this is matt i ll just start off so we ve been doing obviously the war on talent has not ended so we re very sensitive to that we have our mobility program which has hit record numbers this year in terms of where enablement of our folks and i could spend 20 minutes talking to you about all the career enablement things we re doing but the key for us is that i mentioned in my comments just around flexibility with the we have a wide variety of customers that some want i ll say a 100 remote and others that want a 100 on site and so we re working through that as well as for our each of our employees in terms of what experience and career enablement they want to have and i think the phrase that we really use to sum that up was we really want our folks to be the best version of themselves and so we re going to be working with them to make sure that they can do that within the context of the pandemic and the things as our customers are i ll say changing their requirements or updating their requirements for remote work jasper bibb truist securities analyst thanks and then i just want to get your thoughts on what wage inflation might mean for the business based on your contract mix how might that impact margins and is that potentially a tailwind for the cost plus portfolio if your customers are willing to pay out for the best it or cyber talent judith l bjornaas executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean that s definitely an area where having the high percentage of cost plus work is to our benefit so they are willing to pay those higher costs but that said it s still very competitive market both on a bidding standpoint as well as a hiring standpoint jasper bibb truist securities analyst okay last question for me i just wanted well there seems to be a pretty dynamic environment responding to delta now have you seen any customers putting capacity when that s back in place have skipped workers is there kind of any expectation that that might happen in the coming months kevin m phillips chairman chief executive officer and president yeah we are not seeing that i think the general guidance is we want you to show up the we want to make sure you re vaccinated we want to strongly encourage as best we can your vaccinated and if you re not we re asking that you take a lot of precautions and we re going to help you take those precautions and in terms of not only doing math but testing so we ll see how it all plays out but the guidance generally is a fair amount of the citizens have at least one shot but we still have a surge going on and let s work through this and try not to shut down things if we can of it jasper bibb truist securities analyst got it thanks for taking the questions operator thank you our next question comes from mariana perez mora of bank of america your line is open mariana perez mora bank of america analyst good afternoon everyone hello so my question is on cyber security we see a lot of commentary around how cyber security is important for to national security we have seen cyber security funding included in most of the deals that we have seen recently but then how should we think about the timing from those ideas for funding to become like budget to become contract and plus probably become something that is reflected in your organic growth kevin m phillips chairman chief executive officer and president yeah it s a great question and thanks look there s a lot of like any major change it starts with policy level changes as well as incremental funding and reprioritization of funding and basically in that order and you can tell that there s a lot of policy level discussion with the new national cyber director and all the activities that s going on that will inform where the funding goes that said there is already an increase in unclassified budget for cyber so you can see there s beginning for prioritization same thing for it infrastructure renewal and we think that that will be consistent but it s hard to say where it will line up against other priorities but directionally i think that the ship is moving in one direction it s a matter of when and how those priorities lay out over time mariana perez mora bank of america analyst but when you do your internal planning do you see this as a short term boost or more like it could be years for these to actually become top line growth kevin m phillips chairman chief executive officer and president i think certain program is going to be a short term boost but the bulk of it is going to be longer term mission requirements and changes that have to be funded and procured so it s a mixture of both but more and more of this will be more persistent in terms of the obligations and allocations toward it mariana perez mora bank of america analyst interesting and then have you seen given these trends like new entrants into the business how hard it is to get like to compete matt tait chief operating officer we don t see a lot of new entrants in this the areas that we re that you re talking about our i mean there is it s a high bar of entry to be able to do this the type of work that we do mariana perez mora bank of america analyst perfect and last one not related to this more like next opportunities would you mind giving us some color on what is the new work that you mentioned in the qualified pipeline of opportunities what is that related where does it come from or timing that we should look at kevin m phillips chairman chief executive officer and president yeah appreciate the questions so we have been positioning as we mentioned with our investments to be able to kind of predict where the market is and go after some of these procurements of all sizes but more larger procurements as well as prime contractor and we have been able to put together teams and compete and put in strong bids i think that we re on the playing field competing for some of these larger deals across our different components of our business intel defense and federal civilian and so i can t point to any one specific area but if you think about cyber think about enterprise it analytics and automation as well as remote computing and data at the edge support and systems engineering all those are areas that we are expanding into and competing more routinely mariana perez mora bank of america analyst great thank you very much thanks operator our next question comes from louie dipalma of william blair please go ahead louie dipalma william blair analyst kevin judy and stephen good afternoon judith l bjornaas executive vice president and chief financial officer sir kevin m phillips chairman chief executive officer and president how are you doing louie dipalma william blair analyst great matt tait chief operating officer there s matt louie dipalma william blair analyst your booking were and matt matt tait chief operating officer clearly my feelings aren t hurt at all kevin m phillips chairman chief executive officer and president you got to a on that matt tait chief operating officer not hurt at all louie dipalma william blair analyst okay for you matt particularly your bookings were particularly strong from classified customers i believe you and kevin may have said that 55 of bookings came from classified would you say that the intelligence community demand for your services and general award activity is back to 2019 levels or almost back to 2019 levels after all of the disruption associated with the pandemic and administration transition matt tait chief operating officer so i would say there is still some delays in the intel sector and not necessarily from the administration changes but more from the pandemic but there is funding there but it s just a matter of like kevin talked about earlier the pace of what you have coming back in mass and getting things through so it s a bit of a throughput issue that they re working through louie dipalma william blair analyst sounds good and also related to classified spending the intelligence community seems to be accelerating investments in its cloud computing architecture with the amazon c2s the successor c2e that was awarded last year and the recently awarded wild and stormy from a high level perspective are migrations to the cloud a significant growth area for mantech in terms of classified and non classified customers and if amazon microsoft or others win a large federal contract as a prime are you often involved as a subcontractor for like these large cloud implementations matt tait chief operating officer yeah so writ large while we didn t mention cloud specifically within the five technical focus areas it s like electricity for us which is it s a part of all the things that you do it s kind of hard not to do the types of work and the innovations that we want without being cloud enabled and so we do work with all of the csps and do support a lot of the activities there i know we ve had recent press releases on certain relationships and so i think this new unclass and class that part of our go to market is not going to be changed is not changing in a good way meaning that we are investing in that we do see opportunities across the patch but we don t want to lead with cloud we want to lead with solutions right our customers really want us to solve their problems and so this is an these are enabling technologies that we are investing in to make sure that we can be technology agnostic given the right answer and it is kevin i ll just follow on that briefly there s tactical cloud support there s mission and i think service rate level cloud and there s enterprise level and all of those are focus areas for our customers and are going to be areas that we ll seek concentrated movement over time in terms of just creating that foundational element up and down the overall decision making stack if you want to call it louie dipalma william blair analyst thanks kevin operator thank you at this time i d like to turn the call back over to stephen vather for closing remarks sir stephen vather vice president corporate development and investor relations thank you all for your participation on today s call and for your interest in mantech as usual members of our senior team will be available for any follow up

covid related impacts including adjustments to staffing levels navigating supply chain constraints managing commodity pricing and supporting increased customer demand please refer to slide four as i begin my comments on q2 results we earned 1 01 per share for the quarter which is a 141 increase over the 0 42 per share earned in q2 of 2020 all of our businesses had improved results led by our plastics segment which had another outstanding quarter kevin will provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in his comments but here are a few a brief overview of the q2 results the electric segment had a record second quarter with earnings per share increasing 0 04 this was primarily driven by recovery of investments in astoria station and merricourt wind energy center approved interim rates going into effect january 1 in conjunction with otter tail power s minnesota general rate case filing and increased revenues from c i customers as sales volumes recover from the negative impacts of covid our manufacturing segment earnings per share increased 0 13 due to increased sales volumes at btd and t o plastics btd experienced increased demand across all its end markets as major oems continue to rebuild depleted inventories created by strong end market sales and production and supply chain issues our plastics segment had another record breaking quarter with earnings per share increasing 0 42 this was driven by higher pipe sales and higher pipe prices and improved operating margins resulting from positive unique market conditions driven by pvc resin supply constraints we do anticipate operating margins to return to more historic levels in 2022 based on our strong year to date performance especially in the plastics segment and our updated view for the remainder of the year we are raising our 2021 diluted earnings per share guidance to be in the range of 3 50 to 3 65 from our previously announced guidance of 2 47 to 2 62 this is a 50 to 56 increase over last year s 2 34 a share turning to some highlights for the quarter we retired hoot lake plant on may 27 this year marking the end of 100 years of coal fired energy generation at the site on july 21 we joined current and former plant employees and others involved in plant operations to commemorate the plant s legacy and its dependable innovative employees hoot lake plant 140 megawatt coal fired generating facility in fergus falls minnesota played a vital role in our company s history of generating reliable and affordable energy we continue to grow otter tail power through capital investments in generation transmission and technology projects on slide 12 after years of planning and two years of construction and testing astoria station is now part of the mid continent independent system operator or miso energy market this allows miso to economically dispatch the unit this 152 million investment complements our wind generation by providing a reliable backstop when the wind is not blowing and it has flexible operating options and low emissions a storage station provides 245 megawatts of dispatchable capacity compared to hoot lake plant s 140 megawatts with projected 85 less carbon emissions than historic hoot lake plant levels we announced in september 2020 the 60 million hoot lake solar project as shown on slide 13 this is a 49 megawatt project to be built on previously owned and newly purchased land around hoot lake plant hoot lake solar will generate enough energy to power approximately 10 000 homes each year this project offers us a unique opportunity to reuse our existing hoot lake transmission interconnection along with substation and plant land after recently retiring the hoot lake coal plant this spring the minnesota puc approved our request to authorize 100 of hoot lake solar s output to be allocated for use by minnesota customers and 100 of our investment in the hoot lake solar to be eligible for future cost recovery for minnesota customers through our renewable resource rider in early july the fergus falls city council approved our conditional use permit which outlines our plans for the site including screening vegetative management storm water management and decommissioning to qualify for the 26 investment tax credit we have secured safe harbor equipment and currently anticipate the project to be completed in 2023 as noted on slide 14 we began a purchase power agreement in 2013 with nextera energy for energy delivered to the otter tail power system from the ashtabula three wind farm located near laverne north dakota this agreement includes the option to buy the assets of ashtabula 3 converting from a purchase power agreement to a rate based facility in 2023 this wind farm is a 62 4 megawatt facility with a net capacity of 40 net capacity factor we expect to purchase the facility in early 2023 regulatory approvals will be obtained over the next several months we will be filing our next minnesota integrated resource plan in september of 2021 as noted on slide 15 this plan will identify the most cost effective combination of resources to reliably meet customers needs during the next 15 years we will file the plan in all three state jurisdictions as required by the minnesota puc the plan will address compliance with the epa s regional hays rule our last integrated resource plan was filed in june of 2016 and approved in april of 2017 we filed our minnesota general rate case on november 2 2020 as shown on slide 16 our last minnesota rate review was filed in 2016 the primary driver for this request is to place astoria station into our base rates in minnesota this project was approved in our most recent irp and has been earning afudc during the construction period additionally our new customer information system which focuses on enhancing the customer experience by allowing customers more access and options related to their energy use was also a driver for this request recognizing the economic impact to customers of the ongoing pandemic and with input from commission staff we agreed to reduce our interim rate request by approximately half to 6 9 million or 3 2 this was done in conjunction with approval of our annual depreciation filing which extended our wind asset lives from 25 to 35 years this change in depreciation expense and a reduction in pension expense drove the decrease to the interim rate request in december the commission approved our interim rate request beginning in january 2021 in late april we filed a substantial reduction to our original request incorporating the lower depreciation rates approved by the commission lower borrowing rates lower pension and benefit costs and other refinements identified during the discovery phase of the case the new request is for 8 2 million or a 3 8 increase versus the original request of 14 5 million or 6 8 increase evidentiary hearings were held in early june and the administrative law judge is scheduled to issue his recommendation to the puc by september 2 we anticipate a decision in late 2021 even with this increase otter tail power residential customers will continue to have some of the lowest rates in the country as shown on slide 18 utilities rate base is expected to grow by an annual rate of 5 between 2020 and 2025 in a constructive regulatory environment and will be a key driver for future earnings growth we anticipate updating our capex and rate base forecast in future earnings calls after filing our minnesota irp in september and as more information on the miso regional transmission plan is known additionally the utility has entered into electric service agreements with industrial customers in the water pumping and soybean crushing areas these new loads and other loads under development are expected to be commercially operational between 2022 and 2024 turning to our manufacturing segment btd our contract metal fabricator continues to experience increased customer demand and improved sales across all of their end markets as major oems rebuild depleted inventories they continue to be challenged with securing staffing levels to keep up with the increased demand industrywide demand for manufacturing talent has increased and lingering covid 19 impact continue to impact the number of available applicants also steel prices are exceeding historic levels driven by strong demand and limited product availability as mills are slow to recover from capacity reductions in 2020 related to covid even though btd is able to pass increased material costs to the customer steel availability could impact production for some oems our plastics segment continues to deliver extraordinary results in a tight pipe market due to pvc resin supply constraints that have significantly driven up pvc pipe prices pvc resin constraints resulted from abnormally cold weather in february that impacted the gulf coast region resin constraints remain due to high demand as pvc resin plants continue to recover from shutdowns while we expect pvc resin supply constraints to remain for the rest of the year both of our pvc companies remain agile and reliable with on time deliveries looking ahead otter tail power continues to be innovative as we modernize our energy grid enhance customer experiences and work toward a cleaner energy future we project that by 2023 our customers will receive approximately 35 of their energy from renewable sources based on current dispatch levels of both big stone and coyote station our target is to reduce carbon emissions from generation sources we own 50 from 2005 levels by 2025 and 97 by 2050 we will achieve these targets while keeping residential rates among the lowest in the nation with growing concern about companies generating more than 25 of revenues from thermal coal please note otter tail corporation s percentage of revenue from coal assets is significantly below that threshold the percentage of consolidated revenues from our coal assets was 12 in 2010 now i ll turn it over to kevin for the financial perspective kevin g moug chief financial officer and senior vice president well thanks and good morning everyone second quarter sales were up 48 and net earnings increased 148 these results were primarily driven by unique market conditions in our plastics segment resulting from pvc resin supply constraints that caused an acceleration of sales pipe prices well in excess of the increase in resin costs let me provide a detailed review of the quarter results as shown on slides 27 and 28 the electric segment set a new record for second quarter net earnings as we continue to see our largest business execute on its rate base growth strategy net earnings increased 2 1 million quarter over quarter driven by a 1 5 million increase in net retail revenues related to the interim rate increase effective january 1 2021 associated with our current minnesota rate case a 1 5 million increase in retail revenues from commercial and industrial customers primarily due to increased sales compared to the second quarter of 2020 which was negatively impacted by covid a 1 4 million increase in revenues related to the recovery of merricourt operating expenses and astoria station project costs recovery of increased cip program spending in minnesota and south dakota and transmission rider revenues these items were offset by increased operating expenses due to the merricourt wind farm and astoria station being commercially operational increased transmission tariff expenses increased cip expenditures which are being recovered through retail rates and higher vegetative and plant maintenance expense these expense increases were offset in part by lower bad debt expense due to improving customer collections as the economic impact of covid 19 has eased other items impacting earnings were higher depreciation and property tax expense due to recent capital additions higher interest expense due to new long term debt issuances in 2020 higher short term borrowings in 2021 and a lower level of capitalized interest resulting from the placement of the astoria station in service in the first quarter and also a reduction in other income due to lower amounts of equity funds used during construction due to the completion of the astoria station and income taxes were favorably impacted mainly due to production tax credits earned on merricourt in 2021 net earnings for the manufacturing segment increased 5 5 million due to higher parts revenues at btd from increased demand across all our end markets this resulted in increased sales volumes and improved operating margins steel prices continue to exceed historical levels as mill capacity has been slow to recover to pre pandemic levels creating supply chain challenges scrap revenues were higher primarily due to increased scrap metal pricing our scrap volumes were higher as well in comparison to the same quarter a year ago cost of goods sold were higher due to increased sales volumes and higher material costs that were passed on to customers our selling general and administrative costs were higher related to increases in incentive compensation given btd s current year financial performance and increased travel and recruitment costs necessary to support higher revenues at t o plastics our net earnings improved due to increases in product pricing higher levels of horticultural sales and improved gross margins resulting from increased production volumes our plastics segment earnings increased 7 4 million primarily due to higher pricing of pvc pipe sales in excess of higher product costs this dynamic resulted in operating margins not previously experienced increased sales volume also contributed to the improvement the significant increase in pipe prices was driven by pvc resin supply constraints due to resin plant shutdowns that started during the first quarter of 2021 these conditions continued into the second quarter along with significant global demand for pvc resin and limited pipe inventory across the country resin spread as shown on slide 25 which is the difference between the sales price of pvc pipe and the cost of resin in the second quarter of 2021 has increased approximately 65 compared with the first quarter of 2020 our corporate costs net of tax were basically unchanged quarter over quarter in june we completed a 230 million senior unsecured note offering for otter tail power with a delayed drop of 140 million to be issued in november of this year and 90 million to be issued in may of 2022 the proceeds will be used to refinance existing long term debt and for general corporate purposes we continue to generate strong cash flows and have appropriate levels of liquidity under our credit facilities to support our business operations we expect operating cash flows in 2021 will be much stronger than originally anticipated resulting from our plastics segment performance these strong cash flows will allow us to look at investment opportunities such as additional contributions to our pension plan to improve funded status and opportunities for additional capital investments to continue to grow organically we are raising our 2021 overall diluted earnings per share guidance range to 3 50 to 3 65 as shown on slide 31 the midpoint of the revised 2021 earnings per share guidance range of 3 58 reflects an approximate 53 growth rate off of 2020 diluted earnings per share of 2 34 the primary drivers are the exceptional performance and improved outlook of our plastics segment we are also raising our manufacturing segment guidance based on strong first half performance along with end markets that are continuing to improve our forecast reflects our expectations that supply constraints and inflation are not going away nor will they improve materially in 2021 our revised guidance reflects the impact of continued labor challenges as we look to increase wage rates across certain of our businesses in order to attract the needed workforce to support growing volumes let me review the items contributing to our revised segment guidance for 2021 we are maintaining our previous guidance for the electric segment and continue to expect earnings will exceed 2020 levels driven by the merricourt and astoria projects being commercially operational and our 410 million total investment in these projects being fully reflected in rate base both projects have recovery mechanisms in all three of our jurisdictions partially offset by increased operating and maintenance depreciation and property tax expense associated with these investments and increased interest expense due to the 2020 debt issuances the impact of our minnesota rate case that was filed in november of 2020 the minnesota public utility commission has improved an interim rate increase of 3 2 or 6 9 million these items were partially offset by increased non labor oem expenses related to planned outages at big stone plant and increased post retirement expense related to a decrease in the discount rate and long term rate of return on plan assets we are increasing our previous 2021 earnings guidance for our manufacturing segment and continue to expect earnings to be higher than 2020 based on the strong year to date performance at btd driven by the increased sales volumes across all end markets and improved operating margins as our customers continue to rebuild inventories to fill the shortages created by the pandemic the strong year to date recoveries in our end markets is certainly indicative of the economic recovery however we believe growth could be more robust if not for the challenges associated with continued supply constraints and labor shortages scrap revenues are expected to be higher based on higher scrap metal prices decreased steel mill capacity due to covid has created product availability issues while capacity continues to improve mills are struggling to keep up with demand to get the steel needed to meet customer demands and continue to keep steel prices elevated above historic levels we currently expect steel prices to remain high into 2022 and we continue to work on increasing staffing levels to keep up with demand and to mitigate the impacts of lower productivity and increased expedited freight costs we expect higher earnings at t o plastics mainly due to their strong year to date performance increased sales to horticultural end markets and improving operating margins and productivity enhancements backlog for the manufacturing segment is approximately 128 million for 2021 compared with 93 million one year ago our increased backlog is reflective of the improving economy we are raising the 2021 guidance for our plastics segment from our previous guidance due to operating margins being higher than expected during the first six months driven by unique market conditions resulting from pvc supply constraints these market conditions continued into the second quarter and resulted in higher than planned pvc pipe sales prices sales prices are predicted to remain elevated for the rest of the year resin suppliers continue to increase raw material prices in response to market conditions such as availability constraints related to feedstock supplies for resin and a strong export market which has higher resin prices than the domestic market we currently expect the supply constraints to continue for the remainder of the year and return to more normal levels next year pounds of pipes sold in 2021 are now expected to be higher than in 2020 driven by strong construction and municipal markets and our corporate costs net of tax are expected to be higher driven by higher employee benefit costs and potential contributions to the otter tail corporation foundation our expected 2021 financial results show 48 of our consolidated earnings per share coming from the electric segment this is a departure from our 70 to 75 expected earnings from the electric segment the 2021 results are clearly being driven by the economic recovery in our nonelectric businesses and most significantly by the unique market conditions in our plastics segment that are not expected to continue over the long term we continue to expect our electric segment to contribute 70 to 75 of our overall earnings over the long term it will continue to deliver reliable performance along with rate based investment opportunities over the next five years to allow for growing revenues earnings and cash flows the manufacturing and plastics segment will also provide organic growth over the long term these two segments are expected to provide around 25 to 30 of our earnings over time we expect to deliver total shareholder return of 8 to 10 over the long term consisting of our expected 5 to 7 compounded annual growth rate in earnings per share using 2020 as the base year along with our current dividend yield looking forward we would expect to grow the dividend aligned with our earnings per share growth while maintaining a dividend payout ratio between 60 to 70 over the long term our business model continues to serve us well and we remain positioned to fund our rate base growth opportunities at the utility with our strong balance sheet ample liquidity to support our businesses and strong investment grade corporate credit ratings we are now ready to take your questions questions and answers operator ladies and gentlemen after the q a chuck will return with a few closing remarks your first question comes from the line of chris ellinghaus from siebert williams your line is open chris ellinghaus siebert williams analyst operator for mr chris ellinghaus you may now ask your question chris ellinghaus siebert williams analyst hi guys how are you kevin g moug chief financial officer and senior vice president good morning chris chris ellinghaus siebert williams analyst the foundation donation potential should we sort of expect that to be similar to the magnitude of 2020 or given the earnings level this year should we expect that to be bigger kevin g moug chief financial officer and senior vice president chris this is kevin we ve got roughly 0 05 a share is what s included in this updated guidance for a potential contribution to the foundation this year so compared to last year that would when you look at the foundation between or the contribution between the power company that they contributed to their foundation and then plastics also made a contribution to the otter tail corporation foundation it s less this year than last year chris ellinghaus siebert williams analyst okay the way you describe the plastics market today i m a little confused you re talking about probably selling more pounds so that suggests that your ability or your allocation of the resin market is the same or better so that doesn t to me sounds like you have a resin constraint per se does that mean that some of your competitors have bigger constraints and that s allowing for this supply demand imbalance to allow higher prices or i m a little confused on where the resin supply problem is charles s macfarlane president and chief executive officer the plants are pretty much back to full levels but they continue to keep customers us and our competitors on resin allocations so we re getting the resin we need but we aren t getting all the resin we could certainly use and so our inventory levels are significantly lower today than they have been in previous years and so what we re getting in terms of allocation we re pretty much producing and selling through chris ellinghaus siebert williams analyst so really if i think about this it s is really extraordinary demand that can t be met with supply is more in my mind where the margin is coming from in prior years where you didn t have the february disruption would the resin market have been able to adjust its volume to supply you that incremental capacity charles s macfarlane president and chief executive officer yes it would have chris ellinghaus siebert williams analyst okay so this is sort of a combination of factors that are causing these margins what are you expecting in 2022 you re talking about a return to normal but is there a reason to think that the construction market will ease or are you simply thinking that the resin supply will increase to meet that demand charles s macfarlane president and chief executive officer yes chris we re as we look at it today we re expecting that the resin supply will return to more normal type levels in 2022 as such then to meet the demand more easily to meet the demand that s out there and that we would start to see then this these conditions that drove the high sales prices and margins would return back to kind of more normal levels that we ve seen historically chris ellinghaus siebert williams analyst okay can you give us a little color on what your july weather looked like charles s macfarlane president and chief executive officer july weather has been i would say it s probably a little bit warmer than normal kevin g moug chief financial officer and senior vice president i think we re five degrees above average for july chris ellinghaus siebert williams analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brian russo from sidoti your line is open kevin g moug chief financial officer and senior vice president good morning brian brian russo sidoti analyst so just a follow up on the plastics segment i mean do you have a competitive advantage in this market or is it just a spread business meaning when demand is outstripping supply your margins expand or are you able to secure more resin inventory than competitors maybe due to location etc that or all your competitors seeing the same unprecedented outsized margins right now kevin g moug chief financial officer and senior vice president brian this is kevin i would we certainly believe we have a competitive advantage as it relates to our ability to quickly react to customer demands and needs when some of our competitors are not able to do that we certainly saw that in 2020 as we kept our plants open lines running while other competitors did temporary shutdowns during the first couple of quarters of covid impacting us having said that though i would also tell you that we are seeing competitors who are making announcements to raise sales prices of pipe pretty significantly as well even since the end of the quarter here we ve seen competitors come out with price announcements as they continue to raise prices given there s just a even though the plants are back up running in terms of everybody s still having to be on resin allocation there is a demand out there for product and we re seeing competitors raise prices as well as we go through this and we re seeing that occur also in the with our customers where they are now starting to not be able to maybe honor some of the prices that had been out there given that the supply side is raising prices they re having to not be able to honor their prices to the end users as well and having to raise prices so it s affecting a lot of the market brian russo sidoti analyst understood so competitors raising pvc pipe prices is that a leading indicator to your plastics segment performance meaning it s an indication of increasing demand and therefore widening spreads relative to an increase in the actual raw material or resin charles s macfarlane president and chief executive officer well it could be brian i think what we re seeing too though is we re seeing the our competitors raise prices we re also seeing announced resin price increases coming from the suppliers here brian russo sidoti analyst understood and then on slide 25 go ahead charles s macfarlane president and chief executive officer that s it brian russo sidoti analyst yes so on slide 25 the spread relationship any willingness to share what that spread is charles s macfarlane president and chief executive officer no we have confidentiality provisions in our supply agreements with our resin suppliers so such that we just aren t able to kind of go down that pathway brian russo sidoti analyst yes no understood in this bipartisan infrastructure bill i think there s nearly 55 billion allocated to water infrastructure is your plastic segment leveraged to that spend kevin g moug chief financial officer and senior vice president i think we have not put that in our forecast yet we are aware of the lead replacement in the bill a lot of that has to do with areas in the eastern u s which is not a big amount of our pipe going there but it will put a positive i think on the entire sector or pipe manufacturing business brian russo sidoti analyst okay and then at the btd segment obviously a lot of oem or end market demand inventory levels dealership inventory levels are historically low so just hearing some of your customers they can t eat the demand because of supply constraints but it seems that your i m trying to get a sense of what your volume growth was like in the second quarter versus just revenue because revenue reflects the higher price of steel which is a pass through so i m just trying to get a sense for what s kind of the actual growth rate in terms of units sold versus the top line revenue kevin g moug chief financial officer and senior vice president let me try and break it down for you this way brian and see if it helps but as we compare to 2020 revenues at btd to our current view we re seeing about a 96 million increase in revenues so that s 47 but of that 56 million is material pricing between our 2020 results in revenues and what we are forecasting this year so then there s 40 million of if you will growth as it relates to the value add that we re doing to our customers brian russo sidoti analyst got it that s very helpful so with some of your end market customers on recent conference calls have noted supply chain issues etc it s not you that they re facing supply shortages from it s elsewhere for other products that go into these off road vehicles i guess kevin g moug chief financial officer and senior vice president yes i mean brian i would say it s a combination of all i mean we certainly are experiencing supply constraints as well that then impact our ability to get product to our customers but it s i think you see whether it s polaris you look at toro others this supply constraint is an issue for a lot of industrial companies and we re experiencing higher expedited freight costs we ve been having to have employees work overtime to try and meet the demand that our customers are putting on us and we re working through that we re trying to hire more labor to help improve some of that productivity but we re certainly seeing an impact in the p l as it relates to just higher labor costs and expedited freight costs as we work to get product to them brian russo sidoti analyst okay what is the utilization rate at the plants at btd i think you got one in minnesota and one in georgia kevin g moug chief financial officer and senior vice president we have the washington illinois we have the georgia facility and then the minnesota facility i think in general we re somewhere around a 70 capacity level brian russo sidoti analyst okay great and then just switching gears to the utility any insight into the irp in terms of transmission or renewables or scenarios surrounding environmental compliance at coyote or maybe repowering etc charles s macfarlane president and chief executive officer brian i think we don t usually include any of the transmission investments in that irp those are generally will come out of the miso plan and right now we re just going to wait until we file it in september such that our regulators get the first review of the plan and what s in it and we are still finalizing that so it s a little early to bring those out brian russo sidoti analyst okay got it thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of sophie karp from keybanc your line is open sophie karp keybanc analyst hi good morning thank you for taking my question kevin g moug chief financial officer and senior vice president good morning sophie karp keybanc analyst so obviously guys you have a really strong performance in the plastics and manufacturing segments right driven by all of these market conditions my question is it s almost a windfall right if we look at the numbers my question is what are the users how are you planning to use this sort of unexpected if you will revenue and the cash flows that it ultimately translates into would that sort of offset maybe your equity needs and we should start thinking about that or is there a share buyback or is it just getting reinvested so is there any kind of special views that we should be thinking about kevin g moug chief financial officer and senior vice president yes sophie thanks for the question it s kevin i mean we don t have in our i think we talked about this on the first quarter call but we don t have any equity needs in the five year plan and so right now as we look and as i mentioned i think in my opening comments as it relates to the stronger cash flows we certainly have the opportunity to look at some additional contributions to our pension plan to help the funded status there we also have additional capital investments that create additional organic growth for us specifically in the plastics segment that we ve been looking at that would that extra cash would help us fund those things and allow us to have additional organic growth opportunities going forward sophie karp keybanc analyst got it and so i ll take it that you not considering maybe selling those segments at this point given the valuations must be very attractive kevin g moug chief financial officer and senior vice president as we continue to communicate we the two platform strategy between the utility and the manufacturing consisting of manufacturing and plastics segment we like the business model we think it s performing well and continue to expect to execute on that sophie karp keybanc analyst awesome terrific well great quarter and thank you so much for taking my question that s all i have kevin g moug chief financial officer and senior vice president thank you operator and there are no other questions over the phone line at this time charles s macfarlane president and chief executive officer all right i ll turn it

earnings release attachments and slides detailing operating results by company are posted on our website at investor pseg com and our 10 q will be filed shortly the earnings release and other matters discussed during today s call contain forward looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties we will also discuss non gaap operating earnings and non gaap adjusted ebitda which differ from net income or loss as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we include reconciliations of our non gaap financial measures and a disclaimer regarding forward looking statements on our ir website and in today s earnings material i ll now turn the call over to ralph izzo chairman president and chief executive officer of pseg joining ralph on today s call is dan cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer at the conclusion of their remarks there will be time for your questions ralph ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you carlotta and thank you everyone for joining us this morning pseg reported non gaap operating earnings of 0 70 per share for the second quarter of 2021 versus 0 79 per share in last year s second quarter gaap results for the second quarter were 0 35 per share net loss related to transition charges at pseg power and that compares with 0 89 per share of net income for the second quarter of 2020 also in the quarter pseg power recorded a pre tax impairment of 519 million at its new england asset group partly offset by a pre tax gain of 62 million from the sale of the solar source portfolio we continue to make great progress on a number of fronts to position ourselves for the future we had a strong operating quarter that once again produced non gaap operating earnings in line with our expectations for the year our results for the second quarter bring non gaap operating earnings for the first half of 2021 to 1 98 per share this 9 increase over non gaap results of 1 82 per share for the first half of 2020 reflects the growing contribution from our regulated operations and continued derisking at pseg power slides 13 and 15 summarize the results for the quarter and the first half of the year it s been a year since we announced our intentions to explore strategic alternatives for our non nuclear generation assets and i m pleased with the progress to date in what i believe is a compelling platform for future regulated growth at pse g our utility a clean energy infrastructure focused business will be complemented by a significantly contracted carbon free generating portfolio consisting of our nuclear fleet and investments and opportunities in regional offshore wind the marketing of the fossil assets has garnered a significant level of interest from numerous qualified buyers in a competitive process which is advancing as expected and we expect to provide you with more information on this process in the very near future i m pleased that we ve reached a balanced agreement with the new jersey board of public utilities and the division of rate counsel on pse g s transmission rate which if approved by ferc will resolve a significant regulatory uncertainty for us and provide a timely rate reduction for customers pse g has agreed to voluntarily reduce its annual transmission revenue requirement which includes a reduction in its base return on equity to 9 9 from 11 18 if approved by the ferc a typical electric residential customer will save 3 on their monthly bills new jersey continues to experience positive economic activity since governor murphy lifted the public health emergency order in june our largest customer class in terms of sales the commercial segment has shown a rebound in electricity demand electric sales overall adjusted for weather were up nearly 4 over the second quarter of 2020 led by an 11 increase in commercial sales which was partly offset by a 5 decline in residential sales as people gradually returned to work outside the home the warmer than normal summer has also increased pse g s average daily peak load for the quarter to 5 480 megawatts compared to last year s second quarter average of 5 100 megawatts and the 5 330 megawatts experienced in the pre covid second quarter of 2019 and so far this summer pse g s load has peaked at 10 064 megawatts on june 30 exceeding the 10 000 megawatt mark for the first time since july 19 of the year 2013 eight years ago turning to clean energy developments in new jersey the bpu in june awarded a second round of offshore wind projects totaling 2 658 megawatts and is now halfway toward the state s goal of procuring 7 500 megawatts of offshore wind generation by 2035 the award was split between the 1 510 megawatt atlantic shores project and orsted s 1 148 megawatt ocean wind 2 the orec price is set in the second round range from about 86 to 84 for the atlantic shores and ocean wind projects respectively and last week the bpu approved a new solar successor incentive framework that consists of two programs an administratively determined incentive and a competitive solicitation incentive which would apply to larger projects defined as five megawatts and above incentive levels for the administratively determined segment range from 90 per megawatt hour for net metered residential projects to 70 to 100 per megawatt hour for the commercial and community solar segments and up to 120 per megawatt hour for certain public entity projects you will recall that the prior program consisting of solar renewable energy credits or as we frequently refer to them as srecs average well above 200 per megawatt hour over the past decade and combined with net metering subsidies and federal tax credits provided later incentives topping 300 per megawatt hour so this successor program is a positive step toward balancing the need for clean energy while recognizing the importance of affordability for our customers pseg s existing solar programs are essentially fully subscribed we ll continue to work with the state mbp on programs that can help meet the solar goals in the energy master plan pseg continues to make tangible progress on our own decarbonization and esg goals in the second quarter alone we closed on our 25 equity stake in the 1 100 megawatt ocean wind project in new jersey that s the ocean wind one project obviously we retired our last coal unit at bridgeport harbor in connecticut making our generating fleet coal free and moved up our net zero vision by 20 years to 2030 but not only do we accelerate the net zero vision we also expanded it to include scope one direct greenhouse gas emissions and scope two indirect greenhouse gas emissions from operations at both pseg power and pse g expanding the net zero vision to include both the utility and power operations is a significant move forward in our decarbonization efforts and one that will both inspire and challenge us to do more and do it better coming up pseg is preparing to bid into a competitive process to build offshore wind transmission infrastructure this solicitation is intended to procure transmission solutions to this important new jersey 7 500 megawatt offshore wind target by 2035 the potential projects can cover onshore upgrades new onshore transmission connection facilities new offshore transmission connection facilities and a network to offshore transmission system proposals may address any or all of these four components the decision making criteria is expected to include among other things an evaluation of reliability and economic benefits cost constructability environmental benefits permitting risks and other new jersey benefits this competitive transmission open window will be jointly conducted by pjm and the new jersey board of public utilities pjm will lead the technical analysis of the proposed transmission solutions and the bp will be the ultimate decision maker we support the state s efforts to procure transmission in a manner that is most reliable constructible and cost effective for our customers all of this is great progress on our decarbonization efforts and continues to demonstrate our alignment with the state s clean energy agenda and our industry leadership on environmental stewardship new jersey s recent endorsement of the environmental benefits provided by our new jersey nuclear plants through the second zero emission certificates i ll refer to that as zec for the rest of this conversation extends the 10 per megawatt hour carbon free attribute recognition through may of 2025 this extension will allow us along with stakeholders in new jersey and at the federal level the time we need to work on a long term economic solution to keep our merchant nuclear fleet economically viable and preserve its currently unmatched contribution of reliable carbon free baseload generation the most cost effective clean generation source available during the zec deliberations a growing recognition of these nuclear units were economically at risk but vitally important to new jersey s ability to reach its clean energy and carbon goals gain further traction the importance of the new jersey nuclear units to the state s climate goals was also recognized in the bpu staff s recent resource adequacy report the report recommends that new jersey should continue exploring a regionwide or new jersey only integrated clean capacity market with the fixed resource requirement often we refer to that as an frr we expect that the bpu will be closely watching to see whether ferc accepts pjm s just filed modifications to the minimum offer price rule which appears to better align the pjm capacity market with new jersey s clean energy goals the results of the first pjm capacity auction in three years influenced by a covid 19 pandemic stifled demand curve served as further evidence of the market risks faced by our nuclear units this sentiment is shared by biden administration officials including doe secretary granholm and white house domestic climate advisor gina mccarthy who have both spoken publicly on the importance of nuclear energy as a clean energy resource we continue to work on promoting a federal nuclear production tax credit proposal where the value of the credit declines as market revenue increases this is the primary federal policy that would help prevent premature closing of merchant plants whose market revenues are not currently covering cost and risk other options such as the federal nuclear grant program administered by the department of energy are also being discussed however we and others in the industry share the view that a competitive grant program will not provide timely relief nor the certainty these plants need to remain operational nonetheless we re encouraged by the attention that at risk nuclear plants are getting in washington and we especially appreciate the efforts of new jersey congressman bill pascrell who s leading this effort in the house of representatives and senators cardin manchin and booker in the senate that said we do expect the federal infrastructure effort to take the better part of the rest of the year to unfold on the social side of esg during the second quarter we recognized the juneteenth holiday by giving employees paid time off to commemorate and celebrate this important day in our nation s history and supported our lbgtq community with numerous events for pride month also in june pseg was named to just capital s top 100 companies supporting healthy families and communities overall we had a solid quarter and results for the first half of the year have positioned us to update our full year guidance somewhat earlier than has been our practice we are raising by 0 05 per share at the bottom end of pseg s non gaap operating earnings guidance for full year 2021 to a range of 3 40 to 3 55 per share based on favorable results of pse g and power through the first six months of the year this update also incorporates an august one effective date to implement the transmission rate settlement and the expectation that the fossil assets will contribute to consolidated results through the end of the year we re on track to achieve the utilities 2021 planned capital spending of 2 7 billion on schedule and on budget this spend is part of pseg s consolidated five year 14 billion to 16 billion capital plan which we still intend to execute without the need to issue new equity while also continuing to offer the opportunity for consistent and sustainable growth in our dividend before closing i do want to recognize the contributions of dave daly who will be retiring on january 4 2022 after 35 years of dedicated service to the company kim hanemann who had been named pse g s senior vice president and chief operating officer was promoted to succeed dave as president and coo of pse g effective june 30 in support of a seamless transition of leadership at pse g dave is serving as an executive advisor through the end of the year with her promotion kim is the first woman to lead new jersey s largest electric and gas utility in our 118 year history many of you know kim is the power behind the transmission buildout over the past 10 years and i hope all of you will have the opportunity to meet here in the near future speaking of meeting new jersey has among the highest rates of fully vaccinated people in the country but vaccination rates in the state have recently plateaued so we re carefully monitoring the impact that highly contagious variants are having on updated health and safety protocols so whether in person or virtually we are looking forward to hosting an investor owned an investor event in the fall when we expect to share with you the many good things that are happening at pseg regarding our improved business mix increased financial flexibility and solid growth opportunities so now i ll turn the call over to dan for more details on our operating results and we ll rejoin you at the end of this for your questions daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer great thank you ralph and good morning everybody as ralph said pseg reported non gaap operating earnings for the second quarter of 2021 at 0 70 per share versus 0 79 per share in last year s second quarter we ve provided you with an information on slides 13 and 15 regarding the contribution to non gaap operating earnings by business for the quarter and the year to date periods and slides 14 and 16 contain corresponding waterfall charts that take you through the net changes in non gaap operating earnings by major business i ll now review each company in more detail starting with pse g pse g reported net income of 309 million or 0 61 per share for the second quarter of 2021 compared with net income of 283 million or 0 56 per share for the second quarter of 2020 pse g s second quarter results reflect revenue growth from ongoing capital investment programs growth in transmission added 0 01 per share to second quarter net income reflecting continued infrastructure investment as well as the timing of transmission o m in the quarter and true ups from prior year filings electric margin added 0 02 per share to net income compared to the year earlier quarter driven by commercial and industrial demand reflecting higher margins in april and may compared to the covid 19 restrictions that affected prior year results and the implementation of the conservation incentive program or cip mechanism in june gas margin added 0 01 per share driven by the gas system modernization program rate rollings gas related bad debt expense and o m expense were both 0 01 per share favorable compared to the year earlier quarter driven by the timing of covid related deferrals since the issuance of the bpu s order in the third quarter of last year an increase in distribution related depreciation due to higher rate base lowered net income by 0 01 per share nonoperating pension expense was 0 02 per share favorable compared to the second quarter of 2020 reflecting the continued recognition of strong asset returns experienced last year tax expense was 0 02 unfavorable compared to the second quarter of 2020 driven by the timing of adjustments to reflect pse g s estimated annual effective tax rate the transmission agreement between pse g the bpu and rate counsel that ralph mentioned earlier has been filed with ferc for approval with an august one requested effective date there s no timetable from when ferc must respond however we will begin recording the impacts of the settlement on our financials starting with the august one requested effective date the agreement would reset the base roe for pse g s formula rate to 9 9 from 11 18 which lowers the annual transmission revenue requirement by about 100 million per year on a pre tax basis other key elements of the settlement lower annual depreciation expense by approximately 42 million which has a corresponding reduction in revenue that results in no net impact on earnings and an improved cost recovery methodology for our administrative and general costs and investments in materials and supplies the agreement also includes an increase of pse g s equity ratio from 54 to 55 of total capitalization the financial impact of the settlement agreement is expected to lower pse g s net income by approximately 50 million to 60 million or 0 10 to 0 12 per share on an annual basis in the first 12 months once implemented weather for the second quarter was significantly warmer than the second quarter of 2020 with the temperature humidity index that was 34 higher than normal and a significantly higher than normal number of hours at 90 degrees or greater the new jersey economy continued to recover in the second quarter increased by total weather normalized electric sales by approximately 4 compared to the second quarter of 2020 which was at the height of the covid 19 economic restrictions on a trailing 12 month basis weather normalized electric and gas sales were each higher by approximately 1 with residential electric and gas usage up by 4 and 2 respectively the conservation incentive program which started june one for electric sales removes the variations of weather economic activity efficiency and customer usage from our financial results resetting margins to a baseline level this new mechanism supports pse g s ability to maximize customer participation in energy efficiency programs without losing margins from lower sales a similar program covering gas sales will commence october one and replace the weather normalization clause pse g s capital program remains on schedule pse g invested approximately 700 million in the second quarter and 1 3 billion year to date through june this capital was part of 2021 s 2 7 billion electric and gas infrastructure program to upgrade transmission and distribution facilities and enhance reliability and increase resiliency we continue to forecast over 90 of pseg s planned capital investment will be directed to the utility over the 2021 to 2025 time frame pse g s forecast of net income in 2021 has been updated to 1 42 billion to 1 47 billion from 1 41 billion to 1 47 billion now moving on to power pseg power reported non gaap operating earnings for the second quarter of 0 10 per share and non gaap adjusted ebitda of 159 million this compares to non gaap operating earnings of 0 24 per share and non gaap adjusted ebitda of 258 million for the second quarter of 2020 non gaap adjusted ebitda excludes the same items as our non gaap operating earnings measure as well as income tax expense interest expense depreciation and amortization expense the earnings release and slide 23 provide you with a detailed analysis of the items having an impact on pseg power s non gaap operating earnings relative to net income quarter over quarter we also provided you with more detail on generation for the quarter and for the first half of 2021 on slide 24 pseg power s second quarter non gaap operating earnings were affected by several items that combined lowered results by 0 14 per share below the quarter from a year ago recontracting and market impacts reduced results by 0 09 per share reflecting seasonal shape of hedging activity and higher cost to serve load versus the year ago quarter generating volume and zero emission certificates were each down by 0 01 per share affected by lower nuclear output related to the spring refueling outage at the 100 owned hope creek nuclear plant pjm capacity revenue added 0 02 per share to the year ago quarterly comparison for the year ended june 30 for the year to date ended june 30 capacity is 0 05 per share favorable compared to the first half of 2020 reflecting the scheduled higher price of approximately 167 per megawatt day for the majority of the first half of 2021 versus the 116 per megawatt day for the same period in 2020 higher o m expense reduced results by 0 04 per share compared to last year s second quarter primarily reflecting the planned hope creek refueling outage and higher fossil operating expenses lower depreciation expense reflecting the sale of the solar source portfolio and the early retirement of the bridgeport harbor coal fired generating station combined with lower interest expense to add 0 02 per share versus the year ago quarter taxes and other items were 0 03 per share unfavorable reflecting the absence of a multi year tax audit settlement included in the second quarter 2020 results gross margin in the second quarter of 2020 was 28 per megawatt hour compared with 33 per megawatt hour for last year s second quarter the decline quarter over quarter reflects the seasonal price impact of recontracting that is anticipated to result in a negative 2 per megawatt hour price decline in the hedge portfolio for the full year we expect recontracting results in the third quarter of 2021 to be similarly negative as we mentioned last quarter will more than offset the 0 03 per share benefit seen in the first quarter of this year now let s turn to power s operations total generation output declined by 1 to 12 6 terawatt hours in the second quarter as the refueling outage at hope creek and subsequent forced out its lower nuclear output versus the second quarter of 2020 the nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 86 for the quarter producing 7 2 terawatt hours down by 7 versus last year which represented 57 of total generation power s combined cycle fleet produced 5 3 terawatt hours of output up 8 in response to higher market demand helped by warm weather power is forecasting generation output of 25 to 27 terawatt hours for the remaining two quarters of 2021 and has hedged 95 to 100 of its production at an average price of 30 per megawatt hour also during the quarter we re pleased to remind you that pseg power eliminated all coal from its generating mix with the early retirement of bridgeport harbor station three power s quarterly impairment assessments including consideration of its strategic review of the non nuclear fleet determined that the iso new england asset grouping showed an impairment as of june 30 2021 as a result power recorded a pre tax charge of 519 million for this asset group pjm and new york iso asset groupings did not show an impairment as of june 30 2021 however a move of these assets to held for sale which would be effective upon an anticipated sale agreement would be expected to prompt an additional material impairment to the fossil portfolio such a move to held for sale would also prop the cessation of depreciation and amortization expense for the held for sale units resulting in a favorable impact to gaap and non gaap operating earnings through the close of the transaction in june of 2021 pseg completed the sale of pseg s solar source which resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately 62 million and income tax expense of approximately 63 million primarily due to the recapture of investment tax credits on units that operated for less than five years for the remainder of the year depreciation expense will also decline by approximately 0 03 per share as a result of the solar source sale forecast of pseg power s non gaap operating earnings for 2021 has been updated to 295 million to 370 million from 280 million to 370 million while our estimated non gaap adjusted ebitda remains unchanged at 850 million to 950 million now let me briefly address operating results from enterprise and other and provide an update on pseg long island for the second quarter of 2021 pseg enterprise and other reported a net loss of 3 million or 0 01 per share for the second quarter of 2021 which was flat compared to a net loss of 2 million or 0 01 per share for the second quarter of 2020 the net loss for the second quarter of 2021 reflects higher interest expense at the parent initially offset partially offset i should say by the ongoing contributions from pseg long island in june pseg long island entered into a nonbinding term sheet with the long island power authority that would resolve all the authorities claims related to tropical storm isaias the terms will be adopted into amendments to our operation service agreement or osa and submitted to new york state authorities for approval later this year the osa contract term will continue through 2025 with a mutual option to extend for 2021 the forecast for pseg enterprise and other remains unchanged at a net loss of 15 million pseg s financial position remains strong at june 30 we had approximately 4 billion of available liquidity including cash on hand of about 107 million and debt represented 52 of our consolidated capital during the first half of 2021 pseg entered into 2 364 day variable rate term loan agreements totaling 1 25 billion during the second quarter pseg power retired 950 million of senior notes maturing in june and september 2021 and ended june with debt as a percentage of capital of 20 in may moody s changed pse g s credit rating outlook to negative from stable their first mortgage bond rating remains aa3 we still expect to fund pseg s 14 billion to 16 billion capital investment program over the 2021 to 2025 period without the need to issue new equity while also continuing to offer consistent and sustainable growth in our dividend payment as ralph mentioned we ve raised the bottom end of our forecast of non gaap operating earnings for the full year to 3 40 to 3 55 per share up by 0 05 per share based on the solid results we have seen in the first half of the year that give us confidence that we can deliver results at the upper end of our original guidance that concludes my comments and carol we are now ready to answer questions questions and answers operator thank you the first question comes from the line of jeremy tonet with jpmorgan please go ahead jeremy jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst hi good morning just wanted to dig into the fossil sales process a little bit more if i could and given the impairment here i just want to make sure i m clear the one taken in new england it would seem that that process might wrap up more near term than the others and then at the same time for the other pieces of the sale it seems like the process might slip into 22 a little bit if i saw that right just wondering if you could walk through some of the drivers on that daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer sure jeremy with respect to your question on the different asset groupings when we think about and when we do our impairment tests we use those asset groupings and so there s an asset grouping for new england one for new york and one for pjm and so i would not look at the timing of the impairment in the second quarter in new england as being different timing for different components i think what you would look at is the way that the test is done by looking at both the traditional view of an undiscounted set of future cash flows as well as the potential for a sale that go into that calculation and basically that calculation was such that we did as of the end of the second quarter see an impairment in new england but did not see one in new york and pjm as i noted in my remarks that as we continue forward and upon a movement to held for sale you could see a material impairment incremental to what s there but it does not have to do with timing per se of the sale and what we have said all along was somewhere around midyear we would be moving to agreement we re still in that ballpark i believe but i still think year end is about what you would anticipate the path that we re on but it does not imply separate sales by virtue of what s happened it s more just based upon the overall accounting and how that test works vis a vis let s say the balance on the books jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst got it that s helpful thank you for that and maybe just kind of pivoting toward offshore wind here in investment timing in transmission just wondering how you think about the opportunity post the settlement here and then i guess as well with nuclear if there s potential federal outcomes here if that might kind of play into the process in any way at all and informs how the state goes about the review just wondering if you could update us there on that ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes so jeremy it s ralph so we re excited about playing in all four parts of the offshore transmission opportunity and we do see that as a quite sizable opportunity this is due if i m not mistaken at the end of this month but they ve been delayed they were originally due the end of this month but they were delayed now it s sometime in september probably the end of september we re expecting pjm to review that through the balance of the year and then handing their results over to the bpu for an early decision probably end of first quarter next year it could slip a little further than that but there s a sizable opportunity in offshore wind and it s quite real just given the fact that we now have over 3 700 megawatts of wind farms that are due to become operational depending upon the project anywhere from 2024 to 2028 nuclear is wholly separate from that and we are greatly encouraged by the amount of attention being given to merchant plants in particular by president biden and his administration by bipartisan members of the house and the senate there is a component of the infrastructure build that right now allows for a grant program for nuclear and while that is by no means the preferred path for us just a mere fact that congress is recognizing the challenge of nuclear plants i think is important for the nation and could relieve some of the cost pressure on new jersey customers who are currently bearing the full burden of keeping our three units economically viable but i don t see that connected to offshore wind in any way jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst got it that is helpful i will leave it there thanks operator your next question comes from the line of shar pourreza with guggenheim partners shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst hey good morning guys can you just elaborate ralph on the impact of the ferc roe settlement with the bpu i mean do you anticipate that 0 12 to 0 10 to 0 12 of drag to be perpetual or are there offsets like capex go forwards or maybe the ability to raise the equity ratio at the distribution business o m levers how do we think about that ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes so the 0 10 to 0 12 is the all in effect of some of the improvements in the formula rate treatment some of the benefits realized from an earnings point of view of reducing the depreciation rate but it also includes the most obvious drag of lowering the allowed roe now a couple of things will happen by parts of changing the depreciation rate the rate base will decline more slowly so that s an improvement to earnings in the out years but having said that however though as you grow the rate base from new capex the lower roe is going to be a drag on earnings so we won t break it out in the future shar because there s no sense talking about what is no longer our roe but it will all be factored into any earnings guidance we give for 2022 and beyond shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst got it got it got you okay great and then just can you just give us some thoughts on how you see sort of the business trajectory post like the power sale just thinking of like how do you bridge the 6 5 to 8 utility rate base growth with the remaining moving pieces like nuclear and the holdings business offshore wind jv and do you sort of plan to provide longer term eps guidance post the sale at the analyst day so how do we sort of think about that ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes so we re hoping to get together late in september that s still our current thinking and we do anticipate being able to give multiyear earnings guidance and revisit our dividend policy at that point in time i think right now we give you 10 months of earnings guidance so multiyear may start out being three to five years i don t think it s going to it s certainly not going to be beyond that it s just so tough to predict longer term than that shar but really what we highlighted not that long ago is still in place we think after the sale we ll be close to 90 regulated now that could drop a little bit as we start adding offshore wind but that we expect to be fully contracted and so that was the 80 to 90 range that we had given in prior earnings calls and that s still in place we are determined to get a longer term treatment of our nuclear plants we ve said in a matter of fact that the three years that is untenable and we re delighted that new jersey gave us that to be able to enter into this more thoughtful discussion either at the federal level or if it has to be at the state level to expand that time frame but the utility growth trajectory has only been enhanced right its growth trajectory has always been supported by the fact that we have an aging infrastructure that can a not meet the needs of a customer base that is increasingly dependent on that infrastructure and b that infrastructure in addition to its age is confronting more intense weather patterns and storms so the need to replace that aging infrastructure inclusive of greater emphasis on the last mile as more and more people work from home is just equally if not growing in prominence and then we have the ability to add to that the carbon free agenda and the green agenda of new jersey which allows this whole opportunity of adding to the rate base on the customer side of the meter and as i said in the past it takes a lot of light bulbs to replace the transmission tower in terms of earnings power but they re equally important to the customer both from an energy efficiency point of view and a reliability point of view so i d say that the utility growth prospects remain intact if not are enhanced but what we continue to see in terms of climate change and the stress it puts on the infrastructure and the desire to battle that and the opportunity it creates on the customer side of the meter shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst so should we as we re thinking about the three to five year growth rate should we think about it as the rate base that you guide currently at the utility level and when offshore wind starts to become more material you kind of rebase that year higher and then grow off of that or as you re thinking about that three to five year growth rate are you going to revert back to your traditional to what you guide which is looking at your capex and probabilistic scenarios right and i guess the bookends of that growth rate off of the rate base growth would really be based on i guess the capex visibility you have right that would dictate a lot of on top of that is that the way to think about it ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer so i don t want to give that long term growth today but i think when you have to think about shar i mean we have given a five year cagr on rate base growth so that will form the template of how we think about our long term earnings growth so it would be the end of last year until we get to the new year and then it will build off of that now offshore wind is a little bit more difficult at this point in time obviously because we only have one project that s in the bank so to speak that s ocean wind one but we have lots of opportunities that are in the discussion phase and to your point yes we will still suffer from the fact that the capital program is not as well known in years four and five and that they embed a little bit of potential conservatism in the rate base growth which we ve tended to be able to make up for in the past and we ll think that through and give you further clarity about what we re assuming in terms of on file programs or continuation of programs when we meet with you in september but we ll make that abundantly clear in how the earnings growth has been what s being assumed in it shar pourreza guggenheim partners analyst perfect thank you for that ralph i will leave it thanks operator your next question comes from the line of julien dumoulin smith with bank of america julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst hey good morning everyone thanks for taking the time i appreciate it if i can so i want to come back to the guidance increase just on 21 here i just wanted to understand a little bit more of the confidence and the confidence in raising now with second quarter i mean obviously the roe impact is known but you also have a solar and fossil headwind obviously not fully reflected in expectations here just what gave you the confidence to raise it at this point it s notable daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer julien i think it s a couple of things first off we have solar that has been sold and that was in what we had going forward and as we sit here today what we have still assumes that fossil continues on so that s more status quo than anything else the other thing that i would that i think is probably worth mentioning though is just the if you think about the utility if you think about on the electric side that sip program which has a leveling effect is in effect for electric in june it s in effect in october for gas and if you think about going through the summer period gas usage is low during that period so that will take some volatility out of the balance of the year from those perspectives and so just seeing where we are with the events that we know and with the effect of some volatility reducing aspects of the sip i think that it made sense right now to do what we did do and we ll see what happens from here julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst excellent and perhaps i can preference that i know the rating agencies are already acting in some respects but can you elaborate on the increased flexibility right i know you used that word very specifically here as you mentioned the topic at the analyst day what kind of financial metrics are you thinking about with respect to your balance sheet on a prospective basis perhaps pro forma for your strategic repositioning daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes look i think embedded within your question is an acknowledgment that as we step forward the company will have a more stable business mix on top of the aspect that i just talked about with respect to the sip having a stabilizing effect i think analyst day is the right time to put that out but if you think about just that change in business mix is going to put us in a position where we have some more flexibility so i think for more details on that stay tuned but i think the direction of it is obviously favorable given the business mix julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst but just to clarify this should we still broadly be thinking about use of proceeds is it entirely toward debt paydown 2 daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer no i mean what we said is that use of proceeds certainly would go toward power s debt paydown you ve seen some of that happen already but also the continued ability to invest in the business if you think about investment opportunities that ralph just talked about with respect to pse g and certainly within some of the out years as well as offshore wind and the potential for a return of capital to shareholders so those are the buckets that we ve talked about and probably with respect to the first use i would think about the power debt being taken out julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst got it understood i appreciate it but so buyback dividend and capex are all there ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes you were nodding your head dan but they couldn t see that julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst okay alright there you go i like the nonverbal cue i will leave it there thank you guys and best of luck in the preparation ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thanks julien operator your next question comes from the line of durgesh chopra with evercore isi durgesh chopra evercore isi analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my question dan just quickly on 2021 can you quantify how much benefit was weather in the second quarter i m just trying to reconcile your move up in guidance given sort of the roe headwinds and the combination of other things including sort of demand recovery load recovery year over year daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we didn t have a 0 01 provided on weather but modest it s kind of in a 0 01 or 0 02 down across the businesses durgesh chopra evercore isi analyst got it okay so small and then just maybe all my questions have been answered but ralph is there a way to size the transmission investment like what could be the upside i mean you have a what 16 billion five year capex plan toward the high end of your range but what could be a potential upside from all the transmission investment in new jersey ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes no i m glad you asked that question right because what we have been telling folks is that we expect it to be a nine figure investment opportunity but i think we ve understated it looking at the breadth of what new jersey wants to see happen we may need to add a zero to that that does look like a more of a 10 figure investment opportunity at this point durgesh chopra evercore isi analyst got it so very large and presumably sort of worth structure ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes it s a lot of infrastructure durgesh chopra evercore isi analyst right and over sort of a five 10 year timeline is that the right way to think about it i appreciate all leanings but ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes no i think that that s right because it s supposed to be if new jersey goes ahead with it the intent is to be able to manage the 2035 target of 7 5 gigawatts but it s not necessarily all going to be regulated right some of the on land stuff probably will be but the components that are landing sites onshore and the backbone out in the ocean and the pieces that are connected to the ocean more than likely would be unregulated but supported by a contract or a board order daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer and durgesh the nature of it we talked a little bit about it in the prepared remarks there s a lot of options as to what actually can end up coming forward and so i think what you re likely to see is a submission that would include multiple alternatives that some may or may not be mutually exclusive depending upon the way that the decision is ultimately made so you may see kind of a bigger number going forward from the standpoint of all alternatives which may distill down to a smaller number that we end up getting now it all obviously would end up being ferc regulated but you may not see that embedded within our pse g regulated entity durgesh chopra evercore isi analyst understood thanks guys we will be closely watching operator your next question comes from the line of jonathan arnold with vertical research jonathan arnold vertical research analyst hi good morning guys just quickly on ocean wind to your potential interest in becoming involved there any sense of how soon we might learn about that are you already talking about it or anything you can share there ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes i don t think we want to get into details on that jonathan i mean we have a range of conversations across several projects that are in the mid atlantic region underway with orsted and i think that s probably as far as i want to go i do want to make sure that we that dan s comment a second ago is best addressed right so when we say it s not regularly what we mean is it s not going to be part of the transmission it s not going to part of pse g but all transmission is ferc regulated so we d still give that kind of treatment but in terms of ocean wind 2 it is obviously safe to conclude that we will have some conversations with orsted about that as well as some other opportunities in the region jonathan arnold vertical research analyst all right and just on you said that you re hoping to announce the have things to tell us in i think the very near future on fossil in the analyst day still targeting september but you did it does look like you put first quarter of 22 sort of in the official statement on when we might when closing might happen so can you just close the loop for us there a little bit did things shift back a bit or ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer happy to look so from my perspective we ve been running a 12 month process that s been phenomenally successful it s been extremely robust and i just don t want to sacrifice value for an arbitrary deadline so we think in the near future we ll be able to give you more detail and we re still holding out for end of september analyst day but i m not going to sacrifice value for as i said an arbitrary deadline the q1 of 22 is just if you look at ferc approval time frames for similar sized deals in terms of when things were filed and when ferc finally blessed and you tack it on to where we are at the moment that it could bleed into next year is what we re saying it could still happen by the end of this year but it could also just look at the range of dates leading to next year again i think the process has been incredibly robust and i don t want to diminish how well it s gone by just forcing an expedited closing of the final stages daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer and just as ralph mentioned jonathan so i mean the initial announcement was this time last year so when he talks about 12 months we literally are to the event at least if not for the exact day at 12 months and that ferc process does not have a firm timeline on it and so that s as we think about timing it s a little bit of an uncertain target that s an approximate time frame i believe jonathan arnold vertical research analyst i was just curious because it looks like a slight change in language but that s great thank you dan i ll just ask one other quick thing on the cip and implementing that does that have because i guess that sort of would pull out any over or underperformance on weather through the balance of the year does it help or hurt you relative to guidance having the cip sort of come into effect i realize it makes it less volatile going forward but i m just curious as you sort of pull out the what you had in the base daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes honestly jonathan it will depend a little bit upon what the weather and the economic activity is right we will be back to a more neutralized outcome and as you mentioned embedded within your question there s more stability to that but i think it s probably a question better answered as we get to our year end call than where it is now jonathan arnold vertical research analyst i thought it might be a question of what weather was because that was which you ll then as we think about sort of year to year comps that will fall away and then it becomes normal right daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean we would be thinking about it prospectively as being normal so i don t think there d be a strong bias one way or the other jonathan arnold vertical research analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of michael lapides with goldman sachs michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hey guys a couple of questions thank you for taking them first one just need a little help here the net revenue change tied to the ferc roe adjustment is 100 million if i back out the 42 million i m just struggling to get to how it s only 0 10 to 0 12 of an impact would think just that 100 million tax effect is a bigger impact than 0 10 to 0 12 daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer i m sorry michael say again michael lapides goldman sachs analyst well i m just the total revenue reduction is 142 million but there s a 42 million reduction in d a so kind of down to the ebit line or operating income line it s a 100 million adjustment that just if that tax affected that that would imply a bigger impact than the cents per share you ve disclosed when you first announced it can you just help me bridge the gap there daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes yes michael if you think about the other things that we kind of talked about within the overall settlement so the way we ve described it to some folks the probably the easiest thing to think about is just if we spend 1 on g a the imperfected timing groove of state and federal regulation might have us receiving 0 49 back from state and 0 49 back from federal and so there s not full recovery and so it seemed like the right time as we were talking through all this to be able to just make sure that we were able to recover all costs and so something like that that would get us back and my example that 0 02 of that dollar is additive as well and so it s that kind of thing that went into the overall settlement which helped a little bit beyond just the headline math of roe delta times rate base amount so those kind of things around the edges that were a little bit helpful that we cleaned up as we went through as well michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it and then ralph just a question for you and this is thinking multiyears out and really long term what is a better business from a risk profile and return standpoint owning minority stakes in offshore winds the generating facility itself or owning and developing and building either contracted or ferc regulated transmission to serve that wind ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well it depends on the skill sets that you contain right so for us it s clearly the transmission component but we re fortunate to have a partner that s the world leader in operating those offshore windfarms so by virtue of that skill set that we can candidly lean on we re economically indifferent in that regard but it s pretty clear we ve not been shy about it in the case of building the wind farms we re the passenger on the bus but we have a very good bus driver that we trust and in the case of the transmission we re more than happy to be the best driver but in both cases we look at risk adjusted returns and the risk component is a function of what are the skill sets that you have or that your partner has michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it and can you remind me just the we re in an environment right now where a hot topic for conversation is inflation especially on commodity cost inputs if the price or the cost to build the offshore wind plant rises above kind of the original expectation how does that get shared between you and orsted ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well so the projects are shared according to our equity percentages right so you re 25 owner of the project they re 75 owner of the project and that s what the benefits or burdens would be going forward michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you for your help much appreciated operator your next question comes from the line of paul patterson with glenrock associates paul patterson glenrock associates analyst hey good morning so just on the asset sale could you with the write down and everything where is the book value or the asset value on the books of the fossil portfolio at this point daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so we ve laid out within our sec docs paul that fossil asset value is about 4 5 billion paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and then just on the transmission build out which you guys went over and it sounds like a great opportunity with offshore wind and everything but how would it work i mean it sounds like it s competitive would there be afudc if you guys were to win a substantial portion of that would that be would there be afudc that would be associated with the construction of that or would it basically be the situation where you get the earnings impact when the project is complete daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer no there is the ability for an afudc recovery loan paul patterson glenrock associates analyst there is okay and then just finally to sort of you mentioned that any component can be bid on but it would seem to me that how would that work i guess if there was sort of a comprehensive bid somebody dig into this scale like you can do a comprehensive bid is it really the ability of somebody to say hey there s a substation or something i want to i want to build how could somebody sort of modularize it if you follow what i m saying is that really a possibility that you would have a project that would be put out there but they would say well we ll take part of your project and split it up or really would it be pretty much do you follow what i m saying ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i do i do and actually that s been done successfully in the past paul if you think about third quarter 1 000 solicitations replaced called the artificial island project we re basically we were given part of the project and someone else was given another part of the project that were considered complementary to each other and mutually reinforcing of the voltage and stability issue that was trying to be resolved i do think your question points in a direction that i would agree with that it is probably easier to optimize the whole by putting in all four components and a specialist that just wants to do one component may or may not fit as naturally into the other components but they could have just such a low cost solution on land or out in the ocean that that pjm figures out a way to ensure the technical requirements of the project are achieved and then leaves it to the bp units whether or not they want to have bifurcated ownership of what will become an offshore wind grid paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay great thanks so much operator ladies and gentlemen that is all the time we have for questions and now i will turn the call back over to management for closing remarks ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer great thank you so look i hope you agree we ve made tremendous progress on multiple fronts operational regulatory and legislative i m particularly optimistic and encouraged by the amount of federal attention being given to a nuclear production tax credit and the clearing of the deck so to speak of some of our own state issues that are now behind us both in terms of the roe settlement and the second round of zecs we re going to continue to make progress i m sure on the fossil asset sale to get us to that fully regulated or contracted position that we have targeted for the better part of the year and we re looking forward to speaking with many of you at some of the upcoming virtual conferences over the next several weeks and our investor day in the fall so with that stay safe stay healthy and thank you for joining us everyone operator duration 64 minutes call participants carlotta n chan ice president of

financial officer thank you kian good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for pioneer s second quarter earnings call today we will be discussing pioneer s strong second quarter results and our enhanced return of capital strategy we will also present our continued strong execution underpinning our low reinvestment rate and best in class breakeven oil price this is all accomplished while maintaining our focus on safe operations and environmental stewardship in the field after that we will open up the call for your questions with that i ll turn it over to scott scott d sheffield chief executive officer thank you neal good morning obviously we re very excited after talking about it for 18 months to announce that we are both accelerating our first variable dividend payment into the third quarter this year as well as increasing the payment to reflect 75 of second quarter free cash flow after payment of the base dividend as our balance sheet continues to strengthen due to higher strip pricing as a result of improved oil demand and a successful vaccine in addition we had two highly accretive transactions that also led us to making this decision and accelerating when combined with the base dividend total dividend payments in the third quarter will be greater than 2 per share or a total of approximately 490 million return to shareholders during the third quarter alone the initiation of our variable dividend payments marks a significant milestone in our investment framework as shareholders will begin receiving material cash return through eight dividend checks per year pioneer s strong execution continued during the second quarter with production near the top end of guidance delivering over 600 million of free cash flow driving estimated 2021 free cash flow up to about 3 2 billion lastly pioneer is the largest producer in the permian with the largest inventory of tier one locations over 15 000 and the lowest breakeven price in the lower 48 both recent acquisitions were highly accretive and added significant tier one inventory we were not looking at any more midland basin large acquisitions we bought the best two available apollo who was the largest shareholder from doublepoint our largest shareholder from doublepoint has sold out from 13 million shares to about two million shares and now less than 1 of the outstanding of the company going to slide four pioneer s execution remains strong as total production and oil production were in the upper half of our guidance ranges as we successfully integrated doublepoint s operations into our program horizontal lease operating expense dropped by nearly 0 25 per boe when compared to the first quarter in total pioneer generated approximately 1 billion in free cash flow in the first half of 21 we go on to slide five our strong balance sheet underpinned by improved oil price outlook supports both the acceleration and increase of our inaugural variable dividend the first variable dividend will be paid during the third quarter and accelerated from 22 will be based on second quarter free cash flow additionally we are increasing the third quarter variable dividend payment to 75 post base dividend free cash flow from the previous 50 the increase up to 75 in our variable dividend program is approximately 18 months sooner than previously planned these changes result in over 1 billion of incremental cash to be returned to shareholders in 2021 with total dividends to exceed 6 per share on slide six we remain committed to our core investment thesis predicated on low leverage strong corporate returns to average over the next five years in the mid teens low investment rate around 50 over the next five years and generating significant free cash flow this durable combination creates significant value for our shareholders delivering a mid teens total return through our stable and growing base dividend compelling variable dividend program and high return oil growth up to 5 obviously when you look at 2022 the turn on return is much higher because the oil strip over the next five years is about 10 in backwardation when including the base dividend approximately 80 of the company s free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders through eight separate dividend checks per year inclusive of both the base and the variable dividend we will continue to maintain our pristine balance sheet as we allocate the remaining portion of free cash flow to the balance sheet going to slide seven as you can see on slide seven the product of pioneer s high quality assets and top tier capital efficiency drive significant free cash flow generation amounting to greater than 23 billion through 2026 again i want to remind you that the strip is in backwardation it drops about 10 in backwardation over the next five years let s get into free cash flow which is based on current strip pricing represents greater than 50 of our enterprise value and more than 65 of our market cap considering the greater than 23 billion of cumulative free cash flow this program generates over 18 billion of total dividends through 2026 with the remaining free cash flow allocated toward strengthening our balance sheet driving net debt to ebitda to less than 0 5 going to slide eight positioning a leading dividend yield across all sectors the combination of pioneer s expected free cash flow and return on capital framework creates a compelling investment opportunity with a total dividend yield that will exceed all s p 500 sectors as well as companies and the average yield of the major oil companies and all other energy companies in the s p 500 annualized expected dividends paid in the second half of 2021 leads to a dividend yield of approximately 8 which increases 22 to 26 time period to an average greater than 9 due significant free cash flow again when you look at you just focus on 22 the dividend yield is about 12 again a reminder the strip with these numbers is about 10 in backwardation this highly competitive yield is underpinned by the greater than 18 billion of cumulative cash returned to shareholders outlined on the previous slide and speaks to the power and underlying quality of pioneer s assets let me turn it over to rich for the outlook richard p dealy president and chief operating officer great thanks scott and good morning before i start to the slide i just wanted to give a special thanks to our entire pioneer team including all the great people that came over from the parsley and doublepoint transactions for the excellent job they ve done in integrating both transactions this year while we have a few small items left on doublepoint the teams have worked extremely hard and have done a tremendous job and seamlessly integrating these operations in a very short period of time so thank you to all those that are listening turning to and looking at slide nine you can see on the slide here there s no change to our full year oil production guidance range of 351 000 to 366 000 barrels of oil per day and total production of 605 000 to 631 000 boes per day similarly on capital it s unchanged at 2 95 billion to 3 25 billion but we are seeing some inflationary pressure although most of it is being offset by our efficiency improvements by the great work power of drilling and completions and facilities teams looking at cash flow you can see with the increase in commodity prices our forecasted operating cash flow has increased to 6 45 billion and free cash flows increased to 3 2 billion that scott talked about both of those are up 500 million from what we forecasted in our may call related to q1 earnings turning to slide 10 our plan remains unchanged and is set to average between 22 and 24 drilling rigs for the full year we are currently running 24 rigs and eight frac fleets in the midland basin in terms of our delaware plans we are moving multiple rigs into the delaware basin this quarter and the team is looking forward to bringing the same efficiency gains that we ve achieved in the midland basin to the delaware with the goal of further improving well returns especially given the higher oil cut and lower royalty burden in our delaware acreage just for reference the delaware production was 70 oil during q2 as you can see here with over one million acres in the permian basin we have a significant inventory so we will continue to evaluate opportunities to monetize portions of our longer dated inventory as we ve done in the past these monetization opportunities will include small noncore acreage packages as well as evaluating other drillco opportunities turning to slide 11 and talk about synergies you can see here from the slide that we have realized 275 million synergy target related to g a in interest and on both the parsley and doublepoint transactions on the operational synergies we ve made great progress with over 50 of the target synergies being identified and being incorporated into future plans for instance we have leveraged our supplier relationships we re seeing savings on pressure pumping wirelines cement casing among other items joey will talk more about it we ve successfully tested our simul frac and have incorporated a second simul frac fleet into our program which benefits mainly pioneer partially in doublepoint acreage given our leveraging our significant water system that we have across the midland basin the teams are also continuing to optimize future development plans to take advantage of existing facilities and infrastructure including tank batteries water disposal reuse facilities just to name a few obviously this reduces the need for future new builds and lastly just as examples which is significant the team has identified over 1 000 locations that we can drill additional 15 000 foot laterals across our contiguous acreage position that are being incorporated into our future development plans providing significant improvement in capital efficiency going forward why don t i stop there and i ll turn it to neal neal h shah senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you rich on slide 12 you ll see pioneer s high quality asset base which yields a peer leading oil percent that drives our high margin barrels positioning pioneer as the only e p among our peers to realize a corporate breakeven below 30 a barrel wti this peer leading oil mix combined with our unparalleled breakeven oil price in the high 20s not only underpins our operational and financial strength it enables pioneer s low reinvestment rate and drive significant and durable free cash flow and return of capital to shareholders well into the future with that i ll turn it over to joey to discuss our strong operations j d hall executive vice president operations thanks neal and good morning to everybody i m going to be starting on slide 13 where our drilling and completions teams have continued their continuous improvement journey as you can see since 2017 these two teams have seen more than 75 improvement in their completed feet per day and more than 65 improvement in their drill feet per day this journey is even more impressive when considering our increased activity levels including the integration of parsley and doublepoint as rich mentioned we ve also seen the continued success of our simul frac operations consequently we re in the process of starting up our second simul frac fleet our capital projects and production operations teams are working diligently to upgrade partially in doublepoint facilities to our operational and environmental standards and our teams are progressing our esg initiatives by trialing new low carbon technologies to power our operations as in the past we re only noting the improvements in drilling and completions but i want to emphasize that we continue to see tremendous performance in our production operations construction and water management teams and as always none of this will be possible without the great effort from our development planning team our robust supply chain and other groups that support our operations we continue to remain focused on keeping our employees and contractor partners safe delivering peer leading performance and reducing our environmental footprint congrats to the entire pioneer team for our safe and efficient execution in q2 i m now going to move to slide 14 here you can see the results of pioneer s long standing commitment to meeting high environmental standards by our top tier flaring intensity and best in class co2 intensity compared to u s peers and majors this was only made possible through years of thoughtful planning and investments to minimize our emissions at our facilities coupled with our comprehensive leak detection and repair program which includes routine aerial surveys despite our leadership position pioneer s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 25 and methane emissions intensity by 40 through 2030 demonstrates our commitment to further increasing our environmental standards and now moving to slide 15 and continuing the storyline from the previous slide pioneer also produces extremely low emission intensity oil on a global scale this combined with our low breakeven results and exceptionally resilient production that we expect will have a place in the global marketplace for a very long time and with that i ll turn it back over to scott to wrap things up scott d sheffield chief executive officer thank you joey on slide 16 pioneer continues to hold all pillars of esg of great importance i think one of the most important points with the recent rystad report the permian basin has declined over the last 18 months as we ve been talking about it from about 1 billion a day to less than 200 million a day in regard to flaring so people are focused on reducing flaring to less than 1 for most oil companies we continue the biggest flares continue to be the private companies in the permian and we need to continue to ask you in regard to if you find your private equity we got to put pressure on the private companies in the permian basin we continue to promote a diverse workforce which reflects the community in which we live and work as you can see when you look at our top 15 individuals that run the company we re at 47 lastly we would like to welcome lori billingsley to our board of directors lori is an officer of d i with coca cola we re very excited to have her experience and her leadership play a pivotal role in navigating the changing global energy landscape our 2021 sustainability report is scheduled for release in the third quarter which will include pioneer s progress on the environmental targets outlined in the left portion of the slide and finally on slide 17 pioneer is committed to driving all of these values for our shareholders now we ll open it up for q a questions and answers operator we ll now take the first question from neil mehta from goldman sachs neil mehta goldman analyst yes thank you very much i appreciate the time and congratulations to you guys in introducing this variable or accelerating the introduction of the variable contracts that you ve been talking about i guess the first question is just can you give us a sense of how you re going to plan on updating the market around the variable dividend is this something that we should expect on a quarterly basis on a go forward and then also just talk about as you look forward the right payout ratio do you see the potential for this variable dividend payout to continue to move higher over time scott d sheffield chief executive officer yes neil thanks for the opening comments the as you know at the bottom of our slides everything including the base is subject to board approval but our long term intention is to pay up to 75 of free cash flow every quarter for the next several years that s how we re running our business with the number of locations that we have we have over 15 000 locations we re drilling roughly about probably around 500 a year so we have probably the largest inventory of anybody out there so we can go on and produce 5 growth and deliver strong yields for the next several years so it should be the go to energy stock if you re focused on dividends we re focused on dividends primarily it was because of the feedback when we talked to all of our shareholders back over the last 18 months that was the focus feedback that we got they really don t want buybacks if they want to take the dividends and buy back our stock they can do that they want the ability to invest the dividends in any stock they want to was the feedback that we got so that s why we re focused and we have the greatest payout up to 75 so the variability obviously will be commodity price one of the feedbacks we will ask for we do not plan to do any hedging in regard to the variable dividend if we do any hedging it will be at the very very low end it will be to protect the capital budget and balance sheet if shareholders want us to protect the variable dividend they ll have to give us that feedback in regard to hedging i ll stop there neil mehta goldman analyst and it sounds like we ll get an update on the quarterly on the variable dividend on a quarterly basis going forward scott d sheffield chief executive officer yes neil mehta goldman analyst and then the follow up is just around m a so two questions around this one is can you provide a little bit more color in addition to what you provided in the slides here about capturing the synergies associated with the doublepoint transaction and just in general do you view this as a buyer buyers or a seller s market as it relates to a d at this point in other words are you at the point as pioneer given the inventory that you re really going to work on your existing asset base as opposed to pursuing incremental transactions for you richard p dealy president and chief operating officer yes neil it s rich our focus is really on executing our program related to the parsley and doublepoint transactions along with the base pioneer on the synergies i think as i mentioned we ve captured the g a and interest we re focused on the operational side and have identified over 50 of those that we re focused on incorporating into our plan including simul frac that joey talked about the longer laterals integration of our facilities capital that and using that integration capital that we spent to prior spending to upgrade the facilities related to parsley and doublepoint to our high operational standards and you ll see that when you see our sustainability report come out some of the dollars we ve got high standards that we want to adhere to and you re going to see that in our sustainability report and so those dollars are being spent to accomplish those activities scott d sheffield chief executive officer and on your second question neil the as i said we had two became available parsley and doublepoint they were the best opportunities they had great tier one inventory we bought them and there was nothing available at the current time and i don t anticipate anything becoming available so there s no need for us to look at other opportunities at this point in time neil mehta goldman analyst terrific thanks guys operator we will now take the next question from john freeman from raymond james john freeman raymond james analyst good morning guys scott d sheffield chief executive officer hi john richard p dealy president and chief operating officer hi john john freeman raymond james analyst it s great to see we have the variable dividend paid well ahead of schedule and obviously the mechanics of that variable dividend payout you lave laid out really well i m trying to get a sense though on when i look at the base dividend sort of how the mechanics the way the thought process works on the base dividend side of things i know scott in the past you ve talked about that long term plan assumes kind of roughly like a 2 to 3 per year kind of average increase in the base dividend so if the variable dividend as i ve said in the past the main sort of toggle there is the commodity price is the base dividend is it mainly just sort of linked to the balance sheet as leverage goes lower that gives you the ability to raise that just any additional color on the base dividend scott d sheffield chief executive officer yes on the base we re still building in just as you said that 2 to 3 increase in the base that s still subject to board approval but that s our intention is on an annual basis over the next five years to increase the base so as we increase the base keeping the strip the same it reduces the variable a little bit john freeman raymond james analyst got it and then just my other question is there any update yet on the delaware we ve got the one rig there and we re starting to drill those initial wells that area looks to try to compete for some capital just any updates on what you re seeing in the delaware on the early results richard p dealy president and chief operating officer yes john we re just getting started we re just this quarter we re putting our first rigs over there and so we ll have more data into this year or into next year on performance but we fully expect to bring the operational benefits that we ve seen in the midland basin to the delaware basin we re excited to get started over there but it s just early at this point so i don t really have any results yet to share until probably early 2022 john freeman raymond james analyst got it thanks guys congratulations richard p dealy president and chief operating officer thanks operator we can now take the next question from derrick whitfield from stifel derrick whitfield stifel analyst good morning all and congrats on your quarter and variable dividend update with my first question i wanted to focus on ops perhaps for joey are there any practical limitations that can limit your deployment of simul frac ops programwide j d hall executive vice president operations yes one of the questions i get quite often because of the great success we ve seen on simul frac is why not convert all of our fleets to simul frac and there s a couple of things that limit that one is logistics particularly around water because we basically doubled the water requirements in one area if all of our frac fleets were working under simul frac operations we d have to spend a significant amount of capital to upgrade our water systems and of course logistics around the sand as well but the other maybe more trivial matter is also the number of wells on the pad if you have an odd number of wells on the pad it can have a slight impact on the efficiency but primarily we want to make sure that we re efficiently deploying capital and we re getting the bang for the buck so water logistics is probably the single most impactful thing that we look at to deploying simul frac derrick whitfield stifel analyst understood and staying on ops with my follow up question referencing slide 10 in your prepared comments on lateral lengths i wanted to ask you a 2022 activity question as you guys internally prepare for 2022 from a permitting and infrastructure perspective are there any broad activity outlines you could share with us on average pad size and lateral lengths that are possible for 2022 richard p dealy president and chief operating officer yes i think as we ve talked about in the past as we talk about that pad size of basically four wells per pad on average four this year i think that s going to be fairly consistent for 2022 and then when we talk about longer laterals we re still in the midst of developing the exact locations for 2022 and how many of the longer laterals we ll drill but it will be definitely a bigger part of our portfolio in 22 than what has been in the past and in 21 as we ve looked then obviously the capital efficiency drilling longer laterals continues to improve so it s probably an overall on 15 000 foot laterals on a drilling and completions per foot basis 15 plus percent cost savings on an average per foot basis derrick whitfield stifel analyst all right great update and thanks again for your time richard p dealy president and chief operating officer sure operator we can now take the next question from doug leggate from bank of america doug leggate bank of america analyst thanks good morning everybody thanks for taking my question scott i ve got 2 i think they re probably more for you and i guess the first one is on both related to m a there s obviously been some a little bit of criticism over the price of the dp acquisition obviously all stock means your share price given where it is today you have an opportunity to reset the acquisition cost by buying in some of your shares now i understand the variable dividend policy so i m just curious if that ever occurred to management or the opportunity that s been given by this overhang that you clarified your the implied acquisition price is a lot cheaper today if you like and you have a chance to lower that cost by buying in your stock why not scott d sheffield chief executive officer yes doug first of all i think the market totally misunderstood the doublepoint transaction when you look at unproved property and each of you all can do that on our balance sheet we paid the same exact same price as we paid for parsley it s in the low 20 000 per acre so anybody that s criticizing us for paying 40 000 per acre had no idea what they re talking about secondly it was a great transaction in regard to buybacks i m listening to the shareholder base as we drive our debt to ebitda below 1 i ve stated already in prior conference calls that the we will definitely be subject to board approval we ll be buying back stock when we see dislocations so i m a firm believer when we re at the bottoms of the markets like we saw last year i want to have one of the best balance sheets so i can buy a lot of stock at 50 and so i think buying it at today s price i think i d rather distribute all of our cash flow 75 or 80 of it back to the investor so i sort of agree with you but at the same time i d rather save my firepower if we see i hope we don t see dislocations like we saw last year in the marketplace i ve got more confidence in what opec is doing and creating stability less volatility than we ve seen in the last five years over the next five years based on what s happening what s happening with u s shale and other places around the world so that s how we re thinking today doug leggate bank of america analyst okay i appreciate that answer we can take the acreage mark offline i think that s the output rather than the input but i completely agree with you my follow up scott is a little bit more of an obtuse question the cimarex cabot s 4 came out and appeared at least if we join the dots to suggest that pioneer had taken a hard look at cabot so in light of everything that you ve said about the two best opportunities being parsley and doublepoint i wonder if you could help understand the thinking that might have gone into that and you were drilling yourself out of the possible shale packages for sale in new delaware scott d sheffield chief executive officer yes during the extreme downturn we had a lot of discussions with a lot of different ceos obviously just like exxon and chevron did at the top and so we don t comment on specific opportunities but we were looking at parsley early on and continued to look at parsley all during last summer so we are 100 focused on the permian basin and probably 99 9 focused obviously on the midland basin so that s where our focus lies doug leggate bank of america analyst all right thanks for trying to answer the question appreciate it operator we can now take the next question from charles meade from johnson rice we can now take the next question from scott hanold from rbc capital markets scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst yes thanks congrats on the quarter i m going to ask a question maybe a little bit more again back to the hedging and your strategy there and certainly i have to commend you for your effort to listen to investors and then appropriately adjust your business model but what feedback have you been getting from investors to this point on hedging and has that determined the path you re moving forward at this point in time scott d sheffield chief executive officer yes we have due to what s happened with covid 19 and the ability to travel we re just now going to start getting out over the next few weeks and talk with several shareholders obviously the conferences it s sort of hard to get feedback during those virtual conferences we like to do it in one on one meetings so you re going to see the pioneer team over the next eight to 10 weeks travel throughout the u s and talking to shareholders so at this point i ll have to reserve the feedback on what they give us in regard to hedging in regard to the variable dividend so probably it s a good question for us in november to ask scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst okay so this is still a developing sort of thought process going forward because i guess the point i would make is that certainly with your 23 billion of free cash flow outlook and obviously i think you ve stated a pretty strong return to shareholder plan with that to a certain extent obviously that s underpinned by operations but also the current commodity price and so obviously we know oil is volatile it looks good now but like the thought process like why put that the 23 billion of free cash flow at risk when you can lock some of that in but it sounds like that s something that you all need to evaluate a little bit further with shareholders is that sort of right scott d sheffield chief executive officer yes that s right and that s because it s totally changed we used to spend every dollar to drill a well it would protect the capital budget primarily and now we re the free cash flow essentially all most of it all goes back to the shareholder base so we re going to visit with our shareholders to get feedback so there probably won t be consensus above them but it is something that we ve done historically is get shareholder feedback and develop our long term policies scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst absolutely look forward to it thank you operator we can now take the next question from charles meade from johnson rice charles meade johnson rice analyst good morning scott and team am i live this time scott d sheffield chief executive officer yes it working sorry about last charles meade johnson rice analyst not sure would happen but anyway scott i apologize i had time for belaboring this a d question but in your prepared comments i believe i heard you say we re not looking at any other big midland basin acquisitions and i think so i guess literally you might think oh well are you guys looking to tack on in the delaware basin but maybe the right way to think about it is it really you re at your core are a midland basin company and so you really the way to interpret that is that you really just focus on the midland basin as the future of pioneer so how should we interpret that scott d sheffield chief executive officer well it s 95 of our company in our locations is the midland basin so that s why i say that the delaware as rich said we re focused on drilling wells we re moving in several rigs we re averaging one rig but we re moving in more than one rig for a short time frame and we need to develop our own economics the returns at today s price look tremendous in the delaware also and so where higher oil prices go the delaware is close to being equal with the midland basin so this inventory moves up significantly in the 60 70 range versus the 40 to 50 range so we re just focused on our current asset base and try to get every dollar back to the shareholder is where we re focused on both the delaware and the midland basin we are continuing to do trades i think rich may have mentioned that we re doing drill code two on our tier two properties we ll continue to look at small divestitures so there could be some small opportunities on the small side but it s insignificant and doesn t affect free cash flow and that s where the focus is charles meade johnson rice analyst got it and then scott i wondered if you could offer your more kind of maybe macro thoughts but maybe not so much on price but what do you think the world is expecting to see in terms of volume growth from u s onshore in 22 and what do you think they re likely to get versus those expectations scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst most of the numbers i look at eia has the highest numbers they re at 11 85 i think they re way too high most of the other tanks that i look at they re around 11 5 that s probably more realistic but i m still looking at about a 5 growth in the permian and most other basins will be flat to declining and when you put all that together we ll be lucky to grow 5 a year over the next several years in the u s lower 48 that s my general opinion and i think as more companies deliver their free cash flow model they can t change it so just like diamondback committed to 50 the cabot cimarex merger is committed to 50 devon was committed to 50 so more and more companies whether they commit to 50 or 75 they re not going to change and so i m getting more comfortable with the fact they re just not going to grow that much u s shale which helps we can now take the next question from scott gruber from citigroup scott d sheffield chief executive officer no a dislocation is what happened last year or in late 2014 that s what i call dislocations when and we want to have the best balance sheet so our debt to ebitda gets below 0 5 in 2023 so as it gets down to below 0 5 then we ll have the firepower when we see a dislocation i m talking about a major dislocation i d rather buy shares all day long at 50 instead of using firepower to buy shares at 140 or 150 million i d rather not risk the balance sheet and distribute 80 of our free cash flow back to the investor so that s the plan scott gruber citigroup analyst got it and then just turning back to us just given the efficiency gains that you guys are seeing in potential future gains as you roll out simul frac and the 15k laterals what is the rig count and frac crude count that we should be thinking about for pioneer to maintain a 5 growth rate in 22 and then thinking about the inflation that s percolating up through the industry today how much of the underlying industry inflation do you think you ll be able to offset with efficiency gains around these initiatives next year based on what you re seeing today richard p dealy president and chief operating officer yes scott it s rich on the just longer term growth plans like we ve talked about before i mean to accomplish the 5 growth as you got one to two rigs that we would add drilling rigs per year to accomplish that and so that s really how i would from a modeling perspective look at it going forward on inflation we are seeing some pressure and fortunately our efficiency improvements and our long term contracts have dampened that but overall we re seeing it in tubulars diesel cement chemicals but we re also starting to see a little bit in labor as well and so for this year we re projecting what i d call in the mid single digits of inflation most of which were offsetting with efficiencies but in the back half of this year we do expect that to grow to about 10 and so that s something that we ll have to look at in 2022 of where do we see inflation versus what efficiency gains we ve been able to capture this year so we re still going to be highly focused on getting efficiency gains but i do think inflation is going to play a part in our 22 capital budget scott gruber citigroup analyst got it appreciate it thank you richard p dealy president and chief operating officer you re welcome operator we can now take the next question from david heikkinen from pickering energy partners david heikkinen pickering energy analyst good morning guys and thank you for taking the question as i thought through the acquisition and you all really helping clean up the permian can you provide what parsley s flaring intensity was relative to where you ve been at the lowest and same thing for doublepoint just trying to put it into a percent quantify how big an impact the moves you re making in the second and third quarter will impact their flaring and then their venting richard p dealy president and chief operating officer yes david i don t have the exact numbers but we can get them for you but they are definitely coming down and making progress they were higher than where pioneers were but i don t have to i can t remember the exact numbers but like i said we can get them for you but definitely the capital that we re from an integration standpoint and improving their facilities is a big focus and a big focus on those continuing to lower our emissions footprint so it s definitely something that we re spending capital on scott d sheffield chief executive officer and david this is scott if you look at rystad we were down to 0 1 before the two acquisitions now we re about half of 0 5 and so we re like six in the permian basin our goal is to get back to being one so that s when you look at the rystad report you can get a better feel if you look at them on a quarterly basis david heikkinen pickering energy analyst that will be in your updated sustainability report too so that will be helpful did you quantify the barrels of like do you have some curtailment as you do the pneumatics and you do the vrus maybe i missed the third quarter like what amount of curtailment did you have i was just trying to dial in an exact number of kind of that this cleanup work that you all are doing richard p dealy president and chief operating officer yes dave i don t have the exact numbers on that what i d tell you is our q3 guidance is right where we expected it to be and so and it takes into account our focus on being capital efficient and making sure that our we re not overspending capital on facilities and choking back wells so we still as we ve talked about in the past have agreed the choke wells to be capital efficient and therefore we have lower ip rates and flatter declines but also it takes into account this integration capital that we re spending to upgrade the parsley and doublepoint facilities and the time that those are down so it factors all that in and so really no change to what we ve forecasted for the full year production guidance is exactly where we are in q3 is what we would have expected david heikkinen pickering energy analyst thanks guys keep cleaning it up operator we can now take the next question from arun jayaram from jpmorgan arun jayaram jpmorgan analyst yeah good morning i wanted to get some of your thoughts on 2022 scott you ve outlined up to 5 oil growth and i wanted to get your thoughts on how capex could trend there s obviously some pushes and pulls with 150 million of synergy tailwinds from parsley and doublepoint there s simul frac but obviously some inflation so i know the street expectations next year around 405 000 barrels for kbd for oil in just under 3 6 billion in capex i was just wondering to see if you could maybe frame how you think the business playing out relative to where the street s at for next year richard p dealy president and chief operating officer yes rich a little too early for us to comment on the details specifically for 2022 capex and production but i d tell you that we re committed to our investment framework that yields that maximum of 5 oil growth for 2022 and then broadly speaking i think that equates to much of what we said last quarter about 400 000 barrels of oil per day for the year and about slightly over 700 000 boes per day for 2022 arun jayaram jpmorgan analyst got it got it okay fair enough and just my follow up is in the quarter you guys turned to sales i think 157 wells i was wondering if you could maybe give us a bit of a mix between double point acreage versus maybe legacy pioneer parsley and then how would you frame the well productivity on the acquired acreage on doublepoint richard p dealy president and chief operating officer yes our teams did a really a great job as i mentioned early on about the integration and drilling completion efficiencies during q2 were great and so that led to the higher pop cadence during the quarter we do anticipate that to step down in q3 in about 10 to 15 in terms of what that pop cadence will look like but overall our production was for q2 was very strong we were very happy with the performance of all our wells i mean at this point we look at them all as pioneer and so parsley doublepoint pioneer wells all performed at expectation and did well so everything is progressing just as we would have liked arun jayaram jpmorgan analyst great thanks a lot rich operator we can now take the next question from paul cheng from scotia bank paul cheng scotia bank analyst thank you good morning two questions first i think is for neal neal can you give us some idea how is the cash tax progression is going to be over the next several years given oil price at the 70 plus currently the second question is that is just a theoretical scott if we look out for the next say two or three years in the event we still see opec is curtailing production to support the oil prices under that kind of macro environment will pioneer still try to grow at 5 or that should pioneer to grow the oil production net or under that circumstances neil mehta goldman analyst paul i ll kick it off and i ll turn it over to scott i mean if you look at our current nol balance it s approximately 8 billion but if you consider the increase in commodity prices and the forward strip and the expectation for substantial free cash flow profile that scott and richard spoke to our cash tax time frame did accelerate into 2023 so that s based on the current strip and our free cash flow generation so a slight acceleration but good based upon the free cash flow profile if you look at our current portion of taxes those are state related so that s kind of where we sit as it pertains to a cash tax payer and the profile on a go forward basis in regards paul cheng scotia bank analyst so can you talk about becoming a tax i m sorry scott i was just asking when you become cash tax payer in 2023 what kind of the percent of the cash tax represent your total tax going to look like neal h shah senior vice president and chief financial officer so it starts to layer in paul in 2023 so we re not a maximum payer at that point but it does layer in 2023 2024 and start to step up throughout that time frame scott d sheffield chief executive officer yes on the opec question paul the we say up to 5 so as long as demand is strong and i m still on the assumption that the delta variant is going to roll over people will continue to get vaccinated and demand is going to pick up significantly in the back half of this year and next year going into 23 so i still anticipate strong demand and as long as that s happened we ll be growing 5 a year if for some reason there s any softness we can actually we can easily back off the 5 grow 2 3 grow 0 so but right now we re modeling 5 growth over the next five years paul cheng scotia bank analyst i just want to make one observation or comment on the hedging personally that i actually log the people who guys don t hedge you can look at whether it s a single company or the industry over a 10 year 20 year 30 year whatever you see hedging is always a losing money proposition i don t think the industry happen make money and with your very low breakeven requirement and your very strong balance sheet i m not sure that why do you want to hedge your investors really want to get the upside scott d sheffield chief executive officer hopefully you re a shareholder and give me feedback paul operator we can now take the next question from bob brackett from bernstein research bob brackett bernstein research analyst thank you for that most of the good questions have already been asked so let me just chime in which is uncharacteristic for me and say i truly appreciate the variable dividend strategy and the oxygen reducing cash return to shareholders and that modest growth so i ll just leave it there richard p dealy president and chief operating officer thanks operator we can now take the next question from phillips johnston from capital one phillips johnston capital one analyst hey guys thanks just one question for me and it s really just a follow up on the mechanics of the variable i think the prior plan was to tie the variable component to the prior year s actual annual cash flow and just sort of pay that evenly throughout the year every quarter whereas the variable that you announced last night is tied to actual second quarter free cash flow so just to clarify a little bit will variable now always be tied to the prior quarter s free cash flow and if so can you maybe talk about the trade off between the new format which sort of pays out free cash flow in more of a real time fashion which i think is a real plus but it also does bring a little bit more volatility into this quarterly payout scott d sheffield chief executive officer yes i mean it s driven more by the fact the oil strip since we announced our plan in last february the oil strip five year old moved up significantly we ve made two highly accretive transactions and we saw the benefit of what devon was doing already so we decided to go ahead and move it forward so it will fluctuate but at least i mean it s like the third quarter is already pretty is almost closed from a commodity standpoint brent is trading in october already as of now so you pretty much know the third quarter so it would be easy for i think analysts and investors to estimate the free cash flow with their models obviously it will vary if we had gone the old route we would have to wait it had been delayed 18 months that was the negative phillips johnston capital one analyst yes ok makes sense got it thanks operator we can now take the next question from david deckelbaum for cowen david deckelbaum cowen analyst thanks for squeezing me in guys i just had a couple hopefully quick ones for you and congrats on the inaugural variable payments just curious scott after the doublepoint deal if you look back where the 12 month strip was i guess there between then and now you had a 10 move is the plan i guess still to drop those rigs and then bring that production down to a level of like 100 000 equivalent a day to maintain that was there a weighing i guess against just maintaining that higher flush production that you had acquired scott d sheffield chief executive officer no that s still the plan no change david deckelbaum cowen analyst and i guess just as a follow up to that as you talk about this potential for 5 growth every year i guess is this always occurring as like a year end process where there s it s arbitrary in terms of calendar but is it making decisions for the following year always sort of in this fall time frame where the 5 growth would be determined off of that point or are there going to be points along the way throughout the year where perhaps there s a return based function that chooses you maybe to be positioning for bringing more activity forward at that current point scott d sheffield chief executive officer we had to make the decision to go to 5 in 22 and early this year you can t wait until the end of 21 to go 5 you ll end up spending way too much capital so our capital program is setting us up this year to go 5 with adding very few rigs if any we re dropping some this year and at most we ll be adding back one to two next year so we have to make the decisions a year ahead of time that s why it s best to have a great balance sheet so you can drill through the cycle but we also learned from what happened last year we can shut down we shut down how many rigs joey in a short time frame during the pandemic i mean in two weeks we shut down j d hall executive vice president operations 18 scott d sheffield chief executive officer 18 rigs so i mean we ve gone through so many down cycles over the last 11 years sad to say that in 2009 2014 and then 2020 that we ve learned we can make quick decisions at pioneer and get to a free cash flow and what s amazing is 2020 was our first free cash flow model even in the worst oil price year but that s how fast we can react and change david deckelbaum cowen analyst i appreciate the clarity if i could just squeeze in a quick one just on the affluent water coming out of midlands right now where do you estimate the amount of the capacity that you ll be utilizing out of that system in 2022 richard p dealy president and chief operating officer yes it s still ramping up but we can have the ability to take up to about 220 000 240 000 barrels a day from that system and so it really just depends on logistics and mechanics and hydraulics of the system and where the drilling is and we re going to optimize the lowest cost water which midland is one of our lowest cost waters and so it s that s the game plan and it s still being modeled but it s that s basically where we would anticipate getting up to over time david deckelbaum cowen analyst thank you guys richard p dealy president and chief operating officer sure operator this concludes today s question and answer session i d like to now pass call back over to scott sheffield for any additional or closing or max scott d sheffield chief executive officer again we appreciate all the questions we look forward to seeing everybody and hopefully we can see everybody on the road at some point in time stay safe and we ll see you in november thank you operator duration 58

prepared remarks there will be a question and answer session in which dan and bob will join us as well finally we posted a supplemental slide deck on our website this morning which we refer to on this call with that let me turn it over to our chief executive officer jimmy brock jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer thank you nate and good morning everyone we capped off the first half of 2021 by delivering another strong quarterly performance in q2 on the operations front despite two longwall moves in the quarter we delivered a solid cash cost performance additionally we once again demonstrated our ability to achieve strong cash flow performance by generating north of 50 million in free cash flow in q2 of 21 and increasing the unrestricted cash on our balance sheet by more than 50 million as well we reduced the leverage on our balance sheet and reaffirmed our ability to raise a significant amount of long term capital through the recently completed tax exempt financing on the pamc expansion project on the marketing front we continue to execute our strategic shift into the export markets and we also strategically layered in some financial hedges in the api2 market to secure revenue visibility and capture some of the recent export market strengths for 2022 on the safety front our bailey preparation plant consol marine terminal and itmann project each had zero recordable incidents during the second quarter of 2021 however our total recordable incident rate or trir at the pamc finished q2 21 higher than what is typical for us although the severity level on each of these incidents was very low we strived to perform each day at zero incidents and our year to date trir at the pamc remains significantly below the national average for underground bituminous coal mines now let me start with our most exciting news this quarter and provide an update on our itmann metallurgical coal project we have been very clear that one of our major strategic goals is to diversify our revenue streams and reduce the percentage of revenues associated with power generation markets this project is a very important step in that direction as most of you know in early 2019 we announced the commitments of the development of our itmann mine project which is a low vol metallurgical coal mining operation in wyoming county west virginia however due to the unprecedented demand and earnings decline associated with the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 we made the capital allocation decision to pullback spending on this project in order to focus our discretionary capital toward repurchasing our second lien notes in the open market which were trading well below par value at that time now as our debt has continued to trade up to near par levels and as our free cash flow generation has significantly improved i am very pleased to announce our decision to recommence the itmann project despite the significant pullback in project expenditures the past 12 to 18 months were instrumental in repositioning the project we used this time to complete initial development mine to shore up our confidence in the reserve and we optimized plans for the preparation plant to create an additional upside potential we evaluated several options for the preparation plant first build a brand new facility from scratch second purchase an existing plant at a nearby location and truck the coal for process or third identify an existing preparation plant for sale that could be relocated to our itmann side based on our analysis the third option made the most economic sense and we are moving forward with relocating a higher capacity and state of the art preparation plant to the itmann project side which is expected to start up in 2022 by relocating the plant we eliminate potentially long lead times on equipment and avoid inflationary pressures from steel and other construction materials we expect to produce 900 000 plus tons of high quality low vol coke and coal annually from our itmann number five mine once were at full run rate production we expect this to be a low cost operation with a long reserve life of 20 plus years of production at maintenance capital levels while the overall project capital cost has increased slightly due to the reoptimized plants for the prep plant we believe this can be more than offset by the expanded capacity afforded by the prep plant and improved cost structure due to the inclusion of a highly efficient rail load down the prep plant where we are relocating will have a processing capacity that is nearly double that at the plant originally envisioned for itmann opening up the opportunity for us to process up to 750 000 to one million product tons of third party coal in addition to the coal from our itmann mine we expect this will create additional growth opportunity and higher revenue potential compared to the original project plan with that now let me provide an overview of the coal markets we continue to execute on our multiyear transition of diversifying our sales mix and increasing our exposure to nonpower generation markets following a record export sales volume in q1 of 21 we successfully placed a new record 3 2 million tons in the export market in q2 of 21 representing nearly 55 of our total shipments in the quarter additionally 47 of our tons sold were used in the industrial or metallurgical nonpower generation applications as we continue to diversify our way from traditional power generations as you can see on slide five we have continued to steadily diversify our global customer base and end use markets since our span in 2017 and in the second quarter of 2021 our overall export volume as a percentage of total sales volume went up roughly 22 percentage points versus full year of 2017 this improvement was driven by a sharp increase in the portion of our tons going into the industrial markets which has risen by 33 percentage points versus 2017 we continue to focus on our strategy of further reducing our exposure to a declining u s coal market for power generation with a heightened focus on increasing our industrial business we believe that with our quality of coal and cost structure at the pamc coupled with an ownership of consol marine terminal we are very well positioned to take advantage of developing and sustaining opportunities in the export market demand for our product continued to strengthen in the second quarter of 2021 on the back of economic recovery and improved electric power and export demand henry hub natural gas spot prices averaged 2 95 per million btu during the quarter a 73 increase compared to q2 of 20 additionally average pjm west day ahead power prices continued to improve and in q2 of 21 61 above the year ago quarter spot pricing trends were especially encouraging given that we were in the shoulder season pricing has continued to improve since the end of the second quarter henry hub natural gas prices are now in the 4 per million btu range for august deliveries with calendar year 2022 now well above 3 per million btu prior to 2021 you d have to go back to 2018 to find a month in which henry hub averaged 4 or more and prior to that all the way back to 2014 we remain optimistic that overall market conditions will continue to improve due to accelerating global economic recovery and a relatively muted supply response on the export front we have seen sustained improvements in the seaborne thermal coal market since the end of the third quarter of 2020 pet coke prices continued to remain supportive as a result of reduced oil production propping up demand and pricing for northern app coal in high cv markets api2 spot prices also continued to rise in the second quarter of 2021 largely driven by hot and dry weather strong lng pricing and a limited supply response and ended the quarter improved by 82 compared to q2 of 20 as such we layered in commodity derivative contracts in the api2 market for calendar year 2022 which mitesh will provide more color on shortly additionally we completed four term deals in the export market during the quarter with durations from one to two years in length and we recently contracted a cargo of pamc coal to china for the first time since 2018 from a marketing perspective it is encouraging to see that demand for our coal has continued to improve since the low point in q2 of 20 we continue to maintain the vast majority of our core customer base and continue to see improvement in our customers contracting appetites our sales teams remains opportunistic in its marketing strategy and increased our contracted position by 9 4 million tons since our last earnings release bringing our contracted position to 24 6 million tons in 2021 and 10 9 million tons in 2022 now let me review our q2 21 operational performance in detail coal production at the pennsylvania mining complex came in at 5 9 million tons in q2 21 compared to 2 4 million tons in q2 of 20 the vast improvement despite the aforementioned multiple longwall moves in q2 of 21 was due to a continued increase in demand for our products since the covid related trough and demand that bottomed out during the year ago quarter as a result productivity at the pamc measured as tons per employee hour improved by an impressive 46 7 in q2 of 21 compared to q2 of 20 on the cost front our average cash cost of coal sale per ton was 28 02 in q2 of 21 compared to 25 90 in q2 of 20 although this seems impaired keep in mind that the 25 90 per ton did not reflect the 32 million in mine idling cash cost incurred during the year ago quarter when adjusted for that q2 21 cash costs significantly outperformed the prior year period even without accounting for that idle cost our year to date average cash cost of coal sold per ton was improved by nearly 15 versus the first half of 2020 our operations team continues to focus on maintaining tight control over cash expenditures as we move forward the consol marine terminal achieved a throughput volume of 3 8 million tons during q2 of 21 compared to 1 6 million tons in the year ago period the significant increase was again due to improved demand in the seaborne markets compared to the trough of the covid 19 related decline in coal demand in q2 of 20 the terminal throughput volumes reflects a pace of over 15 million tons per annum and marks the second consecutive quarter with an annualized run rate north of 15 million tons terminal revenues for the quarter came in at 17 4 million compared to 15 9 million in the year ago quarter despite the major increase in throughput tonnage the impact on revenue was somewhat lessened due to the take or pay contract that was in place in the prior year period cash operating costs came in at 5 3 million versus 3 8 million in the year ago quarter with that i will now turn the call over to mitesh to provide the financial update mitesh thakkar chief financial officer thank you jimmy and good morning everyone i will start with an update on the progress we have made on our key financial priorities i will then review our second quarter 2021 results and our full year 2021 guidance as we have discussed in the past our financial priorities remain maximizing free cash flow generation maintaining strong liquidity and reducing outstanding debt while these remain on north star we are now also selectively allocating capital toward strategic initiatives such as our itmann project after accomplishing a significant milestone of achieving a net leverage ratio below 2 times at the end of 1q 21 we further reduced our leverage to 1 7 times at the end of 2q 21 this was despite our recently completed tax exempt bond offering which we previously highlighted would increase our leverage in the near term due to the treatment of restricted cash under our credit agreement however if we include the restricted cash our leverage ratio as of june 30 would have dropped to 1 54 times while we have more work to do on our balance sheet front we have several initiatives underway or recently completed that we believe will create long term value for our shareholders first we continue to make strides on our overall debt reduction goal as we made total debt payments and repurchases of 18 million in 2q 21 this included open market repurchases of outstanding second lien notes where we spent 4 8 million to retire 5 million at a slight discount to par we view these buybacks as a good use of capital even as the market price of our second lien notes have rallied back to trade at near par levels second we made the discretionary decision to execute an 18 4 million early buyout option on an existing operating lease for a set of longwall shares this decision not only saves us nearly 900 000 per month in operating lease expense for the next 12 months but also eliminates the buyout requirement in 2q 22 at fair market value given where steel prices are currently this fair market value would most likely have been elevated and could have been close to or more than the 18 million fixed early buyout amount we executed the early buyout also reduces the operating lease liability on our books which rating agencies include in their leverage calculations third as highlighted last quarter we continue to find ways to tap alternative sources of capital by successfully securing 75 million of tax exempt solid waste disposal revenue bonds at the beginning of the second quarter we received reimbursements from qualified expenses in the amount of 21 5 million in 2q 21 which dates back to the initial inducement date in mid 2020 additionally we have 53 5 million in restricted cash associated with this financing that will be used to fund future spending on the refuse disposal areas at the pamc and will reduce our leverage ratio over time from a strategic standpoint this transaction gives us additional financial flexibility and helps to de risk a portion of our future refinancing efforts by pushing 75 million of maturity in 2028 the transaction is also a testament to our ability to access long term capital it gets even more exciting when you consider that the commodity environment and our balance sheet has only strengthened since the closing of this transaction we also expect this as a future financing avenue that could be available to us fourth to capitalize on the strength in the export market we initiated a targeted revenue hedging strategy during the second quarter of 2021 so far we have layered in two million metric tons of commodity derivative contracts in the api2 market for calendar year 2022 at a weighted average price of 79 34 per ton these financial hedges ensure strong netback core prices for us for the approximately two million tons of physical contracts we signed during 2q 21 for 2022 which are also tied to api2 prices the good news for us is that api2 prices and other export market pricing indicators continue to strengthen and we still have an additional 13 plus million tons of coal sales uncontracted for 2022 we anticipate a significant portion of these sales will go into the export markets fifth on the legacy liabilities front under our current actuarial assumptions we have a fully funded status on our defined benefit pension plan at this point we do not have any funding requirements for the foreseeable future and have significantly lowered our exposure to equity market volatility as we move forward we ll continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet while implementing our targeted growth and diversification strategy this includes our commitment to completing the itmann project we expect this project to require an additional 65 million to 70 million of capex to complete given the increased processing capacity and new train load out at the preparation facility this is an addition to the 24 million already spent on the project to date since its inception in early 2019 recommencing this project is not an either our decision relative to our debt reduction priority we still expect to continue to reduce our outstanding debt on our balance sheet and unrestricted cash this project like all financial decisions went to our rigorous capital allocation process excluding any third party revenue we expect it to generate a rate of return north of 25 over the life of the project assuming an australian premium low vol coking coal price of 160 to 170 a ton which is consistent with the actual trailing 10 year average price and the current forward strip for 2023 to 2025 we believe the returns on the itmann project will exceed our weighted average cost of capital even at long term average australian premium low oil prices of 130 a ton we are very excited about this project and its earnings and free cash flow potential with that let me now recap the second quarter results before moving on to our 2021 guidance ceix reported a very strong financial performance for 2q 21 with net income of 4 2 million or 0 12 per diluted share which included 20 4 million of unrealized mark to market losses related to commodity derivatives and adjusted ebitda of 84 4 million this compares to a loss of 18 million or 0 69 per diluted share and adjusted ebitda of 34 2 million in the year ago quarter in 2q 21 we generated 94 6 million of cash flow from operations which included 25 6 million of positive working capital changes driven by a significant reduction in our accounts and notes receivable balance additionally we spent 43 7 million in capital expenditures which included the previously discussed 18 4 million for the discretionary operating lease buyout and we received 3 4 million in proceeds from asset sales this resulted in free cash flow generation of 54 4 million in 2q 21 this highlights the ability of our business to generate free cash flow in challenging markets and capture a meaningful upside in stronger markets as a result of our free cash flow generation we have increased our unrestricted cash position by nearly 56 million in the quarter and now have an unrestricted cash position of 146 million which is the highest level since 2q 19 including the restricted cash position of 53 5 million our cash and cash equivalents balance is over 200 million now let me provide you with our updated outlook for 2021 due to our strong first half 21 operational performance and outlook for the remainder of the year we are increasing our expected sales volume for 2021 to 23 5 million to 25 million tons up from our previous guidance of 22 million to 24 million tons additionally due to the efforts of our operations team to drive costs down despite inflationary pressures so far this year we are adjusting our expected average cash cost of coal sold per ton to a range of 27 to 28 per ton down from our previous guidance of 27 to 29 per ton on the pricing front we currently have a 2021 contracted position of 24 6 million tons at an expected average price of 44 02 per ton the improvement compared to our prior guidance reflects the strength in the current pricing environment on the additional contracted volumes we have layered in as well as an improvement in the assumed pjm west power forwards finally we are increasing our capital guidance due to the decision to recommence the itmann project and the completed lease buyout to a range of 160 million to 180 million as always we will continue to reassess our guidance ranges each quarter and adjust them as necessary with that let me turn it back to jimmy to make some final comments jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer thank you mitesh before we move on to the question and answer session let me take this opportunity to provide a recap of our accomplishments in the second quarter and reiterate our priorities as we move forward first we continue to prioritize strengthening and enhancing our balance sheet by improving our liquidity and financial flexibility despite shrinking access to capital for coal companies we have had good success in identifying and tapping alternative sources of capital second despite significant inflationary pressures we continue to keep costs at our operations under control through efficiencies reduced discretionary spending and creativity in our supply chain management program the team continues to look for ways to effectively drive costs down without sacrificing the effectiveness of our operations by rightsizing our operations we ve taken some slack out of the system allowing our four operating longwalls at the pamc the ability to essentially run full out this drives efficiency and results in a sustained reduction in our average cash cost of coal sold per ton compared to our historical averages third our consol marine terminal is one of the most strategically valuable assets in our portfolio the terminal will be essential for executing our longer term strategic shift into the export market which we expect will derisk our domestic exposure and allow us to capitalize on growing international demand for our high cv product year to date we shipped more than 50 of our total sales volume into the export market which highlights the value of owning our own terminal and is a huge differentiator for us compared to our peers finally we re extremely excited to be in a position to restart the itmann project we view this project as the next phase of our strategy which focuses on targeted growth and diversification as an additional avenue to increase value for our shareholders this project is strategically important as it will diversify our portfolio by adding a new metallurgical coal product stream to the mix and it aligns well with our current operations by being low cost high margin and high quality before handing the call over i want to reiterate that we are extremely proud of our accomplishments to date and believe we have a lot of opportunity in front of us to build upon our strategic priorities our capital allocation process world class asset and employees have helped us to come out of 2020 prime to excel in 2021 and beyond there s always more work to do but we continue to focus on our goal of strengthening our balance sheet and creating long term value for our shareholders with that i will hand the call back over to nate for further instructions nathan tucker director finance and investor relations thank you jimmy we will now move to the questions and answers session of our call at this time i d like to ask our operator to please provide the instruction to our callers questions and answers operator and the first question comes from nathan martin with the benchmark company please go ahead nathan martin the benchmark company analyst good morning guys congratulations on the first half performance jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer thank you nate nathan martin the benchmark company analyst maybe i ll start on the cost side first you guys obviously lowered your guidance by i guess 0 50 a ton at the midpoint but even if i run costs in the second half flat with your second quarter results of 28 which at the high end of your revised full year guidance you end up right at the low end of that new guidance range is there something that pushes costs higher here in the second half or maybe is there a chance you could possibly outperform there jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer nate if you remember on our last earnings call i said that we expect to come in at the lower half of our cost guidance and as we look forward there s still some uncertainties in the market out there i mean we have a contracted position for 2021 that s up significantly than on our last earnings call but still we have two longwall moves in the second half of the year one in each quarter whereas in that first quarter we didn t have any and inflationary pressures from some of the commodities that we produced with we see those could come to us so as mitesh mentioned in his comments we ll reevaluate and look at it but our goal is to keep a tight lease on cost where we can and then let the operations team do what they do best and they figure out ways to lower cost as we continue to produce but the reason that we lowered it 1 is because of our performance to date and then as we look forward with one longwall move in each quarter we think we ll have an opportunity to still come in toward the lower end of that guidance and that s what our goal will be mitesh thakkar chief financial officer and nate i think inflation is a big part of a little bit of cautiousness here as you know all raw material prices have been higher since the beginning of the year so i think that is something that we continuously monitor i think our supply chain team has done a good job of managing that so far but there s always some buffer related to inflation as we go through the year as things continue to be very strong in the commodity landscape nathan martin the benchmark company analyst got it i appreciate those thoughts guys and then maybe shifting over to the pricing side looks like you re essentially fully contracted for this year meaning additional 400 000 tons or so at the high end of revised guidance should we assume those tons would likely go to the export market and then if we look forward to 2022 i think you layered on an additional five million tons or so there can you talk about the mix of those tons and give us an idea of what prices they were layered in thanks robert braithwaite vice president marketing and sales yes sure nate this is bob just to kind of highlight 2021 as we mentioned earlier we have now 24 6 million tons sold the additional volume we had to get to the upper end of the guidance i would suggest that that s likely going to go into the export market there s still about a 5 to 10 arbitrage versus what the domestic prices are today even at 4 gas i would suggest that the prices you re seeing in the publications cold desk reference and they call it the mid 50 range we re still seeing an arbitrage in the export market so it s likely that those volumes will go there as far as 2022 is concerned we did contract an additional 5 3 million tons since our last earnings call about 80 of those volumes were contracted into the international market so sitting here today of the 10 9 million tons a little over four million tons of those are contracted to go exports and based on where we sit today i would suggest that our export volumes will be pretty much similar to if not a little bit higher in 2022 than what we expect to export in 2021 and again that goes based on jimmy s comments of our strategic shift and then also again based on the price arbitrage that exists today nathan martin the benchmark company analyst i appreciate that color bob and just any early thoughts on potential production levels in 2022 given the positive quarter view of the market jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer yeah i think as we ve always said we ll run to the market thus far we ve been able to run our four longwalls full out we would want to continue that into 2022 and then depending upon what future forecasts we see there we could run some additional shifts or something but i would expect our tonnage for 2022 to be very similar to what we have in 2021 with possibly some upside nathan martin the benchmark company analyst got it thanks for that jimmy and then just a real quick one to shift to itmann i appreciate all the color you guys are given on the projects and the updates there i guess how do we think about production ramp i m assuming we ll have to wait for the prep plant completion before we see any meaningful production which i think you guys would say may be mid to second half 22 can you kind of talk about that and then maybe your decision to relocate the existing prep plant with additional capacity maybe just any thoughts on the appetite you see to fill that excess capacity thanks daniel connell senior vice president strategy sure nate this is dan regarding the first part of your question on the production ramp we have been fortunate in being able to continue our development mining here at a reduced rate for the past number of months and we ll continue that as we build out the plant so that puts us in really good position when the plant becomes available targeting kind of the q3 2022 timeframe to very rapidly ramp up and bring both of the additional sections on that we will need to scale up to full production so i think our plan would be that during the second half of next year we can move from kind of the controlled development mining that we ve been doing to something very close to if not achieving full production during 2022 the decision to relocate the plant is one that as jimmy mentioned we ran a lot of analysis on we had time to give that a thorough look given kind of the pause in the project during last couple of months so we feel like we ve vetted that plan very well there are a number of reserves kind of in the vicinity of where this prep plant is being built that are have yet to be developed and we actually have some development mining going on nearby it and then in some of the upper seams as we speak that we ll likely be looking for a home so we feel optimistic about the opportunity to pull third party tons into the plant based on economics should help to improve the product wins that we can produce coming out of itmann and to be clear the economic numbers that we ve been reporting do not assume any upside from those third party tons so we have we based our decisions on just kind of an itmann base case and we view the third party tons as upside to that plan jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer yeah and nate just to add to that one of the things when we were looking at the preparation plant which is a big decision as far as us ramping up to full production the 900 000 tons plus that we had mentioned we would not want to do that until we re processing our own coal and we can get that through so when we looked at the preparation plant one of the key factors there on our initial plan we were going to build a much smaller plant that would be somewhere around 350 tons an hour and then we were going to if we got all the third party business everything we would add that second piece on well we re buying this plant and relocating it we have that from day one and then some of the increase in capital was because of the trained load out that we re going to have that s going to give us the ability to not only move our coal very efficiently on the rail line but also any third party coal that we have coming into there so i remain very very excited about the itmann project i m happy that we put ourselves in a position to whereas we can recommence it and i think it s going to be a nice return and be a nice project for our shareholders nathan martin the benchmark company analyst got it i appreciate that those additional thoughts that makes sense and then just finally i think mitesh obviously you went through some quick irr numbers for itmann and i might have missed some of those but have you guys done kind of any payback period calculations for the project and what that might look like at various net price decks thanks mitesh thakkar chief financial officer sure i think it depends on what met price do you use i mean some of these cases the payback period could be as little as two to three years i ll let dan address some more specific payback periods if you will daniel connell senior vice president strategy sure no i mean i think as we mentioned nate during the remarks we ve kind of run the project economics using a price strip that s consistent with both the 10 year average historic met prices and the current forward strip and that puts you kind of in the payback range that mitesh mentioned i think in terms of roi numbers we said north of 25 obviously if you run the numbers at the current market and assume that it holds out here for a couple of years payback period becomes quite short and these are paybacks the roi numbers just to clarify are based on total project capital costs since inception if you look at the numbers on a go forward basis may become more attractive than what was before mitesh thakkar chief financial officer i think that s an important point that i want to highlight that all these economics that we ran are on total project cost basis it s not just a go forward capex that we used for analysis even though today if you are making that decision you should look at go forward because that s more applicable we wanted to make sure that the project economics hold nathan martin the benchmark company analyst got it i appreciate all that information guys thanks again for the time today and best of luck in the second half jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer yeah thanks nathan operator the next question comes from lucas pipes with b riley securities please go ahead lucas pipes b riley securities analyst thanks very much and good morning everyone jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer good morning lucas pipes b riley securities analyst i may have missed it earlier but jimmy you mentioned the spread between the international and the domestic market and i wondered can you elaborate on what that spread is today i e what is seeing for export tons what is pricing for domestic tons and then do you have a view on what might trigger these prices to which obviously would be great to see the domestic pricing move up so i appreciate your thoughts on there thank you robert braithwaite vice president marketing and sales yeah lucas this is bob right now i d say the arbitrage versus kind of the published marks the published marks are call it mid 50 levels for prompt right around 50 levels for coal strip 22 the volumes we ve locked in to date on the international side the arbitrage is roughly around 5 or 10 and that does not include any again terminal revenues that we receive as well so that s kind of the level we re at today going forward i still view that this market has legs for at least another 12 to 18 months i mean the supply response just is not there not only in coal but gas space as well and inventories are significantly below their averages in fact i read an article just last week that gas reserves in europe are the lowest they ve been in over a decade and then when you look at pet coke prices continue to trend upward and now 90 up year on year so again i think this market has legs on a continued the back of a continued post pandemic recovery and just a relatively muted supply response jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer yeah and i would add lucas going forward when we re looking at gas prices where they are today and i can t reiterate enough the supply response just hasn t been there so i think i agree with bob i think the market does have legs into the coming years particularly on the international market and that will help drive some of the domestic pricing as well so we feel like it does have legs with demand increasing for electricity gas prices where they are and a muted supply response lucas pipes b riley securities analyst thank you very much bob and jimmy for that perspective in terms of your capital allocation you re clearly shifting well you re shifting toward growth with itmann good to see that and i wondered from here on out what are your priorities is it more so on the capital is it more on the debt side buying back maybe more we saw at your transaction on the capital lease side what are some of the opportunities and mitesh maybe if you could speak to any limits or restrictions you may have would very much appreciate your perspective thank you mitesh thakkar chief financial officer so let me start by saying that we are in a very strong position today and are constantly reviewing our capital allocation priorities to ensure that they are consistent with changing market conditions and provide us the best risk adjusted return in line with our strategic priorities and the attractive rates of returns that we just talked about for itmann project we relaunched it makes a lot of sense for incremental dollars that we are spending also as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we still have some wood to chop as far as deleveraging is concerned now debt repurchases are not as attractive as they used to be before but given that we want to de lever and the fact that we still have an 11 paper out there that allows us to be opportunistic in that area i think you ll continue to see us pay down our debt or repurchase in the open market because as i said earlier it s not an either or decision for us as far as deleveraging is concerned and itmann is concerned the steps that we are taking with deleveraging and growing our met coal business are all geared toward one goal and that is really to create significant value for our shareholders whether it comes from growth or from having larger equity value in the enterprise the good news is that the market is offering us the opportunity today to launch and execute on multiple of these initiatives and returning capital to our shareholders is one of them right we are constantly reviewing it and hope to provide you an update in coming quarters as we execute on our near term goals as well with respect to the operating leases i don t see any big opportunities right now on that front we saw one in the second quarter and executed on it which i feel was one of the best projects so to speak when you think about from a rate of return perspective we ran the dcf some it was a very easy decision to make so i think those are the opportunities we ll continue to look at and continue to deliver on some of our strategic priorities jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer yeah and the good news is for us it s not an either or as mitesh mentioned earlier in his comments with us generating free cash flow at the rate we are per quarter we have an opportunity to do all of these things but i want to reiterate really excited about the itmann project it gives us that diversity in our product stream of having the low vol metallurgical coal in the mix and i think we re going to continue to do the things that we ve done in the past which enhanced the balance sheet provides great liquidity and add a new product mix to our stream lucas pipes b riley securities analyst thank you very much and when i saw those capital lease numbers i thought i should get into the business of lending to you guys really appreciate all the color continued best of luck jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer thanks lucas operator the next question comes from michael dudas with vertical research partners please go ahead michael dudas vertical research partners analyst good morning everyone jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer good morning michael dudas vertical research partners analyst first question maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on your domestic customer base again certainly inventories down demand up how urgent do you feel they are right now especially as where we ve had better economic activity going forward and where gas prices are and any update on your customer base relative to potential coal power plant closures and your exposure there and how that may impact maybe some of your competitive suppliers as those things work through the system robert braithwaite vice president marketing and sales mike right now we are in discussions with several domestic customers not only for the balance of 21 but 2022 as well without a doubt utilities are realizing that spot coal is not readily available as it once was so with that being said i do believe that there will be opportunities to lock in some longer term volumes to ensure they have supply going forward so with that being said stay tuned there but as you mentioned inventories are i would say near critical levels for many of the domestic utilities that we do serve when i say critical levels i m saying sub 10 days of inventory on the ground and with gas price at 4 i don t see that that this will change in the very near future so again it should bode very well for us in our contracting abilities for 2022 as far as closures are concerned as of right now within the next 10 years we have very minimal of our customer base look that has announced that they will retire i would say it s in a neighborhood of 0 5 million to one million total tons that we view at risk obviously as jimmy talked about before is reggie we do have to be concerned about reggie which we re keeping a close eye on that could have some additional impact on us in pennsylvania but again we are continuing to look and focus on shifting some of those volumes already in the export market so that s kind of where we stand today michael dudas vertical research partners analyst i appreciate that secondly moving internationally say to your important market in india and you mentioned about pet coke and could you maybe just a thought on just the dynamics going on in the asian coal market especially with some of the shifts in coal in and out of china and then the lack of supply response again not to predict the future markets but you got pretty strong curves out there relative to say and jimmy mentioned your 2014 and 2018 coal price spikes in internationally how different is it dynamic and what you re seeing here especially as you guys have evolved into a much more important and solid provider coal into those export markets robert braithwaite vice president marketing and sales yeah one thing that benefits us as we mentioned in our remarks our coal being a high btu high calorific value coal does transport very nicely into these markets especially into the asian markets where there is additional transportation as far as this time around versus what happened in call it 2014 as we mentioned the supply response isn t there i mean if you look at the production not only in the u s but look at the production in colombia i mean it s significantly down and they re just not those production basins just aren t coming back is strong plus not only that there s additional build outs internationally i mean india obviously is a targeted market for us they re going they have been going through and continue to go through industrial revolution and then again with the whole australia and china tensions continuing it is opening up doors for us to get bailey coal into china as well as jimmy mentioned we did contract our first cargo there this year which is our first since 2018 so again i think a lot of this is based on just again a post pandemic recovery and muted supply response that we just do not feel is coming back michael dudas vertical research partners analyst understood and finally i guess mitesh on your derivative book that you re creating here is that something that is i assume its opportunistic but as we see that as you managed the pricing markets there s a little bit more exposure to that as you move forward is that something that s going to be part of how you on the marketing and hedging side going forward especially with your more exposure in those export markets mitesh thakkar chief financial officer yeah so mike you re absolutely right i think what we did in the second quarter was more opportunistic but it also demonstrates a tool that we have in future i think one of the things that we have noticed is there was interest in doing api tooling contracts by some of our supplier by some of our customers so we wanted to manage that risk and in hindsight you look at it it almost looks like we could have waited three more months and we would have been a lot better off but i think the goal there was to mitigate the risk and i think we used it appropriately at that time but it also gave us another tool to do some of the things where if we want to if we are seeing that we are not making progress on improving our contracted position but the api2 market is there we can lock in tons there and have some of that book right now that s not the case but that doesn t mean it s not going to be in the future i think our marketing team is very successful in layering in some contracts here in the export markets even on a term basis and not just spot basis which is really good we like that approach much better than using the derivatives but it s a tool that we have we can use michael dudas vertical research partners analyst that sounds great i appreciate your thoughts gentlemen jimmy a brock president and chief executive officer thanks mike operator this concludes our question and answer session i will now turn the conference back over to nathan tucker for any closing remarks nathan tucker director finance and investor relations thank you tom we

aln ttrsc04 which we believe could enable an annual dosing regimen we also advanced programs in our earlier stage clinical pipeline including new positive interim data from the phase i study of zilebesiran our investigational rnai therapeutic for hypertension which is now advanced into the cardia phase ii program we believe all of these achievements represent meaningful progress toward our alnylam p 5 times25 goals a bold vision for alnylam with transformative medicines in both rare and common diseases for patients around the world and a robust and high yielding pipeline of first and or best in class product candidates from our organic product engine all this while delivering exceptional financial performance so with that let me now turn the call over to tolga for a review of our commercial results tolga tolga tanguler chief commercial officer thanks john and good morning everyone we re very pleased with our second quarter performance for onpattro we achieved 114 million in global net product revenues representing approximately 12 quarter on quarter growth compared with the first quarter we ended the quarter with over 1 725 patients on commercial treatments in the u s we continue to see strength on many fronts including 12 growth in demand and notable growth in new prescribers we have also seen encouraging signs of the healthcare system reopening for example in the second quarter we received more start forms for onpattro in the u s than we have since early 2019 we re also seeing an uptick in face to face interactions between our field team and healthcare professionals which is an indicator that the healthcare system is continuing to open up further speed to patient diagnosis is continuing to improve with ongoing growth in the use of pyp scans which is often the start of the patient journey toward a polyneuropathy diagnosis patient compliance also remains high and stable at pre covid levels and we continue to observe a trend in concomitant use of onpattro to treat the polyneuropathy of hattr early doses along with the use of a ttr stabilizer to treat the cardiomyopathy of this disease in mixed phenotype patients with regard to the rest of the world market access has now been achieved in over 30 countries worldwide in q2 we saw significant 17 quarter on quarter growth in our rest of world markets with particular strength in europe and canada we re also observing a good balance of first line use and switches from stabilizers in these markets moving to givlaari we achieved 31 million in global net product revenues in the second quarter representing approximately 24 quarter on quarter growth compared with q1 and as of june 30 we attained over 270 patients worldwide on commercial therapy this quarter we saw significant growth driven by net new patient adds this was an improvement relative to the first quarter in which the performance was softer than anticipated likely due to reduced patient flow through the u s healthcare system caused by covid we re also seeing continued expansion of the prescriber base including new riders particularly from community centers in addition to porphyria centers of excellence in the u s we continue to make strong progress toward establishing vbas with over 10 finalizes to date with commercial payers we also have confirmed access for over 98 of covered u s lives with no significant headwinds we continue to make great progress with market access efforts for givlaari across the cemea region with the recent launch in italy ongoing launch in germany temporary authorization for use or atu supply in france as well as named patient sales in other countries in addition we were pleased to recently receive approval of givlaari in japan for the treatment of ahp in adults as well as adolescents aged 12 and older with a launch expected in september moving to oxlumo we re seeing continued demand strength in the drug s second full quarter of launch we achieved 60 million in global net product revenues in the second quarter and attained approximately 100 patients on commercial oxlumo treatment in the u s and eu as of june 30 as we re still early in the launch oxlumo performance is also being modestly benefited by the dynamics of a loading dose our market access efforts are progressing very well with no access headwinds and confirm medical policy inclusions for over 80 of covered u s lives and seven vbas finalized to date with commercial payers geographic expansion of oxlumo is moving along nicely with a recent approval in brazil and launch underway in germany and atu supply in france supported by early transitions from our expanded access program we re very pleased to see broad utilization of oxlumo at this early stage of launch including across age groups in conclusion we believe we had a great second quarter of 2021 as we continue to make steady and continued growth across our wholly owned commercial portfolio driven by the focus and hard work of our teams improved patient flows through the healthcare system improve disease awareness and new patient finding in the case of givlaari and oxlumo we also experienced growth partially fueled by new market expansion due to reimbursement and regulatory decisions with that i will now turn it over to akshay to review our recent r d and pipeline progress akshay akshay vaishnaw president research development thanks tolga and good morning everyone i ll start with our efforts in attr amyloidosis where we re advancing two clinical stage product candidates patisiran and vutrisiran also onpattro is currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat the polyneuropathy associated with hereditary attr amyloidosis we re committed to expanding the product s label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild type attr amyloidosis patients to this end we re conducting the apollo b phase iii study during the second quarter we completed enrollment in apollo b and expect to report top line results in mid 2022 we re also advancing vutrisiran an investigational therapy which is delivered by a quarterly subcutaneous injection and is also in development for attr amyloidosis here we re conducting two phase iii studies the first is helios a evaluating vutrisiran in hattr amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy at the aan conference in april we presented our positive 9 month helios a results based on those results we submitted our nda to the fda which was accepted and signed a pdufa date of april 14 2022 patient dosing continues in helios a and we look forward to reporting top line results from the 18 month endpoint in late 2021 which will also further characterize vutrisiran s impact on the exploratory cardiac endpoints we plan to make additional regulatory submissions including in the eu in the late 2021 period based on the helios a results the other phase iii vutrisiran study is helios b which is our ongoing phase iii cardiac outcome study with vutrisiran in hereditary and wild type attr amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy we re excited to have announced this morning that due to high interest among physicians and patients we now expect to complete enrollment within the next two weeks well ahead of schedule and with more than 600 patients randomized to date helios b has a 30 month endpoint of all cause mortality and cv events and we can now expect the full results in early 2024 the study design includes the potential for an interim analysis and we ll consider this following results from apollo b and alignment with regulatory authorities lastly for vutrisiran we re very excited about the potential opportunity for biannual dosing regimen which could further differentiate vutrisiran from other products and provide yet another dosing regimen option for patients we re now generating the clinical data to potentially advance this additional 50 milligram biannual dosing schedule for vutrisiran specifically we ve provided the open label extension period of the helios a study to now include a randomized treatment extension where patients from the helios a study will be randomized to receive vutrisiran at a dose of either 25 milligrams every three months or 50 milligrams biannually these data intended to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the 50 milligram biannual regimen are expected in 2022 beyond patisiran and vutrisiran we have a new addition to the attr amyloidosis franchise we re building specifically using our ikaria platform we ve generated a new ttr targeting sirna aln ttrsc04 that we believe could support an annual dosing regimen of greater than 90 ttr knockdown we intend to share more detail on the ikaria platform and our preclinical work at an upcoming scientific meeting in mid 2021 let s now move on to lumasiran our rnai therapeutic recently approved in the eu and u s as the first treatment for primary hyperoxaluria type one or ph1 we were very pleased to announce positive top line results from illuminate c just last week as a reminder illuminate c is a single arm multinational phase iii study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lumasiran in ph1 patients of all ages with severe renal impairment including patients on dialysis a total of 21 patients were enrolled in the study and lumasiran was found to achieve substantial reductions in plasma oxalate relative to baseline both in patients who are not yet on dialysis and patients who are hemodialysis dependent elevated plasma oxalate can result in systemic oxalosis with severe clinical consequences impacting the heart bones eyes skin and other organs moreover lumasiran demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile with no deaths or drug related saes the most common aes were isrs all of which were mild there are two discontinuations from treatment during the extension period due to aes that neither was drug related we now intend to submit supplemental regulatory filings with the fda and ema in late 2021 with the goal of strengthening the label supporting oxlumo as we have noted previously we re also excited about the potential for lumasiran for patients with recurrent renal stones and later this year we plan to start a phase ii trial to evaluate that potential as you know we have two additional late stage programs that are in development with partners this includes leqvio or inclisiran partnered with novartis which was approved last year in the eu for the treatment of adults with hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia leqvio marks the first rnai therapeutic approved for a prevalent condition recently novartis resubmitted its nda for leqvio in response to a complete response letter it received from the fda due to the inability of fda inspectors to visit a third party manufacturing facility in europe due to covid importantly the fda has not raised any concerns related to the efficacy or safety of inclisiran novartis announced that the fda has accepted the resubmission and has signed a pdufa date of january 1 2022 our late stage programs also include fitusiran in department hemophilia a or b with or without inhibitors partnered with sanofi who is leading development of fitusiran in the atlas phase iii program sanofi announced substantial progress with fitusiran and now expects to share data from initial pivotal trials as early as beginning of next year with a potential regulatory submission later in 2022 now in addition to our late stage clinical programs we believe we have also been making great progress with our early and mid stage programs one of the exciting parts of our story now is the potential expansion of rna therapeutics beyond rare disease into prevalent disease opportunities we believe now is the time to address many unmet needs in common disease settings such as hypertension nash gout diabetes among others and we believe the pharmacological properties of rnai therapeutics provide the foundation for success our program for hypertension is a great example so zilebesiran formerly known as lnagt our investigational rnai therapeutic targeting the genetically validated target angiotensinogen for the treatment of hypertension in the second quarter we reported interim results from the phase i study in which patients treated with single days of zilebesiran at 100 milligrams or higher doses experienced durable reductions in serum agt of more than 90 throughout to weeks reductions in 24 ounce systolic blood pressure of greater than 10 millimeters of mercury were observed at week aid after single doses of 100 milligrams or higher this antihypertensive affected persistent through week 12 in the highest dose group greater than 15 millimeters of mercury reduction in blood pressure was observed we believe these durable pharmacologic effects may support tonic control of blood pressure with a once quarterly and potentially biannual dosing regimen in the study zilebesiran has been generally well tolerated with an encouraging safety profile observed to date the phase i study has two parts that are designed to assess the tolerability of zilebesiran during potential augmented pharmacology inducing either by a low salt diet or by co administration of the conventional ras inhibitor of zilebesiran these cohorts have completed dosing with data readout expected later this year we also recently initiated our kardia phase ii program with zilebesiran the first of the two studies kardia 1 is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran s the monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate hypertension this study is currently enrolling patients in late 2021 a we plan on initiating kardia 2 which is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran as an add on therapy in patients with uncontrolled hypertension while receiving treatment with standard of care moving on we re also advancing aln hsd in collaboration with our partner regeneron for the treatment of nash we believe that rnai mediated knockdown of hsd17b13 or phenocopying the genetic loss of function findings reducing hepatic inflammation injury and fibrosis in nash patients enrollment and dosing continues in the phase i study of aln hsd which is now transitioned to dosing in part b with nash patients let s turn briefly to our aln hbv02 program also known as vir 2218 in partnership with vir at the easl meeting in june vir presented results from the phase ii study of aln hbv02 showing a positive safety profile and reduction of hepatitis b surface antigen when combined with pegylated interferon alpha for 12 weeks a more rapid and substantial hepatitis b surface antigen decline was observed in the co administration cohort compared to hbv02 alone as a reminder alnylam has retained a free opt in right to co develop and co commercialize hbv02 or to receive milestones and royalties we consider to be quite attractive we have also made great progress with our preclinical program aln xdh in development for the treatment of gal and plan to file a cta for this program in late 2021 a significant unmet need for new treatments to address recurrent gas attacks are very painful and debilitating condition and our scientists pioneered rna therapeutics for this condition with broad intellectual property protection we also continue to make great progress on our many preclinical rnai therapeutic opportunities beyond the liver notably we continue to advance our cns and ocular assets with regeneron this includes our aln app program in development for the treatment of for autosomal dominant alzheimer s disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy we now plan to file a cta for aln app in late 2021 representing a small shift in our time line finally in our press release this morning we announced our decision to discontinue our aln cov or aln cov program in development for the treatment of covid 19 this was a portfolio decision based on the availability of highly effective vaccines and alternative treatment options for covid 19 with that let me now turn it over to jeff to review our financial results jeff jeffrey v poulton executive vice president chief financial officer thanks akshay and good morning everyone i m pleased to be presenting alnylam s q2 2021 financial results which reflect another strong quarter of operational excellence across the business turning to our results first for onpattro we generated 113 8 million in net revenue for the quarter representing 12 growth from the first quarter of 2021 and 71 growth compared with q2 2020 this marks the fourth consecutive quarter of double digit quarter on quarter growth following one quarter of flat in growth that we experienced during the onset of the pandemic in q2 of last year u s onpattro sales increased 6 versus q1 2021 and were primarily impacted by the following an approximate 12 increase in demand representing an acceleration from the 4 demand growth delivered in q1 with the increase driven by the addition of new patients on therapy and continuation of greater than 90 patient treatment compliance demand growth was offset by a higher level of gross to net deductions and less inventory stocking in the quarter compared with q1 2021 in our international markets onpattro performance remains very strong with growth of 17 versus q1 2021 and 79 versus q2 2020 primarily driven by increased patient demand broadly across our markets in europe and canada sales from our international markets comprised 54 of our global total in q2 clearly reflecting the benefit of our global commercial footprint turning to our results for givlaari we generated 30 6 million in net revenue in q2 representing 24 growth compared to the first quarter of 2021 driven by ongoing launches in the u s and europe reported results in the u s in particular improved during the quarter with quarter on quarter growth of 26 compared to 6 quarter on quarter growth in q1 as we benefited from improved patient flow through the u s healthcare system with oxlumo we had an excellent second full quarter of sales generating 16 3 million in net revenue in the quarter up from 9 1 million in q1 with growth contributions from both u s and rest of world markets turning now to a summary of our full p l results for the quarter total combined product sales in the second quarter were 160 8 million representing 107 growth versus q2 2020 net revenue from collaborations for the quarter was 59 4 million a significant increase from q2 last year primarily due to revenue recognized from our regeneron collaboration we recognized 0 3 million in royalty revenues during the quarter representing our initial recognition of royalties earned on novartis sales of leqvio gross margin on total revenues was 82 4 for the quarter a slight improvement from prior year our combined non gaap r d and sg a expenses for the quarter increased 19 versus q2 2020 key drivers of the increase continue to be additional r d investment in advancing our late stage pipeline programs and increased sg a investment to support our three commercial brands including the launch of oxlumo also recall that last year in q2 operating expenses were at the lowest quarterly level in 2020 and were impacted by the onset of the pandemic our non gaap operating loss for the quarter decreased by approximately 51 million versus the same period in 2020 driven by strong top line growth and more moderate growth in operating expenses q2 also represents the sixth consecutive quarter that we ve delivered an improvement in our non gaap operating loss and we believe this clearly signals the path we re on toward profitability cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 1 9 billion as of june 30 2021 compared to 1 87 billion as of december 30 2020 with the increase primarily due to the second drawdown of our credit facility with blackstone which occurred during q2 and cash received from the exercise of employee equity awards and purchases of shares under our employee stock purchase plan offset by cash used in our operations to support overall growth lastly turning to our financial guidance we believe our results for the second quarter continue to demonstrate successful commercial execution as a result of the strength of our first half 2021 results we are increasing our full year 2021 combined net product revenue guidance from 610 million to 660 million to 640 million to 665 million representing a 3 increase from the midpoint of the prior range to the midpoint of the new range our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalties and for combined non gaap r d and sg a expenses remain unchanged with that i ll now turn the call over to yvonne to review our upcoming milestones yvonne yvonne greenstreet chief operating officer thanks jeff and hello everyone let me start by reviewing exciting partnership we announced with peptidream peptidream is an industry leader in the discovery and optimization of peptide ligands against a wide variety of receptors through this collaboration we and peptidream will discover and develop peptide sirna conjugates to create multiple opportunities to deliver rnai therapeutics to tissues outside the liver the collaboration has the potential to yield multiple treatment opportunities by targeting disease causing mrna transcripts in a wide variety of tissue types let me now turn to a review of the remaining goals for 2021 for starters within our ttr programs we plan to present 18 month top line results from the helios a phase iii study with vutrisiran we also plan additional regulatory submissions for vutrisiran in the eu japan and brazil in late 2021 based on the excellent progress in enrollment we also plan to complete enrollment in helios b in the coming weeks as we announced today with zilebesiran as actually mentioned we plan to present additional data from the phase i study later this year hopefully at the american heart meeting in november pending abstract acceptance and plan to initiate the kardia 2 phase ii combination study later this year as well for lumasiran we plan to initiate a phase ii study for renal stone events in late 2021 we believe this phase ii study represents meaningful life cycle management of oxlumo with the potential to significantly expand the overall opportunity we also plan to submit supplemental regulatory applications in both the u s and eu based on the illuminate c results with aln hsd we expect to report initial safety results in healthy volunteers from the phase i study turning to cemdisiran for complement mediated diseases our partner regeneron plans to initiate a phase iii study of cemdisiran and pozelimab combination in myasthenia gravis in addition to multiple phase ii studies in pnh we believe the combination of cemdisiran and pozelimab represents an attractive therapeutic strategy for complement mediated diseases we re very excited to file our first cns cta for ai and app now expected in late 2021 in development for the treatment of autodermal dominant alzheimer s disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy this sets us up for potential initial poc data in 2022 and given the exciting preclinical progress we plan to advance aln xdh in development for the treatment of gout toward a cta filing in late 2021 let me now turn it back to christine to coordinate our q a session christine christine regan lindenboom senior vice president investor relations and corporate communications thank you yvonne operator we will now open the call for questions to those dialed in we would like to ask you to limit yourself to one question each and then get back in the queue if you have any additional questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from gena wang with barclays gena wang barclays analyst thank you for taking my question and also congrats on the very strong quarter so i have one big picture question alnylam has been very successful as a stand alone company with established platform several approved drugs and also numerous high quality pipeline assets so just wondering going forward are you willing to be under a bigger umbrella or do you want to continue being a stand alone company and to grow into a top five biotech company as your goal john maraganore chief executive officer director hi gena that s thank you first of all for your comments on the quarter and thank you for your comments on what we ve been able to achieve as a company and i think it s fair to say that we believe that we have a path forward as a company to build significant value it s very evident in the p 5 times 25 5 year goals and plans that we outlined earlier this year as to how we believe that we can build a top five biotech company in market cap over the next 5 year period by execution with our organic product engine and our capabilities to achieve sustainable innovation so it s certainly our plan to continue on that path but of course we have a fiduciary duty to shareholders and obviously we ll always consider that component of how we have an obligation to our shareholders but our plans right now are very focused on our p 5 times25 goals and our abilities to execute continuously on that sustainable source of innovation so that s how we re focused gena gena wang barclays analyst thank you john maraganore chief executive officer director thank you operator our next question comes from alethia young with cantor fitzgerald alethia young cantor fitzgerald analyst hey guys thanks for taking the question you guys crushed it this quarter i guess i wanted it s another kind of big picture but i just wanted to talk a little bit about as you start to do bigger programs like in hypertension and even ones beyond as you build out your business like how do you kind of think about the balancing act of making that investment and kind of the commitment to profitability because some of these programs are pretty big opportunities so i know i just wanted to kind of get a flavor would you go ahead alone or do you think that these are opportunities for potential partnership thanks john maraganore chief executive officer director yes well first of all thanks alethia for the comments on the quarter we re really pleased with the results obviously and it s a real credit to our overall organization for delivery as they did look we re very excited about the opportunities for rnai therapeutics in more prevalent diseases i think the data with zilebesiran really points to the ability to reimagine the treatment of hypertension a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality around the world so i mean how can you not get excited about transformational medicines that can make a fundamental impact on a major issue of public health globally with the potential obviously over time to help many many people so we re very excited about that direction there is really no reason why we aren t able to advance these assets on our own we have a great team we have a proven track record of execution on the r d side and there s simply no reason why we have any need for capabilities or even funding from third party partners but obviously we also want to make sure that we navigate our path toward sustainable and ultimately profitable business in a responsible manner so we are very thoughtful about how we balance our opex investments along with the growth in our revenues toward a sustainable financially sustainable self sustainable profile and so that is a core part of our strategy let me with those intros let me first start with jeff and then transfer over to yvonne to comment a little bit more about our sort of going forward views but jeff do you want to talk first on the financials and then yvonne with a little bit about our perspectives on growth in the prevalent disease markets jeffrey v poulton executive vice president chief financial officer yes i think i agree with everything you said john and one of the metrics in p 5 times25 goals is getting to profitability across the period and we re committed to doing that i think the one other comment that i would make as it relates to zilebesiran is from a commercial standpoint our hope is that we ll be able to leverage infrastructure that hopefully we will have built by them from a perspective of supporting an expansion of the ttr franchise if we re successful in the apollo b and helios b studies to get into a larger sort of cardiomyopathy footprint so that s one factor as well john maraganore chief executive officer director and yvonne do you want to comment a little bit more strategically going forward how we think of this yvonne greenstreet chief operating officer no i think actually both of you have covered this well we believe we re a unique company and we have every intention of building a top five biotech and we have every intention of progressing all of our opportunities obviously in a thoughtful fashion john maraganore chief executive officer director thank you yvonne did that answer your question alethia alethia young cantor fitzgerald analyst yes it s great thank you guys john maraganore chief executive officer director thank you operator our next question comes from joseph stringer with needham company john maraganore chief executive officer director joseph i can t hear you are you on mute operator joseph your line is open you can ask your question john maraganore chief executive officer director maybe we should go to the next question operator okay our next question comes from maury raycroft with jefferies maury raycroft jefferies analyst hi good morning everyone congrats on the quarter thanks for taking my question i was wondering if you can talk about the parallels between zilebesiran and inclisiran and investors should be thinking about and is there anything additional you could say about the kardia 2 design including whether it s going to be dosing every three months or six months and lastly if you can provide any perspective into what time lines look like for both kardia 1 and 2 john maraganore chief executive officer director fantastic let me start my comments and then maybe akshay you can chime in here on some more of the specifics on the kardia program and the dosing regimen for starters i mean look we re very again very excited about zilebesiran and its potential to reimagine the treatment of hypertension and you re very right maury to point to the analogy with inclisiran because both srnas are designed to address both very prevalent diseases one is in hypercholesterolemia with inclisiran the other hypertension with zilebesiran and both of course enable a very infrequent dose regimen to control these leading causes of cd morbidity mortality in both cases right with hdl and ldl i d say from a development program standpoint what s attractive strategically about both efforts is that the biomarker or the clinical marker that we re measuring in our phase i studies and our phase ii studies in the case of zilebesiran blood pressure and in the case of inclisiran ldl cholesterol those are the exact same endpoints that will be used in our phase iii trials in support of an approval and so it is attractive that we have completely derisked the primary endpoint of what will ultimately be a phase iii study with zilebesiran and that s a very analogous situation to what we had with inclisiran in the setting of hypercholesterolemia so a very attractive profile and of course we re very very encouraged by the safety profile that we saw with inclisiran in thousands of patients that were studied and we re obviously aiming to achieve a similar result with zilebesiran as we do further studies with that agent so at a high strategic level that is those are some of the reasons why there s a lot of analogies between inclisiran and zilebesiran so with that akshay maybe you can talk a little bit about more of the kardia program some of the time lines there as well as some of the dosing approaches q3 monthly or q6 monthly so akshay take it away akshay vaishnaw president research development yes thanks john so maury as zilebesiran we ll execute two phase ii studies kardia 1 is looking at zilebesiran in as a monotherapy in patients with multimode hypertension about just shy of 400 patients 375 or so in that study orthodox randomized controlled study and that will be comp that study is up and running that we complemented by kardia 2 which will kick off in the months to come later this year and there we will evaluate in kardia 2 the combination of zilebesiran with other antihypertensial medications and of course that will include ras inhibitors calcium channel blockers diuretics there are more details to come that study will be larger about 650 patients or so we re not guiding right now to the exact completion date of both studies they re just getting going as i said and more details to come later in the year as recruitment ramps up but this is hypertension so we re anticipating enrollment will go relatively quickly and so we re looking forward to an exciting outcome building on the very promising data from the phase i that john has already commented on with reference to dose and regimen that there ll be a spectrum of doses evaluated again more details to follow but i can reiterate that we ll be looking at both three and six monthly dosing regimens in these studies and so we ll have a conference if you look at pharmacology of the drugs and put us in a good position to select the right dosing regimen for further development in phase iii so i hope that s helpful maury maury raycroft jefferies analyst very helpful thanks for taking my question john maraganore chief executive officer director thanks maury operator our next question comes from salveen richter with goldman sachs salveen richter goldman sachs analyst good morning thanks for taking my question just given your agreement with peptidream could you just talk about extrahepatic targets that you re or tissues that you re looking to target beyond cns john maraganore chief executive officer director yes thanks salveen let me start and then i ll hand it over to akshay to talk a little bit further we re obviously very excited about the agreement that we formed last week with peptidream as yvonne said in her remarks peptidream is really a leading company in peptide design and synthesis and obviously working with them is part of our continued investment in extrahepatic delivery where we ve already been very successful in cns and ocular so we re very excited about that so akshay do you want to talk a little bit about how we look at the future of extrahepatic delivery and tissues of interest akshay vaishnaw president research development yes so salveen of course we re interested in a range of organs for several reasons one is that rnai as a pharmacologic activity can be conducted in any tissue any cell in the body so we can take an srna to any cell type and expect to see target lock down and we can say that with confidence and if you combine that with the possibility that they re genetically validated and oncologically validated targets in many many different tissues we ve got broader ambitions with peptidream beyond the liver so of course we re already in the cns ni that we have several options there in terms of the kind of conjugates we ve built i m sure we can add to those with peptidream and then there ll be new tissues you ll be hearing about from us but you can remain confident that this collaboration is being conducted to really maintain and extend our leadership position in rnai and we believe that by the end of the decade we ll see rnai in many many different tissues beyond the liver and approved programs associated with that salveen richter goldman sachs analyst thank you john maraganore chief executive officer director thanks salveen operator our next question comes from paul matteis with stifel paul matteis stifel analyst great thanks so much i was wondering if you could give any comments on the expansion of the chair role and if there s any sort of back story to that or any relationship to the prior onpattro investigation that was announced earlier this year in terms of marketing and then just one question on apollo b what do you assume for the number of events in that study in terms of mortality and hospitalization and do you think that there s a chance to show at least some sort of convincing numerical difference versus placebo thanks so much john maraganore chief executive officer director well i ll take the first part paul and then akshay you should obviously address the apollo b thing so yes we announced this morning the appointment of mike bonney in an expanded role he s obviously been our chairman but we ve now expanded his role as the executive chair of the company and this is really to help us continue and further strengthen our overall ethics and compliance function within the company an area that we re extremely committed to having a high quality best in class type of organization and its integration within the business so that s what we ve done mike is an extremely experienced commercial leader i have worked with mike for many many years i know him obviously extremely well and so we welcome him in this new governance role in a way that really is just aimed to help us continue to be the best company we could possibly be across every dimension of what we do and mike brings a lot of experience to that side of it so akshay do you want to handle the apollo b question akshay vaishnaw president research development yes paul i think it s clear to everybody in the primary endpoint 6 minute walk distance and that s how we powered the study from the beginning it s the most efficient way to show potentially the benefit of patisiran in the att cardiomyoptahy population so we re looking forward to that result in the middle of next year the study is fully enrolled of course and that s exciting now vis a vis the specifics of mortality and hospitalization study wasn t powered around that and we look forward to seeing those data it s hard to tell right now of course because the study is blinded and so forth to comment on the exact nature of those data and what we ll see we hope to see a trend but that s something we ll have to wait for next year john maraganore chief executive officer director does that answer your questions paul matteis stifel analyst fair enough yes absolutely thanks operator our next question comes from ritu baral with cowen ritu baral cowen analyst hi guys thanks for taking the question given the rapid time lines for helios b especially relative to apollo b versus initial expectations john what are your i guess current thoughts on a potential interim continue to be a point of client conversations and also obviously feeds into the whole breakeven question and then a very quick follow up for tolga and jeff q2 was great but apparently since we can t have nice things the delta variant is going to be hitting q3 what are you seeing so far and what might the impact be there thanks john maraganore chief executive officer director okay that s great let me start with the ia then we ll akshay you may want to comment on the ia after that and then we ll go to tolga on your question for delta variant and perspectives on q3 we obviously aren t going to foreshadow q3 but we can give you some sense from a at least our view so regarding the interim analysis ritu when we designed helios b we included the and with alignment of both the fda and ema we included the ability to do an interim analysis that was not at that time specified because we wanted to have more time in the study to basically understand how and what type of interim analysis we might do we continue to believe that an interim analysis could be useful in the study but obviously we have the beautiful benefit of the apollo b readout that will occur sometime this time next year that will give us line of sight on mortality and cv events that are happening in that study and the wisdom and any trends that we might see in the wisdom of doing an earlier interim analysis in helios b as it relates to that study now it s extremely good that we also have killed it on the enrollment of helios b as it relates to the study and the fact that the ultimate ending data of that study has now been accelerated significantly so obviously all these things will factor into our decision but that decision which includes regulatory alignment of course won t be really happening until next year akshay anything to add to the ia side of things akshay vaishnaw president research development no i think you covered it john john maraganore chief executive officer director okay terrific and so let s now go to tolga to comment a little bit on his perspectives on q3 as it relates to the delta variant tolga tolga tanguler chief commercial officer yes absolutely thank you for that question look i mean we obviously as an organization learned a lot and built a lot of capabilities that includes alternative sites of care home care when it s possible and how we have been able to continue to engage with physicians and other important customers and that will stay with us regardless of where the delta variant is going to go we clearly were able to take advantage of the healthcare systems opening up and that has obviously been reflected on our ability to inform and communicate with our key stakeholders in the near term we don t anticipate a significant impact given the success of the vaccine but obviously like everyone else we are observing and continuing to build our capabilities and the learnings that we ve had since 2020 john i don t know if you have anything else to add to that john maraganore chief executive officer director no i think you nailed it i would just say obviously ritu our confidence is partially reflected in our new guidance range which we upped to 640 million to 665 million this morning so obviously we wouldn t have done that if we felt didn t feel confident around our ability to continue to perform for the rest of the year and i think that speaks for itself ritu baral cowen analyst great thanks john maraganore chief executive officer director great thanks to you too operator our next question comes from tazeen ahmad with bank of america tazeen ahmad bank of america analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question john maraganore chief executive officer director good morning tazeen ahmad bank of america analyst so mine is going to also be on attr can you give us some color about why you think the enrollment rate of helios b is much faster than you might have anticipated initially and then can you give us any idea of the profile of the patients that are being enrolled in helios b are they in any way really different from the profile that s been enrolled in apollo b and i guess i m trying to get a little bit of color on whether or not we can make any read through as estimates based on what you show for apollo b as read through to helios b thank you john maraganore chief executive officer director those are great questions tazeen i m going to just pass them both over to akshay akshay why don t you handle them akshay vaishnaw president research development yes so the enrollment in helios b has gone extremely well and i think few of the major factors are we obviously have a validated platform we get excellent ttr knockdown ttr knockdown is a proven approach in hattr amyloidosis with peripheral neuropathy it s of great interest in the cardiomyopathy space as you know the data from the original apollo study would suggest that in the cardiomyopathies in hattr patients that are these important effects on biomarkers post hoc analysis showing mortality and hospitalization so all of these bode well and i think are very promising in terms of the hope for both patisiran and vutrisiran in the various studies including helios b for vutrisiran so i think that s helped a lot this great interest of course vutrisiran is once every three months subcutaneously and we re also investigating once every six months so that s a very exciting value proposition for patients it s convenient and an effective way we hope to treat the disease i m sure that s an attractive factor we ve heard that from folks and that s especially important in these covid times so you don t have to see patients as much and then finally we have enormous experience in the ttr space in terms of working with investigators working with patients and working globally at triple digit couple of sites that we now know through our work and so that s been very effectively leveraged by our clinical development team and clinical operations team so those are some of the factors and we look forward to the results in due course now your other question related to similarity of the patient population at a high level i would say yes indeed they are largely similar and they are basically patients with attr cardiomyopathy which could be hereditary or wild type ithink we anticipate seeing more wild type patients in the in both studies and they ll have a substantial burden of disease in terms of patients with 1 two in some patients with class iii disease so i think the apollo readout and as john emphasized on an earlier question for regarding the interim analysis for helios b is an important readout will give us the great insight that will then leverage to make decisions around the ia for helios b tazeen ahmad bank of america analyst okay thanks for that maybe just to follow up akshay sometimes when studies enroll faster than expected and investors can get a little concerned about whether or not the quality of the patients being enrolled is ideal now obviously you can only give a limited amount of information on this question but is that a concern at all for you thank you akshay vaishnaw president research development yes i mean we monitor the quality of our study is obviously very very carefully just for the reasons that you say i think we ve established a good track record we have three approved drugs that we ve executed numerous phases 1 two and three studies now and so we re confident that the quality control systems we have in place when we do clinical trials are adequate and you can rest assured that we ve been paying a lot of attention to these studies patients coming into apollo b and helios b studies inclusion exclusion criteria the patient management through the studies and of course we do a lot of work ourselves and in collaboration with our cro so there are numerous points of control and so i think really the rapid enrollment is more a reflection of the tremendous work by my colleagues and the attractiveness of the hypothesis and vutrisiran as a drug as opposed to something awry in the study so we re feeling good john maraganore chief executive officer director i m going to be less british there should be 0 concern about that tazeen ahmad bank of america analyst okay thank you john maraganore chief executive officer director thank you operator our next question comes from mani foroohar with svb leerink mani foroohar svb leerink analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question first let s start with the peptidream collaboration we ve seen some early but interesting data with other oligo approaches using an antibody targeting approach specifically in skeletal muscle do you want to give us a little bit sense of how you think about that data versus the unique advantage of peptidream approach and sort of the scope of extra hepatic targets are there specific tissue types that you think the peptidream collaboration are especially well suited for and then secondarily more sort of a more commercial question presuming that we continue to see reasonable vaccine protection against the delta variant with booster doses that we ve seen from there from pfizer and j j where are we in terms of how many innings in are we in terms of the recovery in clinical volumes and is there additional tailwind to be had there commercially on growth acceleration across the existing pipeline i m sorry across the commercial platform john maraganore chief executive officer director could you mani could you repeat the second part of your question again covid impact and yes mani foroohar svb leerink analyst yes it s how much presuming that we don t have a that we don t have a return to lockdown sort of dynamic how much runway is there any of the rebounds in clinical volumes and how much of the tailwind remains john maraganore chief executive officer director good okay all right so akshay do you want to handle the peptidream question and then tolga maybe you can address mani s question on tailwinds on that side so go ahead akshay akshay vaishnaw president research development yes so mani broadly speaking we ourselves have invented a number of delivery systems for rnai therapeutics to deliver to the nervous system in the eye of course we ve been very open with the lit nanoparticle approach from onpattro and then the galnac conjugates for the liver and then we have novel conjugates which we haven t shared as many details for the central nervous system in the eye and so i m confident that over the period of time that there ll be many many approaches that we and others will come up with as you said a published on antibody targeting via the transient receptor for muscle some of the advantages of peptide based approaches of course are screening specificity ease of manufacture cogs there are many many advantages i think will probably have a much more diverse library that we can tap in fact we know we have a much more diverse library we with peptidream and so we can we ll be able to reach a vast array of receptors for internalization of rs rnas and so it s really a very exciting collaboration we ourselves have some pilot data they have pilot data and so more details to come but i think this really opens up an enormous number of possibilities from now john maraganore chief executive officer director tolga do you want to handle the second question tolga tanguler chief commercial officer sure absolutely mani look obviously having seen the healthcare systems opening up we ve been able to generate a pretty healthy growth of quarter over quarter and due to that we were able to increase our guidance for the full year now looking at the future obviously we re very pleased with the capabilities that we ve built which helps us a lot tremendously if you look at our accuracy rates if you look at how we ve been able to engage with our customers those numbers have been relatively steady the big remaining question is going to be depending on our ability to find new patients is if the healthcare systems close down significantly which we don t anticipate obviously that impacts some category growth but what we ve been able to achieve so far in the first half of the year and through 2020 i think should demonstrate that we ve been able to navigate in an environment were rather limited with the healthcare systems the more it opens up it will certainly help us to be able to continue to grow at that state rate that we ve been able to demonstrate john maraganore chief executive officer director yes and i would just add thanks tolga and i would just add mani to your question that we know that there s still going to be more and more patients that come back into the healthcare system i think we all know it that people have stayed out because of concerns and as time goes on we re going to see more coming back so i think this is an opportunity for more headwinds more tailwinds rather for the future because of just return into the healthcare system in normal care cycles that are going to be important going forward mani foroohar svb leerink analyst great thanks for answering the question guys john maraganore chief executive officer director thank you operator our last question comes from luca issi with rbc capital luca issi rbc capital analyst well fantastic thanks for squeezing me in congrats on all the progress two quick ones here the first can you maybe talk a little bit more about the ikaria platform here i find it interesting that in your press release you mentioned that the platform is both long acting and reversible so wondering if you can offer any color on how you re planning to do both and then the second one on fitusiran obviously data in early 2022 but wondering if you can comment on the ultimate commercial opportunity for this product given the evolving competitive landscape in both hemophilia a and hemophilia b thank you john maraganore chief executive officer director great thanks luca two great questions let me answer both and then akshay you can jump in if you have additional views look we re very excited about the ikaria platform ikaria by the way is an island in greece that s one of these booze on islands where people live for a long time so we like greek islands and we like people living for a long time but the foundation the scientific foundation for this is going to be something that we present relatively soon sometime in the fall at a scientific meeting and i think what you re going to see is really continued evidence of alnylam innovation and alnylam and genuity as it relates to rna interference so the reason it s both long acting and reversible is it s rnai we re targeting rna we re not targeting dna which has got a lot of uncertainties and risks associated with it and so by targeting rna with our rnai platform and with some adjustments that we made to it we re able to achieve both long acting and reversible and i think importantly as well luca a deeper level of knockdown so it s really got many attributes that we think are exciting and ttrsc04 will be the first program providing annual dosing almost a vaccine for the treatment of hattr and more broadly attr amyloidosis so very very exciting now on fitusiran that s our program in hemophilia what sanofi has said is that they re planning to have a filing a regulatory filing in the second half of next year they continue to be very excited about the program as are we and while the landscape in hemophilia certainly is evolving and has evolved with the introduction of hemlibra it s fair to say that there are many aspects of the fitusiran profile including its effectiveness potential effectiveness in hemophilia b where there is no subcutaneous treatment option today and that s a while smaller than hemophilia a it s still a very sizable market opportunity and some of the longer acting factors that were being developed for hemophilia b have not panned out as successfully namely idelvion from csl so there really is a very nice opportunity just in hemophilia b alone and then obviously the opportunity to compete in the hemophilia a market against hemlibra is something which sanofi is quite keen on doing as well gene therapy is coming as well but i think that s going to really be niched in the whole hemophilia segment at the end of the day so akshay anything to add to those two comments i just made akshay vaishnaw president research development no you covered it john luca issi rbc capital analyst thanks so much john maraganore chief executive officer director excellent excellent all right thank you so i think that was the last question so let me thank everybody for joining us on this call we re obviously really happy with our second quarter results and overall results in 2021 and we re really looking forward to the next six months of the year and what we can deliver from our science as well as our commercial execution and we re very much on our way toward p 5 times25 so it s an exciting time for alnylam by all accounts

click to enlarge wendy kagan the deer tick nymph embedded in my daughter s calf was hardly an invited guest on our summer vacation to block island but there it was the size of a poppy seed it could ve easily escaped attention yet my 12 year old has fighter pilot radar for the potentially disease toting little buggers upon learning that we hadn t packed our tick tweezers she dug her fingernails in with gusto removing most of it there s a reason why no doctor recommends such a tactic which often leaves bits of dismembered tick inside the skin i doused the site with alcohol but that night a rash bloomed around the raised bump prompting a panicked facetime with my father an md with no pharmacy on the island he ordered doxycycline in the morning from the mainland delivered same day via plane as i pulled myself away from the beach to meet the rx cargo at the sleepy island airport i thought there s got to be a better way to keep lyme off our backs that is medical speak tells us that lyme disease is a vector borne illness caused by the borreliabacteria that s transmitted to humans by infected ixodes ticks we know it locally as the scourge of the northeast from virginia to maine the reason our kids can no longer roll laughing down grassy hills and why our stomachs turn at the thought of strolling romantically through waving meadows a la vintage merchant ivory films the kiss scene amid hip high italian poppies in a room with a view is ruined forever thanks borrelia according to the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc about 476 000 americans may get lyme disease each year and incidence is growing in endemic regions of the us and europe that s a lot of misery depending on the stage of infection if left untreated after flu like early symptoms lyme can spread to the joints heart and nervous system yet one day we might be able to saunter less fearfully again through the woods and unmown fields and that is not the stuff of fantasy but of science two promising new preventive therapies both currently in clinical studies could potentially stop lyme in its tracks one is a preexposure prophylaxis or prep shot developed by massbiologics to be taken annually at the start of tick season for months long protection the other is a vaccine candidate vla15 developed by french biotech firm valneva in collaboration with pfizer the american multinational firm behind the pfizer biontech mrna vaccine for covid 19 if all continues to go well in the trials both could come to market as early as 2024 offering two protective options to an arsenal against lyme that has been nearly empty for decades zapping borrelia while it s still inside the tick way back when we did have a vaccine for lyme manufactured by smithkline beecham now glaxosmithkline in 1998 the lymerix vaccine may have been ahead of its time as it met with lackluster demand from consumers the company pulled the vaccine in 2002 and some trace its failure back to the newly vocal anti vax movement which focused on reports that lymerix may have triggered rheumatoid arthritis in a small population of patients since then cases of lyme have at least tripled per cdc estimates yet while lymerix faltered commercially the science behind it offered clues that continue to help crack the nut of lyme preventative medicine today these clues have aided in the development of both lyme prep which is not a vaccine but a monoclonal antibody shot and the vla15 vaccine candidate which just might meet with more enthusiastic consumer demand this time around during the vaccine studies back in the 1990s it became apparent that the thing that allowed you to be protected and immune was an antibody directed against the bacteria and it didn t work in you it worked inside the tick explains mark klempner md executive vice chancellor for massbiologics and a professor of medicine that is lymerix prompted the body to make antibodies against a protein on the surface of borrelia called outer surface protein a ospa so when a tick bit an immunized person it feasted on blood containing lyme killing antibodies which wiped out the bacteria sitting in the tick s gut before it even entered the person s body klempner and his colleagues set about finding a way to replicate that mechanism while avoiding the potential pitfalls of a vaccine we knew the vaccine worked through an antibody that your body made and we thought it would be a lot easier and safer to bypass that and give you the antibody directly he says that s how we proceeded to look for our human monoclonal antibody that would kill the bacteria in the tick the result was lyme prep which is designed to work immediately and provide protection against lyme for the crucial six to nine months when ticks plague us from about april through november a phase 1 human trial is well underway but don t get excited about joining the study yet to make it most likely that we ll find volunteers with no previous antibodies to lyme disease we go to a place where there s virtually no lyme disease and that is a place in nebraska says klempner for the next phase they ll seek volunteers in lyme endemic spots like new england and the hudson valley and klempner knows those opportunities will fill up quickly i get emails and letters every day saying when you re ready sign me up desperate enough to drink twig tea it s no wonder that people are eager to help advance the science of lyme in new york most of us either have our own lyme war story or we ve got family or friends who ve struggled with the illness for colette stock a registered nurse in lake hill the saga began back in 1994 when she was a young mother in nursing school that summer i had flu like symptoms but i didn t think anything of it because lyme wasn t prevalent in ulster county at the time she recalls i put the pieces together later remembering that i d walked through a swampy area and about six weeks afterwards my daughter had found a round rash on the back of my head unfortunately it took me a while to get diagnosed and by that time it was already invested in my neurological system once that happens lyme can become chronic then came a procession of strange symptoms pain between her shoulder blades heart palpitations dizziness extreme fatigue in december this excruciating pain set in and i started to feel like i couldn t walk she says i d be in bed four to six hours a day i would get up to make sure that had what she needed and then go back to bed doctors doubted her story sometimes accusing her of seeking pain pills which she never took or telling her she was depressed a lot of the doctors i went to were totally uneducated with regard to lyme she says you have to go to a lyme literate doctor and they don t take insurance i would go for a round of iv antibiotics and they d give me a 600 bill and i had to do it three times a week you also take supplements and try alternative treatments that are expensive too once she visited an itinerant healer in vermont who gave her a bag of twigs and told her to make a tea and drink it three times it looked like he went into the woods and just picked up a handful of twigs and the tea smelled so bad she recalls but you get so desperate to feel better you try anything stock estimates that she s spent well over 150 000 on treatments over the years she s been in and out of remission several times and was reinfected in 2005 when she contracted babesia a lyme coinfection she s technically in remission after a successful round of iv antibiotics three years ago but she still occasionally suffers from joint pain weakness and brain fog i can t work because of my symptoms but i can t collect disability which i ve applied for numerous times she says that s because the cdc will not recognize chronic lyme as a thing which is pathetic fist pumping enthusiasm for lyme science thankfully many scientists do recognize acute and chronic lyme disease as the public health crises they are and they re working hard to come up with solutions the vla15 vaccine candidate developed by valneva and pfizer targets six of the most common borrelia strains found in the us and europe lymerix targeted only one strain which may explain why its efficacy rate was only about 76 percent after three doses of the vaccine and as a precautionary measure against potential autoimmune side effects like rheumatoid arthritis valneva replaced lymerix s human protein mimicking segment of the ospa protein with a similar sequence from another strain just how effective the vaccine will be remains to be seen after its phase 2 trials which include both adult and pediatric volunteers finding kids to participate in clinical trials isn t always easy but with the heightened awareness and growing concern about lyme it hasn t been a hurdle here obviously there are still a lot of parents who say i d rather have somebody else do it and then once it s approved i ll get my kids vaccinated says jeffrey stein president of stamford therapeutics consortium one of several research companies conducting clinical trials for vla15 but if we all took that attitude then we d never have any new drugs we re fortunate we re able to reach people who are open minded and willing to help in the way that they are stein adds that the kids participating are every bit as motivated as their parents they have to be comfortable with getting an injection three times and having their blood drawn periodically to monitor their antibody levels a lot of them are outdoors kids and they really want to help with this we ve got one young lady who s 13 and every time she leaves she sticks her hand up in the air and says for science vaccine hesitancy is real and time will tell how it affects the public s embrace of a new lyme vaccine as for the lyme prep shot the fact that it s not a vaccine may work in its favor there s not a lot of preconceived monoclonal antibody hesitancy says klempner noting that monoclonal antibodies have been around as both a prevention and therapy for over 20 years one called synagis has been administered to hundreds of thousands of premature babies to prevent a lethal respiratory viral infection and it s been proven safe and effective over two decades it gives me a lot of confidence adds klempner to think that something similar being used to prevent lyme disease won t have any untoward side effects that you would anticipate going forward another advantage of lyme prep it requires only one shot instead of three and it works immediately while a vaccine needs several months in your system to build immunity assuming that all goes well in the clinical trials and the shots are affordable or better covered by insurance we still have a two to three year wait for both lyme prep and vla15 until then it s essential to stay vigilant a lyme long hauler as well as a nurse stock recommends always carrying a tick removal kit note to self add to vacation packing list pulling them out with a slow steady motion note to daughter no fingernails and placing removed ticks in a zip locked plastic bag so you can mail them out for testing services like tickreport com based in massachusetts will test the little critter for lyme along with coinfections like bartonella ehrlichiosis and babesia if you do get infected be sure to visit a doctor who is lyme literate not all of them are along with lyme prep and vla15 stock has heard of other lyme remedies in development that use the mrna technology we know from covid 19 vaccines as well as new antiviral protocols that may prove effective it makes you hopeful for the future she says but the thing is the ticks are getting worse every year we need to know how to stop this
president joe biden on tuesday called on resistant governors to get out of the way of vaccine rules aimed at containing the more transmissible and dangerous covid 19 variant he backed city and private mandates requiring people to be vaccinated to go about some daily activities speaking from the white house biden sharply criticized florida gov ron desantis texas gov greg abbott and other officials who have moved to block the re imposition of mask mandates to slow the delta strain of the virus the strain is surging in their states and other parts of the country that have large numbers of unvaccinated people if you re not going to help at least get out of the way of people trying to do the right thing biden said related cdc orders new 60 day eviction moratorium amid covid 19 surge biden also renewed his push for americans to get vaccinated on tuesday as covid 19 cases trend upward calling the pandemic largely preventable what s different about this surge compared to previous ones is that we have the tools to prevent this rise in cases from shutting down our businesses our schools and our society as we saw what happened last year biden said from the white house tuesday afternoon biden noted while the u s is seeing a rise in covid 19 positive cases the country hasn t seen a comparable rise in hospitalizations and deaths giving credit to the current vaccines which health officials said can ward off serious illness and death from a covid 19 infection in fact according to one recent study 95 of all overall covid 19 hospitalizations are among those not fully vaccinated he added biden pointed out that cases are particularly on the rise in the south where vaccinations rates remain low but have recently increased he endorsed new york city s move to require vaccinations to dine indoors or go to the gym as well as corporate moves to require vaccines to return to work and said more localities and businesses should follow suit such policies have been barred to varying degrees in at least seven gop led states this is a tragedy he continued people will die who don t have to die the data is absolutely clear we have a pandemic of the unvaccinated at the same time the biden administration is helping other countries increase their vaccination rates the united states has donated and shipped more than 110 million doses of covid 19 vaccines to more than 60 countries worldwide the white house announced on tuesday the biden administration said in a statement that the donations to countries ranging from afghanistan to zambia are just the beginning at the end of august the u s will also begin shipping 500 million doses of pfizer biontech s covid 19 vaccine to 100 low income countries in need officials said as one part of our strategy to do that the president has promised that the united states will be an arsenal of vaccines for the world and is acting with the same urgency to combat the virus abroad as here at home the white house said in the statement biden had pledged to ship more than 80 million doses overseas by the end of june but had only been able to share a fraction of that due to logistical and regulatory hurdles in recipient countries the pace of shipments picked up significantly through july file a health worker prepares a dose of the pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine at the clalit health service in jerusalem on august 1 2021 photo by menahem kahana afp via getty images under biden s sharing plan about 75 of u s doses are shared through covax which aims to help lower and middle income nations with the balance being sent to u s partners and allies the white house insists that nothing is being sought in return for the shots contrasting its approach to russia and china which it alleges have used access to their domestically produced vaccines as a tool of geopolitical leverage the 110 million donated doses came from u s surplus vaccine stock as the pace of domestic vaccinations slowed amid widespread vaccine hesitancy in the country on monday the u s reached 70 of american adults to have received at least one dose of a vaccine a goal biden had hoped to reach by july 4 data from the u s centers for disease control and prevention shows that among those who are currently eligible to receive a vaccine 58 1 are now fully inoculated roughly 90 million eligible americans aged 12 and over have yet to receive one dose of vaccine the white house announcement comes amid an uptick in covid 19 cases and hospitalizations in the u s fueled by the highly contagious delta strain of the virus the delta variant led cdc officials last week to recommend that people who have been fully vaccinated against covid 19 resume wearing face coverings in public indoor settings this story was reported from cincinnati the associated press contributed

the sinclair companies in light of that we ll be doing things a little differently on the call today rich and i will first walk through the transactions and the expected benefits they will create for hollyfrontier holly energy partners and our shareholders after that rich will briefly review hfc and hep s results for the quarter before we turn it over for questions starting on slide three to put it simply the acquisition of sinclair s assets will be transformative for both hollyfrontier and holly energy partners it diversifies and scales hollyfrontier s portfolio with the addition of sinclair s iconic brand and integrated distribution network its renewable diesel business which was the first mover in the space and its two complementary refineries in the rocky mountain region and we expect it will strengthen our financial position increasing our earnings cash flow and free cash flow within the first year positioning us to increase returns to shareholders while we deepen our commitment to esg and sustainability for hep too this transformative transaction provides strategic and financial benefits with the addition of sinclair s integrated network of pipelines and storage facilities hep will have the scale and incremental earnings power to capture new growth opportunities and focus on increasing returns to unitholders turning to slide four this transaction follows a decade of growth since the merger of holly and frontier we spent a greater part of that period expanding our refining business building our renewables business establishing and growing our lubricants business and benefiting from our interest in holly energy partners since 2011 we ve returned more than 3 6 billion in cash through special and regular dividends and an additional 2 3 billion through share repurchases similar to our 2011 merger we believe these transactions with sinclair represent an inflection point for our company we know the holding family well and have deep respect for the brand and the business they and generations of sinclair employees have built over the last century plus we re pleased this family will retain a significant stake in our combined companies and we re incredibly excited about beginning this next chapter as hf sinclair i ll turn now to a brief overview of the details of the transaction on slide five first the hollyfrontier transaction hollyfrontier is acquiring sinclair s branded marketing business and all commercial activities related thereto which build upon an iconic brand with exceptional customer loyalty also sinclair s renewable diesel business and sinclair s two rocky mountain based refineries sinclair s hospitality ranching and upstream oil and gas businesses are not part of this transaction hollyfrontier will create a new publicly traded holding company named hf sinclair corporation sinclair shareholders will receive approximately 60 2 million shares in the newly formed hf sinclair equal to 26 75 of the company hollyfrontier s existing shareholders will own 73 25 of the equity or approximately 164 9 million shares of the common stock of hf sinclair as a result each outstanding share of hollyfrontier common stock will convert into one share of hf sinclair common stock at the closing the all stock transaction has a value of 1 8 billion based on hollyfrontier s closing stock price on july 30 2021 and sinclair comes with no debt upon closing hollyfrontier s existing senior management team will operate the combined company and sinclair has been granted the right to nominate two directors to the hf sinclair board of directors at the closing the transaction is expected to close in mid 2022 and now i ll turn the call to rich richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you mike good morning everybody turning to slide six hep will acquire sinclair s integrated crude and refined product pipeline and terminal assets comprised of 1 200 miles of pipeline eight product terminals and two crude terminals with 4 5 million barrels of operated storage we will also acquire sinclair s interest in three midstream joint ventures for crude gathering product offtake including powder flats pipeline pioneer pipeline and the remaining interest in the unev pipeline of which we already own a significant stake critically this transaction provides additional scale and earnings power to hep is expected to add 70 million to 80 million of annual ebitda over 75 of the revenue on these assets will be supported by long term minimum volume commitments with hf sinclair under the terms of the hep transaction sinclair shareholders will receive 21 million hep common units and 325 million of cash for a total consideration of 758 million based on hep s closing price on july 30 2021 on closing of the acquisition hep s existing senior management team will continue to operate the company and sinclair has been granted the right to nominate one director for the hep board at closing the hep transaction is also expected to close in mid 2022 michael c jennings chief executive officer and president thanks rich so turning to slide seven hf sinclair will be well positioned for the next decade and beyond we expect to generate shareholder value through strong free cash flow increased earnings per share as well as realizing synergies all of which underpin a commitment to deliver enhanced cash returns to shareholders and will fuel our continued growth moving to slide eight hollyfrontier and sinclair share a common philosophy on commitments to environmental stewardship sustainability and strong corporate governance that will endure and be strengthened within hf sinclair the transaction will increase the scale of our renewable diesel business this is a critical step forward as we diversify our business for a low carbon future our cultures also share a deep commitment to safety which is important to us as we strive every day to put our people first do right by our communities and manage risk we also take very seriously the responsibility for supplying the exceptional products that provide our customers with mobility and quality of life and at the governance level our board is equipped with the right mix of skills and experience to oversee the company and ensure we are delivering for our shareholders and our other stakeholders turning to slide nine you can clearly see how we are creating scale in our geographies diversifying our business and building an integrated business with a strong marketing presence with that in mind i want to take some time walking through why these individual businesses are a complementary fit within our existing business and discuss some of the compelling strategic benefits of this acquisition on slide 10 i ll begin with the marketing branded business by adding a branded wholesale business the combined company will have a significant base business and the opportunity to grow this iconic brand across a range of hf sinclair products and geographies through a consistent sales channel the sinclair dinosaur known as dino is one of the industry s most recognized symbols and will represent the brand for hf sinclair we re thrilled to bring on board sinclair s marketing team who will help us to manage and grow a footprint of over 300 distributors and 1 500 branded locations across 30 states with over two billion gallons of annual branded fuel sales the marketing business provides significant renewable identification or rin generation through sinclair s integrated product distribution network the addition of the branded marketing business also provides a consistent sales channel for produced fuels with stable margins as well as additional earnings from brand licensing and credit card programs turning now to renewables on slide 11 sinclair was the first mover in this space its renewable diesel unit colocated at its sinclair wyoming refinery has been operational since 2018 and was recently expanded to produce 10 000 barrels per day sinclair is also currently in the process of constructing a pretreatment unit allowing for further feedstock advantage and flexibility feedstock flexibility generates higher low carbon fuel standard value through lower carbon intensity while also mitigating single feedstock risk the pretreatment unit is expected to be completed in mid 2022 the combined renewable diesel business will have the scale and size to support logistical procurement feedstock and operational synergies and will enhance our esg profile as we help to facilitate a clean energy transition together we will be a leading producer of renewable diesel in the u s with three renewable diesel production facilities with an anticipated production of approximately 380 million gallons annually beyond the facilities the sinclair team brings significant renewables expertise that we intend to leverage to capture further synergy opportunities in short this is a key part of the transaction with sinclair we are expanding our fast growing segment and we will have additional size and scale to support logistical procurement feedstock and operational synergies turning to the refining business on slide 12 we are adding two refineries that are complementary to hollyfrontier s existing refinery network expanding the company s combined footprint in the rocky mountain region together the sinclair gas refineries adds almost 125 000 barrels per day of operating capacity and approximately 5 2 million barrels of storage the sinclair refinery distributes products by pipelines to denver and salt lake city and the casper refinery delivers products across the eastern rocky mountain region and south dakota like hollyfrontier s existing refineries the sinclair refineries are feedstock advantaged given their northern tier access to canadian and rocky mountain crudes each refinery has the complexity to convert discounted crude oils into a high percentage of gasoline diesel and other high value refined products looking at our combined refining network we will feature seven complex refineries in the mid continent southwest rocky mountain and pacific northwest regions with a combined crude oil processing capacity of 678 000 barrels per day with these additions the combined company has an opportunity to create significant value through increased reliability and an improved cost structure rich richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer okay turning to slide 13 holly energy partners acquisition of sinclair s expansive network of crude and product assets provides an integrated system with connectivity to key crude hubs in the rockies including casper and guernsey together the combined company will operate 4 600 miles of pipeline and 19 terminals with over 20 million barrels of storage capacity hep will also acquire stakes in three joint ventures serving crude production in the powder river basin and product distribution from wyoming through utah and nevada consistent with hep s existing business these assets will be supported by long term minimum volume commitments representing 75 of the revenue generated we expect this will translate to 70 million to 80 million annually from this acquisition of ebitda and grow hep to 400 million to 450 million in annual ebitda so let s turn to the financial aspects of these acquisitions we expect to generate 100 million of run rate synergies within the first two years post closing through a combination of commercial improvements operating expense reductions and sg a savings on the commercial side we expect to increase gross margin by 40 million through multiple opportunities such as the sale of legacy hollyfrontier refined product through the branded wholesale business improvements in renewable diesel sales values and feedstock costs from an operating expense perspective we anticipate another 40 million in cost savings primarily through the optimization of the combined company s renewable diesel logistics and improvements from our procurement activities and finally we also expect 20 million in traditional sg a reductions associated with corporate savings in addition to these run rate synergies we expect to generate another 100 million to 200 million in onetime savings during the first two years from working capital benefits turning to slide 15 the transaction is expected to be accretive to the company s earnings cash flow and free cash flow within the first year in a mid cycle environment total ebitda for hf sinclair is expected to be over 2 5 billion per year and we anticipate after tax free cash flow of approximately 1 5 billion per year hollyfrontier s credit profile will be enhanced as part of the combined company through reduced leverage increased scale and diversification of our businesses consistent with our history we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating fueled by significant free cash flow generation the combined company will be able to support a balanced approach to capital investment and cash return to shareholders to that end slide 16 lays the hollyfrontier s renewed commitment to returning capital to our shareholders in the near term as previously announced we intend to reinstate the regular quarterly dividend of 0 35 per share no later than the second quarter of 2022 in the medium term we intend to return 1 billion of cash to our shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases by the first quarter of 2023 for the next 18 months this represents a cash return from 35 to 15 and returns increase from there for 2023 and beyond we intend to implement target payout ratio comprised both of dividends and share repurchase of 50 of adjusted net income bottom line we are committing to substantial capital returns as we realize the benefits of our growth initiatives in renewables and the acquisitions of the puget sound refinery and sinclair oil turning to slide 17 and hep s the sustainable free cash flow we generated by this transaction will support our deleveraging strategy while allowing for increasing unitholder returns in the near term we intend to reduce leverage and maintain our quarterly distribution of 0 35 per unit inclusive of the sinclair acquisition in 2023 we expect to reach a leverage ratio of 3 5 times and increased distributions with a target coverage ratio of 1 5 times and maintain the option to repurchase units longer term in 2024 and beyond our goal is to maintain leverage below three times and increase the distribution with a target coverage ratio of 1 3 times again with the option to repurchase units we expect that these increases to the quarterly distribution and optional unit repurchases will be funded through excess free cash flow mike michael c jennings chief executive officer and president yes thanks looking ahead on slide 18 we ve presented a road map to completion the transaction has been approved unanimously by the boards of directors of both companies and is subject to certain closing conditions including receipt of regulatory clearance we expect to close in mid 2022 and so i will now ask rich to walk through the second quarter financial results for both hollyfrontier and holly energy partners richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer okay thank you mike details of our earnings are available in this morning s press releases hollyfrontier reported net income attributable to stockholders of 169 million or 1 03 per diluted share and adjusted net income of 143 million or 0 87 per diluted share for the second quarter reported consolidated ebitda was 444 million and adjusted ebitda was 335 million our strong second quarter results were driven by sequential improvements in refining margins in both the west and mid continent regions as well as strengthening base on our margins which are visible in the results from the rack back portion of hollyfrontier leads and specialties as well as in the tulsa refinery for the second quarter of 2021 net cash provided by operations totaled 428 million and at june 30 our cash balance stood at approximately 1 4 billion representing a build of approximately 205 million in the quarter for the third quarter of 2021 in our refining business we anticipate running between 380 000 and 400 000 barrels per day of crude oil at hep we reported second quarter net income attributable to unitholders of 56 million or 0 53 per unit and reported ebitda of 88 million all supported by continued improvement in crude and refined product demand within the markets we serve distributable cash flow was 67 million for the quarter representing a 2 increase versus the same period last year hep announced a quarterly distribution of 0 35 per unit to be paid on august 13 to unitholders of record on august 2 and with that i ll hand it back to mike for some closing thoughts michael c jennings chief executive officer and president okay thanks for those details rich the second quarter was financially and operationally very solid ending on slide 19 as we communicated today we believe this transaction will drive value for all of our stakeholders with more diversified and integrated revenues and with increased scale the transaction is a win shareholders will benefit from the free cash flow synergies and accretion which will enable a balanced approach to investment and cash return to shareholders for customers and partners we will extend the reach of our products and network of pipelines and storage facilities and for employees this transaction adds a strong and talented workforce across all of our business segments i m confident that together we will capitalize on the many opportunities this combination with sinclair will provide and with that lauren we re going to open the line for questions thank you questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from ryan todd from piper sandler ryan your line is now waiting ryan todd piper sandler analyst great thanks and good morning congratulations guys maybe could you just talk from a i guess a couple of high level strategic things on the deal i mean after the timing of the anacortes deal earlier this year can you maybe talk about the timing of what s now multiple kind of transformative transactions in a single year what how you view that the environment has kind of driven whether it s more willing sellers or more of an opportunistic outlook from you all and how does this particularly the sinclair deal could position you differently for an uncertain refining environment going forward versus how you view yourselves previously michael c jennings chief executive officer and president absolutely ryan thanks for being on the call listen our company has taken on a major strategic shift in the past 18 months as we ve worked to add renewable fuels to our mix and protect our feedstock economics through pretreatment redouble our efforts to improve our reliability and asset utilization at refineries increase our asset quality and add a high value products market through investment in puget sound and now combining with sinclair to add a really exceptional downstream branded marketing channel increase production of renewables both on a relative and absolute basis and increase our presence in the rocky mountain states all very intentional while also adding a logistics network that knits this together this is exceptionally transformative for us and i think it differentiates us from many other downstream businesses in the business that we have built here in response to the environment that we re now in so we think that hf sinclair is going to be a great place to work and will support the forward leaning capital return strategy that we ve laid out alongside this deal as it pertains to your comment on the market and on asset availability what i d say is this isn t really responsive to willing sellers but rather our desire to build the business in a manner that we think is going to be durable for the future ryan todd piper sandler analyst maybe a follow up on cash returns i mean you ve laid out kind of a near term midterm and long term strategy for capital allocation can you maybe talk a little bit about what metrics is going to drive the reinstatement of the dividend and the buyback you mentioned the reinstatement of the dividend no later than the second quarter of 2022 what would allow you is there an environment that would allow you to reinstate that earlier depending on the environment is there a risk that it could slip further and maybe the same kind of questions on the 1 billion of cash return and the outlook for the buyback is there kind of an underlying cash flow in 2022 to support that expected buyback and how could that swing either way richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer ryan it s rich so with respect to the dividend again it will be reinstated no later than the second quarter of 2022 and we re optimistic depending on the markets to your point that we can come back earlier than that with respect to the buyback absolutely look we as you can tell expect to add a lot of cash flow in the next six to 12 months between renewables puget sound and then sinclair and at the same time obviously our capital expenditures will be falling dramatically in 2022 versus 2021 so free cash flow generation here is going to go up dramatically and we intend to return that to the shareholder ryan todd piper sandler analyst great thank you so much operator our next question comes from theresa chen from barclays theresa your line is now open theresa chen barclays analyst good morning thank you for taking my question maybe if i can just follow up on the last question that ryan asked about the macro environment that underlies your assumptions to get to not just the target ebitda and free cash flow but also the capital allocation target what has to happen in terms of broad based benchmark cracks differentials and the capture what are your assumptions that underlie your expectation that you ll be able to achieve these targets richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer theresa it s rich they re not i would not call them terribly aspirational our internal estimates are not very dissimilar from consensus you re probably a touch lower so really we just need the macro environment not to get worse and again we expect to generate a large amount of free cash under that scenario if it gets better than that it will be even better but really we re not assuming some sort of dramatic recovery or anything exotic in order to get to these numbers michael c jennings chief executive officer and president theresa i think if you take the second quarter as an example our business isn t in a very healthy state right now really all aspects of it are working well we were looking forward to renewable diesel as you know but the base business is solid despite what has been a punch in the gut from covid where we ve recovered pretty well and it doesn t take a big step forward in order to be able to meet these returns targets that we re laying out theresa chen barclays analyst got it and just in terms of the two refineries to be acquired in terms of the breakdown between wcs rocky sweet and other crudes can you provide a percentage range of each michael c jennings chief executive officer and president yes the casper refinery runs principally on rocky sweet and that s 30 000 32 000 barrels a day sinclair otherwise we re all in the refinery is more in the neighborhood of 30 000 to 40 000 barrels a day of canadian heavy with the remainder being sweet crudes theresa chen barclays analyst thank you very much operator our next question comes from paul cheng from scotiabank paul your line is open paul cheng scotiabank analyst thank you hey guys good morning just wondering rich can you provide you gave a mid cycle midterm expectation for refining marketing and renewable can you tell us maybe give some things that how those mid cycle number compared to the actual result in the first half of this year or 2019 is there any comparison that we can use richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer so paul i think we ve laid this out in some of our historic ir materials similar assumptions but really we re looking at gulf coast cracks on a 3 1 basis of roughly 10 a barrel historic cleaning paul cheng scotiabank analyst but the gulf coast doesn t work in here right richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer pardon paul paul cheng scotiabank analyst no i say the gulf coast doesn t really matter in here it really is more on the rocky mountain richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer right so you re going to trade at premiums to the gulf coast but we do believe that the gulf coast sets the market at the end of the day the marginal barrel obviously we have crude advantages across our fleet that we assume historic mid cycle numbers on and those product differentials that i mentioned paul we assume those to be similar to history does that help paul cheng scotiabank analyst how about on the marketing and the renewable richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer so with respect to the marketing paul this business looks very similar to what you see in publicly traded companies that are out there now that do wholesale you typically see a few pennies a gallon of wholesale margin there s some money to be made in credit cards and brand license branding as well very stable over time with respect to renewables i think to the broader question obviously things are moving around dramatically and mike made the point about pretreatment what we see today really is that the economics are in your ability to process discounted feeds not so much in your ability to take high grade soybean oil and turn it into renewable diesel we expect that that ll move around over time and that s why we re consistent on having that kind of feedstock flexibility at the end of the day paul cheng scotiabank analyst okay and second question that can you share with us that how much is the rin the marketing business generates richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer so basically paul sinclair is long rins they are more or less balanced on the d6 basis and long d4 rins via the renewable fuels business that they ve got so pro forma transaction paul cheng scotiabank analyst can you tell us how much is actually that in january richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think probably the better answer here paul is pro forma the transaction hollyfrontier or hf sinclair i should say excuse me will basically be balanced paul cheng scotiabank analyst and that s including your own two renewable your two renewable diesel plant right when you say you re balanced richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer yes paul cheng scotiabank analyst and when you say balanced let s say you re balanced on a total rin or your balanced i mean individually on d6 and individually in d4 and d5 richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer we ll be balanced on our total rins paul paul cheng scotiabank analyst and how about d6 specifically richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer so directionally we ll be short d6 and long d4 and imbalanced in aggregate paul cheng scotiabank analyst ok alright thank you operator we now have a question from paul sankey from sankey research paul your line is waiting paul sankey sankey research analyst good morning all just if i could continue on the ebitda question so given that you re saying that a mid cycle would be about 1 billion of refining ebitda for hfc based on the report that you just made and what you said about the 10 crack on the gulf coast it feels like we re only about 20 below where we would be on your mid cycle assumption can you just sort of run through some of the elements of that ebitda and how much distance there is to travel if you want before we get to this 2 6 billion that you ve talked about for the combined company richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer so paul i think look we flagged 1 billion of refining ebitda for legacy hollyfrontier right in this quarter we printed about 210 million so to your point we re just a little offset i think directionally if we just get a little more improvement in jet fuel market that probably bridges us home paul sankey sankey research analyst yes i was really thinking more about the sinclair breakdown richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer well it s going to be similar paul i think at the end of the day where you add these together these are all apples to apples assumptions across puget sound legacy hollyfrontier and sinclair michael c jennings chief executive officer and president beyond that paul i think what you re seeing is paul sankey sankey research analyst i guess go ahead michael c jennings chief executive officer and president i was going to say what you re seeing in the last couple of years in the rockies is really ahead of mid cycle earnings and margins and so to the extent that continues that puts wind in the sales paul sankey sankey research analyst great okay and then a tough one for you guys is that you ve had some operational criticisms over the years and you ve had some issues with your renewable diesel project with as far as you sit behind time and over budget what conviction can you give us that it s the right thing for you to be taking on a much bigger footprint in the way that you are and that you re going to be able to do the number one most important thing which is run the assets well and efficiently and i know that s a tough question to answer but i have to ask it timothy go executive vice president and chief operating officer paul it s a tough question this is tim let me try to start with this and see if others want to chime in but we ve been focused on the last 1 5 years really a year and two really trying to build our operating capability grow it we ve been implementing operating discipline programs we have an operational excellence management system that we ve implemented we ve got a team management process that we ve laid out we ve been bringing in some additional resources to help shore up our existing capability both on the turnaround side on the process safety side mechanical integrity overall operations leadership we spent the last few years trying to strengthen our internal capability to improve not just the refining operations which i think you re starting to see some of the fruits of that labor here even just in this last quarterly earnings update but it s going to serve as the foundation for us to be able to build on with puget sound and with the sinclair assets one thing i will tell you is we ve got familiarity with operating in the rockies we understand the crude markets we understand the product markets we understand the operating environment for that we have plenty of time we believe to plan and execute this integration keep in mind the puget sound transaction is scheduled or anticipated to close here in the fourth quarter which will give us plenty of time to continue to plan and integrate the acquisition of sinclair which we re anticipating to close in mid 2022 so we think we have time and we think we have the resources to be able to build and integrate this transaction thomas g creery president hollyfrontier renewables paul this is tom creery paul sankey sankey research analyst yes sorry thomas g creery president hollyfrontier renewables sorry go ahead paul sankey sankey research analyst no you go thomas g creery president hollyfrontier renewables i was just going to say this is tom creery in terms of renewables just a quick update on where we are since we last talked at the last earnings call nothing has really changed we re still on track in terms of both cost and schedule all the long lead items have been ordered as have been the critical path items their schedule still looks good at this point in time we re heavily into the construction phase at all three locations that being the two rdu plants as well as the ptu in artesia things are going well no manpower shortages or anything else and like i say we are on track as last reported michael c jennings chief executive officer and president yes paul i would add that i mean our execution you highlight is absolutely critical and we ve got it with respect to renewable diesel we took on a big project particularly during a time when it s sometimes hard to get a pizza delivered but we re nearing the end of it and we re really excited about these projects and we think we can bring them on from here according to the schedule and budget that tom s laid out so we feel like we re in a good spot there paul sankey sankey research analyst yes and it feels like you can point to this result this morning s result and say things are operating well at the hollyfrontier level is that a statement you d make is everything running the way you would want it right now thomas g creery president hollyfrontier renewables absolutely michael c jennings chief executive officer and president yes paul sankey sankey research analyst ok great thank you operator we now have a question from phil gresh from jpmorgan phil your line is now waiting phil gresh jpmorgan analyst good morning you were talking on the sinclair side that the refining ebitda you think is operating i think you said ahead of mid cycle i was wondering how you would characterize the performance in the renewable diesel business right now given that it does not have a pretreatment unit currently and then if you could kind of walk through some of your assumptions to get to the 150 million of ebitda there that we could think about as we try to model this richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer phil it s rich good morning so given they just completed an expansion of their plant given that they do not have a pretreatment unit at the moment it s been a little tough for the last six to 12 months but again they re doing the right thing here and investing in a pretreatment unit that we expect to be up and running before close so i think that s essential to the assumptions we ve made here going forward we re expecting d4 rins north of 1 is what we ve assumed blender s tax credit we now expect will probably be extended somewhat longer than 2022 but we do expect it to get phased out over time and then continue to expect lcfs credits to be higher in the long run phil gresh jpmorgan analyst and do you have a rough feedstock mix for post ptu richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer there will be probably roughly 50 50 maybe a little higher on low ci feed versus high grade bean oil phil gresh jpmorgan analyst okay and so the 400 million of renewables ebitda are you saying that does or does not include some amount of blender s tax credit richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer it does include some amount of blender s tax credit yes phil gresh jpmorgan analyst okay ok and then rich just on i m just kind of like running free cash flow per share numbers of stand alone holly versus the pro forma and it looks to be a little bit dilutive on free cash flow per share so i guess i m just curious how you think about the valuation obviously sinclair has a different mix than stand alone holly but just in general how do you think about the valuation paid and if you agree with my comment richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer so now phil actually look we expect frankly across all metrics earnings per share cash flow per share and free cash flow per share that will be accretive in the first year call it to the tune of mid single digits and that will increase dramatically over time as those synergies come in so now we re expecting some substantial accretion across all the kind of conventional metrics you would look at phil gresh jpmorgan analyst ok alright thank you operator our next question comes from manav gupta from credit suisse manav your line is now waiting manav gupta credit suisse analyst hey rich and mike so if we just look at the 2q earnings right you are out earning your bigger competitors and more diversified competitors and so if you think about it only on a pe basis there s a massive dislocation in your stock price right i mean your stock is 30 your bigger peers are 60 and 70 and so things are actually working out very nicely for you and from that perspective you re about to take all this transformation puget sound renewable diesel and sinclair again if everything works out your ebitda could be 1 8 billion next year but there is an execution risk here there s a lot of things which you ll have to make sure go right and i m just trying to understand why push for so much change when you are actually doing so well on a stand alone basis michael c jennings chief executive officer and president yes it s a good conservative point manav what i would say is that the good quarter doesn t comprise a good strategy and looking at the business environment that we see and foresee we believe that the downstream integration into branded wholesale controlling more of the value chain and serving those customers on a branded basis really is going to help us out both with rfs compliance and with gross margin generation so we think that it s a smart move we also see the renewable diesel business as an important addition as we try to expand in that and have the opportunity to optimize and gain synergies across the two sets of plants and finally adding rocky mountains exposure to us given our experience in that geography is a smart and high earnings thing to do so i guess we could leave well enough alone but we re trying to build this for the five and 10 years forward not for the next two quarters manav gupta credit suisse analyst that s fair one my second question is you did see some capex escalation in renewable diesel last quarter and again it s still the same but i m trying to understand was there a design change made somewhere during the process that would allow you to use a lot more lower quality soya bean oil versus the rdb sic rbd and did that make that was that one of the reasons your capex actually went up because your guidance is one of the cases that should be pretty positive because the lower quality soya bean oil is trading like 0 20 discounts to rdb sic rbd so was that also a reason your capex actually went up on the renewable diesel side last quarter thomas g creery president hollyfrontier renewables manav you bring up an excellent point it s tom creery yes we did make some scope changes as we went along to accommodate the low ci feedstocks predominantly tallo at the cheyenne refinery repurposed refinery that is going to do a lot for us in terms of feedstock flexibility and it also works well with our ptu at artesia as well so it reduces our dependence upon rbd or refined soybean oil and we think it s going to play out well and give us a great amount of flexibility as we move forward that we ll be able to run a variety of feedstocks to get the maximum value up manav gupta credit suisse analyst congrats on the great quarter and look forward to the deal thank you operator we now have the question from spiro dounis from credit suisse spiro your line is waiting spiro dounis credit suisse analyst good morning guys first question just on the strategy for hep can you talk a little bit more about some of the integration and synergy opportunities for these assets at the hep level and curious if that 70 million to 80 million ebitda contemplates any synergies and if you could rich just maybe expand on why these assets provide more opportunities for growth versus some of your legacy assets there thanks richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer sure spiro look it s a very complementary set of assets both in the sense of culture and the way we operate being based around steady refinery customers as well as in a sense of a cultural fit so we re really excited to welcome some new colleagues here i think to your point about growth look i think we re going to have achieve some real scale at a corporate level and in certain markets where we ll be able to i think we ll find organic opportunities that we ve not had historically particularly on the crude gathering side so we re really looking forward to be able to grow going forward here to your question it does assume a little bit of synergy a few million dollars a year it s not going to be a huge number on the hep side spiro dounis credit suisse analyst got it that s a couple rich second question just around the capital allocation outlook once again for hep the reduction in that coverage ratio seems to imply a pretty healthy kind of double digit distribution growth i just want to make sure i didn t miss anything in sort of reading that right and if you could just maybe talk about the mechanics of reaching that goal and then i guess how much if any puget sound asset drop downs are contemplated in that outlook if at all richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so you are correct in where your math is getting you on a growth rate basis i think we will probably phase into that i don t think it ll be a step change there is not any puget sound embedded in that it s probably worth highlighting here on the sinclair transportation side maintenance capital here is very low it s consistent with what you see at hep today in the 5 million ish range so that ebitda is going to flow right through the cash flow per share and distributable cash flow spiro dounis credit suisse analyst alright congrats richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator we now have a question from doug legate from bank of america doug your line is now waiting kalei bank of america analyst hey good morning guys this is kalei on for doug just a couple of questions from me so firstly i don t think anyone would argue the strategic logic of building scale in the rockies but wondering if you guys see any ftc issues on the concentration of assets michael c jennings chief executive officer and president no we expect to have this transaction reviewed thoroughly by the ftc we believe that it s a good transaction for our customers marketers employees and the communities we serve and we don t see it as reducing competition so that s kind of where we are at this point kalei bank of america analyst got it second question just can you remind us on the breakdown of the synergy and i m wondering how conservative you re being given the concentration of the purchasing power and the operation overlap it s fairly robust richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer sure let me give you a little more detail there kalei so again it is about 40 million on the gross margin side by way of example we see plenty of opportunity in the renewable side sourcing lower cost feeds using our scale in that space as well as the ability to consolidate transportation really which is obviously a big deal in the renewable space in the operating expense side again we ll see some opportunities in renewables there s also a tremendous opportunity here in procurement our procurement organization has delivered a lot of value to us in the last five years and we ll be able to realize some real opportunities with sinclair from that group and again as mentioned g a we re comfortable that we can obtain 20 million there so these feel like very comfortable run rate synergies to us kalei bank of america analyst got it and last one if i can just sneak it in are there any tax considerations from net operating launches for asset in sinclair richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer no kalei bank of america analyst ok thank you operator our next question comes from michael blum from wells fargo michael your line is now waiting michael blum wells fargo analyst thank you for taking my question just two follow ups on hep one is there any growth or maintenance capex associated with the acquired assets from sinclair that s the first question richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer so michael i think there s going to be roughly 5 million a year of maintenance capital in these assets there is the opportunity for growth capital particularly with the power flats joint venture but that s going to be driven by rig count and well growth in that area michael blum wells fargo analyst okay great and then just to clarify on the sequence of distribution growth and leverage is the plan going to be to first get to three times leverage and then start pushing toward from 1 5 to 1 3 on the coverage or do you anticipate that those things will sort of happen simultaneously richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer so i think these things will happen simultaneously michael we want to work our way into this again i don t expect a stair step change here michael blum wells fargo analyst great thank you very much richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator we now have a question from jeremy tonet from jpmorgan jeremy your lines is open please go ahead jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst hi good morning richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning jeremy jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst just wanted to follow up on the from the hep perspective here with regards to accretion because the transaction terms on ebitda level looks fairly similar maybe to where hep trade that and so just wondering if you could dive in a little bit more on what goes into the accretion at the hep level in this transaction and maybe timing of achieving that accretion richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer yes jeremy so directionally you re correct so we ll be using marginally more leverage at the hep side which helps and i think consistent with what i mentioned earlier we re talking about very low maintenance capital in these assets so this will really flow through on a cash flow per share basis jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst got it so it s really just leverage here is how we should think about i richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer and again we re not going to add any g a so we ll get some operating leverage there jeremy tonet jpmorgan analyst got it i ll leave it there thank you operator our next question comes from jason gabelman from cowen jason please go ahead jason gabelman cowen analyst thanks for taking my question i first wanted to ask on hfc just understanding the debt and buyback outlook for the next couple of years can you just provide what the debt to ebitda target is once the acquisition closes where you want to get that number to and is the intention on the buyback to offset the shares issued over some period of time maybe the next couple of years or further out just any color on that and then just going back to the strategic rationale on the deal you mentioned you wanted to create a more durable business do you see the need to do anything else to get the business in a place that you wanted or following the sinclair acquisition do you now think hfc post sinclair is in a position to be durable over the next five to 10 years michael c jennings chief executive officer and president jason i ll answer the third question first and then rich will hit the financial metrics and the leverage ok do we need to do anything else to get there the short answer is no we ve obviously got a lot on our plate we ve emphasized execution as being critical and we re really excited about what we have this business model is as it comes together going to our mind be a launchpad but we re very satisfied to integrate it and run it and basically optimize it for the next period of time and focus on cash returns richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer jason on your financial questions with respect to leverage targets i wouldn t say we have a target per se we do expect the closing to be right around 1 5 times consolidated net debt to ebitda and we do expect and then foresee this whittling that down going forward clearly well within the range of an investment grade balance sheet and with respect to your question on repurchases yes absolutely we would expect to be in the market we do expect that the sinclair oil shareholders will be sellers over time and we look forward to being able to participate in the market when they re selling operator our next question comes from roger read from wells fargo roger please go ahead roger read wells fargo analyst good morning just wanted to catch up on a couple of items one getting back to the question on the kind of mid cycle what your expectations are for the various crude diffs that predominantly i guess brent ti or llsti and the wcs and then my other question is on the capex side you gave i believe 590 million consolidated capex and is that just a maintenance level or what all is included in there any kind of a breakdown by segments of the company as we look at refining renewable and the leads business richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer roger so on the crude diff assumptions that are embedded in there is consistent with what we ve shown previously brent ti diff of 3 4 a barrel really we expect no midland differential for the foreseeable future and a wcs differential with these kind of crude prices in the low to mid teens with respect to capex that is a maintenance capital number that you see and it s again it s a mid cycle number freely admitting that there is no actual mid cycle year in capital spending as you can imagine the lion s share of that is in the refineries and is in turnaround so there will be volatility around that roger read wells fargo analyst okay and then one other kind of modeling type question as we look at the renewable diesel and your assumptions kind of a mid cycle you mentioned well i m sorry you mentioned but it was mentioned on the call possible extension of the btc for a period of time what sort of the you run the math are you assuming a 0 50 or are you assuming it stays 1 25 a gallon just curious what you re using for your analysis thomas g creery president hollyfrontier renewables well we tom creery what we used in our analysis is that we expected the btc to continue on unchanged through 2022 and then ratchet down over the next five years at 75 50 25 and then 0 that s the way that we modeled it in absence of any firm information at this given at this point in time so that s what we used roger read wells fargo analyst no that s fine with me i m just curious what you were using thank you operator we now have a follow up question from paul cheng from scotiabank paul your line is now waiting paul cheng scotiabank analyst thank you maybe i missed it did you say how long is the lockup richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer so paul the lockup is going to be worked through in phases over a 15 month period basically the first quarter of the stock will be unlocked at closing and then there ll be a quarter unlocked the six month mark the 12 month mark and a 15 month mark paul cheng scotiabank analyst okay so yes 25 every three months unlocked richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer every six months or so paul cheng scotiabank analyst okay every six months so 25 unlocked every six months richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer so at close at six months and 12 months and then the last one is a little shorter at 15 months paul cheng scotiabank analyst i see okay sorry so six months 12 months and then 15 months all right on the on page 15 on the capex for the sinclair asset of 175 million i think rich you mentioned that logistic is 5 million renewable can t be that high probably it s only maybe 20 million 25 million and marketing since its brand marketing with a wholesale so it s probably not more than 5 million 10 million so it seems to suggest that the refining may be about 130 million to 145 million back out range that seems really high is my math have done something wrong richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer no i think paul the margin the capital numbers in marketing are probably going to be a little higher than you re saying and the renewals are probably going to be a little higher than you re saying but yes i think to be honest i think we ve been pretty conservative with the capital on the refining side paul cheng scotiabank analyst yes because i mean that is 120 000 barrels per day and 25 000 barrels a day in total capacity so one would have thought the capex there for maintenance should not be more than say 90 million or so so i m a bit surprised that so you think that that number could potentially be conservative richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer yes michael c jennings chief executive officer and president yes paul as you heard from tim we are laser focused on execution and asset reliability and we want to ensure that we have sufficient capital in our modeling and our planning to be able to deliver those results so yes it s conservative but for now it s intentional until we really get in and understand more about what we re going to want to do to help to achieve higher reliability across the system paul cheng scotiabank analyst yes that s totally fine i just want to make sure that it s not something related to the speculations of those two facilities and as such that their maintenance capex will be much higher on a per daily barrel of capacity comparing to other assets in the u s so that s michael c jennings chief executive officer and president that s a fair question paul that s a fair question and the answer is no it s our own conservatism to ensure that we can deliver on our promises timothy go executive vice president and chief operating officer yes and in fact paul i would just this is tim i would just chime in that sinclair has just completed investing 1 billion in capital in their two refineries over the last several years as a way to modernize and improve their infrastructure so these are not undercapitalized facilities that we re taking on here paul cheng scotiabank analyst and is there any outstanding or pending environmental emission regulation tie up spending that they need to spend in those two facilities over the next five years oh and meaningful i should say michael c jennings chief executive officer and president it s a normal spending the environmental regulations and our desire to exceed those continues to grow and so i would say it s normal spending as we try to improve our environmental footprint and reduce emissions paul cheng scotiabank analyst ok thank you michael c jennings chief executive officer and president thank you paul operator our next question comes from neil mehta from goldman sachs neil your line is now waiting carly goldman sachs analyst hi good morning this is carly on for neil thanks for taking the question just a quick one kind of on the quarter base oil margins continue to be robust here and hflsp results were strong relative to history in the quarter so can you just talk about your views on the base oil margins in the back half and just what you re seeing around base oil supply demand in real time bruce a lerner president hollyfrontier lubricants and specialties sure this is bruce speaking so we see the environment continuing the way it is through the balance of the year our forward forecast indicates that and base oil supply in general on a global as well as domestic basis remains pretty tight particularly in group three and group one two is a little more balanced but still favorable so we would look for the same continuation of metrics that we ve been seeing carly goldman sachs analyst great that s helpful thank you and then just a follow up around the capital returns point so holly has been known over the years for special dividends and a strong return of capital so you mentioned the regular dividend reinstatement and the buybacks but just curious if there would be any other means of capital returns that you would consider over time in addition richard l voliva iii executive vice president and chief financial officer no carly those would really be the two we ll focus on we look at the dividend as the stable and source of capital return and treat the buyback as the variable obviously we ll have a more stable business going forward but we ll still have volatility in our cash flows carly goldman sachs analyst great thank you operator there are no further questions so i will now hand you back over to craig for any closing remarks michael c jennings chief executive officer and president thanks so much lauren and thank you all for joining us obviously we re really excited about this transaction we think it s incredibly strategic and transformative for our company as we step into an integrated downstream business centered around the dino brand which has been built through time to one of the most recognizable petroleum brands in the country and important enough that we re willing to take its name so this is big for us the renewable diesel business that sinclair has and has built is also going to add incredibly to what we have going on in that space and finally the earnings engine of petroleum refining and what those people do every day to supply their customers is going to fit well within our system it s in crude and product markets that we understand and we re really looking forward to it and all of this really comes together to drive two things one is an opportunity for our employees to have long and stable and productive careers and the second is for our investors to enjoy high cash returns from a company that s intent on doing the right thing so thank you so much for your support and your participation today and we ll look forward to talking to you

available for questions i will now turn the call over to steven roth steven roth chairman chief executive officer thank you cathy and good morning everyone i hope everyone is healthy continues to be vigilant and gets vaccinated let me say it again everybody please get vaccinated i ll start by sharing a few things that are happening on the ground which i hope you all find interesting the u s economy is resilient it s growing i might even say is booming and so is new york financial tech and almost all industries are achieving record results in new york apartment occupancy which had dropped to as low as 70 during covid is now rapidly climbing back with record numbers of new leases being signed each week at higher and higher rents condo sales which had stalled during covid are now active albeit at discounted pricing except i m proud to say that our 220 central park south where resales are at a premium this apartment and condo demand is coming from folks who live and work in new york and that s a very good sign at 220 central park south where we are basically sold out resale pricing is up and that s an understatement a recent spectacular example which is now public is a two floor 12 000 square foot resale that traded at a record breaking 13 000 per square foot think about that our new york office division is now experiencing record incoming rfps and requests for tours including from many large and important occupiers who had been on the sidelines during covid glen and his team are very busy by the way big tech is now very active looking for more space in new york to take advantage of new york s large highly educated and diverse workforce here s an interesting fact a fortune 100 occupier household name who dropped out of the market during covid has come back to market they were originally looking for 300 000 square feet to house 2 800 employees post covid after extensive study and space planning they now need and are seeking 400 000 square feet a 30 increase to house the same 2 800 employees in both instances their projected in office occupancy is the same 60 the fact that this occupier needs 30 more space post covid is contrary to all analyst expectations but that is the fact and we are hearing the same from many although not all but many of our tenants that they will need more space not less post covid one of our analysts and a friend recently wrote that our company suffers from penn fatigue true it took us over a decade to assemble our vast penn district hoardings but as the same goes this is our time here s where we stand at farley we have delivered to facebook all of their 730 000 square feet their tenant work is going full bore the west side of seventh avenue along the three blocks stretching from 31st street to 34th street is now a massive construction site where we are transforming the 4 4 million square foot penn one and penn 2 into the nucleus of our cutting edge connected campus the 34th street penn 1 lobby just opened and our unrivaled three level amenity offering will be completed at year end our full building penn 2 transformation including the bustle and reskinning is 98 bought out on budget and off to a fair start we couldn t be more excited our 14 000 square foot sales center the seventh floor of penn 1 is now open to rate reviews from brokers and occupiers it s busy it is that the sales office is designed as a dealmaking conference and presentation center with multiple building models and videos that tell our story in a clear persuasive and unique way after working with glen and josh in the sales center the market is understanding our ambitious plans to make the penn district the crown jewel of the west side of the new new york by the way every quarter and every year the west side is punching way above its weight measured by high and growing leasing share market share of leases signed aside from our confidence and the market s enthusiasm even at this early date we are raising our penn asking rents we will shortly begin demolition of the hotel pennsylvania to create the best development site in town we expect demolition and shutdown costs to be about 150 million which you should look at as land cost our book basis in this property today is 203 million and we are midstream in the process to make the unique high growth penn district a separate investable public security our best in the business team leaders in the penn district are glen weiss leasing barry langer development and dave bendelman construction michael will cover our operating results in a moment but i can say that overall leasing and occupancy statistics in new york tell a misleading story while overall availability is 18 assets newly built or repositioned since 2000 have a much lower direct vacancy rate of 11 last quarter 88 of new leasing activity in midtown was a class a product it s clear that the market is voting for new and repositioned assets as you would expect class a assets command higher pricing than class b in fact one third higher obviously this is the place to be and you should know that substantially all of our assets are repositioned and in this competitive set new york is coming back to life residential neighborhoods are bustling less so the commercial canyons where office utilization is now approximately 23 remember it s august the vacation month the largest employers in manhattan have mandated a return to work by labor day or shortly thereafter some with full staff in office and others with a flexible program allowing some work from home as i have said before i do not believe that the office will be threatened by the kitchen table and i do not believe that even one or two work from home days per week by some number of a tenant s employees will be a negative to us i for one i m unable to predict whether it will take a month or a quarter for office buildings to be back to full up and the canyons to be teeming again there is no magic date all that matters is that it will happen soon enough last week we announced that wegmans the premier grocer in the northeast region is opening its first store in manhattan at our 770 broadway replacing kmart and you can bet that we will do several more manhattan deals with wegmans the fact that wegmans is coming is creating excitement with it at last count 43 print and broadcast press articles celebrating the announcement here is an interesting fact to it wegmans expects that as much as 50 of its volume will be from in home delivery appropriately from to home delivery we will be investing 13 million in tis leasing commissions and free rent in this long term lease with a 65 gaap mark to market increase over kmart s rent this quarter we announced that we exercised a rofo to acquire our partner s 45 interest in one park avenue in a transaction that values the building at 870 million based on the in place floating rate loan we project 18 million 0 09 cents per share first year accretion last summer we brought 555 california street to market for sale and are unable to achieve fair value we withdrew understandable at the height of covid with travel restrictions and so forth at that time we said we will refinance and this past quarter we did to the tune of 1 2 billion netting us approximately 467 million at share we can just carry on the new floating rate loan is almost exactly the same as the old much smaller fixed rate loan so one might say the 460 million is free money ironically i believe continuing to own this outstanding asset with this superb accretive financing is actually a better outcome in new york replacement cost is rising quickly over the past many decades replacement costs with a dip here and there has risen relentlessly and if past this is pro log replacement costs will undoubtedly continue to rise as far as the eye can see replacement cost has always been a key predictor of future value a rising umbrella lifting all similar real estate values and new york is the poster child of this phenomenon here is updated guidance for our retail business for 2021 we guided cash noi of 135 million and now halfway through the year we expect to do a little bit for 2022 we guided cash noi of 160 million which we affirm for 2023 we announced new cash noi guidance of not less than 175 million you should know that as expected swatch exercised the termination option for a portion of their space at st regis which is effective march 2023 with a 9 million termination fee the swatch owned harry winston store will remain under lease through its june 2031 expiry the guidance above takes account of the swatch termination if i were a betting man and i guess in some ways i am i would bet that we have already put in the bottom in new york that the worst of the best stuff is behind us and that new york will get better and better and so will new york real estate in space in our case occupancy rate tis and pricing have bottomed finally we have a great talented leasing development and operations team all thanks to them thank you now to michael michael franco president and chief financial officer thank you steve and good morning everyone i will start with our second quarter financial results and end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets second quarter comparable ffo as adjusted was 0 69 per share compared to 0 56 for last year s second quarter an increase of 0 13 we have provided a quarter over quarter bridge for you in our earnings release on page 5 and in our financial supplement on page 7 the increase was driven by the following items 0 09 from tenant related activities including commencement of certain lease expansions and nonrecurrent or straight line rent write offs impacting the prior period primarily jcpenney and new york company 0 02 from lower g a resulting from our overhead reduction program and 0 02 from interest expense savings and the start of improvement in our variable businesses primarily from bms cleaning our second quarter comparable results are consistent with the fourth quarter run rate we discussed at the beginning of the year as is our overall expectation for the full year speaking of our variable businesses we are beginning to see signs of recovery with a return to normalcy bms is nearing pre pandemic levels signage is starting to pick up with healthy bookings in the second half of the year our garages are picking up as well and should be fully back in 2022 and finally we have a number of trade shows scheduled for the fourth quarter other than hotel penn s income we expect to recover most of the income from our variable businesses by year end 2022 with the balance in 2023 companywide same store cash noi for the second quarter increased by 0 5 over the prior year second quarter our core new york office business was up 3 2 blending in chicago and san francisco our office business overall was up 2 consistent with prior quarters our core office business representing over 85 of the company continues to hold its own protected by long term leases with credit tenants our retail same store cash noi was down 6 primarily due to jcpenney s lease rejection in july 2020 but excluding the impact of jcpenney s lease rejection the same store cash noi for the remaining retail business was up 9 8 our office occupancy ended the quarter at 91 1 down 2 percentage points from the first quarter this was expected and driven by long expected move out at 350 park avenue and 85 tenth avenue as well as 825 seventh avenue coming back into service with the activity we have in our pipeline this quarter should represent the bottom of our office occupancy and it should improve quarter by quarter from here retail occupancy was up slightly to 77 3 now turning to the leasing markets since our last call the pace of office leasing activity in new york city has picked up each successive month with the vaccination rates high companies are now fully focused on their return to the office with many returning during the summer and a majority expected back soon after labor day predictably the overall sentiment in new york continues to improve as company s return and the office market continues to heal during the second quarter leasing volume in manhattan was its highest since the onset of the pandemic and office tour activity has now exceeded pre pandemic levels with more than 11 million square feet of active tenant requirements importantly office using employment in the city continues to strengthen with more than 100 000 jobs now recovered we re at 92 of the pre pandemic peak while leasing volume during the first half of 2021 was dominated by small to medium sized transactions driven by well capitalized financial services and technology tenants we are now seeing pent up demand from larger occupiers across all industry types as many have formally entered the market there are additional signals that the market continues to fought tenants are now entering into leases for longer terms and asking rents in concessions have stabilized and in fact as steve alluded to we have recently increased our asking rents in our top tier assets reflecting the strong demand for best in class assets during the second quarter we signed 33 leases totaling 322 000 square feet with two thirds coming from new companies joining our high quality portfolio across the city the average starting rent of these transactions was a strong 85 per square foot the leasing highlight for the quarter was 100 000 square feet at penn 1 further validating the market s resounding reception to our redevelopment of this property the largest transaction was a new lease with empire healthchoice for 72 000 square feet our main competition here was newly constructed buildings in both downtown and midtown our new dramatic lobbies in plaza s best in class campus amenity program and premier access to transportation from the data looking toward the second half of 2021 our leasing pipeline has grown significantly since last quarter with more than 1 million square feet of leases in active negotiation including 180 000 square feet of new leasing at 85 tenth avenue as well as an additional 1 6 million square feet in various stages of discussion this includes discussions with several large users newly interested in penn 2 after seeing our vision at the experience center our activity is a balanced combination of new and renewal deals with the majority of our activity with companies in the financial technology and advertising sectors our office expirations are very modest for the remainder of 2021 and 2022 with only 976 000 square feet expiring in total representing 7 of the portfolio and 150 000 of this square footage is in penn 1 and penn 2 as we look toward our 2023 expirations of 1 9 million square feet of which 350 000 is in penn 1 and penn 2 we are of course already in dialogue and trading paper with many of these companies and anticipate announcing important transactions by year end now turning to themart in chicago where the office market is also showing signs of life and tenant demand is returning coming out of the pandemic while short term renewal leasing dominated the market during 2020 activity has picked up with almost 1 million square feet of new leasing completed during the second quarter though concessions are unusually high at themart we completed a 91 000 square foot long term office renewal with 1871 chicago s premier technology incubator for entrepreneurs and have an additional 80 000 square feet of new deals in negotiation two weeks ago we produced our first trade show at themart since february 2020 pre pandemic this show in partnership with international casual furniture association featured the largest manufacturers of outdoor furniture in the country attendance was 10 higher than the same show produced pre pandemic 2019 and feedback from exhibitors and attendees was very positive we have eight upcoming trade shows calendared during the remainder of 2021 including neocon in october the largest show in north america focused on commercial design though we don t expect the tenants to reach 2019 levels this year in san francisco at 555 we are finalizing a couple of small strong leases in our fall other than the cube turning to the capital markets now the financing markets are wide open and aggressive for high quality office companies and buildings and we are taking advantage of the low all in coupons it bears repeating that in may we upsized our 555 california street loan from 533 million to 1 2 billion with no additional interest costs we also reentered the unsecured debt market for the two tranche 750 million green bond offering at a blended yield of 2 77 there was robust demand for our paper underscoring investor support for our franchise and belief in new york city we paid off the loan on themart with the proceeds and added the remainder to our treasury finally our current liquidity is a strong 4 492 billion including 2 317 billion of cash and restricted cash and 2 175 billion undrawn under our 2 75 billion revolving credit facilities with that i ll turn it over to the operator for q a questions answers operator we have a question from steve sakwa from evercore isi steve sakwa evercore isi analyst thanks for all the detail i guess steve first on the retail figures that you threw out i m just curious where does the retenanting of the jcpenney s box and manhattan mall sort of fit into that steven roth chairman chief executive officer there s no credit in those guidance number for any new for any occupancy in that space yet steve sakwa evercore isi analyst and do you have any updated thoughts on just sort of the timing behind that or sort of any sort of initial thoughts on what you want to do with that space steven roth chairman chief executive officer the answer is we have thoughts we have a few things that we re working on nothing imminent and i think that that s all i really have to say about that today obviously the rent that jcpenney was paying us is not realistic in today s market and i wouldn t expect that space to be leased in the short term steve sakwa evercore isi analyst ok thanks and then maybe michael you talked about good activity you re seeing at kind of both penn 1 and penn 2 could you just maybe give us without getting too specific but can you kind of just give us a flavor for those discussions and what maybe your expectations are in terms of kind of leasing up penn 2 in particular michael franco president and chief financial officer glen why don t you take that glen weiss executive vice president co head of real estate sure good morning steve it s glen so we are busier every day at both buildings penn 1 and penn 2 penn 1 we have multiple lease negotiates happening now as you know there s no real big blocks there but we certainly are putting full floors together and the attraction to the redevelopment has been remarkable the new lobbies opened now which has only accelerated the activity people are getting a great now physical feel to how great the asset will be it feels like a brand new building at penn 2 we have daily presentations at the experience center we have rfps in the door on certain blocks we are feeling great about it by the way we re not rushing on it because we know that it s going to be better as the construction unfurls it s early but we re certainly in the market we re in deal making mode but we re not rushing steven roth chairman chief executive officer steve i would just add my two cents i mean the proof of the pudding is that we re in the market glen and his team is in the market every day with this space talking to the brokerage community and to prospective tenants the reaction has been nothing short of astonishing we had never seen it in our careers in terms of the reception as to what s happening first of all the whole west side and second of all the unique program that we re putting together so we are extremely enthusiastic our strategy as glen said is to let a little time pass until we re not in a rush because we have a level of the most important thing that i said with respect to the penn is we are so convicted and we are so enthusiastic and we are centering to the marketplace that at the very outset we are now raising prices so you can take a lot from that steve sakwa evercore isi analyst great thank you steven roth chairman chief executive officer by the way you should put on your construction boots and come over and see us steve sakwa evercore isi analyst i ll take you up on that thanks operator thank you the next question comes from manny korchman from citi please proceed michael bilerman citigroup analyst hey good morning it s actually michael bilerman here with manny steve you made a comment i hope you re well but you made a comment in your opening remarks about a fortune 500 company looking at i think you said 300 000 square feet it was going to house about 2 800 employees and then upon further review they increased their space needs by 30 for the same number of employees i think your firm tends to have a little bit lower or smaller of a lease size in terms of leasing obviously you have a number of bigger tenants but an average lease size of smaller than 300 how are those medium sized tenants thinking about their space so how often does the situation come up where someone s willing that want to take more space and how are they thinking about the total cost of that to get to that point steven roth chairman chief executive officer glen is probably more qualified to answer than i am but i ll give you my thoughts number one you have to remember that real estate cost for these tenants is one of the smallest line items in their p l so there are different management teams different perspectives ok so we went through the wework experience where the whole economics were driving the space per capita the square footage per capita down from what was 250 square feet per capita before down to as low as a stupid number like 60 ok well that doesn t work so a lot of this has to do with what the management s philosophy is as to how they re going to treat their employees so number one from a health point of view that dictates more space per capita and in terms of real estate is a recruiting tool especially in new york so a lot of that has to do with the management s vision as to what they want the space to look like and feel like and what kind of experience they want their employees to have so what i m saying is just to take the road well obviously if 10 people out of 100 are going to work from home they need 10 less space that s not true and so i think it s all over the lot but what i m saying is there s a feeling in the marketplace and in the analyst community that it s a certainty that covid that work from home which was lower square footage requirements by the tenants that s not true some yes many no glen you have additional thoughts glen weiss executive vice president co head of real estate yeah i mean one thing that we talked about in michael s remarks is flight to quality so number one a lot of the deal making with new tenants are an upgrade to the better buildings with the better landlords and the better locations with that we re seeing space plans for a review every day in these buildings and there s been no diminution in terms of space in terms desk sharing etc and it s exactly reflective of what steve said i mean that s exactly what s going on out there on the ground steven roth chairman chief executive officer now just to add to that one of the things we re seeing from all the space planners with whom we deal with all of them every day is management teams want more communal space more hangout space more conference space etc so it s not just the particular cubicle or desk or office where an individual sits it s the entire package and i don t believe in most cases that s going down in fact in many cases it may even go up michael bilerman citigroup analyst and steve how do you think it plays out because i would say most of the commentary that you re talking about is consistent when we talk to the senior management teams of corporations ceos cfos when we talk to the real estate landlords but when you survey the actual employees across the united states they tell a different story right they want immense flexibility how can that not at the tails there will be exceptions but the bulk of the curve would suggest that a vast majority of employees have a different view of how they want to work going forward than how their employers how does that tension ultimately get resolved steven roth chairman chief executive officer well michael you can bet on the employer employees i m going to bet on the employers ok i think it gets resolved in different different ways different firms will do different things but basically i believe in the office as the principal driver of commerce and i believe the office will continue to be the core of a business where creativity decisions etc are made and i think if i use the phrase at a kitchen table i don t think the kitchen tables are going to beat out the office right now there s a very strange phenomenon and that is folks who re out in the hamptons getting full pay and enjoying it that s not going to continue from more than another quarter or two or three so at some point the people who pay the paychecks are going to insist that they re their gang their team their thinkers their creators are back in the office where they can see them touch and feel them and interact now there will always be some work from home or work from anywhere or whatever there always has nobody works a 52 week full 5 day week in the office everybody has some whatever time where they re not in the office but i believe as this plays out the employer s desire to have their staff in the office will carry the day michael bilerman citigroup analyst ok and then just a second question just in terms of the spin off can you just give a little bit more color in terms of where you stand today when we should expect some filings and secondarily whether you are at least exploring private alternatives just given the public market still is shunning office stocks and so is there an opportunity to use private capital or an alternative nonpublic structure to get to where you want to be steven roth chairman chief executive officer the answer is sure we explore all alternatives in terms of creating value every day we are in midstream with respect to the legal and banking etc activity to create the what i call is a separate tradable public security that s the way i like to look at it because i think our shareholders deserve to have the ability to invest in either a menu a or menu b with respect to the high probability is that that transaction as contemplated will be completed you ll know we re not going to predict when we re going to file papers at the current time if some other kind of transaction surfaces we will of course study that and consider that as of now there are no alternative transactions that we re considering and we re on full speed ahead for the the separately tradable security and by the way this is the side and michael i couldn t be more enthusiastic about this idea about the opportunity ok we are fully we have full conviction about the penn district we think what we re doing is something which is going to be totally unique and one of the most important developments in the real estate industry country wide and i think that the strategy is a superb strategy thanks operator thank you our next question comes from john kim from bmo please proceed john kim bmo capital markets analyst thanks good morning steve you mentioned the penn asking rents are trending higher can you provide any color on that as far as the dollar amounts or percentage and should we be expecting the development yield steven roth chairman chief executive officer john i m sorry i didn t hear you john kim bmo capital markets analyst that s ok you talked about the penn asking rents increasing i was wondering if you could provide some more color on that either the dollar amount or the percentage increase and also if we should expect development yield to also increase or should that be offset by higher cost or higher tis steven roth chairman chief executive officer with respect to the asking rents i mean i think that those are published aren t they no so they re not published so we re not going to get into a conversation with them but i can tell you that our conviction is so strong that we are raising our asking prices which obviously if construction costs are stable will raise yields i believe that the numbers that we have in our supplement in terms of rents and yields are the lowest that they could possibly be extremely conservative and we expect over time if we do our job right and we will and we create the kind of atmosphere that we have created at the bloomberg tower for example or 220 central park south with superbly conceived space for our occupiers the rents will go to a premium to the rest of the market we re just at the beginning of this adventure john kim bmo capital markets analyst ok maybe this is a question for michael but we re still a few years away from the penn redevelopment being stabilized but can you just remind us of your capitalized interest policy if there are floors that are unleased do you expense those immediately or do you capitalize on leased floors until stabilization and so then we stop michael franco president and chief financial officer i mean they re out of service then we re capitalizing that interest right we bring them back service then we stop that policy so obviously penn 2 is out of service and that we ve laid those numbers out in the supplement penn 1 today is all in service so i think that s i think it s pretty straightforward john john kim bmo capital markets analyst ok great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from jamie feldman from bank of america please proceed jamie feldman bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks and good morning everyone steve i want to go back to your comments on big tech being very active can you just maybe quantify or just help us understand i mean we obviously saw a lot of big tech leasing over the last few years just how large that pipeline really looks and where they may be going and how long you think it might take to actually see some of these leases come together steven roth chairman chief executive officer that s a question for glen glen weiss executive vice president co head of real estate hi jamie jamie feldman bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi glen glen weiss executive vice president co head of real estate so as you know how you doing we have all the big tech we have facebook apple amazon google we re obviously in touch with them often as you would expect and they re all in mode thinking about expansion in new york as we sit on this phone call i m not going to get into specifics on our discussions or what their plans are but i could tell you the engines are on again and they re revved up to start searching for more space and as their hiring paces continue so just i would be watching for that action as this year goes on michael franco president and chief financial officer jamie i don t think it s surprising i mean i sense surprise in your voice but i mean if all you have to do is look at the earnings growth and what s being produced by big tech by medium tech fintech these companies are growing at significant rates even despite their size the law of large numbers sort of is historically it s been difficult to do so and they need people engineers sales etc to continue to grow their business whether it s laterally or additionally vertically in what they re doing already and so whether it s big tech medium tech new york has continued to be a market of choice for the reason steve outlined but these companies they probably had a four month pause in 2020 they re going gangbusters right now in terms of the earnings growth and they need people to continue to drive that going forward steven roth chairman chief executive officer and beyond that the big tech has a limited capital i mean if you look at their balance sheet and their cash reserves and their stocks etc they have a limited capital and the cost of their capital is basically 0 and they have a limited ambition to innovate and grow and invent and they are not shy of spending and investing so obviously they are favorite clients of ours and there s a reason for that they believe in new york they love the size of new york the scale of new york the ability to open up space and hire 3 000 engineers in one year they can t do that hardly any place else they love the education and very importantly and interestingly they love the diversity of the population jamie feldman bank of america merrill lynch analyst how should we think about the space they just leased i guess do they already feel like it s they have enough heads to fill those seats or it s just all about the 10 year view at this point and get what you can while you can steven roth chairman chief executive officer i don t know look anecdotally one of our big tech customers complained recently that in a certain city not new york they re having trouble filling the seats and they re upset about that we have not heard that in new york new york has a large workforce and they re very happy with it so if you think about it if in the last year and a half or so there was about 3 million square feet of big tech lease something like that so if you take a 200 square foot per capita what is that 4 500 employees so the numbers are large and the beauty of new york is it has the scale to satisfy their aspirations so the answer is they re growing they re hiring and they re going to continue to do that jamie feldman bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok and then secondly you talked about occupancy bottoming rents bottoming i mean can you give us a sense of where you think the occupancy trajectory goes for new york office michael franco president and chief financial officer i mean jamie i don t know we want to give you a specific projections it ll be off by 10 20 basis points here or there but this is clearly the bottom of it it s just a matter i mean again we talked about pipeline it is significant much higher than it was last quarter and i d say significant on an absolute basis and it just depends on when glen and his team finalized the leases right so the number could be two points higher it could be one point higher at the end of the year it just depends on time but i think the punchline is we ve reached the bottom we see meaningful improvement based on what s in the queue and whether it happens this quarter next quarter the following quarter the trend line will be up steven roth chairman chief executive officer i ll give you my opinion as to where this goes if you look at our occupancy rates over a 20 year period we are almost always at 97 or maybe even a pinch higher ok every once in a while over that 10 year cycle we dipped down a little bit and there s generally reasons for that in this case we have a building and transition at 350 park avenue we have a building in transition and 85 tenth avenue and in both those instances we are talking to enough prospects that fill double the amount of space that is vacant there or more so my expectation is we are going to go back to the 97 plus percent occupancy rate that we always carry it s just a matter of whether it takes a year or two years that s where we re going jamie feldman bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok great thanks for everyone s thought operator thank you our next question comes from alexander goldfarb from piper sandler please proceed alexander goldfarb piper sandler co analyst good morning thank you good morning steve good morning michael so two questions and actually steve you just sort of recasted the question i was going to ask i was going to ask you if you still believe in manhattan tilting to the south and the west given the resurgence of midtown grand central obviously you guys bought one park but to jamie s question you just talked about 350 park enough tenants to double the demand so i guess wrapping up because i d like to ask about 350 do you see midtown the grand central market returning as the dominant submarket or do you still believe that new york is still tilting to the south and to the west steven roth chairman chief executive officer i like the phrase that i invented some years ago the predictive phrase that new york is tilting i think that s still the case notwithstanding new york is a great mysterious wonderful place ok so park avenue south which is what s what we call that so midtown south is a smaller but very highly sought after submarket there s not going to be any new construction in there and it s a very it s a great submarket with lots of culture lots of texture and lots of grit and s it will do just fine i think would you characterize 770 broadway as part of that market michael franco president and chief financial officer yes steven roth chairman chief executive officer so i think we own the premier building in that submarket 770 broadway which is now the home of wegmans and of course facebook so now let s go to conventional midtown park avenue has been a stepchild for a while it s gotten older and tighter and that is now changing aggressively park avenue is going to reclaim its role as the great boulevard of commerce in the world so we have jp morgan chase tearing down a building and rebuilding it with a stupendous headquarters building which we re familiar with because they re using norman foster so we have and their plans have been published we own the adjacent building to that 280 park avenue which we re very enthusiastic about there are two other potential there s another brand new foster building up at 55th street there s two more teardowns and rebuilds that are going to happen in park avenue so park avenue is going to become what it always should be and that s a premier boulevard of commerce so all of these parts in the city is not going to be segregated into one or two submarkets all submarkets are going to do well we believe that on a relative basis the midtown west market the penn district market will do on a relative basis better than the others and will grow faster than the others and we ll have higher demand than the others and the statistics as i said about market share if you look at how much leasing is done in each district compared to how large a district is the penn district wins that race but everything in new york is going to thrive except for the really c buildings and there are plenty of them alexander goldfarb piper sandler co analyst and steve you still feel confident on your bet on penn station winning the race over grand central even after the opening of east side access which east side access obviously would be great for 280 great for 350 and your other neighboring buildings but you still you don t think east side access will eat into your penn station steven roth chairman chief executive officer no i think it s i think the look you can look at all kinds of negative issues penn station has always been the transportation hub of this region for 100 years ok all of the networks and all the spiderweb of transportation from the 380 degrees come into penn station and that s the way it s designed now obviously there s going to be grand central is not nothing and but it will be fine there will be plenty of business in penn station i m not in a relative race with grand central grand central is going to be fine we think penn station is going to be a little and that s ok with me alexander goldfarb piper sandler co analyst ok no that s fine and then the question for michael steven roth chairman chief executive officer by the way hang on hang on alex alexander goldfarb piper sandler co analyst sure sure steve steven roth chairman chief executive officer there s an enormous amount of public capital that is being invested in penn now i m sure you ve seen the moynihan improvement which is of course ours all the adjacent real estate to retail etc and i m sure you couldn t be more aware of the gateway project which is a massive infrastructure project and i m sure you re also aware of the plans to expand penn station s trackage which means capacity to the south which is i mean these are huge infrastructure projects which have 10 year projects and take tens and tens of billions of dollars and i can tell you that the government s focus is on penn so we believe in penn and that doesn t mean that grand central isn t going to thrive as well it will and we hope it will alexander goldfarb piper sandler co analyst ok the next question is for michael on second quarter you guys handily beat the street estimates and i m just sort of curious in that second quarter number and steve you mentioned guidance i didn t see guidance but maybe i just missed it the lack of coffee michael is there what is onetime in the second quarter and what is sort of sustainable stuff so as we think about that 0 80 number how much of that is a go forward number and how much of that was just sort of either onetime rent collections or onetime true ups or whatever that would not repeat michael franco president and chief financial officer i think 0 80 obviously includes the gains from 220 so that s looking comparable which is 0 59 which is up 0 13 from last year obviously that benefited from not having a recurrence of the straight line write offs principally from penn in new york company but we had rent commencement at several assets which were positive so as we ve said the run rate which basically closed from fourth were a little bit better or bit worse depending overall yes is consistent alex and so i think it s i think that s the right thing to model for the remainder of the year obviously the trend lines are getting a little better but as we sit here today we re not prognosticating doing better than that yet but i think the short answer is notwithstanding those straight line write offs there were enough other positives that picked up on those things so on a run rate basis i think that s all a pretty good number alexander goldfarb piper sandler co analyst ok and then i think there was a piece of paper that went over the mic you said run rate something about fourth quarter but that it was muddled did you cite anything michael franco president and chief financial officer no my comment was when we started the year we said the fourth quarter of 20 was a decent run rate for the entire year of 2021 and we still think that s the case alexander goldfarb piper sandler co analyst ok that s good listen thank you michael franco president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from vikram malhotra from morgan stanley vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst thanks so much good morning everyone maybe just first on all the leasing activity that you ve done over the last call it 12 months or so can you give us a rough estimate of the noi contribution from leases signed but not commenced michael franco president and chief financial officer yeah we don t have those numbers at our fingertips vikram we ll have to come back on that vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst ok no worries and i wanted to dig into just comments about the ab divide the class a or quality versus more tired building and steve i guess i wanted to get a sense of how you see that divide playing out in terms of rents and tis and specifically for the vornado portfolio i m sure it s a very small proportion but if you were to estimate sort of what proportion today would you need to spend incremental capex dollars to kind of get them up to speed in that ab divide steven roth chairman chief executive officer i think what you re saying is how do we have any b buildings and if so how much is going to cost to fix them vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst yes steven roth chairman chief executive officer the answer is we have none and maybe we have one little space here one little space there but it s so de minimis i can t even put a number on we ve been on a program we ve been on a program that started with david greenbaum and glen 15 years ago to reposition all of our inventory so that it s first class and a surrogate for new now when i say reposition i mean lobbies physical appearance mechanical systems elevators tech service etc so we don t have any buildings that we re not proud of vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst ok great and then just sorry one clarification on the 2023 street retail initial number that you provided that obviously includes rent bumps but does it include a specific occupancy for the street retail portfolio or is that just existing portfolio and rents converting to cash steven roth chairman chief executive officer where s tom tom sanelli executive vice president and chief financial officer new york division so it includes leasing up some vacant space that we have today vikram and it also includes the farley retail which would be something that we don t have in service today steven roth chairman chief executive officer but it s a very small amount of the farley retail so it s if you include the farley retail that would mean it s not really a same store number because we re adding a new space the amount of almost the vast majority of it the vast majority of it the huge majority of it is basically same store vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst ok great thanks so much steven roth chairman chief executive officer thank you you re welcome operator thank you our next caller is nick yulico from scotiabank josh brown scotiabank analyst hey this is josh brown on with nick so i know it s hard to estimate but based on what you re hearing from your tenants about returning to the office after labor day what s your expectation for office utilization after labor day and what would you consider to be a bull case scenario steven roth chairman chief executive officer i think i said in my remarks that one i for one i can t answer that question all of the conference calls that i have listened to is all of my pals have come up with a number and very strong conviction about this is going to happen by a certain date i have no idea there is no magic date but i think i said in my remarks and i ll say it again is that it may take a quarter it may take two quarters whatever it is we believe from talking to our tenants that normal work headcount normal work population and normal theme will return and i just can t predict nor does it make sense to try to predict when that will happen exactly i believe that new york will turn to its robust bustling self somewhere in the shorter term josh brown scotiabank analyst ok and then you mentioned that you re betting on the employers rather than employees when you re figuring out the return to office so i m curious what do you think about the department of justice ruling that businesses can mandate vaccinations for their employees and how do you think that impacts the return to office steven roth chairman chief executive officer i think that s a very complicated question which goes to both law and ethics and i think each company is going to have to i mean basically the extension of that is if you re not vaccinated you re fired now that s a very interesting situation i don t i really don t want to get into what our policy will be with respect to our important employees whom we cherish or what the market is going to do i don t think that s a question for me josh brown scotiabank analyst ok thank you operator thank you we have a question from daniel ismail from green street please proceed daniel ismail green street advisors analyst great thank you just going back to rent you mentioned raising rents at penn district a couple of times i m just curious on a net effective basis are those rents back to pre covid levels or is there still some discounts steven roth chairman chief executive officer in the penn district we re coming off 50 and 60 rents so and i think our guidance in our supplement is somewhere in the 90 number with so obviously we are budgeting in penn 1 and penn 2 which is the better part of 4 5 million fee that there s going to be a 30 a foot uptick and that s what justifies the expenditure the capital expenditure and also that creates the nucleus of our district we believe that we will achieve those budgeted numbers and more so so i think that s your answer is we re not pre covid numbers we re actually it s not relevant because the pre covid number is the old building we re talking about the new buildings michael franco president and chief financial officer i would just add to steve s comment dan and i think where you re going to is our expectations for penn if you look at our aspirations pre covid right they are equal or higher than where they were right and i think the comments on raising rents reflect the market s reception to those and so we are more bullish today than we were if you go back pre covid steven roth chairman chief executive officer yes let s talk about it a little bit our strategy is that we have a unique huge 6 8 10 block collection of assets and property that surrounds the most important transit hub in the city actually in the country our strategy is that we know from the we re developers we re not just owners with developers our strategy in creating assets and redeveloping our assets is that quality is something that the market is willing to pay for and appreciates so if you look at two very prominent examples of what we have done as a business the bloomberg building which we did which i did some years ago is extraordinary it s 15 years into it and it still is cutting age in terms of the user experience in that building by the way a lot of that has to do with mike himself who as a very the interior designs are extraordinary go to 220 central block south where we have achieved something that nobody ever thought could possibly be achieved based upon the quality of the offering that we have given if you go into the two penn lobby which just opened two weeks ago i m sorry the 1 penn lobby and it s only half opened whatever you could begin to see what the environment that we re creating which we think is unique and we know because of brokers tourers and occupier stores already that the marketplace respects understands what we have done so we think that that has an enormous effect our ability to develop our vision to develop on the value of the assets that we are creating there s more we also believe in multiple buildings and clusters of buildings so that we can offer the tenant a uniqueness that you can t get by going into a single building i ve said this before and i d like to say it again a 300 000 foot tenant and a 600 000 foot building is dead if that tenant wants another 100 000 square feet he s going to have to move out or move five blocks away in our complex which will eventually grow to 10 million 12 million maybe even 15 million feet that 300 000 square foot tenant glen will always be able to provide that tenant with what he needs in our complex so the cluster of buildings interconnected above ground and below ground is what creates the district creates the uniqueness and we believe will command a premium in the marketplace daniel ismail green street advisors analyst appreciate all the color steve and just maybe taking a step back bigger picture for new york you mentioned a few times the difference between higher quality and lower quality office building and mentioned new york has a fair share of older class b properties what do you think happens to those office buildings do they get redeveloped and do they stay office buildings what is the long term view for those properties steven roth chairman chief executive officer i think the first part of that answer is it depends entirely upon the owner so if the owner is a single owner or whatever without the resources of the organization the vision and the capital the building is going to stay a c building and it will find its own market at much lower rents and of course that owner may or may not be able to provide tis and may or may not be able to keep the building in good repair so a lot of it depends upon the order and there s that if the owner is a sophisticated firm and a large owner of multiple buildings eventually over time the buildings will be teared down and there ll be new buildings or whatever or they will take the buildings and make them so that they are fit to be leased at decent rents below the class a umbrella so if you get a halfway decent building with a sophisticated capable owner with an organization and a capital base there will always be a low discount rent market for those buildings so that s a complicated thing i don t know but great locations and the great pieces of land underneath those b and c buildings will over time and i m talking about 20 years be bought up by developers and will be teardowns there will not be a huge number of those there ll be one or two of those every couple of years operator mr ismail does that answer your question daniel ismail green street advisors analyst it does thanks steve operator thank you we have no further questions at this time i will turn the call over to mr steven roth for final remarks steven roth chairman chief

some of the city s best brisket ribs and pulled pork was born out of an evanston catering business when co owners d andre carter and heather bublick speak about the creation of their barbecue and comfort food concept soul smoke it sounds anything but intentional the couple left their jobs at defunct fine dining institution moto to focus on hosting underground tasting dinners in their apartment as demand for their cooking grew they established a catering company called feast imbibe to create menus for events and when customers began requesting food for drop off they developed a comfort food focused menu that formed the underpinnings of the soul smoke concept built around chef carter s love of barbecue it was always part of me already it was part of what we did on a weekend carter says explaining his passion for barbecue it was the way you would celebrate any occasion that happened carter s love of cooking was fostered by his grandmother as her oldest grandchild he d often help her prepare sunday meals for his extended family at her home on chicago s south side he landed his first job at an olive garden restaurant and fell in love with the adrenaline rush of working in a kitchen eventually he attended culinary school at le cordon bleu and secured an internship at chef homaro cantu s moto where he worked his way up to executive sous chef moto is where carter first crossed paths with bublick a rogers park native who also interned at the fine dining restaurant before joining the front of house stff while attending culinary school at kendall college by the time they founded feast imbibe together in 2013 they were a couple working hand in hand on menus and the logistics of their business when we started feast imbibe we didn t know we were going to turn into caterers bublick says we were so obsessed especially in the very beginning with making sure that whatever food we made didn t have the hallmarks of catered food for years soul smoke was merely a drop off friendly menu option that feast imbibe offered but carter and bublick always had ambitions to begin offering their barbecue at farmers markets and other public events those plans were accelerated when the pandemic hit and months of catering business instantly disappeared photograph neil burger as soul smoke became one of the first chicago area vendors to provide free community meals for josé andrés world central kitchen carter and bublick also began offering takeout from their small kitchen in evanston in september a soul smoke branded food truck began hauling ribs mac and cheese and other comfort food to diners in chicago and the surrounding suburbs by the beginning of 2021 soul smoke was offering delivery from ghost kitchens in avondale and the south loop if you taste a few bites of soul smoke s tender brisket or its gooey mac and cheese it s easy to see why carter and bublick have been able to expand their business beyond evanston so quickly but even after spending years developing his recipes carter s perfectionist tendencies have lead to continual changes from developing a smoked turkey stock that s used in his collared greens to switching out the noodles used in his mac and cheese no less than three times the day that the tribune review was published d andre decided that he needed a new smoker because the ribs and pulled pork weren t good enough the article only talked about brisket bublick says describing her husband s belief that soul smoke s food always has room for improvement photograph jaclyn rivas chef carter s latest tweaks to his dishes trickle down to every soul smoke location including a kitchen at time out market chicago where you ll find brisket pulled pork and hot links served alongside dishes like shrimp and grits or grilled jerk chicken the recent expansion to the fulton market food hall is the latest step in carter and bublick s plans for their business which include the purchase of a second soul smoke food truck and the eventual opening of a dining room in the same building that houses their kitchen in evanston pending approval by the city chicago s reopening has allowed carter and bublick to resume a limited catering schedule through their feast imbibe business but the couple is pouring more and more of their time into operating their soul smoke kitchens allowing carter to continue perfecting his barbecue techniques while cooking some of the same dishes that he used to help his grandmother prepare feast imbibe was challenging myself but soul smoke was very easy to me carter says it s just the food i grew up eating perfected order soul smoke from its kitchens in evanston avondale and the south loop keep an eye on its food truck schedule or stop by its location at time out market chicago open wednesday through sunday

steven roth steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you cathy and good morning everyone i hope everyone is healthy continues to be vigilant and gets vaccinated let me say it again everybody please get vaccinated i ll start by sharing a few things that are happening on the ground which i hope you all find interesting the u s economy is resilient it s growing i might even say is booming and so is new york financial tech and almost all industries are achieving record results in new york apartment occupancy which had dropped to as low as 70 during covid is now rapidly climbing back with record numbers of new leases being signed each week at higher and higher rents condo sales which had stalled during covid are now active albeit at discounted pricing except i m proud to say that our 220 central park south where resales are at a premium this apartment and condo demand is coming from folks who live and work in new york and that s a very good sign at 220 central park south where we are basically sold out resale pricing is up and that s an understatement a recent spectacular example which is now public is a two floor 12 000 square foot resale that traded at a record breaking 13 000 per square foot think about that our new york office division is now experiencing record incoming rfps and requests for tours including from many large and important occupiers who had been on the sidelines during covid glen and his team are very busy by the way big tech is now very active looking for more space in new york to take advantage of new york s large highly educated and diverse workforce here s an interesting fact a fortune 100 occupier household name who dropped out of the market during covid has come back to market they were originally looking for 300 000 square feet to house 2 800 employees post covid after extensive study and space planning they now need and are seeking 400 000 square feet a 30 increase to house the same 2 800 employees in both instances their projected in office occupancy is the same 60 the fact that this occupier needs 30 more space post covid is contrary to all analyst expectations but that is the fact and we are hearing the same from many although not all but many of our tenants that they will need more space not less post covid one of our analysts and a friend recently wrote that our company suffers from penn fatigue true it took us over a decade to assemble our vast penn district hoardings but as the same goes this is our time here s where we stand at farley we have delivered to facebook all of their 730 000 square feet their tenant work is going full bore the west side of seventh avenue along the three blocks stretching from 31st street to 34th street is now a massive construction site where we are transforming the 4 4 million square foot penn one and penn two into the nucleus of our cutting edge connected campus the 34th street penn one lobby just opened and our unrivaled three level amenity offering will be completed at year end our full building penn two transformation including the bustle and reskinning is 98 bought out on budget and off to a fair start we couldn t be more excited our 14 000 square foot sales center the seventh floor of penn one is now open to rate reviews from brokers and occupiers it s busy it is that the sales office is designed as a dealmaking conference and presentation center with multiple building models and videos that tell our story in a clear persuasive and unique way after working with glen and josh in the sales center the market is understanding our ambitious plans to make the penn district the crown jewel of the west side of the new new york by the way every quarter and every year the westside is punching way above its weight measured by high and growing leasing share market share of leases signed the aside of our confidence and the market s enthusiasm even at this early date we are raising our penn asking rents we will shortly begin demolition of the hotel pennsylvania to create the best development site in town we expect demolition and shutdown costs to be about 150 million which you should look at as land cost our book basis in this property today is 203 million and we are midstream in the process to make the unique high growth penn district a separate investable public security our best in the business team leaders in the penn district are glen weiss leasing barry langer development and dave mandelbaum construction michael will cover our operating results in a moment but i can say that overall leasing and occupancy statistics in new york tell a misleading story while overall availability is 18 assets newly built or repositioned since 2000 have a much lower direct vacancy rate of 11 last quarter 88 of new leasing activity in midtown was a class a product it s clear that the market is voting for new and repositioned assets as you would expect class a assets command higher pricing than class b in fact one third higher obviously this is the place to be and you should know that substantially all of our assets are repositioned and in this competitive set new york is coming back to life residential neighborhoods are bustling less so the commercial canyons where office utilization is now approximately 23 remember it s august the vacation month the largest employers in manhattan have mandated a return to work by labor day or shortly thereafter some with full staff in office and others with a flexible program allowing some work from home as i have said before i do not believe that the office will be threatened by the kitchen table and i do not believe that even one or two work from home days per week by some number of a tenant s employees will be a negative to us i for one i m unable to predict whether it will take a month or a quarter for office buildings to be back to full up and the canyons to be teeming again there is no magic date all that matters is that it will happen soon enough last week we announced that wegmans the premier grocer in the northeast region is opening its first store in manhattan at our 770 broadway replacing kmart and you can bet that we will do several more manhattan deals with wegmans the fact that wegmans is coming is creating excitement with it at last count 43 print and broadcast press articles celebrating the announcement here is an interesting fact to it wegmans expects that as much as 50 of its volume will be from in home delivery appropriately from to home delivery we will be investing 13 million in tis leasing commissions and free rent in this long term lease with a 65 gaap mark to market increase over kmart s rent this quarter we announced that we exercised a rofo to acquire our partner s 45 interest in one park avenue in a transaction that values the building at 870 million based on the in place floating rate loan we project 18 million 0 09 cents per share first year accretion last summer we brought 555 california street to market for sale and are unable to achieve fair value we withdrew understandable at the height of covid with travel restrictions and so forth at that time we said we will refinance and this past quarter we did to the tune of 1 2 billion netting us approximately 467 million at share we can just carry on the new floating rate loan is almost exactly the same as the old much smaller fixed rate loan so one might say the 460 million is free money ironically i believe continuing to own this outstanding asset with this superb accretive financing is actually a better outcome in new york replacement cost is rising quickly over the past many decades replacement costs with a dip here and there has risen relentlessly and if past this is pro log replacement costs will undoubtedly continue to rise as far as the eye can see replacement cost has always been a key predictor of future value a rising umbrella lifting all similar real estate values and new york is the poster child of this phenomenon here is updated guidance for our retail business for 2021 we guided cash noi of 135 million and now halfway through the year we expect to do a little bit for 2022 we guided cash noi of 160 million which we affirm for 2023 we announced new cash noi guidance of not less than 175 million you should know that as expected swatch exercised the termination option for a portion of their space at st regis which is effective march 2023 with a 9 million termination fee the swatch owned harry winston store will remain under lease through its june 2031 expiry the guidance above takes account of the swatch termination if i were a betting man and i guess in some ways i am i would bet that we have already put in the bottom in new york that the worst of the best stuff is behind us and that new york will get better and better and so will new york real estate in space in our case occupancy rate tis and pricing have bottomed finally we have a great talented leasing development and operations team all thanks to them thank you now to michael michael j franco president and chief financial officer thank you steve and good morning everyone i will start with our second quarter financial results and end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets second quarter comparable ffo as adjusted was 0 69 per share compared to 0 56 for last year s second quarter an increase of 0 13 we have provided a quarter over quarter bridge for you in our earnings release on page five and in our financial supplement on page seven the increase was driven by the following items 0 09 from tenant related activities including commencement of certain lease expansions and nonrecurrent or straight line rent write offs impacting the prior period primarily jcpenney and new york company 0 02 from lower g a resulting from our overhead reduction program and 0 02 from interest expense savings and the start of improvement in our variable businesses primarily from bms claim our second quarter comparable results are consistent with the fourth quarter run rate we discussed at the beginning of the year as is our overall expectation for the full year speaking of our variable businesses we are beginning to see signs of recovery with a return to normalcy bms is nearing pre pandemic levels signage is starting to pick up with healthy bookings in the second half of the year our garages are picking up as well and should be fully back in 2022 and finally we have a number of trade shows scheduled for the fourth quarter other than hotel penn s income we expect to recover most of the income from our variable businesses by year end 2022 with the balance in 2023 companywide same store cash noi for the second quarter increased by 0 5 over the prior year second quarter our core new york office business was up 3 2 blending in chicago and san francisco our office business overall was up 2 consistent with prior quarters our core office business representing over 85 of the company continues to hold its own protected by long term leases with credit tenants our retail same store cash noi was down 6 primarily due to jcpenney s lease rejection in july 2020 but excluding the impact of jcpenney s lease rejection the same store cash noi for the remaining retail business was up 9 8 our office occupancy ended the quarter at 91 1 down two percentage points from the first quarter this was expected and driven by long expected move out at 350 park avenue and 85 tenth avenue as well as 825 seventh avenue coming back into service with the activity we have in our pipeline this quarter should represent the bottom of our office occupancy and it should improve quarter by quarter from here retail occupancy was up slightly to 77 3 now turning to the leasing markets since our last call the pace of office leasing activity in new york city has picked up each successive month with the vaccination rates high companies are now fully focused on their return to the office with many returning during the summer and a majority expected back soon after labor day predictably the overall sentiment in new york continues to improve as company s return and the office market continues to heal during the second quarter leasing volume in manhattan was its highest since the onset of the pandemic and office tour activity has now exceeded pre pandemic levels with more than 11 million square feet of active tenant requirements importantly office using employment in the city continues to strengthen with more than 100 000 jobs now recovered we re at 92 of the pre pandemic peak while leasing volume during the first half of 2021 was dominated by small to medium sized transactions driven by well capitalized financial services and technology tenants we are now seeing pent up demand from larger occupiers across all industry types as many have formally entered the market there are additional signals that the market continues to thaw tenants are now entering into leases for longer terms and asking rents in concessions have stabilized and in fact as steve alluded to we have recently increased our asking rents in our top tier assets reflecting the strong demand for best in class assets during the second quarter we signed 33 leases totaling 322 000 square feet with two thirds coming from new companies joining our high quality portfolio across the city the average starting rent of these transactions was a strong 85 per square foot the leasing highlight for the quarter was 100 000 square feet at penn one further validating the market s resounding reception to our redevelopment of this property the largest transaction was a new lease with empire healthchoice for 72 000 square feet our main competition here was newly constructed buildings in both downtown and midtown our new dramatic lobbies in plaza s best in class campus amenity program and premier access to transportation looking toward the second half of 2021 our leasing pipeline has grown significantly since last quarter with more than one million square feet of leases in active negotiation including 180 000 square feet of new leasing at 85 tenth avenue as well as an additional 1 6 million square feet in various stages of discussion this includes discussions with several large users newly interested in penn two after seeing our vision at the experience center our activity is a balanced combination of new and renewal deals with the majority of our activity with companies in the financial technology and advertising sectors our office expirations are very modest for the remainder of 2021 and 2022 with only 976 000 square feet expiring in total representing 7 of the portfolio and 150 000 of this square footage is in penn one and penn two as we look toward our 2023 expirations of 1 9 million square feet of which 350 000 is in penn one and penn two we are of course already in dialogue and trading paper with many of these companies and anticipate announcing important transactions by year end now turning to themart in chicago where the office market is also showing signs of life and tenant demand is returning coming out of the pandemic while short term renewal leasing dominated the market during 2020 activity has picked up with almost one million square feet of new leasing completed during the second quarter though concessions are unusually high at themart we completed a 91 000 square foot long term office renewal with 1871 chicago s premier technology incubator for entrepreneurs and have an additional 80 000 square feet of new deals in negotiation two weeks ago we produced our first trade show at themart since february 2020 pre pandemic this show in partnership with international casual furniture association featured the largest manufacturers of outdoor furniture in the country attendance was 10 higher than the same show produced pre pandemic 2019 and feedback from exhibitors and attendees was very positive we have eight upcoming trade shows calendared during the remainder of 2021 including neocon in october the largest show in north america focused on commercial design though we don t expect the tenants to reach 2019 levels this year in san francisco at 555 we are finalizing a couple of small strong leases in our fall other than the cube turning to the capital markets now the financing markets are wide open and aggressive for high quality office companies and buildings and we are taking advantage of the low all in coupons it bears repeating that in may we upsized our 555 california street loan from 533 million to 1 2 billion with no additional interest costs we also reentered the unsecured debt market for the two tranche 750 million green bond offering at a blended yield of 2 77 there was robust demand for our paper underscoring investor support for our franchise and belief in new york city we paid off the loan on themart with the proceeds and added the remainder to our treasury finally our current liquidity is a strong 4 492 billion including 2 317 billion of cash and restricted cash and 2 175 billion undrawn under our 2 75 billion revolving credit facilities with that i ll turn it over to the operator for q a questions and answers operator thank you we have a question from steve sakwa from evercore isi steve sakwa evercore isi analyst thanks for all the detail i guess steve first on the retail figures that you threw out i m just curious where does the retenanting of the jcpenney s box and manhattan mall sort of fit into that steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer there s no credit in those guidance number for any new for any occupancy in that space yet steve sakwa evercore isi analyst and do you have any updated thoughts on just sort of the timing behind that or sort of any sort of initial thoughts on what you want to do with that space steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer the answer is we have thoughts we have a few things that we re working on nothing imminent and i think that that s all i really have to say about that today obviously the rent that jcpenney was paying us is not realistic in today s market and i wouldn t expect that space to be leased in the short term steve sakwa evercore isi analyst okay thanks and then maybe michael you talked about good activity you re seeing at kind of both penn one and penn two could you just maybe give us without getting too specific but can you kind of just give us a flavor for those discussions and what may be your expectations are in terms of kind of leasing up penn two in particular michael j franco president and chief financial officer glen why don t you take that glen j weiss executive vice president office leasing and co head of real estate sure steve it s glen so we are busier every day at both buildings penn one and penn two penn one we have multiple lease negotiates happening now as you know there s no real big blocks there but we certainly are putting full floors together and the attraction to the redevelopment has been remarkable the new lobbies opened now which has only accelerated the activity people are getting a great now physical feel to how great the asset will be it feels like a brand new building at penn two we have daily presentations at the experience center we have rfps in the door on certain blocks we are feeling great about it by the way we re not rushing on it because we know that it s going to be better as the construction unfurls it s early but we re certainly in the market we re in deal making mode but we re not rushing steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer steve i would just add my two cents i mean the proof of the pudding is that we re in the market glen and his team is in the market every day with this space talking to the brokerage community and to prospective tenants the reaction has been nothing short of astonishing we had never seen it in our careers in terms of the reception as to what s happening first of all the whole west side and second of all the unique program that we re putting together so we are extremely enthusiastic our strategy as glen said is to let a little time pass until we re not in a rush because we have a level of the most important thing that i said with respect to the penn is we are so convicted and we are so enthusiastic and we are centering to the marketplace that at the very outset we are now raising prices so you can take a lot from that steve sakwa evercore isi analyst great thank you steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer by the way you should put on your construction boots and come over and see us steve sakwa evercore isi analyst i will pick you up on that thanks operator thank you the next question comes from manny korchman from citi please proceed michael bilerman citi analyst hey good morning it s actually michael bilerman here with manny steve you made a comment i hope you re well but you made a comment in your opening remarks about a fortune 500 company looking at i think you said 300 000 square feet it was going to house about 2 800 employees and then upon further review they increased their space needs by 30 for the same number of employees i think your firm tends to have a little bit lower or smaller of a lease size in terms of leasing obviously you have a number of bigger tenants but an average lease size of smaller than 300 how are those medium sized tenants thinking about their space so how how often does the situation come up where someone s willing that want to take more space and how are they thinking about the total cost of that to get to that point steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer glen is probably more qualified to answer than i am but i ll give you my thoughts number one you have to remember that real estate cost for these tenants is one of the smallest line items in their p l so there are different management teams different perspectives ok so we went through the wework experience where the whole economics were driving the space per capita the square footage per capita down from what was 250 square feet per capita before down to as low as a stupid number like 60 ok well that doesn t work so a lot of this has to do with what the management s philosophy is as to how they re going to treat their employees so number one from a health point of view that dictates more space per capita and in terms of real estate is a recruiting tool especially in new york so a lot of that has to do with the management s vision as to what they want the space to look like and feel like and what kind of experience they want their employees to have so what i m saying is just to take a row well obviously if 10 people out of 100 are going to work from home they need 10 less space that s not true and so i think it s all over the lot but what i m saying is there s a feeling in the marketplace and in the analyst community that it s a certainty that covid that work from home which was lower square footage requirements by the tenants that s not true some yes many no glen you have additional thoughts glen j weiss executive vice president office leasing and co head of real estate yes i mean one thing that we talked about on in michael s remarks is flight to quality so number one a lot of the deal making with new tenants are an upgrade to the better buildings with the better landlords and the better locations with that we re seeing space plans for a review every day in these buildings and there s been no diminution in terms of space in terms desk sharing etc and it s exactly reflective of what steve said i mean that s exactly what s going on out there on the ground steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer now just to add to that one of the things we re seeing from all the space planners with whom we deal with all of them every day is management teams want more communal space more hangout space more conference space etc so it s not just the particular cubicle or desk or office where an individual sits it s the entire package and i don t believe in most cases that s going down in fact in many cases it may even go up michael bilerman citi analyst and steve how do you think it plays out because i would say most of the commentary that you re talking about is consistent when we talk to the senior management teams of corporations ceos cfos when we talk to the real estate landlords but when you survey the actual employees across the united states they tell a different story right they want immense flexibility how can that not at the tails there will be exceptions but the bulk of the curve would suggest that a vast majority of employees have a different view of how they want to work going forward than how their employers how does that tension ultimately get resolved steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer well michael you can bet on the employer employees i m going to bet on the employers ok i think it gets resolved in different different ways different firms will do different things but basically i believe in the office as the principal driver of commerce and i believe the office will continue to be the core of a business where creativity decisions etc are made and i think if i use the phrase at a kitchen table i don t think the kitchen tables are going to beat out the office right now there s a very strange phenomenon and that is folks who re out in the hampers getting full pay and enjoying it that s not going to continue from more than another quarter or two or three so at some point the people who pay the paychecks are going to insist that they re their gang their team their thinkers their creators are back in the office where they can see them touch and feel them and interact now there will always be some work from home or work from anywhere or whatever there always has nobody works a 52 week full five day week in the office everybody has some whatever time where they re not in the office but i believe as this plays out the employer s desire to have their staff in the office will carry the day michael bilerman citi analyst okay and then just a second question just in terms of the spin off can you just give a little bit more color in terms of where you stand today when we should expect some filings and secondarily whether you are at least exploring private alternatives just given the public market still is shunning office stocks and so is there an opportunity to use private capital or an alternative nonpublic structure to get to where you want to be steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer the answer is sure we explore all alternatives in terms of creating value every day we are in midstream with respect to the legal and banking etc activity to create the what i call is a separate tradable public security that s the way i like to look at it because i think our shareholders deserve to have the ability to invest in either a menu a or menu b with respect to the high probability is that that transaction as contemplated will be completed you ll know we re not going to predict when we re going to file papers at the current time if some other kind of transaction surfaces we will of course study that and consider that as of now there are no alternative transactions that we re considering and we re on full speed ahead for the separately tradable security michael bilerman citi analyst okay thank you steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer and by the way this is the slide and michael i couldn t be more enthusiastic about this idea about the opportunity ok we are fully we have full conviction about the penn district we think what we re doing is something which is going to be totally unique and one of the most important developments in the real estate industry countrywide and i think that the strategy is a superb strategy thanks operator thank you our next question comes from john kim from bmo please proceed john kim bmo analyst thanks good morning steve you mentioned the penn asking rents are trending higher can you provide any color on that as far as the dollar amounts or percentage and should we be expecting the development yields steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer john i m sorry i didn t hear you john kim bmo analyst that s ok you talked about the penn asking rents increasing i was wondering if you could provide some more color on that either the dollar amount or the percentage increase and also if we should expect development yield to also increase or should that be offset by higher cost or higher tis steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer with respect to the asking rents i mean i think that those are published aren t they no so they re not published so we re not going to get into a conversation with them but i can tell you that our conviction is so strong that we are raising our asking prices which obviously if construction costs are stable will raise yields i believe that the numbers that we have in our supplement in terms of rents and yields are the lowest that they could possibly be extremely conservative and we expect over time if we do our job right and we will and we create the kind of atmosphere that we have created at the bloomberg tower for example or 220 central park south with superbly conceived space for our occupiers the rents will go to a premium to the rest of the market we re just at the beginning of this adventure john kim bmo analyst okay maybe this is a question for michael but we re still a few years away from the penn redevelopment being stabilized but can you just remind us of your capitalized interest policy if there are floors that are unleased do you expense those immediately or do you capitalize on leased floors until stabilization until they ll be stuffed michael j franco president and chief financial officer i mean they re out of service then we re capitalizing that interest right we bring them back service then we stop that policy so obviously penn two is out of service and that we ve laid those numbers out in the supplement penn one today is all in service so i think that s i think it s pretty straightforward john john kim bmo analyst okay great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from jamie feldman from bank of america please proceed jamie feldman bank of america analyst thanks and good morning everyone steve i want to go back to your comments on big tech being very active can you just maybe quantify or just help us understand i mean we obviously saw a lot of big tech leasing over the last few years just how large that pipeline really looks and where they may be going and how long you think it might take to actually see some of these leases come together steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer that s a question for glen glen j weiss executive vice president office leasing and co head of real estate hi jamie jamie feldman bank of america analyst hi glen glen j weiss executive vice president office leasing and co head of real estate how are you doing so as you know we have all the big tech we have facebook apple amazon google we re obviously in touch with them often as you would expect and they re all in mode thinking about expansion in new york as we sit on this phone call i m not going to get into specifics on our discussions or what their plans are but i could tell you the engines are on again and they re revved up to start searching for more space and as their hiring paces continue so just i would be watching for that action as this year goes on michael j franco president and chief financial officer jamie i don t think it s surprising i mean i sense surprise in your voice but i mean if all you have to do is look at the earnings growth and what s being produced by big tech by medium tech fintech these companies are growing at significant rates even despite their size the law of large numbers sort of is historically it s been difficult to do so and they need people engineers sales etc to continue to grow their business whether it s laterally or additionally vertically in what they re doing already and so whether it s big tech medium tech new york has continued to be a market of choice for the reason steve outlined but these companies they probably had a four month pause in 2020 they re going gangbusters right now in terms of the earnings growth and they need people to continue to drive that going forward steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer and beyond that the big tech has a limited capital i mean if you look at their balance sheet and their cash reserves and their stocks etc they have a limited capital and the cost of their capital is basically zero and they have a limited ambition to innovate and grow and invent and they are not shy of spending and investing so obviously they are favorite clients of ours and there s a reason for that they believe in new york they love the size of new york the scale of new york the ability to open up space and hire 3 000 engineers in one year they can t do that hardly any place else they love the education and very importantly and interestingly they love the diversity of the population jamie feldman bank of america analyst thank you how should we think about the space they just leased i guess do they already feel like it s they have enough heads to fill those seats or it s just all about the 10 year view at this point and get what you can while you can steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer i don t know look anecdotally one of our big tech customers complained recently that in a certain city not new york they re having trouble filling the seats and they re upset about that we have not heard that in new york new york has a large workforce and they re very happy with it so if you think about it if in the last 1 5 years or so there was about three million square feet of big tech lease something like that so if you take a 200 square foot per capita what is that 4 500 employees so the numbers are large and the beauty of new york is it has the scale to satisfy their aspirations so the answer is they re growing they re hiring and they re going to continue to do that jamie feldman bank of america analyst okay thank you and then secondly you talked about occupancy bottoming rents bottoming i mean can you give us a sense of where you think the occupancy trajectory goes for new york office michael j franco president and chief financial officer i mean jamie i don t know we want to give you a specific projections it ll be off by 10 20 basis points here or there but this is clearly the bottom of it it s just a matter i mean again we talked about pipeline it is significant much higher than it was last quarter and i d say significant on an absolute basis and it just depends on when glen and his team finalized the leases right so the number could be two points higher it could be one point higher at the end of the year it just depends on time but i think the punchline is we ve reached the bottom we see meaningful improvement based on what s in the queue and whether it happens this quarter next quarter the following quarter the trend line will be up steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer i ll give you my opinion as to where this goes if you look at our occupancy rates over a 20 year period we are almost always at 97 or maybe even a pinch higher ok every once in a while over that 10 year cycle we dipped down a little bit and there s generally reasons for that in this case we have a building and transition at 350 park avenue we have a building in transition and 85 tenth avenue and in both those instances we are talking to enough prospects that fill double the amount of space that is vacant there or more so my expectation is we are going to go back to the 97 plus percent occupancy rate that we always carry it s just a matter of whether it takes a year or two years that s where we re going jamie feldman bank of america analyst okay thanks everyone operator thank you our next question comes from alexander goldfarb from piper sandler please proceed alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst good morning thank you good morning steve good morning michael so two questions and actually steve you just sort of recasted the question i was going to ask i was going to ask you if you still believe in manhattan tilting to the south and the west given the resurgence of midtown grand central obviously you guys bought one park but to jamie s question you just talked about 350 park enough tenants to double the demand so i guess wrapping up because i d like to ask about 350 do you see midtown the grand central market returning as the dominant submarket or do you still believe that new york is still tilting to the south and to the west steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer i like the phrase that i invented some years ago the predictive phrase that new york is tilting i think that s still the case notwithstanding new york is a great mysterious wonderful place ok so park avenue south which is what s what we call that so midtown south is a smaller but very highly sought after submarket there s not going to be any new construction in there and it s a very it s a great submarket with lots of culture lots of texture and lots of grit and s it will do just fine i think would you characterize 770 broadway as part of that market michael j franco president and chief financial officer yes steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer so i think we own the premier building in that submarket 770 broadway which is now the home of wegmans and of course facebook so now let s go to conventional midtown park avenue has been a stepchild for a while it s gotten older and tighter and that is now changing aggressively park avenue is going to reclaim its role as the great boulevard of commerce in the world so we have jpmorgan chase tearing down a building and rebuilding it with a stupendous headquarters building which we re familiar with because they re using norman foster so we have and their plans have been published we own the adjacent building to that 280 park avenue which we re very enthusiastic about there are two other potential there s another brand new foster building up at 55th street there s two more teardowns and rebuilds that are going to happen in park avenue so park avenue is going to become what it always should be and that s a premier boulevard of commerce so all of these parts in the city is not going to be segregated into one or two submarkets all submarkets are going to do well we believe that on a relative basis the midtown west market the penn district market will do on a relative basis better than the others and will grow faster than the others and we ll have higher demand than the others and the statistics as i said about market share if you look at how much leasing is done in each district compared to how large a district is the penn district wins that race but everything in new york is going to thrive except for the really expletive buildings and there are plenty of them alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst and steve you still feel confident on your bet on penn station winning the race over grand central even after the opening of east side access which east side access obviously would be great for 280 great for 350 and your other neighboring buildings but you still you don t think east side access will eat into your penn station steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer no i think it s i think the look you can look at all kinds of negative issues penn station has always been the transportation hub of this region for 100 years ok all of the networks and all the spiderweb of transportation from the 380 degrees come into penn station and that s the way it s designed now obviously there s going to be grand central is not nothing and but it will be fine there will be plenty of business in penn station i m not in a relative race with grand central grand central is going to be fine we think penn station is going to be a little and that s ok with me alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst no that s fine and then the question for michael steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer by the way hang on hang on alex alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst sure sure steve steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer there s an enormous amount of public capital that is being invested in penn now i m sure you ve seen the moynihan improvement which is of course ours all the adjacent real estate to retail etc and i m sure you couldn t be more aware of the gateway project which is a massive infrastructure project and i m sure you re also aware of the plans to expand penn station s trackage which means capacity to the south which is i mean these are huge infrastructure projects which have 10 year projects and take tens and tens of billions of dollars and i can tell you that the government s focus is on penn so we believe in penn and that doesn t mean that grand central isn t going to thrive as well it will and we hope it will alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst okay the next question is for michael on second quarter you guys handily beat the street estimates and i m just sort of curious in that second quarter number and steve you mentioned guidance i didn t see guidance but maybe i just missed it the lack of coffee michael is there what is onetime in the second quarter and what is sort of sustainable stuff so as we think about that 0 80 number how much of that is a go forward number and how much of that was just sort of either onetime rent collections or onetime true ups or whatever that would not repeat michael j franco president and chief financial officer i think 0 80 obviously includes the gains from 220 so look at comparable which is 0 59 which is up 0 13 from last year obviously that benefited from not having a recurrence of the straight line write offs principally from pennies in new york company but we had rent commencement at several assets which were positive so as we ve said the run rate which basically closed from fourth were a little bit better or bit worse depending overall yes is consistent alex and so i think it s i think that s the right thing to model for the remainder of the year obviously the trend lines are getting a little better but as we sit here today we re not prognosticating doing better than that yet but i think the short answer is notwithstanding those straight line write offs there were enough other positives that picked up on those things so on a run rate basis i think that s all a pretty good number alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst okay and then i think there was a piece of paper that went over the mic you said run rate something about fourth quarter but that it was muddled did you cite the things michael j franco president and chief financial officer no my comment was when we started the year we said the fourth quarter of 20 was a decent run rate for the entire year of 2021 and we still think that s the case alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst okay that is good listen thank you michael j franco president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from vikram malhotra from morgan stanley vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst well thanks so much good morning everyone maybe just first on all the leasing activity that you ve done over the last call it 12 months or so can you give us a rough estimate of the noi contribution from leases signed but not commenced michael j franco president and chief financial officer we don t have those numbers at our fingertips vikram we ll have to come back on that vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay no worries and i wanted to dig into just comments about the a b divide the class a or quality versus more tired building and steve i guess i wanted to get a sense of how you see that divide playing out in terms of rents and tis and specifically for the vornado portfolio i m sure it s a very small proportion but if you were to estimate sort of what proportion today would you need to spend incremental capex dollars to kind of get them up to speed in that divide steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer i think what you re saying is how do we have any b buildings and if so how much is going to cost to fix them vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst yes steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer the answer is we have none and maybe we have one little space here one little space there but it s so de minimis i can t even put a number on we ve been on a program we ve been on a program that started with david greenbaum and glen 15 years ago to reposition all of our inventory so that it s first class and a surrogate for new now when i say reposition i mean lobbies physical appearance mechanical systems elevators tech service etc so we don t have any buildings that we re not proud of vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay great and then just sorry one clarification on the 2023 street retail initial number that you provided that obviously includes rent bumps but does it include a specific occupancy for the street retail portfolio or is that just existing portfolio and rents converting to cash steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer where s tom thomas sanelli executive vice president finance and chief administrative officer so it includes leasing up some vacant space that we have today vikram and it also includes the farley retail which would be something that we don t have in service today steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer but it s a very small amount of the farley retail so it s if you include the farley retail that would mean it s not really a same store number because we re adding a new space the amount of almost the vast majority of it the huge majority of it is basically same store vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst okay great thanks so much steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you you are welcome operator thank you our next caller is nick yulico from scotiabank josh burr scotiabank analyst thanks this is josh burr on with nick so i know it s hard to estimate but based on what you re hearing from your tenants about returning to the office after labor day what s your expectation for office utilization after labor day and what would you consider to be a bull case scenario steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer i think i said in my remarks that one i for one i can t answer that question all of the conference calls that i have listened to is all of my pals have come up with a number and very strong conviction about this is going to happen by a certain date i have no idea there is no magic date but i think i said in my remarks and i ll say it again is that it may take a quarter it may take two quarters whatever it is we believe from talking to our tenants that normal work headcount normal work population and normal theme will return and i just can t predict nor does it make sense to try to predict when that will happen exactly i believe that new york will turn to its robust bustling self somewhere in the shorter term josh burr scotiabank analyst okay and then you mentioned that you re betting on the employers rather than employees when you re figuring out the return to office so i m curious what do you think about the department of justice ruling that businesses can mandate vaccinations for their employees and how do you think that impacts the return to office steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer i think that s a very complicated question which goes to both law and ethics and i think each company is going to have to i mean basically the extension of that is if you re not vaccinated you re fired now that s a very interesting situation i don t i really don t want to get into what our policy will be with respect to our important employees whom we cherish or what the market is going to do i don t think that s a question for me josh burr scotiabank analyst okay thanks operator thank you we have a question from daniel ismail from green street please proceed daniel ismail green street analyst great thank you just going back to rent you mentioned raising rents at penn district a couple of times i m just curious on a net effective basis are those rents back to pre covid levels or is there still some discounts steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer in the penn district we re coming off 50 and 60 rents so and i think our guidance in our supplement is somewhere in the 90 number with so obviously we are budgeting in penn one and penn two which is the better part of 4 5 million fee that there s going to be a 30 a foot uptick and that s what justifies the expenditure the capital expenditure and also that creates the nucleus of our district we believe that we will achieve those budgeted numbers and more so so i think that s your answer is we re not pre covid numbers we re actually it s not relevant because the pre covid number is the old building we re talking about the new buildings michael j franco president and chief financial officer i would just add to steve s comment dan and i think where you re going to is our expectations for penn if you look at our aspirations pre covid right they are equal or higher than where they were right and i think the comments on raising rents reflect the market s reception to those and so we are more bullish today than we were if you go back pre covid steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes let s talk about it a little bit our strategy is that we have a unique huge six eight 10 block collection of assets and property that surrounds the most important transit hub in the city actually in the country our strategy is that we know from the we re developers we re not just owners with developers our strategy in creating assets and redeveloping our assets is that quality is something that the market is willing to pay for and appreciates so if you look at two very prominent examples of what we have done as a business the bloomberg building which we did which i did some years ago is extraordinary it s 15 years into it and it still is cutting edge in terms of the user experience in that building by the way a lot of that has to do with mike himself who as a very the interior designs are extraordinary go to 220 central block south where we have achieved something that nobody ever thought could possibly be achieved based upon the quality of the offering that we have given if you go into the two penn lobby which just opened two weeks ago i m sorry the one penn lobby and it s only half opened whatever you could begin to see what the environment that we re creating which we think is unique and we know because of brokers tourers and occupier stores already that the marketplace respects understands what we have done so we think that that has an enormous effect our ability to develop our vision to develop on the value of the assets that we are creating there s more we also believe in multiple buildings and clusters of buildings so that we can offer the tenant a uniqueness that you can t get by going into a single building i ve said this before and i d like to say it again a 300 000 foot tenant and a 600 000 foot building is dead if that tenant wants another 100 000 square feet he s going to have to move out or move five blocks away in our complex which will eventually grow to 10 million 12 million maybe even 15 million feet that 300 000 square foot tenant glen will always be able to provide that tenant with what he needs in our complex so the cluster of buildings interconnected above ground and below ground is what creates the district creates the uniqueness and we believe will command a premium in the marketplace daniel ismail green street analyst great appreciate all the color steve and just maybe taking a step back bigger picture for new york you mentioned a few times the difference between higher quality and lower quality office building and mentioned new york has a fair share of older class b properties what do you think happens to those office buildings do they get redeveloped and do they stay office buildings what is the long term view for those properties steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer i think the first part of that answer is it depends entirely upon the owner so if the owner is a single owner or whatever without the resources of the organization the vision and the capital the building is going to stay a expletive building and it will find its own market at much lower rents and of course that owner may or may not be able to provide tis and may or may not be able to keep the building in good repair so a lot of it depends upon the order and there s that if the owner is a sophisticated firm and a large owner of multiple buildings eventually over time the buildings will be teared down and there ll be new buildings or whatever or they will take the buildings and make them so that they are fit to be leased at decent rents below the class a umbrella so if you get a halfway decent building with a sophisticated capable owner with an organization and a capital base there will always be a low discount rent market for those buildings so that s a complicated thing i don t know but great locations and the great pieces of land underneath those b and c buildings will over time and i m talking about 20 years be bought up by developers and will be teardowns there will not be a huge number of those there ll be one or two of those every couple of years operator mr ismail does that answer your question daniel ismail green street analyst it does thanks steve operator thank you we have no further questions at this time i will turn the call over to mr steven roth for final remarks steven roth chairman of the board and chief executive officer well thank you everybody we our whole management team is in the conference room in person on this call we enjoy these calls we learn from them both in terms of our preparation for the call and the questions that you all ask so we thank you for that i ll say again what i said in the beginning of the call was we wish everybody good health

good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining the call i d like to start today by thanking the veeco united team for their continued dedication and hard work they delivered exceptional second quarter financial results and made excellent progress advancing our strategic growth initiatives we continue to feel confident about the remainder of 2021 our near term growth plans are unfolding as expected and the investments we re making today are also on track giving us confidence in our longer term growth plans i ll expand on this in a few minutes but first i ll discuss our q2 highlights then turn it over to john for a financial update and guidance veeco continues to execute well with q2 results at the high end of our guidance strong shipments from our semiconductor and data storage customers drove revenue of 146 million our non gaap gross margin came in at 42 and we achieved non gaap operating income of 21 million leading to diluted non gaap eps of 0 35 both the top and bottom line results are sequentially better than last quarter and significantly improved from the year ago quarter in addition we had generated 10 million in cash flow from operations and improved our cash position we continue to improve our operating model while making investments for future growth i m particularly excited about our semiconductor market momentum which is led by our laser annealing and advanced packaging lithography systems obtained with our ultratech acquisition we re pleased that the strategic rationale for the acquisition is now serving as a cornerstone to the overall veeco growth strategy before we get into a detailed discussion on each of our four end markets let s look at the mega trends driving our business the first of these mega trends is mobility with people and machines always on the move and always connected via devices like smartphones and sensors a healthy market outlook is driven by exciting technologies like 5g which along with the edge as a platform will enable many exciting use cases for consumers and businesses alike increases in mobility will drive leading edge semiconductors advanced packaging and display technologies high performance computing is another mega trend driven by large scale data center applications and artificial intelligence high performance computing creates demand for leading edge semiconductors and advanced packaging the third major market trend is the transformation of the automotive industry with electrification and autonomous advancements this market trend is arguably in its early stages and is expected to be a driver of power electronics 3d sensors artificial intelligence and 5g communication and finally the cloud is another mega trend driven by enormous amounts of data stored and processed forecast shows stored data growing at a 35 cagr for years in turn creating demand for hard disk drives and high speed communications these market trends are expected to be in place for some time driving our longer term growth initiatives now let s turn to our specific market opportunities beginning with our semiconductor market wafer fab equipment spending has been revised up several times recently and analysts are now forecasting approximately 18 billion for 2021 this underscores the healthy equipment market today and looking ahead longer term forecast predict spending up to 100 billion annually we serve this market with three major product lines our laser annealing products currently used in production at advanced logic nodes our ion beam deposition systems for euv mask blank production and our lithography products for advanced packaging our laser annealing products are used by leading edge device manufacturers in their most critical process steps where currently production tool of record at multiple customers which underscores the unique advantages of our laser annealing systems as device geometries shrink we continue to work with our semiconductor customers on their next nodes by supporting evaluation systems in both logic and memory as we build sustainable long term relationships our laser annealing is closely tied to the trends i talked about earlier mobility along with high performance computing are mega trends that drive demand for advanced memory and logic devices these devices in turn require our laser annealing solutions today and for the foreseeable future furthermore regarding our semiconductor market we re happy to see further evidence of euv adoption during the quarter as another memory manufacturer announced their commitment to euv lithography this is not unexpected as device geometries continue to shrink with most leading semiconductor manufacturers now planning on adopting euv lithography we expect continued demand for our ion beam systems used for euv mask blank production moving to advanced packaging in the context of moore s law slowing down the semiconductor industry is turning to innovative packaging technologies to support system scaling demands and performance improvements our advanced packaging lithography and wet processing systems are used for advanced packaging technologies such as heterogeneous integration and fan out wafer level packaging graphics processing and artificial intelligence are examples where advanced packaging is used to improve system performance we had strong order activity during the quarter for our lithography products and we see growth coming from advanced packaging into 2022 we re experiencing strong momentum across all three products in our semiconductor market this momentum is expected to continue and is the reason we re expanding our manufacturing footprint for laser annealing and lithography products and i m proud to say our san jose capacity expansion remains on schedule we serve the compound semiconductor market primarily with two product lines our wet processing equipment for rf power amplifiers and filters and mocvd equipment for power rf and photonics applications we continue to see strong demand for our wet processing equipment from our rf customers 5g communication is driving an increase in content per mobile device and our customers are responding by adding capacity for rf power amplifiers and filters in fact we had strong shipment and order activity during the quarter for rf applications our gallium nitride and arsenide phosphide mocvd systems enable fast charging and other power management solutions 5g rf devices and microleds these markets have tremendous growth potential and we re looking to build our market position recent early stage wins and evaluations underway for power and microled applications give us confidence we ll grow in these emerging markets our third major end market is data storage this equipment market has been growing for multiple years consistent with increasing amounts of data storage and server enterprise nearline and surveillance applications hard disk drive exabyte capacity shipped with a new record last quarter this corresponds to an increase in the number of heads shipped and since our customers seek to improve their aerial density to enable a larger capacity drives head complexity is also increasing these tailwinds have been creating a robust market environment for our customers who are adding capacity to keep up with increasing demand after several years of capacity additions including in 2021 our data storage order rate has slowed in the first half and we believe 2022 will likely be a period of equipment digestion however with the amount of data generated showing no signs of slowing we re confident about the long term prospects of our data storage business if there is a data storage decline given our traction in semiconductor and compound semiconductor applications we see multiple paths to growth at the company level now for an update on our 2021 priorities first in addition to making safety a priority during the global pandemic we sought to improve our veeco united culture while this initiative has been ongoing our recent culture survey has shown remarkable improvements and we re focused on further improving throughout the year our employees and the positive culture that permeates our organization is essential to our success second we continue to focus on profitability our q2 results are reflective of this effort and we re on track to meet our 2021 financial targets third we re on track to deliver 2021 revenue growth with our laser annealing 5g rf and data storage solutions and fourth we continue to make investments in evaluation systems and our service infrastructure our goal is to achieve additional evaluation successes leading to lasting customer relationships and long term growth and with these four priorities the veeco united team is committed to making material difference and building a stronger veeco now i ll hand it over to john john p kiernan senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks bill and good afternoon everyone i will be discussing non gaap financial results and encourage you to refer to the reconciliation to gaap results in our press release or at the end of the earnings presentation looking at revenue revenue for the quarter was 146 million representing a 9 increase sequentially and a 48 year over year increase the increased revenue from q1 2021 was largely driven by data storage which grew 27 in the quarter semiconductor compound semiconductor and data storage all contributed to a year on year increase in revenue from 99 million with the following details providing a little more color semiconductor revenue increased by 43 to 54 million which represented 37 of total revenue driven by our laser annealing and lithography products data storage revenue increased by 84 to 52 million and made up 35 of our total revenue driven by both capacity and technology additions by our customers and compound semiconductor revenue increased by 37 to 24 million and made up 17 of total revenue driven by wet processing systems sold for rf applications a few comments on q2 revenue by region the united states region made up 46 of total revenue and was driven by ion beam systems shipped to data storage customers our asia pacific region excluding china was 34 china made up 14 of overall revenue and we expect the revenue percentage from china to trend higher given our recent order activity and improving ability to obtain export licenses now turning to our non gaap quarterly results gross margin came in at 41 6 which was flat to last quarter and toward the top end of our guidance operating expenses for the quarter were 39 6 million flat to last quarter and 27 of revenue a reduction from 29 in q1 operating income of 21 3 million for the quarter increased 32 sequentially and more than doubled from the same quarter last year tax expense for the quarter was approximately 400 000 with net income coming in at 17 9 million eps was 0 35 on a diluted share count of 51 8 million shares now moving to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights we ended the quarter with cash and short term investments of 330 million a sequential increase of 2 million from a working capital perspective our accounts receivable increased to 108 million due to the timing of shipments in the quarter this drove an increase in dso to 67 days from 59 days in the prior quarter accounts payable increased to 55 million with most of the increase related to construction invoices for our capital expansion project as a result dpos increased 58 days from 49 in q1 inventory increased approximately 8 million to 164 million to support increased shipment volume and investments in evaluation systems on increased volume days of inventory declined to 167 from 173 in q1 long term debt on the balance sheet was recorded at 320 million representing the carrying value of 389 million in convertible notes our capex during the quarter was 7 million this includes 4 million for the san jose expansion project and approximately 3 million in other capital spending we expect capital spending on our facility expansion project to decrease in the coming quarters now turning to our guidance for q3 revenue is expected to be between 135 million and 155 billion with non gaap gross margin between 41 and 43 we expect q3 non gaap opex to be between 40 million and 42 million a slight uptick for us as we add resources in r d along with increases in selling and marketing to support our growth we are on pace however for full year opex as a percentage of revenue to decline compared to 2020 gaap eps for q3 is expected between 0 02 and 0 20 per diluted share non gaap eps is expected between 0 25 and 0 44 per diluted share diluted non gaap eps is based upon 52 million share count for reference we ve included a table in the backup section of the earnings presentation to provide detail on effect of the convertible notes on diluted share count now for an update beyond q3 we expect q4 to be in the same revenue range as our q3 guidance which at the midpoint we project full year revenue around 570 million which is above the high end of our previous provided guidance we expect non gaap eps for the year to be toward the high end of our previously reported guidance which was 1 30 per diluted share i would like to add one quick announcement before we open up the call for questions we will be hosting a virtual analyst day in september where we plan to share more detail about our strategy markets and technologies please keep an eye out for a formal announcement in the coming weeks we hope you ll join us and with that bill and i will be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator we ll now take our first question from tom o malley with barclays tom o malley barclays analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question and congrats on the really nice results and updated full year guidance i just wanted to kind of dive into an update you normally give us traditionally bill you dive into some of the equipment wins that you have or at least equipment status of the lsa business could you update us on how some of those evaluation tools are going and where you currently stand with your leading customers there william j miller chief executive officer sure tom this has been a big focus for the company we re planning to put 10 evaluation tools out into the field during 2021 and if you look back historically the company typically would only have one or two out in the field at any given time so as of today we have eight of those 10 tools shipped into the field six of those are in the semi space specifically four are in laser annealing and one is with the current customer to support them in their next node one is at a new logic customer to engage them to develop their next node and we have two dram tools at memory player that are doing quite well evaluation tools doing quite well there so we re really pretty bullish on where we stand specifically with lsa we also have two compound semiconductor tools out in the field one is for 8 inch gan on silicon power electronics at a foundry pretty exciting opportunity as the world transitions from 6 inch to 8 inch that tool just recently shipped and we have another application for microleds in the compound semi space so a lot of good activity there i mentioned we have six semi tools i talked about four lsa we do have two in advanced packaging one is wet processing tool in advanced packaging memory application and one is a litho application at an idea so really pretty excited about that so that covers the eight that are in the field and we have two tools that we re planning to ship throughout the second half of this year one is for laser annealing tool at a current logic customer for their next node that s ready to go and now we have one tool that s a veeco core technology that we think has a lot of applicability in front end semi in memory as well as logic so we are clearly making investments in front end semi expanding our service infrastructure we think it s critical to work side by side with our customers to build sustainable long term customer relationships to entrench our position here so i would say we re pretty happy with the way things are going now but we need to obviously keep focused here tom tom o malley barclays analyst great that s super helpful and then my follow up question was on the data storage business so you guys have been pretty forthcoming with the fact that there may be some slowdown into the market next year and you can offset that with growth in other areas but could you just update us on what you re seeing in that market you re up over 80 year over year but some of the players in the storage industry has seen some declines in the topline or at least some moderating growth can you help us square that where you re starting to see some slowdown there but in terms of your capacity and your shipments it s starting to be moving pretty quickly and the timing that you would see some of that slowdown if you did william j miller chief executive officer yes we carry a pretty long pretty big backlog in the data storage area and what we re seeing right now in the second in the third quarter showing up in our revenue is we do have a customer building a new line an 8 inch line and that equipment is going in a tranche here in the second in the third quarter but what s clear from talking with all of our customers is that data proliferation isn t slowing data storage is forecasted to grow at 35 per year heads are forecasted to grow at 8 to 10 per year the complexity of those heads which is the number of steps going to our equipment is forecasted to grow at 8 to 10 as well so we feel very good about the long term prospects of the data storage business as the industry moves to 20 terabyte 30 terabyte drives but what we have seen in the first half of this year is we ve seen our order rate slow in the first half and given our lead time we can see a digestion period likely in the first half of 22 so what i will say though is that even if data storage equipment digestion does continue throughout 22 at the veeco level we ve been making these investments in semi and compound semi markets to grow next year to more than offset the decline in data storage so specifically in the semiconductor space what we re seeing in our advanced packaging lithography space is we are booked out for the rest of this year in litho and have a pretty good order book building for 2022 i think this will be a growth engine for us our euv business remains strong and i think we have a good pipeline of activity queued up in laser annealing so i think we re going to see strong growth next year there in the compound semi space we are seeing continued strength in 5g we see opportunities in power electronics as well as photonics so i think we have a pretty good we re seeing a potential digestion here next year in data storage but i think we ve positioned the company to continue the growth tom o malley barclays analyst great thanks and congrats again william j miller chief executive officer thanks tom operator we will now take our next question from rick schafer with oppenheimer rick schafer oppenheimer analyst thanks guys and i ll add my congratulations on a great quarter maybe just two questions if i could follow on similar to what you were just talking about bill obviously data storage i think you said is basically sold out this year given the lead times and everything you just said about potential slowdown in the first half i guess what i m trying to get to is where are some possible sources of second half upside might lie what sort of levers can you pull to maybe close whatever supply demand gap there is out there what kind of flexibility do you guys have to pull in any additional supply william j miller chief executive officer so rick just to understand your question your question is kind of more focused on the second half of 21 rick schafer oppenheimer analyst this year i was looking for the next couple of quarters because you guys obviously have been pretty consistently beating and raising this year so you ve clearly found little room for upside in the first half and i was just trying to dig if it s not going to come from data storage in the second half kind of areas where we might see upside come from is incremental supply a lever that you could pull as well that might quite alleviates any tightness that s out there and drive some upside as well john p kiernan senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so rick maybe this is john i ll take that so when we just raise the revenue guide for the year at the midpoint to around 570 million from what was previously the midpoint the 550 million as bill indicated we re executing against that data storage backlog and the increase in revenue even for this quarter even with the strong revenue coming from data storage that s where we expect it to be so where we are driving a little bit of higher revenue right now is both in our semi business and as bill mentioned with some strength in the litho side where activity and as we previously reported we started to see that activity pick up a bit and that s continuing and also with higher utilization at our customers driving higher service revenue so that really helped us both in q2 and as well as as we look out into q3 and into q4 as well rick schafer oppenheimer analyst thanks for that color my second question is kind of more on margins and i know you guys there is only so much you can talk about but i know advanced products like lsa and euv increasingly contributing to growth becoming a bigger piece of the pie what does that mean for long term margin outlook i mean is 45 and maybe you re going to update us on at analyst day in a month or so but i m just curious is 45 sort of still kind of where we talked about the long term target is there any way to should we think about that being bias to the upside as mix continues to sort of favor some of the more advanced products i m just curious long term what some of the puts and takes are on gross margin in particular and maybe where they could go longer term john p kiernan senior vice president and chief financial officer sure i think rick as you mentioned in the analyst day we re planning to have we would cover that in what our views are on the financial model but to answer that shortly is few years out we do expect with our growth plans to get gross margins in the mid 40 i would just as a reminder right now we are focused on growth and we are continuing to make investments in service infrastructure and for the manufacturing ramp including supporting a number of evals and both of those items are impacting current gross margins as bill said earlier we ve got a significant increase in the amount of evals that we re supporting in the field as well as these semi applications that we re driving today that is requiring investments in our service and manufacturing so i think as we move toward a couple of years out here and we execute our growth plans for mid 40 45 gross margin would be our target rick rick schafer oppenheimer analyst thanks for the color guys william j miller chief executive officer thanks rick operator we ll now take a question from patrick ho with stifel patrick ho stifel analyst thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter and outlook bill maybe first off in terms of your results and your outlook you clearly delivered upside the outlook looks really good the industry in particular on the semiconductor side is experiencing supply chain constraints the inability to procure certain parts allocation all those issues are starting to really pop up in semi with the full understanding that you have different types of tools and even for different markets can you comment on any potential supply chain constraints you ve seen or are starting to see and have you had any kind of nominal impact on your revenue line again with the full understanding that you guys actually delivered upside and are providing a pretty strong outlook william j miller chief executive officer patrick that s really a timely question and we are experiencing lots of constraints in the supply chain but i will say our supply chain team has done an excellent job of mitigating that and taking some unique approaches here at this kind of interesting time and i ll just turn it over to john for a little more detail john p kiernan senior vice president and chief financial officer sure i think just to carry on from what bill just said we haven t been immune to what s going on in the industry here we are seeing some material shortages and longer lead time and i would say the situation is pretty dynamic but we have been successful mitigating those risks or and patrick as you said we are exceeding our revenue target so what we ve done here we ve been more than closely with suppliers to monitor their upstream risks in trying to get out in front of any issues we have been making selected buys ahead of demand and to some extent you can see that in the increased inventory that we re carrying and i would say one of the other things that we ve been successful to be able to do is when in supply issue as identified we ve been able to move quickly to execute alternative supply and we ve been working in that regard with suppliers outside of traditional semi base maybe focusing on competencies in defense and in aerospace so i guess overall i think our supply chain team is an organization is performing well in a tight market environment patrick ho stifel analyst great thanks and kudos to you guys on that and maybe as my follow up question i think your commentary on data storage is completely consistent with the potential digestion period maybe on a qualitative basis bill can you comment maybe the difference between the capacity buyers see versus say the technology by particularly as you see the industry beginning its move to hamr and on the wd and to the energy assisted and more types of drives how much in the technology buys are you starting to see related to those next generation drives and heads william j miller chief executive officer i would say patrick that we if i kind of look back over the last few years a lot of it over the last number of years has really been volume driven and i think what we re seeing now is more of a transition to technology buyers specifically to enable hamr in particular steps within hamr but not in not yet in volume i would say so certainly we ve seen a bit of a pivot here and i look at the order rate not what we re shipping patrick ho stifel analyst great thank you very much william j miller chief executive officer thank you patrick operator we will now take our next question from mark miller with the benchmark company mark miller the benchmark company analyst let me add my congratulations on the quarter just wondering kind of following up on patrick s question about component and supply i know most of your ibd systems are cryo pump but there have been some reports turbopumps shortages by at least one major semi equipment manufacture how exposed are you to turbopumps william j miller chief executive officer we do have turbopumps and cryo pumps in our ion beam deposition and etch tools and i think john mentioned that we ve been taking a little more aggressive position in some of these key components and so yes i think we have that fairly covered mark miller the benchmark company analyst you mentioned in the introductory remarks that micron had committed another euv and they re increasing their capex do you expect the other team around manufacturers to follow suit very quickly and if so what does that mean in terms of orders for your ibd for mask blank dilutions william j miller chief executive officer yes i don t want to really take a position about what our customers are doing i know micron has been very public about their euv adoption and i think there is others that have are adopting euv and that can be read out in the shipments from asml going from shipping 30 systems last year to booking 44 in the first half of this year so a lot of business coming asml s way they have a high productivity tool that they re going to start shipping that s obviously a positive for veeco and i would say at this point what we re seeing is about one of our assistance for every 10 to 15 asml scanners which puts us at about two to four systems per year through kind of a bit lumpy but i think if you were to average that out that s about where we should be sizing it obviously as they take a leg up to say 50 plus system shipments and i believe 22 they are targeting and if that continues onward that would put an upward bias toward our euv mask blank tool shipments but i don t we re not quite ready to take that up yet mark miller the benchmark company analyst thank you william j miller chief executive officer thank you mark operator we ll now take our next question from david duley with steelhead securities david duley steelhead securities analyst yes thanks for taking my questions i was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on your advance packaging business i believe you said in response to a question that your capacity was booked out could you just talk about that a little bit more and then where you are seeing demand in that advanced packaging business is it broad base or is it a simple customer and what the applications are thank you william j miller chief executive officer sure dave we serve this market with lithography as well as wet processing equipment the lithography area we re typically seeing actually i d characterize it as a broad base of applications and customers applications like heterogeneous integration fan out wafer level packaging copper pillar and bumping with foundries idms and osat and so we have seen a significant pickup in order activity which has put this out through the rest of this year at our current capacity levels and clearly enough business activity to kind of state that looks like we re going to see some positive numbers positive growth in 22 over our 2021 business level david duley steelhead securities analyst and i know this is probably hard to gauge but i think it was one or two quarters ago you weren t really calling this a growth driver in your business so just curiosity since you ve got really broad based demand from foundry osats and idms what is there what was the switch that went off or is there something that s being adopted in the marketplace that s all of a sudden forcing customers or causing customers to come in and order in much greater levels william j miller chief executive officer i would say we re i would say if i look back a few quarters we were carrying our visibility was only out about three months four months we were still building a bit to forecast as opposed to build to order and that with in a very in a pretty short period of time we have seen broad adoption i would say we ve seen applications like heterogeneous integration multi chip packaging start to happen in a pretty broad level and so i were to kind of pin it on something i might choose heterogeneous integration but there is also in the osat some of the more basic steps where there s just seems to be a volume of equipment and i wouldn t want to speculate that s automotive or chip shortages in general but it does seem that the activity has picked up john p kiernan senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i think listen we were starting to get some idea over the last six months or so we started to see the order quoting and activity picking up a bit i would say that we were a little bit cautious in our outlook and then the order rate started to pick up a bit and we started to get a little bit more optimistic and now i would say as bill indicated where we would typically have three to four months visibility given the current order rate right now we re getting visibility five to six months out and maybe even a little bit more in some cases so i think that s really given us a an opportunity to be a bit more out this year david duley steelhead securities analyst so and just as a follow up when you talk about heterogeneous integration that s kind of a broad based term i think that is modules and system and package and then some of these the idm strategies like forever triplets so if this is being broadly adopted and i guess it s a simple observation that a lot of the stuff is actually moving into production volumes and that s perhaps why you re seeing much level higher levels of orders william j miller chief executive officer dave i agree with that characterization i think we are seeing broad and i don t really want to go much below heterogeneous integration that i don t really want to without disclosing what we re dealing with what customers so but yes i think that s i think the way you characterize it is fine david duley steelhead securities analyst okay thank you william j miller chief executive officer thanks dave operator we ll now take a question from gus richard with northland gus richard northland capital markets analyst yes thanks for taking my question and good execution i know that s not random luck just as a follow on on the lithography there is some long lead time items the glass and was wondering how you are fixed for basically raw glass and your fabricators is that creating a is that a bottleneck in getting shipped tools out the door william j miller chief executive officer no it s not that our lead times are particularly long i mean it s we carry years of glass in various stages of width whether it s raw glass or partially processed glass or fully processed glass and so we would it s very hard to never run out of glass so we carry gus richard northland capital markets analyst fair enough sorry to interrupt just real quick because normally those tools are like book and ship in a quarter and i m just wondering for the stretch and deliveries is that just customer flat dates or why is it stressed bed william j miller chief executive officer we are running out of slots we are ramping our laser annealing business and our lithography business we did announce that we are doing on expansion we leased a building about a mile away from our current facility and that s really doubling the manufacturing footprint of laser annealing and lithography and that s obviously critical for us to execute the business that s pending in front of us and so what we re seeing is we only spent about 40 million in capex between this year and next year our lease in our current building ends january 2023 we re going to have some overlap expenses but we will be completely in the new building q3 of next year so really ramping the second facility is really critical for us and i m pleased to say we re really on track with what is an aggressive construction project gus richard northland capital markets analyst got it and then does that business getting the little piece on the lsa second to back to prior peaks william j miller chief executive officer i don t think about our prior peaks like the 2016 and 17 model i think we re there yet john p kiernan senior vice president and chief financial officer no i wouldn t categorize it to that level gus richard northland capital markets analyst got it that s helpful and then finally on the compound semi there is a number of potential applications for gan power and rf i was wondering which ones of those are you seeing demand for in particular william j miller chief executive officer we re seeing demand in gan power a lot of it is for gan charging rapid charging consumer applications we have sold tools to a number of customers for that application i did mention a few minutes ago that we ve placed an 8 inch gan on silicon tool at a foundry the industry is at 6 inch today and we believe that the industry is going to move to 8 inch just for economies of scale and leveraging 8 inch infrastructure as opposed to 6 inch infrastructure so we think that s a pretty exciting opportunity for us gus richard northland capital markets analyst got it and any gan rf business william j miller chief executive officer we do have gan rf a number of companies are looking at multiple uses of the equipment for gan on silicon and power as well as rf applications gus richard northland capital markets analyst okay and then and just and on photonics is there any production revenue in the is core activity for photonics picking up at all william j miller chief executive officer we are seeing i don t believe we have the orders yet but i believe we are looking at repeat orders from customers for photonics applications that we had in eval with over a year ago we do have on top of that an eval system for microleds for arsenide phosphide applications which is pretty exciting as well gus richard northland capital markets analyst is the photonics application william j miller chief executive officer no it s for microled it would be more of gallium arsenide substrate red opportunity gus richard northland capital markets analyst got it all right very good thanks so much for taking the questions william j miller chief executive officer thanks gus operator and it appears we have no further telephone questions i d like to turn the conference back over to mr miller for any additional or closing remarks william j miller chief executive officer thank you operator and thank you for joining our call today we do remain excited about 21 and i want to thank our customers and shareholders along with the veeco united team for their continued support as we execute our growth strategy we are excited to share more details and introduce you to keep some a few

tierra s quarterly report on form 10 q filed august 3 2021 key highlights end of colombian blockades affecting gran tierra as previously announced by gran tierra on may 17 2021 a number of protests and blockades across colombia impacted several key transportation routes throughout the country resulting in the temporary shut in of some of gran tierra s wells and oil fields though these blockades were not directed at gran tierra these events caused the company to implement temporary production curtailments during may and june 2021 as a result of the blockades approximately 597 000 bbl of oil production were deferred during the quarter and gran tierra does not expect any negative impact on the company s oil reserves as the company previously announced on july 12 2021 the colombian government successfully negotiated the end to all of the blockades in the areas that were affecting gran tierra s operations which has allowed the company to restore its oil production throughout its entire colombian portfolio second quarter 2021 production the quarter s production averaged 23 035 bopd up 14 from the second quarter of 2020 but down 6 from the first quarter of 2021 the prior quarter the quarter over quarter production drop was due solely to the temporary impact of the blockades during the quarter all of which have since been lifted strong second half 2021 production gran tierra forecasts second half 2021 total production to average approximately 30 000 32 000 bopd full year 2021 production guidance based on the company s significant progress in restoring production subsequent to the quarter gran tierra reaffirms its 2021 full year production guidance of 27 500 28 500 bopd key financial metrics for the quarter credit facility paid down despite the reduction in the quarter s production as of june 30 2021 the company had paid down its credit facility balance by 5 million to 175 million and had a cash and cash equivalents balance of 20 million these figures compare to a credit facility balance of 180 million and cash and cash equivalents balance of 22 million at the end of the prior quarter with 2021 expected free cash flow2 and changes in non cash working capital primarily related to the ongoing collection of tax receivables gran tierra expects its bank credit facility to be paid down to a balance of 60 80 million by december 31 2021 significant reduction in operating expenses compared to the prior quarter the company s operating expenses were down 9 to 12 46 bbl despite the reduction in the quarter s production this decrease in operating expenses was achieved mainly by lower power generation costs in acordionero increases in other expenses due to the temporary impact of the blockades during the quarter gran tierra rerouted some of its production to higher cost transportation alternatives as a result of these temporary alternative marketing arrangements with higher costs the quality and transportation discount was up 2 56 bbl during the quarter to 11 54 bbl relative to the prior quarter transportation expenses were up 0 28 bbl during the quarter to 1 43 bbl compared to the prior quarter with the resolution of the blockade situation gran tierra has restored its normal lower cost transportation routes and reaffirms its 2021 full year forecasts for quality and transportation discount of 8 00 10 00 bbl and transportation expenses of 0 90 1 10 bbl general and administrative g a expenses before stock based compensation increased by 0 77 bbl during the quarter to 3 49 bbl compared to the prior quarter due to the timing of certain corporate costs gran tierra reaffirms its 2021 full year forecast for g a expenses of 1 50 2 50 bbl narrowed net loss and increased ebitda relative to the prior quarter gran tierra significantly narrowed its realized net loss by 53 to 18 million from 37 million in the prior quarter ebitda1 also substantially improved to 34 million up from 16 million in the prior quarter funds flow relative to the prior quarter the company s funds flow from operations1 was down 20 to 23 million due to the quarter s blockade driven drop in production and temporary increase in expenses but was up 290 from second quarter 2020 increased oil sales and operating netback the brent oil price averaged 69 08 bbl and gran tierra generated oil sales of 97 million up 1 or 1 million from the prior quarter as the 13 increase in the brent oil price more than offset the 6 decrease in production during the quarter the company s operating netback3 of 33 44 bbl was up 15 an increase of 4 24 bbl relative to the prior quarter this improvement was achieved despite an increase in royalties to 10 21 bbl up from the prior quarter s 8 34 bbl which was caused by higher oil prices and despite increased expenses during the quarter capital expenditures the quarter s expenditures of approximately 37 million were flat with the prior quarter s level of 37 million as gran tierra pressed ahead with development drilling operations completions and workovers at the acordionero and costayaco oil fields the company estimates that approximately 50 60 of its 2021 capital program of 130 150 million has been spent during the first half of 2021 oil price hedges in place designed to protect cash flows during second half 2021 the company has the following brent oil price hedges in place covering 10

blockades during the quarter we are very pleased that we have now safely and diligently ramped operations back up throughout our colombia portfolio although the blockades temporarily impacted gran tierra s production volumes the stronger brent oil price environment more than offset the effect of lower production volumes as demonstrated by our higher oil sales and ebitda1 figures with production restored we expect gran tierra to generate second half 2021 free cash flow2 of 100 120 million with a constructive oil price environment a successful first half 2021 drilling program and the expiry of our first half 2021 oil price hedges we are very excited about the second half of 2021 and all of 2022 operations update acordionero oil field 100 wi gran tierra completed a total of 13 workovers during the quarter to restore wells to production which had gone offline during the current workover campaign the average electric submersible pump replacement cost has decreased 57 from fourth quarter 2019 the development drilling rig was active from november 30 2020 to may 13 2021 drilling both producers and water injectors the average cost per well has decreased 38 since 2019 five wells were drilled from pad 6 with a pacesetter well from spud to rig release of 10 9 days at a total cost of 1 9 million from january 1 to june 30 2021 gran tierra drilled 11 new oil wells and 2 new water injection wells gran tierra believes its prudent reservoir management of acordionero s waterflood has allowed the company to restore this field s production to a level last achieved 20 months ago which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness of the waterflood costayaco oil field 100 wi in march 2021 gran tierra commenced its infill development drilling campaign to drill 3 oil producers this drilling program is the first in costayaco since november 2019 the cyc 42 and cyc 43 infill oil wells were drilled during march and april of 2021 and the cyc 44 infill well was drilled in late april 2021 the cyc 43 well is currently on production and the cyc 42 and cyc 44 wells are both expected to start production during august 2021 moqueta oil field 100 wi during the quarter gran tierra initiated a 6 well workover program one stimulation mqt 12 and one injector conversion mqt 2 were completed two remaining injector conversions mqt 6 and mqt 16 and two producer workovers mqt 15 and mqt 8 are expected to be completed by early september 2021 the workover program is designed to optimize the field s waterflood and potentially increase ultimate oil recovery suroriente block 52 wi and operator at the cohembi oil field in the suroriente block a facility expansion program is progressing as planned which is expected to allow additional production to be brought online in the second

operational activities and expectations regarding well performance production and workover activities the benefits of reduced capital spending and g a expenses and the benefits of derivative transactions and expectations regarding future oil prices among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements in this press release are the unprecedented impact of the covid 19 pandemic and the actions of opec and non opec countries and the procedures imposed by governments in response thereto disruptions to local operations the decline and volatility in oil and gas industry conditions and commodity prices the severe imbalance in supply and demand for oil and natural gas prices and markets for oil and natural gas are unpredictable and volatile the accuracy of productive capacity of any particular field the timing and impact of any resumption of operations gran tierra s operations are located in

the forward looking statements contained in this press release are based on certain assumptions made by gran tierra based on management s experience and other factors believed to be appropriate gran tierra believes these assumptions to be reasonable at this time but the forward looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties many of which are beyond gran tierra s control which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward looking statements the risk that the assumptions on which the 2021 outlook and guidance are based prove incorrect may increase the later the period to which the outlook relates in particular the unprecedented nature of the current economic downturn pandemic and industry decline may make it particularly difficult to identify risks or predict the degree to which identified risks will impact gran tierra s business and financial condition all forward looking statements are made as of the date of this press release

comparable to the non gaap measures ebitda and operating netback respectively due to the impracticality of quantifying certain components required by gaap as a result of the inherent volatility in the value of certain financial instruments held by the company and the inability to quantify the effectiveness of commodity price derivatives used to manage the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of its oil production and changes in commodity prices operating netback as presented is defined as projected 2021 oil and gas sales less projected 2021 operating and transportation

hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume gran tierra s reported production is a mix of light crude oil and medium and heavy crude oil for which there is not a precise breakdown since the company s oil sales volumes typically represent blends of more than one type of crude oil well test results should be considered as preliminary and not necessarily indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery well log interpretations indicating oil and gas accumulations are not necessarily indicative of future production or ultimate recovery if it is indicated that a pressure transient analysis or well test interpretation has not been carried out any data disclosed in that respect should be considered preliminary until such analysis has been completed references to thickness of oil pay or of a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume this press release contains certain oil and gas metrics including operating netback and cash netback which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons these metrics are calculated as described in this press release and management believes that they are useful supplemental measures for the reasons described in this press release such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the company s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods

shanghai the great powers in history have tended to have one thing in common size matters while a large market does not guarantee dominance in other realms it certainly helps perhaps more than any other single factor this was true of the united states and now it applies to china beyond being a leading economic and trading power china is increasingly and inexorably becoming a global financial power somehow too many economists in the west did not see this coming even a decade ago few were bullish about the growth of china s external financial strength with sceptics highlighting the country s vulnerabilities a rare exception is brown university s arvind subramanian in his 2011 book eclipse living in the shadow of china s economic dominance subramanian argued that china s dominance was not only more imminent but would also be broader than virtually anyone expected involving huge financial influence among the domains that china would reshape given his prescience the title of the chinese translation of his book the big forecast might have been more apt why did subramanian see so clearly what most economists didn t his model unlike the standard analytical framework of economics included the variable of size a decade later china s financial influence is becoming impossible to ignore in the 20 months beginning on april 1 2019 364 renminbi denominated onshore chinese bonds issued by china s government and policy banks were added to the bloomberg barclays global aggregate index the first time domestic chinese bonds were included in a major global index was a milestone in the opening up of china s financial markets and it was followed by more progress with jp morgan adding chinese government bonds to its flagship index in the first quarter of 2020 ftse russell will follow suit beginning later this year with that chinese bonds will be included in all three of the major bond indices tracked by global investors it should not be surprising then that the rmb globalisation index which measures growth in offshore renminbi usage reached new highs this year following three years of 40 per cent annual growth the rapid internationalisation of china s bond market has accelerated the internationalisation of the renminbi a process the government has long sought to facilitate in 2010 china allowed central banks renminbi offshore clearing banks and offshore participating banks to invest in china s interbank bond market china launched the shanghai hong kong stock connect in 2014 and the shenzhen hong kong stock connect two years later both use a two way renminbi settlement system the people s bank of china pboc has also allowed eligible foreign institutional investors to access the china interbank bond market directly without quotas or restrictions since 2016 and in 2017 it established china bond connect which gives overseas investors access to fixed income markets in mainland china via trading infrastructure in hong kong these efforts are bearing fruit according to the financial times overseas investors have bought a net 35 3 billion worth of chinese stocks through the shanghai and shenzhen hong kong stock connects so far this year an annual increase of about 49 per cent as of july they held more than 228 billion in renminbi denominated a shares of china based firms through these channels moreover overseas investors have purchased more than 75 billion worth of chinese government bonds this year up 50 per cent year on year and about 578 billion in chinese bonds through the china bond connect channel foreign investors now hold a total of 806 billion in chinese stocks and bonds up 40 per cent from a year ago ultra loose monetary policy in the us and the european union during the covid 19 pandemic has undoubtedly helped to fuel this surge in purchases of chinese assets a huge amount of money is flowing out of the us and the eu and china is a safer destination for it than other emerging market economies but that does not mean this is a short term trend the annual global public investor survey published by the official monetary and financial institutions forum shows that 30 per cent of central banks plan to increase their renminbi holdings in the next 12 24 months compared with 10 per cent last year in africa almost half of central banks plan to increase their renminbi reserves as a result the renminbi s share of global foreign exchange reserves is on track to rise at an average annual rate of roughly 1 percentage point for the next five years research by goldman sachs and citi predicts that the renminbi will be among the world s top three currencies within a decade as china opens its capital markets it is also quietly pushing forward the development of its central bank digital currency cbdc the e cny the cbdc is currently being tested in a representative sample of ten key cities placing china well ahead of the vast majority of other central banks while 80 per cent have begun to design a digital currency system only 16 per cent of them have reached the pilot stage china has also been developing a digital cross border payment system now the pboc has joined with the hong kong monetary authority the bank of thailand and the central bank of the united arab emirates to launch a multilateral research project multiple cbdc bridge which will explore ways to incorporate digital currencies into cross border payment systems while the e cny is currently being positioned as a cash payment voucher its potential is huge as china s belt and road initiative facilitates an increase in trade and investment flows the e cny will expand the renminbi s use in settling cross border transactions reduce dependence on the us led swift network and lay the groundwork for the establishment of a more convenient regional digital currency payment network led by china most importantly the e cny will certainly help china to internationalise its multitrillion dollar domestic debt thereby creating a huge market to turn the renminbi into an internationalisation currency whatever challenges china faces its financial rise can no longer be ignored and subramanian s decade old prediction remains valid it will happen faster and more comprehensively than most observers expect zhang jun dean of the school of economics at fudan university is director of the china centre for economic studies a shanghai

frac sand and provider of proppant logistics solutions through both its in basin transloading terminal and smartsystems products and services today announced results for the second quarter 2021 charles young smart sand s chief executive officer stated we are pleased to have put the u s well service lawsuit behind us with the favorable judgement and our negotiated settlement of 35 million in cash this brings this issue to a positive conclusion provides us with additional liquidity to support the business and allows us the ability to fully focus on the path ahead for smart sand although second quarter sales volumes were basically flat with first quarter sales our activity levels for the first half of 2021 were higher than we achieved in the first half of 2019 before the pandemic severely impacted market activity should commodity prices continue to stay in their current pricing ranges we believe activity will start to improve over the next twelve months with our high quality asset base ample liquidity and strong balance sheet we are well positioned to compete in the market going forward second quarter 2021 results revenues were 29 6 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 27 5 million in the first quarter of 2021 and 26 1 million in the second quarter of 2020 revenues were up in the second quarter compared to the first quarter of 2021 due to higher sand sales revenues resulting from higher in basin sales volumes partially offset by a decrease in logistics and shortfall revenues logistics revenue decreased in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2021 due to increased in basin shipments which include transportation and other handling services rather than mine gate shipments the increase in revenue in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the second quarter of 2020 was primarily due to the negative impact of covid 19 on sales during 2020 which was partially offset by shortfall revenue tons sold were approximately 767 000 in the second quarter of 2021 compared with approximately 760 000 tons in the first quarter of 2021 and 208 000 tons in the second quarter of 2020 increases of 1 and 269 respectively sales volumes were relatively consistent in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2021 and significantly higher than the same period in the prior year demand has increased from last year as the overall economy has improved from the depressed levels caused by covid 19 in 2020 for the second quarter of 2021 the company had a net loss of 27 3 million or 0 65 per basic and diluted share compared to net loss of 3 9 million or 0 09 per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of 2021 and net income of 4 6 million or 0 12 per basic and diluted share for the second quarter of 2020 the higher net loss in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2021 is primarily due to 19 6 million recorded as non cash bad debt expense in the current period which is the difference between the 54 6 million accounts receivable balance that was subject to the company s litigation with u s well services llc u s well and the 35 0 million cash received in the settlement of such litigation partially offset by higher average sand prices over the previous quarter while the company wrote down a portion of the receivables that it had previously recorded related to the disputed contract with u s well it increased its cash position by 35 0 million as a result of the proceeds received in the settlement the difference in net loss income in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 was primarily due to 19 6 million non cash bad debt expense recorded against the residual balance of accounts receivable previously under litigation with u s well combined with lower average sale prices per ton of our sand and no shortfall revenue in the current period contribution margin was 3 5 million or 4 55 per ton sold for the second quarter of 2021 compared to 1 0 million or 1 36 per ton sold for the first quarter of 2021 and 19 3 million or 92 62 per ton sold for the second quarter of 2020 the sequential increase in contribution margin and contribution margin per ton in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2021 was primarily due to production cost savings as we remain focused on being the lowest cost provider of northern white frac sand the decrease in contribution margin and contribution margin per ton in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year was due primarily to shortfall revenue in the prior year period on historically low sales volumes as the covid 19 pandemic began to impact the global economy adjusted ebitda was 21 5 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared with 3 5 million for the first quarter of 2021 and 15 6 million for the second quarter of 2020 adjusted ebitda declined in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2021 as a result of the 19 6 million bad debt expense recorded in the second quarter of 2021 related to the settlement of litigation with u s well partially offset by lower production costs the decrease in adjusted ebitda compared to the second quarter of 2020 was primarily due to the bad debt expense recorded in the quarter and no shortfall revenue recognized in the current period liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash flow generated from operations and available borrowings under our abl credit facility and the acquisition liquidity support facility from our recent acquisition as of june 30 2021 cash on hand was 39 3 million and we had 12 9 million in undrawn availability on our abl credit facility with no borrowings outstanding under our abl credit facility or the acquisition liquidity support facility in the second quarter we received a 35 million cash payment as a settlement of our litigation with u s well for the six months ended june 30 2021 we spent approximately 5 0 million on capital expenditures we estimate that full year 2021 capital expenditures will be between 10 0 million and 12 0 million we continue to remain focused on a strong balance sheet and low

and production cost per ton as non gaap financial measures as we expand our logistics activities and continue to sell sand closer to the wellhead our sand production costs will only be a portion of our overall cost structure gross profit is the gaap measure most directly comparable to contribution margin contribution margin should not be considered an alternative to gross profit presented in

in washington the conversation about infrastructure and budget reconciliation is running hot and heavy both the good the bad and the ugly right now nothing is completely clear not the outcomes not the spending not the scoring and not even the taxing though let me tell you there s going to be plenty of spending plenty of taxing and unfortunately plenty of weird scoring the infrastructure story could rest on cbo and jtc tax scoring a lot of republicans are waiting for the official numbers according to the hill media website the joint committee on taxation issued a report yesterday saying the bipartisan infrastructure deal would raise only 51 billion in new tax revenues over the next 10 years a fraction of the 550 billion in proposed new spending 51 is a bad number for this deal up to 300 billion could come from repurposing unused covid money but the rest of it could be a day in the country or should i say a day lost in the country s deep woods part of the good news of infrastructure is there s no phony irs tax gap and no corporate income tax hikes also there is no infrastructure bank but the bipartisan group will not pay for infrastructure with dynamic scoring ending medicare rebates imposing drug price controls or 30 billion of a crypto currency tax they look revenue short to me right now of about 100 billion which means republican support is by no means a given we will have senator bill hagerty in the next block to comment on all of this but my biggest concern is still the budget reconciliation package this is the taxing spending entitling greening transformational worker s paradise utopia that the left wing democratic progressives yearn for it will all be jammed into the reconciliation bill amnesty for illegals may be part of it banning voter photo ids could be part of it there s no telling and for those of us who do not wish to transform america into a woke driven exercise in central planning regulating critical race theory cancel culture end free enterprise vision i think of it as bulgaria before the berlin wall came down this proposed bill must be stopped it is the number one priority for people of all stripes who love this country and want to save it whatever the democrats don t get in infrastructure they re going to try to jam it into reconciliation part of the bad of infrastructure is this green new deal ness which covers about 140 billion dollars or roughly one quarter of the bipartisan package there will be massive subsidies for everything remotely related to green including changing the electricity power grid boosting electric vehicle car sales financing electric gas pumps aka electric charging stations and according to some conservative friends the word equity appears 64 times in this 2 700 page infrastructure bill in other words equal opportunity at the starting line is not enough anymore we need equality at the finish line and if not equity unfortunately based on gender race and other identity groups then federal subsidies will flow galore of course i don t like any of that you can t buy me off but you could temporarily rent me if you give me a free tesla which is kind of what they re doing with free everything that is green i m joking here but not entirely so there s the good the bad and the ugly on infrastructure but as far as the budget reconciliation package is concerned there is nothing good it s all bad and it s getting more and more ugly let me stop here again we re going to have senator bill hagerty on to talk more about infrastructure and reconciliation i just wanted to get this riff off my chest early in the show but first we re going to go to another hot story and that is the demise of chinese stocks click here to get the fox business app as the chinese communist government intensifies and spreads its regulatory crackdowns on public companies some 400 billion of the value of us listed chinese companies has gone down the drain places like california s orange county employee s retirement system state funds like calpirs calsterz are going to have to change their strategy for profit tutoring companies in china have been decimated by communist government intervention

changes in government mix due to shifts to medicare advantage plans increased hospital inpatient revenue and favorable changes in commercial mix patient care costs the quarter change was primarily due to decreases in labor costs driven by a decline in hospital inpatient treatments a seasonal decrease in payroll taxes and declines in professional fees and health benefit expenses these decreases were partially offset by increases in other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers including utilities expense resulting from lower expense in the first quarter of 2021 related to our virtual power purchase arrangements as well as increases in medical supply expense and insurance expense the year to date change was primarily due to increases in other direct operating expenses

millions note 1 calculation of the leverage ratio under our senior secured credit facilities the credit agreement dated august 12 2019 the leverage ratio is defined as a all funded debt plus the face amount of all letters of credit issued minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents including short term investments not to exceed 750 divided by b consolidated ebitda the leverage ratio determines the interest rate margin payable by the company for its term loan a and revolving line of credit under the credit agreement by establishing the margin over the base interest rate libor that is applicable the calculation below is based on the last twelve months of consolidated ebitda as of the end of the reported period and pro forma for acquisitions or divestitures that occurred during the period and consolidated net debt at the end of the reported period each as defined in the credit agreement the company s management believes the presentation of consolidated ebitda is useful to investors to enhance their understanding of the company s leverage ratio under its credit agreement the leverage ratio calculated by the company is a non gaap measure and should not be considered a substitute for the ratio of total debt to operating income determined in accordance with gaap the company s calculation of its leverage ratio might not be calculated in the same manner as and thus might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies twelve months ended june 30 2021 march 31 2021 june 30 2020 net income attributable to davita inc from continuing operations 1

calculation and this measure of net income already excludes our discontinued operations divested 2 the debt amounts as of june 30 2021 march 31 2021 and june 30 2020 presented exclude approximately 62

gaap measures unaudited note on non gaap financial measures as used in this press release the term adjusted refers to non gaap measures as follows each as reconciled to its most comparable gaap measure as presented in the non gaap reconciliations in the notes to this press release i for income measures the term adjusted refers to operating performance measures that exclude certain items such as impairment charges gain loss on ownership changes restructuring charges accruals for legal matters and debt prepayment and refinancing charges and ii the term effective income tax rate on adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to davita inc represents the company s effective tax rate excluding applicable non gaap items and noncontrolling owners income which primarily relates to non tax paying entities these non gaap or adjusted measures are presented because management believes these measures are useful adjuncts to gaap results however these non gaap measures should not be considered alternatives to the corresponding measures determined under gaap specifically management uses adjusted operating income adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to davita inc and adjusted diluted net income from continuing operations per share attributable to davita inc to compare and evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors to analyze the underlying trends in our business to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes we believe these non gaap measures also are useful to investors and analysts in evaluating our performance over time and relative to competitors as well as in analyzing the underlying trends in our business furthermore we believe these presentations enhance a user s understanding of our normal consolidated results by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations as a result adjusting for these amounts allows for comparison to our normalized prior period results in addition the effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations attributable to davita inc excludes noncontrolling owners income which primarily relates to non tax paying entities the effective income tax rate on adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to davita inc excludes noncontrolling owners income and certain non deductible and other charges which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results accordingly we believe these adjusted effective income tax rates are useful to management investors and analysts in evaluating our performance and establishing expectations for income taxes incurred on our ordinary results attributable to davita inc finally free cash flow from continuing operating represents net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less distributions to noncontrolling interests and all capital expenditures including development capital expenditures routine maintenance and information technology plus contributions from noncontrolling interests and proceeds from the sale of self developed properties management uses this measure to assess our ability to fund acquisitions and meet our debt service obligations and we believe this measure is equally useful to investors and analysts as an adjunct to cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations and other measures under gaap it is important to bear in mind that these non gaap adjusted measures are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and should not be considered in isolation from nor as substitutes for their most comparable gaap measures the following notes 2 through 5 provide reconciliations of the non gaap financial

alex brummer why placing a price on pledges is of utmost importance whitehall s indifference to the defence and national security implications of private equity and overseas bids in britain s aerospace and engineering sector is disturbing in spite of a heavily redacted national security report on the sale of aerospace group cobham to advent warning of its importance to uk defences it was sold off with few safeguards at the time of the proposed 2012 merger of the uk s defence industry leader bae with europe s airbus it took an intervention from angela merkel concerned about production in germany to scupper the transaction while britain sat on its hands those who regard the potential sale of defence contractor meggitt to american interloper parker hannifin as a no brainer because the companies are a good fit should listen to the wise words of lord west of spithead a former admiral of the fleet and downing street national security adviser west argues that the behaviour of advent after the takeover of cobham in early 2020 serves as a warning to the uk s high tech defence industry that advent owned cobham is now seeking to take control of ultra electronics responsible for valuable submarine detection technology beggars belief the retired admiral notes that parkerhannifin can make all the promises it wants but it is difficult to hold the predators to commitments his remedy is that if key undertakings are ignored then the trespassers should be subject to big fines at the time of the financial crisis prosecutors in new york showed no mercy in levying huge penalties not just on the american banks but on uk banks too in britain the serious fraud office has reached a series of deferred prosecution agreements which have seen companies as different as rollsroyce and tesco cough up big fines the eu has shown considerable bravery in challenging internet giants apple and google and levied penalties for alleged breaches of competition law one of the biggest tests of the uk s willingness to intervene in takeovers on national security grounds is the proposed softbank sale of britain s smart chip maker arm holdings to us competitor nvidia stock image the prospect of fines in the hundreds of millions of pounds for breaking takeover promises would be a huge deterrent to private equity marauders and foreign buyers with a main objective of extracting value from companies the new uk national security and investment act ought to put some sand in the wheels of buyers acquiring on the cheap in london might look far less attractive if there were big financial consequences when factories are closed jobs lost and as in the case of cobham valuable flight refuelling technology shipped overseas strong arm one of the biggest tests of the uk s willingness to intervene in takeovers on national security grounds is the proposed softbank sale of britain s smart chip maker arm holdings to us competitor nvidia a report delivered to the government in july suggests the deal has worrying implications for british security and should be blocked according to bloomberg as concerning would be the potential technology and intellectual property loss should the cambridge company end up in american hands a far better outcome would be an initial public offering restoring arm to the london stock exchange cash gusher as temperatures in parts of southern europe soar above 40 centigrade germany emerges from terrifying floods and people drown in the torrents cascading through china s subways it is hard not to think that climate change is happening yet so far bp boss bernard looney has received limited credit for embracing the green agenda indeed it seems there is a body of shareholders who don t care so long as oil profits keep on gushing the jump in the oil price from 20 a barrel at the start of the pandemic to 72 a barrel shows that what investors really care about is dividends and share buybacks looney doesn t intend to invest in new exploration despite the current high price instead he is promising share buybacks of at least 1bn a quarter as long as oil stays above 60 a barrel that will be most welcome to most shareholders but the bonanza should provide a golden opportunity to go all out for investment in renewables beyond current projects such as offshore wind leases in scotland and norway and us solar the difficulty is convincing investors that beyond oil can ever be more valuable than drilling

have to trust someone to buy homemade seafood from a street cart and favela 47 was that vendor in the poorest neighborhoods of long beach when the coronavirus pandemic shut down food carts across los angeles county and the rest of the country last year favela adapted taking her knives and cutting boards to a friend s kitchen together the women both undocumented kept sales moving and money in their pocket until this spring when favela felt a tickle in her throat it was covid for weeks she couldn t work the money dried up she said and the long beach boarding house where she was subletting a room left an eviction notice with her name on it on the front door that was the friday before memorial day they gave me the notice on may 28 and told me to be out on june 2 and every day in between was closed for the holiday favela said i tried to ask the people at the courthouse but they said i needed to make an appointment sheriff s deputies knocked at 5 a m on june 2 and told her to leave she said that night favela and her 11 year old son slept in a city park hers is one of at least 221 households evicted in the city of long beach since july 2020 one of the densest clusters of evictions in los angeles county the county with the most residential evictions in california according to a calmatters analysis an eviction moratorium with evictions in the city of long beach a calmatters analysis found 83 evictions in the second half of 2020 and 138 in the first three months of 2021 from july 2020 through march 2021 sheriff s departments across the state enforced lockouts of at least 7 677 households according to data obtained through public records requests from all but two of california s 58 counties similar data from march 2020 until august showed the state carried out at least 2 000 evictions bringing the total number of california households locked out throughout the pandemic to nearly 10 000 at minimum the number of evictions has accelerated in 2021 and they are happening despite a series of moratoriums approved by gov gavin newsom and the legislature that are supposed to protect people who were barely scraping by when the pandemic made them sick or cost them jobs leaving them unable to pay rent cynthia macias board president of housing long beach sits inside her office in long beach on july 23 2021 pablo unzueta calmatters but in long beach it has been a mostly invisible crisis on the street no vast tracts of unoccupied homes as seen in the foreclosure crisis during the 2008 great recession no blocks of shuttered storefronts no long lines for food or jobs the eviction crisis is also less visible city tenant assistance groups say because 75 of the people they work with are undocumented and many of them already live in the shadows this landlord would tell me these tenants need to go back to their country said cynthia macias board president of housing long beach a tenant advocacy group or that they should be on section 8 federally subsidized housing since they re so poor excuse me like it s a pandemic i don t understand how i have to rationalize with you why this family chose not to work they re people like favela who found a new home in mid june with money raised online by late july she took a job cleaning houses she was supposed to start today but last week her son started coughing and she again felt a tickle in her throat the root causes why is long beach a hotspot in a county that already makes up nearly half of the state s confirmed residential evictions the reasons are both mundane and the result of extraordinary circumstances a complicated mixture of failures in planning and landlords suspected of exploiting loopholes three major factors according to city officials academics and residents are high unemployment the number of renters and the age of houses in this blue collar port city at 11 the city s unemployment rate is higher than the state and county average although long beach leaders say they re optimistic about a recovery renters comprise 60 of long beach residents a number higher than los angeles county 54 or orange county 43 which is on long beach s southeast border according to research by seiji steimetz chairperson of economics and director of the office of economic research at california state university long beach a man walks along a fence located near the residence inn by marriott hotel in long beach on july 30 2021 the hotel is where rasheena mccord and her children are temporarily living after she was evicted pablo unzueta calmatters while tenants in long beach are not significantly more likely to spend more than 30 of their income on rent than the residents in the rest of los angeles county steimetz said people of color are far more likely to rent just 24 of black households and 29 of latino families own their homes compared to 54 of white households according to city statistics a third factor is that long beach s housing stock is extraordinarily old compared to the rest of the county in long beach 82 of residential units are more than 30 years old the age at which they generally need major upgrades and 71 of long beach residential units are more than 50 years old older housing stock means renters are more likely to be put out of their homes because state law allows landlords to evict for needed upgrades or repairs even during the pandemic said christopher koontz long beach s deputy director of development services but koontz said the city suspects some landlords are exploiting the law to evict tenants for instance by merely installing a new appliance the definition of substantial remodel leaves a lot to be desired he said ironically just two weeks before the march 2020 shutdown caused by the pandemic the city had enacted stronger tenant protections requiring landlords to get construction permits and compelling them to notify tenants sooner about remodeling in june four city council members wrote to mayor robert garcia warning that effectively any tenant or family residing in an older building is at risk of eviction later this month the city council will take up a proposal to halt all no fault substantial remodel evictions until the end of the year the california apartment association maintains that most evictions are due to nuisances and health and safety issues under the current statewide moratorium landlords can evict tenants for a substantial remodel only if that is necessary to comply with health and safety standards it s too late for those already evicted in long beach 83 households were locked out between july and december 2020 in just the first three months of 2021 sheriff s deputies evicted 138 households according to calmatters analysis many of the elected leaders who represent long beach however don t want to talk about the eviction crisis in their backyard assemblymember patrick o donnell a democrat whose district includes long beach declined to comment through a spokesperson janice hahn the los angeles county supervisor whose district includes long beach did not return multiple calls from calmatters a separate city unscathed there s one area of long beach relatively untouched by the eviction crisis signal hill a city that exists entirely within the borders of long beach has had a total of five evictions during the pandemic one of the most affluent cities in the country signal hill was founded in 1924 three years after a 600 barrel a day oil well sprung a gusher seeking to avoid a proposed oil tax in long beach a cadre of oil men drew the borders of a new city and signal hill was born and the oil tax avoided today signal hill is a kind of suburb within long beach comprised of broad boulevards lined with cookie cutter big box stores office parks and coffee shops scrubbed to a sparkle with the kind of refined sterility that comes when cities have lots of tax dollars to spend on roads and parks its 75 000 median annual household income is 12 000 more than the surrounding city more than 46 of its population has at least a bachelor s degree 15 percentage points higher than in long beach looking from just the right angle on the right street there are views of the port of long beach and the poorer neighborhoods that line signal hill s south and west border it was along that border that long beach saw its highest concentration of evictions and it was along that border that rasheena mccord made a life until the summer of 2020 living on the street here s what mccord knows about sleeping as a single woman on the street start at bus depots because they are brightly lit make sure some part of your body is touching all of your stuff treat anyone who approaches as a threat on the good days she said she s able to scrape together money for a motel room but not every day is a good day before the pandemic and her eviction mccord was in a two bedroom apartment with her two children and her partner her family was just beginning to recover from the serious beating of her special needs son outside a long beach high school in may 2019 three teenagers were charged and one 19 year old man was sentenced to eight years in prison that october the same month mccord 41 filed domestic violence charges against her partner when he went to jail she was left to pay the rent by herself in the meantime she said the hospital where she worked as a caregiver and medical technician cut her hours from about 32 per week down to one eight hour shift she fell behind paying the rent and in february 2020 her landlord filed for eviction a judge scheduled the eviction for march 24 when the state shut down at the outset of the pandemic and newsom issued a stay at home order on march 19 mccord thought she might be safe from removal with the whole stay at home order i wondered if the eviction was even going to happen mccord recalled the landlord said that virus has nothing to do with the eviction she sent her children to stay with her parents in los angeles but there was no room for her so she spent her first night on the street within a week she filed for unemployment and looked for help from the city and county i had been trying to get hotel vouchers but because i m not 65 or over not mentally ill not hiv positive not at high risk for covid which is freaking ridiculous mccord said she found a new job at a hospital in artesia with significantly reduced hours but she said she quit this january due to the concentration of covid cases mccord who said she isn t vaccinated sold her car and went back on unemployment she s now staying in hotels with help from housing long beach today mccord sees far more families on the street or living in cars their belongings piled up to the rear window and stacked on the roof you used to see that like a family on vacation visiting from out of town now it s actually people freaking living in it mccord said sometimes you may feel like man i m going through this s t alone am i the only person then when you see these families these little bitty kids younger than mine babies and the mom s doing the best she can i ve never seen this many families homeless in my life california s eviction moratorium is set to
