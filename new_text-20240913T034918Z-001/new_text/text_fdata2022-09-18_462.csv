president joe biden arrived in london to pay his respects to queen elizabeth ii at a time of transition in u s u k relations as both a new monarch and a new prime minister are settling in the hawkish approach of prime minister liz truss to russia and china puts her on the same page as biden but the rise of truss 47 who once called the relationship special but not exclusive could mark a decidedly new chapter in the trans atlantic partnership on trade and more of high concern for biden officials in the early going of truss s premiership is her backing of legislation that would shred parts of the post brexit trading arrangements in northern ireland analysts say the move could cause deep strain between the u k and the european union and undermine peace in northern ireland white house press secretary karine jean pierre said the move would not create a conducive environment for crafting a long awaited u s uk trade deal coveted by truss and her conservative party she s signaled that she s willing to go to the mattresses on this and that s going to cause a rift not just between the u k and eu but the uk and the u s said max bergmann director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and a former senior state department official in the obama administration it s one that s going to keep the white house up at night biden arrived in london late saturday and had been set to meet with truss on sunday but the prime minister s office said saturday they would skip the weekend hello opting instead for a meeting in new york at the u n general assembly on wednesday though truss still planned to gather with other world leaders converging on london for the royal funeral the white house confirmed the u n meeting just as the president boarded air force one the two close allies now find themselves in a period of political uncertainty on both sides of the atlantic not unlike his fellow septuagenarian biden king charles iii faces questions from the public about whether his age will limit his ability to faithfully carry out the duties of the monarch charles 73 and biden 79 discussed global cooperation on the climate crisis last year while both attended a summit in glasgow scotland they also met at buckingham palace in june 2021 at a reception the queen hosted before a world leaders summit in cornwall truss finds herself as biden does facing questions about whether she has what it takes to lift a country battered by stubborn inflation borne out of the coronavirus pandemic and exacerbated by russia s invasion of ukraine unleashing chaos on the global energy market all the while britain and the rest of europe is carefully watching to see what the upcoming u s midterm elections will bring for the democratic american president after he vowed upon taking office that america is back to being a full partner in the international community after four years of republican donald trump pushing his america first worldview it certainly is a time of change and transformation in the u k said barbara a perry presidential studies director at the university of virginia s miller center she added we don t know what will happen in our midterms we don t know what will happen in 2024 truss a former accountant who was first elected to parliament in 2010 hasn t had much interaction with biden the u s president called her earlier this month to congratulate her truss as foreign secretary accompanied her predecessor boris johnson on a white house visit last year it s been more than 75 years since winston churchill declared there was a special relationship between the two nations a notion that leaders on both sides have repeatedly affirmed still there have been bumps along the way tony blair was derisively branded by the

move forward with legislation that would rewrite parts of the northern ireland protocol the agreement was part of the u k s 2020 brexit withdrawal from the eu that was designed to avoid a hard north south border with ireland that might upset northern ireland s fragile peace now in the first weeks of truss s premiership biden administration officials are carefully taking the measure of the new british leader analysts say there is some trepidation in the administration that undercutting the northern ireland protocol could plunge europe into trade turmoil at a moment when biden is working mightily to keep the west unified in confronting russia over its aggression against ukraine brexit could once again become the issue the issue that can make it difficult for all of europe to work together at a time when it is critical for europe to work together bergmann said if you re the biden administration this is not the time for the two of your closest partners getting into fights to be certain there were areas of friction between biden and johnson who had a warm rapport with former president donald trump biden staunchly opposed brexit as a candidate and had expressed great concern over the future of northern ireland biden once even derided johnson as a physical and emotional clone of trump johnson worked hard to overcome that impression stressing his common ground with biden on climate change support for international institutions and most notably by making certain britain was an early and generous member of the u s led alliance providing economic and military assistance to ukraine in the aftermath of the russian invasion the former prime minister also unsuccessfully pressed biden starting days into his administration to begin negotiations on a new u s u k trade deal just as the u k regained control over its national trade policy weeks before biden took office and following the end of a post brexit transition period but biden largely kept focus on his domestic to do list in the early going of his presidency passing trillions in spending on coronavirus relief infrastructure and more and put negotiations on trade deals on the back burner elliot abrams chairman of the conservative foreign policy group vandenberg coalition said that truss needs biden to make a new u s u k trade deal a priority queen elizabeth s funeral won t be the setting for tough bilateral conversations but it still marks a moment for the two leaders to begin taking stock of each other truss who succeeded johnson after he was forced to resign in the face of a string of scandals has lagged in the opinion polls she also won her election with a smaller margin than her recent predecessors and is looking for an early win i think if i were truss i want recognition of the leading role britain s played far more than any other country outside the united states in supporting ukraine said abrams who served in senior national security and foreign policy roles in the trump george w bush

transfer of excess weapons from us stocks the report stresses the white house said it was the 21st time that the us s defense department has pulled weapons and other equipment off the shelves to deliver to ukraine president zelensky is now going straight to congress and the us arms makers themselves which is somewhat unprecedented the ukrainian offensive failed miserably everywhere the russians had choosen to defend the only success was the area where the ukrainians managed to put ten to one numerical advantage against the russian rear troops and rebels the idea was to encircle and take them prisoners which didn t work not a lot of the defeat and victory respectively what ukraine did was throw it s most capable and well armed troops that nato had been preparing for months into a small area of the front but russia has made great inroads into southern ukraine to libh8er 2 2 the guardian democracy now and most reported that a mere 1 000 square kilometers were retaken by ukraine far less than zel s claimed 6000 sq km the bbc reported that about 1 5 of ukraine has been conquered by russia so ukrainians retaking 1k to 6k square kilometers of 1 5 of ukraine turns out to be a paltry percentage less than 1 to around 5 of what russia has conquered and especially paltry given that russia has made recent advancements into areas of southern ukraine ukraine took back land the size of rhode island as russia took more land in the south and ukrainian leaders have said publicly they are worried if they can even keep it zelensky says ukraine has retaken 6 000 square km but army worried about defending it to all good we can stop sending the ukraine money since putin is 2 weeks from a coup and 3 weeks from dying of cancer and 4 weeks till all of russia collapses to libh8er 2 2 continued then there s russia making more inroads in the south russia advances in bakhmut defends in north donetsk eu leaders split on gas crisis russia encircling bakhmut putin sticks with smo rebuffs scholz macron russia encirclement of bakhmut parries ukrainian counterattacks putin modi xi meet in samarkand to mcgruff he looked pretty healthy in some pics from the last few days but the daily mail is pretty important with the bidettes lately to libh8er 2 2 continued blows my mind how anyone especially the pentagon could accept the ukrainian security agency s narrative on the war in ukraine does no one remember the corpse pulling its body bag back over itself the russians pulled troops out of a quiet zone to reinforce their coming offensives to push the ukrainians away from shelling range of donetsk when the ukrainians moved forward into the vacuum with minor resistance in the northern kharkov region the ukrainiansa claimed a great victory the bush bot and biden bot rallying cry aaron maté twitter 9 17 22 were you traumatized by us failures in afghanistan iraq luckily retired us diplomat daniel fried of the atlantic council has a path to healing the ukraine proxy war for traumatized warmongers like fried ukraine is a situation where an actual success is possible ambdanfried says that those traumatized by us failures in afghanistan and iraq can take solace in the ukraine proxy war do those traumatized people include the millions of afghans iraqis invaded by the us or the tens of thousands of us veterans who fought in these wars battle of the bulge neocons germany will drive back the allies for sure hitler will win this war by next week to libh8er funny title sounds like an old radio show by 15 posted onby saxxonwoods the only way to secure your own future is to create it yourself to libh8er headline should read is this the beginning of the end for the thoroughly corrupt country of ukraine by 16 posted onby lastdayz a blunt and brazen texan i will not be assimilated to libh8er the british seem to be infected with putin derangement syndrome by 17 posted onby mcgruff don t underestimate joe s ability to f things up barack obama to its all over except ukrainian wounded have been hosted in both poland and germany from the first week of the war this is nothing new the proper way to look at casualties is current strength not cumulative losses in the way your post is counting them comparable losses in us divisions in the eto would have averaged 100 from july to december 1944 6 months that is on the face of it all the us divisions that landed in june 1944 were wiped out by christmas but they weren t their unit cohesion was retained and they were kept up to strength with replacements and returning wounded these are the casualty rates of modern war etc etc anyway some new news ukrainian soldiers are expected in spain next week to train on the spanish leopard 2a4 s spain has 200 of these in reserve and it looks like the lot of them are going to ukraine to libh8er the scariest conversation between russian soldier and his mother a real evidence of atrocities only psychopaths would agree with or try to rationalize the behavior of the russian soldier and his mother by 19 posted onby familyop for they that sleep with dogs shall rise with fleas john webster the white devil 1612 to its all over except you know you can look at maps and keep in touch with the war news to figure out whats what you can fact check a lot on your own look at the ground that ukraine has taken those lines on the map mean something among other things highways and railroads tell you how the armies are sustained logistics is key the kharkiv territory taken by ukraine has cut both the principal logistics routes from russia to luhansk and donetsk the alternate route is from rostov to donetsk which will now have to serve nearly the whole eastern front the south front is sustained from crimea and thats already under stress disclaimer

london ap president joe biden arrived in london to pay his respects to queen elizabeth ii at a time of transition in u s u k relations as both a new monarch and a new prime minister are settling in london ap president joe biden arrived in london to pay his respects to queen elizabeth ii at a time of transition in u s u k relations as both a new monarch and a new prime minister are settling in the hawkish approach of prime minister liz truss to russia and china puts her on the same page as biden but the rise of truss 47 who once called the relationship special but not exclusive could mark a decidedly new chapter in the trans atlantic partnership on trade and more of high concern for biden officials in the early going of truss s premiership is her backing of legislation that would shred parts of the post brexit trading arrangements in northern ireland analysts say the move could cause deep strain between the u k and the european union and undermine peace in northern ireland white house press secretary karine jean pierre said the move would not create a conducive environment for crafting a long awaited u s uk trade deal coveted by truss and her conservative party she s signaled that she s willing to go to the mattresses on this and that s going to cause a rift not just between the u k and eu but the uk and the u s said max bergmann director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and a former senior state department official in the obama administration it s one that s going to keep the white house up at night biden arrived in london late saturday and had been set to meet with truss on sunday but the prime minister s office said saturday they would skip the weekend hello opting instead for a meeting in new york at the u n general assembly on wednesday though truss still planned to gather with other world leaders converging on london for the royal funeral the white house confirmed the u n meeting just as the president boarded air force one the two close allies now find themselves in a period of political uncertainty on both sides of the atlantic not unlike his fellow septuagenarian biden king charles iii faces questions from the public about whether his age will limit his ability to faithfully carry out the duties of the monarch charles 73 and biden 79 discussed global cooperation on the climate crisis last year while both attended a summit in glasgow scotland they also met at buckingham palace in june 2021 at a reception the queen hosted before a world leaders summit in cornwall truss finds herself as biden does facing questions about whether she has what it takes to lift a country battered by stubborn inflation borne out of the coronavirus pandemic and exacerbated by russia s invasion of ukraine unleashing chaos on the global energy market all the while britain and the rest of europe is carefully watching to see what the upcoming u s midterm elections will bring for the democratic american president after he vowed upon taking office that america is back to being a full partner in the international community after four years of republican donald trump pushing his america first worldview it certainly is a time of change and transformation in the u k said barbara a perry presidential studies director at the university of virginia s miller center she added we don t know what will happen in our midterms we don t know what will happen in 2024 truss a former accountant who was first elected to parliament in 2010 hasn t had much interaction with biden the u s president called her earlier this month to congratulate her truss as foreign secretary accompanied her predecessor boris johnson on a white house visit last year it s been more than 75 years since winston churchill declared there was a special relationship between the two nations a notion that leaders on both sides have repeatedly affirmed still there have been bumps along the way tony blair was derisively branded by the british tabloids as george w bush s poodle for backing the 2003 american led invasion of iraq david cameron and barack obama had a bromance but obama also had his frustrations with the brits over defense spending and the u k s handling of libya following the 2011 ouster of muammar gaddafi margaret thatcher and ronald reagan forged a close alliance in the midst of the cold war with the prime minister once telling students that the republican president s really good sense of humor helped their relationship but there were difficulties too such as when thatcher and members of her cabinet bristled at the reagan administration s initial neutrality in the falklands war the white house wasn t expecting truss s announcement in may when she was foreign secretary that the government would move forward with legislation that would rewrite parts of the northern ireland protocol the agreement was part of the u k s 2020 brexit withdrawal from the eu that was designed to avoid a hard north south border with ireland that might upset northern ireland s fragile peace now in the first weeks of truss s premiership biden administration officials are carefully taking the measure of the new british leader analysts say there is some trepidation in the administration that undercutting the northern ireland protocol could plunge europe into trade turmoil at a moment when biden is working mightily to keep the west unified in confronting russia over its aggression against ukraine brexit could once again become the issue the issue that can make it difficult for all of europe to work together at a time when it is critical for europe to work together bergmann said if you re the biden administration this is not the time for the two of your closest partners getting into fights to be certain there were areas of friction between biden and johnson who had a warm rapport with former president donald trump biden staunchly opposed brexit as a candidate and had expressed great concern over the future of northern ireland biden once even derided johnson as a physical and emotional clone of trump johnson worked hard to overcome that impression stressing his common ground with biden on climate change support for international institutions and most notably by making certain britain was an early and generous member of the u s led alliance providing economic and military assistance to ukraine in the aftermath of the russian invasion the former prime minister also unsuccessfully pressed biden starting days into his administration to begin negotiations on a new u s u k trade deal just as the u k regained control over its national trade policy weeks before biden took office and following the end of a post brexit transition period but biden largely kept focus on his domestic to do list in the early going of his presidency passing trillions in spending on coronavirus relief infrastructure and more and put negotiations on trade deals on the back burner elliot abrams chairman of the conservative foreign policy group vandenberg coalition said that truss needs biden to make a new u s u k trade deal a priority queen elizabeth s funeral won t be the setting for tough bilateral conversations but it still marks a moment for the two leaders to begin taking stock of each other truss who succeeded johnson after he was forced to resign in the face of a string of scandals has lagged in the opinion polls she also won her election with a smaller margin than her recent predecessors and is looking for an early win i think if i were truss i want recognition of the leading role britain s played far more than any other country outside the united states in supporting ukraine said abrams who served in senior national security and foreign policy roles in the trump george w bush and reagan administrations and i think i d want some positive economic message to give the british people which could be that the free trade agreement negotiations are starting ___ madhani reported

gurdev singh khush icome from a farming family while i was studying the opportunities were very limited and i always wanted to go abroad for higher studies and do research in this i was encouraged by my father who was my first mentor interestingly he was the only one from his village rurkee 7 km from phagwara to pass from a high school after graduation from punjab agricultural university pau ludhiana in 1955 i borrowed money from a relative and went to england there while i worked in a factory at night to return the borrowed sum i d apply for admission to various universities during the day i was fortunate to get admission with scholarship in three universities in the us in 1957 i joined the university of california davis which offered me admission to phd in genetics with half time assistanceship after completing my phd in 1960 i worked as a faculty member in the same university for seven years i was researching on tomato there when the chairman of my department recommended my name to the director of the international rice research institute irri in the philippines when he had come to our university looking to hire a young rice breeder i joined the irri in 1967 from where i retired in 2002 thereafter i rejoined the university of california as adjunct professor and worked for another 13 years i worked on rice breeding for 35 years and developed more than 300 high yielding rice varieties which later came to be known as miracle rice these were widely adopted and planted all over the world particularly in asia in india this gave impetus to the green revolution from being food insecure and on the verge of famine in the 1960s india has not only become self sufficient but has also become a food surplus country it is the second largest producer of foodgrains the largest milk producer and the second largest producer of vegetables in the world it has 70 million tonnes of buffer stocks of rice and wheat and is the largest exporter of rice in the world because of the ukraine russia conflict india has become a major exporter of wheat yet 200 million indians are food insecure and 40 million children below five years of age are stunted this dilemma of food surplus and food insecurity at the same time is due to poverty and lack of employment for the food insecure people i come to india almost every year and meet my brother who still lives in our village i also visit my alma mater pau in relation with philanthropic activities of my foundation which offers scholarships to the needy students pau is doing good work in farm research but research on cellular and molecular biology biotechnology is advancing rapidly and we need to invest in new areas of research and make attempts for breakthroughs in increasing food productivity countries like china are already investing heavily in basic research young scientists should aspire to become world class professionals it is vital to keep our country food secure through farm research our scientists should aim to do research worthy of a nobel prize the breakthroughs in technology should go hand in hand with a rise in gdp and higher income for farmers the bane of the agricultural sector in india is that the farm size is very little nearly 80 90 per cent farms in our country are less than 2 hectares besides the input costs have been increasing rapidly too many people are dependent on farming slowly and slowly we have to move more people away from farming and create alternative employment opportunities also the water table is going down due to too much area under rice cultivation we need to diversify and grow crops that require less water the area planted for rice should be reduced progressively to less than half of what it is at present at present the country spends more than 2 billion in importing edible oils alternative crops such as soyabean and other pulses and sunflower should be grown instead small farmers should grow high value crops and vegetables they could invest in animal farms this will help increase production in poultry and fisheries sectors indian scientists have paid less attention to resource management efforts should be made to develop newer technologies for water and soil management indian soils have on an average 0 5 per cent of organic matter whereas for high productivity there should be at least 1 5 to 2 per cent organic matter because of low organic matter fertiliser use efficiency is also low not much attention has been paid to practice conservation agriculture which should help improve soil fertility water use in agriculture is treated as a free and unlimited resource flood irrigation is now the norm all over the country and a very limited area is under water saving methods such as sprinkler and drip irrigation already climate change is affecting productivity last season because of high temperature the production of wheat was 10 per cent less than normal bigger dangers lie as the glaciers are melting very fast a recent consequence has been the floods in pakistan our farm production is also dependent on the water from glaciers that melt in summers the faster melting of our glaciers would lead to flooding of the ganga and sutlej basins there will be lesser supply of water left for irrigation during summer eventually affecting food production indian farmers should aim to produce healthy food free of chemicals and other contaminants less attention has been paid to improving the micronutrient content of cereals thus the poor in india suffer from a lack of adequate amounts of zinc iron and vitamin a in their diet on the other hand we have changing food habits which are a natural outcome of urbanisation and improved living standards an increasing number of indians can now afford high value foods such as meat milk fruits and vegetables they derive fewer calories from cereals such as wheat and rice thus greater amounts of wheat and rice are now available for export urbanisation leads to the consumption of processed foods this combined with over consumption are contributing to the increase in obesity it is estimated that 70 per cent of indians will live in urban areas by 2050 this will impact the incidence of obesity and healthcare costs will increase i have mixed feelings about subsidies some of the subsidies are necessary for example fertiliser subsidy was required during the food deficit decades of 1960s and 1970s the green revolution may not have happened if there had been no subsidy for fertiliser at the same time higher levels of fertiliser subsidies have led to overuse of fertiliser leading to water and environmental pollution the provision of free electricity for tubewells in punjab is a bad use of subsidy i have worked for almost 60 years now though i no longer hold any office i continue to work with young scientists who are doing research work the best thing i can do is share my experiences and work with younger people based in california the writer is an acclaimed agronomist and geneticist as told to seema sachdeva
a newly available transcatheter device for edge to edge mitral valve mv repair named for a famed scientist inventor is similar to the long available mitraclip abbott for short term efficacy and safety suggests an interim but prespecified analysis from a randomized trial in its comparison with mitraclip the pascal transcatheter valve repair system edwards lifesciences was noninferior with respect to 30 day major adverse events and to success at achieving mitral regurgitation mr of no more than moderate severity within 6 months the trial had entered patients with significant symptomatic degenerative mr considered too high risk for surgical repair or replacement the interim analysis covers 180 of the 300 patients followed in the study of whom 117 received the pascal device and 63 were given mitraclip both groups showed significant gains in functional class symptom status and quality of life over 6 months reported d scott lim md university of virginia health system hospital charlottesville and konstantinos koulogiannis md morristown medical center new jersey jointly on september 17 at transcatheter cardiovascular therapeutics tct 2022 in boston massachusetts lim one of the trial s principal investigators is also lead author on its same day publication in jacc cardiovascular interventions based largely on those results from the clasp iid pivotal trial the u s food and drug administration fda recently approved the pascal system for use in patients with degenerative mr edwards announced on september 15 the device was approved in the european union on august 17 mitraclip has been available in various iterations in the united states since 2013 and in europe since 2008 it s good for the field to be able to say we have two devices that are comparable giving clinicians more options vinod h thourani md piedmont heart institute atlanta georgia told theheart org medscape cardiology the current analysis shows that we ve yet to figure out what patient pathologies will be beneficial for each of the devices thourani said the goal will be to find out if there are certain anatomical considerations where one device is better than the other it will be necessary to study more patients a larger cohort with longer follow up to allow us to see their true benefits he said as well as to conduct more subgroup analyses for now the choice of device will probably be operator specific which they feel comfortable with thourani not an author on the current study is the u s principal investigator for the clasp iif study looking at clinical outcomes with the two devices and says he consults for both edwards and abbott the findings are preliminary for now said michael young md dartmouth hitchcock medical center lebanon new hampshire in part because like most randomized trials clasp iid entered a select not broadly representative population they want to make as best as they could an apples to apples comparison without confounding that might make it more difficult to interpret it afterwards young not associated with the trial told theheart org medscape cardiology but clasp iid did enroll patients that we do see and treat so undoubtedly it s a compelling study we now have another device that is shown to be safe and effective how we re going to extrapolate it to all the patients that are being referred to our practices will i think be under debate and deliberation the pascal and mitraclip devices each may be more suitable for different patients with varying mitral valve pathologies due to differences in their designs lim said the pascal s relative flexibility might make it preferable in patients with smaller mitral valves and its ability to elongate during delivery could make it more suitable for patients with chordal dense areas around the valve he speculated mitraclip lim told theheart org medscape cardiology has a mechanical closure system for anchoring that may make it more appropriate for more complicated thicker leaflets with calcium clasp iid enrolled patients with grade 3 or 4 degenerative mr considered to be at prohibitive surgical risk at 43 sites in north america and europe it randomly assigned them 2 to 1 to receive the pascal device or mitraclip either of two pascal versions were used the original device or the smaller narrower pascal ace lim observed both versions are covered by the pascal precision system fda approval about 40 of patients assigned to mitraclip received older versions of the device and about 60 more recent versions as they were entered into practice the mean procedure times were 88 minutes for pascal and 79 minutes for mitraclip p 023 with much of the difference attributable to the earliest pascal procedures procedure times for the device declined with greater operator experience the published report states rates of the primary safety endpoint of major adverse events at 30 days were 3 4 for pascal and 4 8 for mitraclip the endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular mortality stroke myocardial infarction new need for renal replacement therapy severe bleeding or nonelective mv reintervention the proportion of patients with mr grade 2 or lower at 6 months the primary effectiveness endpoint assessed at a core laboratory was 96 5 for the pascal group over a median follow up of 179 5 days and 96 8 over a median of 184 5 days for those who received mitraclip comparisons for both primary endpoints met the prespecified criteria for pascal noninferiority in a secondary analysis the proportion of pascal patients with mr grade 1 or less held about steady from postprocedure discharge out to 6 months at 87 2 and 83 7 respectively p 317 but whereas 88 5 of mitraclip patients had mr grade 1 or better at discharge 71 2 were at that grade by 6 months p 003 that apparent hemodynamic deterioration raised some eyebrows at the tct sessions as a potential sign that pascal functional results are more durable that sort of judgment is premature offered anita w asgar md msc montreal heart institute quebec canada as an invited discussant after the clasp iid trial s formal presentation the trial is notable in part for showing how safe this procedure is and how successful it is for these patients this is phenomenal she said but i would caution comparing one device being better than another with such a small number of patients mitraclip young observed has been up to this point our only option for edge to edge repair of the mitral valve and many of us have years of experience and a lot of patients that we treat with that device his center hasn t yet used pascal but that may change as the field gains more familiarity with the device operators may use either device in different cases he said depending on the program and depending on the volume of mitral patients that you see and edge to edge repair that you do it could be that you stick with one or switch to another or you integrate both of them and try to decide which patients might be better

snarled supply chains have been a hallmark of the pandemic era s global disruption from china s port shutdowns to a giant container ship stuck on the banks of the suez canal a so called perfect storm of factors including a surge in demand for chinese covid supplies bottlenecks in ports and a shortage of staff to offload freight led to almost two years of disruption that included a doubling of journey times a tenfold rise in shipping rates and a surge in consumer goods inflation now however several indicators are starting to suggest the pressures are alleviating as the price of shipping falls consumer spending slows and queues at ports start to ease in august the global supply chain pressure index run by the new york federal reserve fell for the third straight month in a row taking it to the lowest level since january 2021 the bank s index which incorporates data on shipping costs delivery times backlogs and other statistics into a single measure is down 57 since its peak almost 18 months ago though it still remains significantly above levels seen just before the start of the pandemic a major factor behind the easing pressure is the improvement in the global shipping network the start of covid saw huge queues build up outside ports in china and the us west coast and led to mass disruption and delays outside los angeles s two ports 75 container ships were queued up in september 2021 today that has fallen to 12 as the ports work their way through the backlog according to supply chain portal flexport much of the congestion has been cleared by diverting some ships to the port of new york new jersey and has contributed to the east coast now handling more cargo in a surprising reversal of the long term pattern shipping times are consequently tumbling with delays on the trans pacific route from china to the us west coast now down from 12 days to less than two helping to free up capacity on other trade lanes around the world shipping routes from china to europe are also down from 12 days to four but the higher number of intermediary ports that ships dock at along the way are contributing to a continued partial slowdown the quicker times means the lower costs with the price of moving a standard sized 40 ft shipping container from china to north europe down from 15k in january to around 10k today a welcome reduction but still six times higher than at the start of the pandemic data from freightos a global freight booking platform shows nonetheless the improvements are giving some observers hope that the easing situation will help slow the rate of inflation in the months ahead before the pandemic shipping costs accounted for around 5 of the product price for some suppliers in recent times that has grown in some cases to over 20 last month the closely watched purchasing managers index reported falling orders and a drop in backlogs suggesting the price pressures are starting to noticeably ease for many manufacturers higher shipping rates and higher fuel costs just add to the cost of producing everything says robert sierra director of economics at fitch ratings but you re now beginning to see an unwinding of all the supply congestions and so the goods component of cpi is beginning to come back down the calming of these inflationary pressures will be widely counted as a good thing yet there remains a flip side for many businesses in that the reduced pressure is potentially coming thanks to less demand and falling purchasing power among consumers according to jennifer mckeown head of the global economics service at capital economics it is in part this weaker demand that is opening up some spare capacity and allowing supply conditions to improve that falling demand is not only a threat to sales particularly of discretionary items but is contributing to pile ups in warehouses around the world as businesses struggle to sell products at the same rate they are used to last month the purchasing managers index tracking the levels of finished goods stocks hit its highest level on record inventory levels are becoming more of a conundrum for retailers says siobhán géhin senior partner at global strategists roland berger who explains that while businesses initially rushed to build up inventory in light of surging demand and global supply chain challenges the economic downturn has now left many unable to shift it the result is that instead of supply chain bottlenecks on the sea they are now often taking place on land the pile up of goods is even leading some companies to use sea containers to hold their excess stock thereby placing an added strain on the global supply of containers there are also issues handling containers at the ports with containers at many sites piling up due to a lack of transport to take them away there s just not the ability to handle the incoming volumes says josh brazil vp of supply chain insights at project44 a supply chain insights platform you have to find a way to get those containers out to a holding space quickly and the problem is that all the trains are understaffed you either have strikes in europe or in the us there s just not enough trained drivers the infrastructure is antiquated as well strike action the situation has been exacerbated by a series of strikes across numerous ports in june south korean truck drivers stopped their trucks and sat down in the street over soaring fuel prices causing volumes through the port of busan which typically handles 80 of the country s container traffic to fall by around 75 germany s north sea ports also saw strikes in july when dock workers walked out for 48 hours paralysing cargo handling at major ports including hamburg bremerhaven and wilhelmshaven european ports are some of the most troubled in the world with congestion at hamburg and rotterdam now at critical levels according to a recent note from flexport while the duration was brief the impact was still felt says brazil even those two day strikes quickly held up containers in the port for two weeks every supply chain disruption is so sensitive it takes months to get back to normal whether it s the suez canal or the congestion we saw at los angeles it takes a long time because these ripple effects go out that is a worry for british importers last month s strike at felixstowe ended on 31 august without resolution meaning further strikes could be on the cards in the lead up to christmas felixstowe acts as the primary uk destination for long distance shipments to and from asia and handles 48 of our container trade while the strike action has paused for now danish shipping company maersk predicted the ramifications would be felt for at least two weeks as vessels are delayed and some cargo diverted to ports including antwerp and le havre with workers at liverpool port now also set to stop work for two weeks from 19 september the threats to uk supply chains look set to continue china lockdowns across the globe in china lies the other great threat to global supply chains beijing s zero covid policy of quashing every flare up is pushing the country into a state of rolling lockdowns and despite warnings of its impact on global trade in a speech in may president xi jinping insisted the country would unswervingly adhere to the policy for as long as it takes china is home to seven of the world s 10 biggest container ports including ningbo shenzhen and guangzhou and the rolling lockdowns are raising alarm among businesses worldwide who rely on materials goods and the free flow of ships in and out of the country in early may joerg wuttke president of the eu chamber of commerce in china warned the erratic enforcement of the rules was making it difficult for firms to adjust there will be shortages on shelves in europe at some stage he said we never had this kind of uncertainty before shanghai china s main commercial hub was locked down from april to may this year and led to a 20 reduction in container traffic while that has now eased the end of august saw further restrictions in several of china s biggest cities including chengdu and shenzhen although chinese officials opted not to impose the restrictions on the ports themselves given the country s key role in global supply chain the local restrictions meant trucks could often not travel to pick up loads and meant containers full of frozen food and chemicals were regularly left to pile up military tensions for now the situation is undesirable but manageable that could quickly change however if china s ongoing tension with taiwan escalates much further in the past month china has intensified its military presence in the taiwan strait flying jets and sailing ships ever closer to the island it claims as its own testing taiwan s defence and raising the risk of conflict the risk is that a conflict could cause the shipping lanes around taiwan to effectively close around half of the world s container fleet passes through the taiwan strait each year according to bloomberg meaning the potential for disruption is huge military exercises at sea are not uncommon but it is unusual for live fire to be used in such heavily trafficked areas some ships are already understood to be trying to avoid the area as a result prolonged or regular drills in the taiwan strait could create significant disruptions in taiwan s trade with the rest of the world and in global supply chains said homin lee asia macro strategist at lombard odier in a note last month if further disruptions do creep back into global supply chains then the uk may be especially vulnerable to a rise in blank sailings a ploy used by shipping lines when schedules are messy to cancel certain routes or stops to make up for lost time in recent months these have fallen from 50 in may to 30 now according to brazil at project44 but if disruption mounts then so will blank sailings and british ports could be the ones to suffer we re at the end of the line simon heaney of drewry a shipping consultant told politico last month highlighting that shippers often decide to drop cargo off at european ports such as hamburg or rotterdam if ports are too congested we re more vulnerable to the vagaries of shipping lines network planning for them the incentive is to get back to china you don t make money on the backhaul leg and you certainly don t make money hanging around outside of the uk waiting for a berth with retailers now initiating their christmas planning for the year it would be poor timing for the easing of the past few months to be reversed the falling price of shipping has been a rare light in a sea of rising costs yet it now seems reasonable to believe this could be a temporary respite rather than a permanent shift back to normality it has taken around two years for the disruption of covid to resolve itself and this could well happen again were another major threat to make its force felt the complexity of global shipping networks leaves their schedules finely balanced with small changes having big impacts down the line as long as those schedules are on time things work says brazil at project44 but as soon as they re disrupted it disrupts a lot downstream from trucks to trains to everything else

expectations of more fed tightening is the most important thing for financial markets markets reacted dramatically to the stronger than expected cpi report tuesday morning the djia futures dropped 800 points in five minutes and was down 1 650 points later in the day friday s low was 2 150 points below tuesday s high it was the biggest weekly loss since the covid panic in march 2020 interest rates across the curve surged higher with june 2023 eurodollars falling 50bps by thursday taking out the mid june low as the market grudgingly concedes that the fed will be more hawkish for longer the 10 year t note futures traded to a 13 year low this week yield curves became more inverted after the cpi report the us dollar rallied sharply gold tumbled to a 30 month low a strong usd and soaring real interest rates mean investors have less interest in buying gold despite high inflation tips and gold etf charts courtesy of martin murenbeeld capitalight research for the past three months investors have wanted to believe that peak fed tightening was behind us the djia tumbled 3 000 points in the week before the mid june fomc meeting as investors braced for the fed to raise rates by 75bps and warn of much more to come over the next two months investors began to believe that they had seen the worst from the fed and the djia rallied 4 600 points but as interest rates marched higher through august and the usd climbed to a 20 year high the stock indices turned lower clearly a risk off environment bullish positioning accelerated the break on the cpi report stock indices rallied after labor day recovering 50 of the decline from the mid august highs but buyers of this rally just added to selling pressure on the post cpi break fed expectations futures markets are pricing the fomc to increase s t interest rates by 75 100bps this coming wednesday with another 50bps bump in november and december the fact that the fed will be shrinking its balance sheet qt by 95 billion a month is relatively unnoticed but adding to the tightening of financial conditions currencies the british pound hit a 37 year low vs the usd the yen hit a 24 year low and is down 22 ytd the euro hit a 20 year low and both the cad and the rmb hit 2 year lows here s an interesting chart from barclay showing that weakness in the euro this year has been primarily due to weak chinese growth they are buying fewer european exports and high natgas prices if chinese growth picks up or natgas prices ease then the euro might rally market sentiment is very bullish the us dollar the cad dropped 2 cents from tuesday s high to friday s low the day to day correlation of the cad to the s p is 80 according to scotia bank rising wages will keep inflation from falling to the fed s 2 target american railroad workers were set to strike this week but a last minute deal involving substantial increases in wages and benefits averted the strike a couple of weeks ago i wrote that i expected people to push for higher salaries as they try to catch up to the rising cost of goods and services and that this would sustain inflationary pressures i expect more strikes because many people feel left behind by income inequality and soaring prices for food fuel and shelter massive state intervention momentum growing the heisenberg report recently noted the rising trend of massive state intervention think of the fiscal stimulus during covid the proposed direct cash payments to european citizens to help cover rising energy costs etc is there no irony that fiscal policies are increasingly inflationary while monetary authorities are trying to get inflation down do pension funds have a problem the sustained rise in inflation will result in higher cost of living adjustments cola for pensioners for instance social security and supplemental security income ssi benefits for approximately 70 million americans will increase 5 9 percent in 2022 and will likely rise again in 2023 as inflation rises most pension funds will have to pay more money to pensioners because of cola the problem is that most pension funds have some form of 60 40 stock bond investment portfolios and with both stocks and bonds down sharply this year their portfolio values are falling while their payout liabilities are rising is it time to buy bonds the yield on american government debt with maturities from 6 months to 30 years is approximately double the 1 7 s p dividend yield remember tina there is no alternative to investing in the stock market well the bond market may now be an alternative the 10 year treasury futures have traded lower for the last seven weeks and hit a 13 year low this week cftc data shows that speculators are heavily short the bond futures if the stock market remains under pressure and a recession looms government bonds with 3 5 yields might look good to some folks the prospect of inflation staying high and the fed staying hawkish don t forget the qt program running at 95billion a month might discourage some people from buying bonds still my long time friend and excellent technical analyst ross clark recently published a report noting a weekly downside capitulation a momentum gauge and daily and monthly sequential nine buy setups a pattern recognition in the tlt maybe the bond market is already pricing in a lot of negativity a looming recession fedex issued a warning thursday afternoon they see a drop in shipping volumes and forecast lower earnings fedex shares dropped 25 on friday on huge volume and are down 50 from ath made in june 2021 is fedex a canary for other businesses my short term trading i started this week with long positions in the s p cad mex and gold all the positions especially the s p were up from where i bought them last week the four positions were all one trade they were all risk on trades i knew the cpi report was scheduled for early tuesday morning and it would likely inspire volatile price action either for me or against me i considered taking profits on some if not all of my positions but i ve been trying to lengthen the time horizon of my trading to get away from day trading so i considered staying with the trades in the end i took profits on all my positions on monday the deciding factor was my mantra that i make money from managing risk not from having a great crystal ball and the looming cpi report was a huge risk that i chose to avoid the markets plunged on the report the velocity of the drop in the first few minutes after the report was incredible i was grateful to have sold everything on monday i couldn t bring myself to get short the drop was so violent that it seemed a bounce back was inevitable and i didn t want to risk that so i did nothing tuesday on wednesday and thursday i bought the s p looking for a bounce and was briefly ahead on both trades but ended up with two small losses i bought the 10 year note on thursday was stopped for a slight loss rebought it friday and kept it for the weekend buying the s p and the tnotes this week was probing i was trying to establish a position that could have a decent move but i was buying very close to where i would stop myself out if i were wrong with this kind of trading i will have a low win loss ratio but one winning trade will easily make up for several losing trades using different time frames if i see a buy setup in one time frame i will always look at the same market in other time frames to see if my trade idea still looks good for instance this week when i liked the look of the hourly s p and bond charts the daily charts told me to keep my stops tight i was fighting the longer term trend on my radar market sentiment is very bearish for a good reason there are lots of things to worry about with an aggressive fed and the consequences that may come from that topping the list but the question always is how much is already in the price and what s your time frame markets feel stressed which may produce a flight to quality which is why i m probing the long side of the bond market the most recent boa fund manager survey shows that fund managers are the most cautious they have been in more than twenty years maybe a lot of negativity is already in the price i think it s a good time to be cautious i expect stress will cause something to break sharply higher interest rates will have consequences quote of the week another steal from my friend kevin muir the macrotourist but when i saw it i knew i had to steal it i ve read every jack schwager market wizard book several times and i agree 100 with this quote i also recommend jim dines excellent book mass psychology the barney report i haven t taken barney swimming in the ocean this week but he s had a few huge off leash runs on the forest trails he loves to run

wave he nibbled at his food and walked away i worried that he had grown tired of the same old thing i tried giving him different foods but he just wasn t hungry it seemed the heat wave killed his

please make sure these dispatches reach as many readers as possible share with kin friends and workmates and ask them to do likewise a yale school of management and yale chief executive leadership institute study titled business retreats and sanctions are crippling the russian economy was issued in august and it argues on a fraudulent basis that because so they allege russia needs world markets as an outlet for its commodity exports far more than the world needs russian commodity supplies russia will be crushed by western sanctions that penalize countries that import those commodities from russia what is fraudulent about the report is first of all that the west s war against russia isn t a war by all nations against russia but is only a war by countries that are allied with the u s against russia if it were a war by all nations against russia then the allegation that russia needs world markets as an outlet for its commodity exports far more than the world needs russian commodity supplies would be relevant to the outcome of this war but it s not a second fraudulent argument in this yale study is that russia is checkmated by the u s allied countries closing down the gas and oil pipelines that have been supplying those commodities to russia s biggest market for those commodities which is the u s allied european countries and that the reason why russia is checkmated on this matter is that russia won t be able fast enough to build the infrastructure to liquefy and containerize and then ship and then re gasify that gas to those european countries and thereby to replace what had been its pipelined gas by instead liquefied natural gas lng going to those european countries and so those european markets for russia s fuels will effectively become entirely closed and russia won t soon be able to sell those fuels elsewhere since these eu nations had been russia s main customers for those fuels what s fraudulent about this argument is that lng is vastly costlier than pipelined gas is and this reality has been the reason why europe was buying its gas from russia it s the only country that was selling pipelined gas to europe it was thus by far the lowest cost gas on european markets this war against russia is a u s and allied war against russia and it is mainly a u s war against russia which is being waged by not only america which profits from it but by america s european colonies or vassal states america s allies as they call these nations which will be losing disastrously from it so that 118 page study is designed to sucker fools perhaps especially ones in europe by burying its implicit basic and false assumption that it is about world markets being customers of russia s commodity exports instead of about the u s allied european countries being customers of russia s gas and oil and those countries are the ones that will now be paying vastly higher prices for those commodities than previously because they will now be buying lng instead of far cheaper pipelined gas and they will now be buying shipped oils instead of likewise cheaper pipelined oils an august 23 youtube by joe blogs headlines russia heading for economic oblivion according to yale management review on impact of sanctions and pretends to analyze this yale study but fails to notice either of its big frauds and so it comes up at the end just regurgitating the study s conclusions which in the study s own words are russia needs world markets as an outlet for its commodity exports far more than the world needs russian commodity supplies this is true not only across the entire commodity complex writ large but on each specific commodity russia exports as well this is not to say that the transition away from russian commodities has been painless for the west far from it as recent headlines bear out the necessity of europe cutting back on power usage while diversifying energy supply sources has created challenging political and economic ramifications but the evidence clearly shows that the impact has been asymmetric for every incremental pain inflicted on the west by pivoting away from russian commodities the damage wrought to russia is far in excess russia s strategic positioning as a commodities exporter has irrevocably deteriorated as it now deals from a position of weakness with the loss of its erstwhile main markets and faces steep challenges executing a pivot to asia with non fungible exports such as piped gas as we explain further in section ii of this paper despite some lingering leakiness russian imports have largely collapsed and the country faces stark challenges securing crucial inputs parts and technology from hesitant trade partners leading to widespread supply shortages within its domestic economy as we explain further in section iii of this paper despite putin s delusions of self sufficiency and import substitution russian domestic production has come to a complete standstill with no capacity to replace lost businesses products and talent the hollowing out of russia s domestic innovation and production base has led to soaring prices and consumer angst as we explain further in section iv of this paper as a result of the business retreat russia has lost companies representing 40 of its gdp reversing nearly all of three decades worth of foreign investment and buttressing unprecedented simultaneous capital and population flight in a mass exodus of russia s economic base as we explain further in section v of this paper putin is resorting to patently unsustainable dramatic fiscal and monetary intervention to smooth over these structural economic weaknesses which has already sent his government budget into deficit for the first time in years and drained his foreign reserves even with high energy prices and kremlin finances are in much much more dire straits than conventionally understood as we explain further in section vi of this paper russian domestic financial markets as an indicator of both present conditions and future outlook are the worst performing markets in the entire world this year despite strict capital controls and have priced in sustained persistent weakness within the economy with liquidity and credit contracting in addition to russia being substantively cut off from international financial markets limiting its ability to tap into pools of capital needed for the revitalization of its crippled economy as we explain further in section vii of this paper looking ahead there is no path out of economic oblivion for russia as long as the allied countries remain unified in maintaining and increasing sanctions pressure against russia and the kyiv school of economics and mcfaul yermak working group have led the way in proposing additional sanctions measures across individual sanctions energy sanctions and financial sanctions led by ambassador michael mcfaul tymofiy mylovanov nataliia shapoval and andriy boytsun defeatist headlines arguing that russia s economy has bounced back are simply not factual the facts are that by any metric and on any level the russian economy is reeling and now is not the time to step on the brakes that joe blogs video has acquired since its publication on august 23rd up till september 17th 610 057 views so this is an excellent example of how the u s regime and its hired agents propagandize the dumb majority to believe what not only isn t so but what is based on obviously false and misleading even illogical arguments incidentally the authors of that yale study closed it by saying one exception not shown on the chart is wheat russian exports represent 20 of the global wheat market but russian wheat is primarily exported to em countries such as turkey and egypt rather than to europe this footnoted acknowledgement proves that they know that basing their argument upon world markets instead of upon russia s former european markets or some equivalent phrase such as eu markets that is the european countries whose economies will be crashing this winter because they do what the u s uk regime tells them to do is fraudulent intended to deceive instead of being merely incompetent they are saying here that russia s wheat doesn t really matter because it is going to poorer countries not to the eu so they know the difference the reason why their argument is based upon their ignoring that difference is simply in order to fool the suckers such as joe s blogs and its hundreds of thousands of viewers after all these are democratic countries and many of those people vote an important question that the yale study also ignored is how quickly can russia and its asian trading partners who will henceforth be buying russia s pipelined fuels that the u s uk eu regimes are now closing off to eu countries build the pipelines to reroute those fuels there to asia one sign of the answer to this is the following wikipedia article about one such pipeline which is now in the process of being expanded the total length of the pipeline when fully completed will be 3 968 km 2 466 mi the full capacity of the 1 420 mm 56 in pipeline would be up to 61 billion m3 2 2 trillion cu ft per annum of natural gas of which 38 billion m3 1 3 trillion cu ft per annum are supplied to china the export to china starts with 5 billion m3 180 billion cu ft per annum in 2020 and is expected to increase gradually to 38 billion m3 1 3 trillion cu ft per annum by 2025 in other words probably well before the eu s coming economic crashes have ended russia will already have rerouted all or almost all of the gas and oil that it had been selling cheaply to europe to asia instead the u s uk regime is treating both ukrainians and the citizens of eu nations as being fools to be exploited instead of as individuals who have sovereign rights not to be lied to and exploited by that hegemoniacal regime investigative historian eric zuesse s new book america s empire of evil hitler s posthumous victory and why the social sciences need

opinion editor s note star tribune opinion publishes letters from readers online and in print each day to contribute click here thank you for the excellent reporting on the studies on neonicotinoids in the deer population of minnesota majority of deer exposed to toxin sept 11 what i found most revealing was that the deer taken in the thick woods of northern minnesota were just as likely to have neonicotinoids in their systems as those taken among the vast corn and soybean fields of southern minnesota and scientists don t know why this is alarming and it makes me think these wild animals aren t directly eating the crops on which this insecticide is used yet even deer from the boundary waters have neonics in their system what does that say about the amount of neonicotinoids in the farmed animals that directly eat the crops that are sprayed with neonics what damage are they doing to those animals health have studies been done on that and when will someone study the amount of neonics found in humans who eat those crops and the animals that fed on those crops in this case i m afraid the deer is the canary in the coal mine mark robinson st paul i appreciate all the attention being given to greenhouse gas emissions and the havoc they are creating but there is another story that is totally underreported the killing of our pollinators by neonicotinoids this summer when i see the occasional butterfly it makes me sad rather than joyful because i think of all the others i used to see and there are very few birds on my backyard bird feeder all the bugs they needed to feed their young have been wiped out so the chicks perished when our pollinators are gone will we be happy eating only corn and soybeans farmers in europe have learned to grow crops without neonicotinoids ours can too perry benson minneapolis cannabis laws reckless and unjust the star tribune editorial board makes the case for two bills pending in congress that would facilitate a rapid expansion of cannabis both recreationally and medically federal catch up is critical on cannabis sept 11 without sounding the facts for going slow on cannabis proliferation the piece is flawed states that have legalized recreational cannabis such as colorado and california are rethinking that decision the harms to adolescents from diverted cannabis the proliferation of illegal sources and the shortfall of taxes earned to remediate the harms are now being chronicled medical and mental health experts saw this coming but the popularity of an addictive substance that had great economic potential seems too good for policymakers to be thoughtful about minnesota s recreational cannabis legislation is potentially the worst for its recklessness in the country every other state had some guardrails like data collection on possible harms and public health analytics regulated retail locations etc the first order of business for policymakers must be decriminalization and expungement are the values of this newspaper to choose capitalization banking privileges for the cannabis industry over social justice why who are you george realmuto apple valley climate change ira can help if we don t blow it according to multiple modeling groups the inflation reduction act signed into law by president joe biden last month has the potential to lower u s carbon emissions by 40 by 2030 i say potential because the law faces a big obstacle bad policy implementation at the state and local levels about 30 billion of the total 369 billion covered by the law is specifically allocated to helping states clean up their electricity sectors another 1 billion will be available as grants to states and local governments to update their building energy codes and 4 3 billion will be given to state energy offices to develop rebate programs for homeowners making energy improvements this is a lot of money that can be used to make real progress against climate change but it won t be worth anything if our elected officials don t use it wisely or worse fail to use it at all we ve seen this happen once already when our state legislature failed to pass a transportation bill this summer thus losing out on an annual infusion of 100 million in federal money the ira is our first and perhaps last real chance to put a massive dent in our carbon emissions i ve been contacting my city and state representatives regularly to make sure they know this and i urge my fellow minnesotans to have it on your minds when you cast your votes this fall kelsey murphy minneapolis electric vehicles i could use a few more chargers as the owner of an electric vehicle since 2020 i was intrigued by the commentary denouncing xcel energy s proposed investment in charging stations don t hand xcel the minneapolis ev charging marketplace opinion exchange sept 14 while i have been frustrated by nonworking level 3 chargers it has only happened once in three years much more common in my experience is pulling up at a charger and finding it already in use by another ev furthermore i don t understand why a utility s major investment in the charging infrastructure is anything for private businesses to worry about there are over 2 000 gas stations in minnesota and from my experience i would say nearly all of which have more than one pump conservatively i would estimate there are 6 000 to 10 000 gas pumps in our state there are only 200 public ev chargers many of which in my experience have one or two plugs were it not for the local utility s ev charger in hutchinson i would not be able to make

deepen this crisis although it appears a tentative deal between workers and the nation s largest freight rail companies has been reached the labor dispute underscores the structural challenge in the railroad industry corporate concentration the nation s largest class 1 railroads have shed a third of their workforce over the past six years raised rates on shippers and struggled with delays and poor service yet posted record profits last year this is what happens when competition is eliminated higher prices fewer jobs and fatter profits in 1980 there were 33 class 1 railroads but mergers and an exemption from antitrust law have left just seven companies handling 90 of the nation s freight traffic now two of those railroads canadian pacific and kansas city southern want to merge the 30 billion deal would further reduce choices and raise costs for small businesses and farmers meaning increased prices for consumers the merger also means more trains carrying oil from canada will be rumbling through minnesota on neglected infrastructure over the past two decades class 1 railroads have spent more on stock buybacks than investing in improvements the lack of competition leaves rail barons with few incentives beyond enriching shareholders the final decision on the merger will be made by the surface transportation board stb and members of congress are speaking out minnesota sens amy klobuchar who has previously championed repealing the railroads antitrust exemption and tina smith should join them and call for the stb to reject further monopolization of our railroads justin

scott simon host now dates not the going out kind but you know the edible fruit kind now in season there are few places in the world where dates are more cherished and come in more varieties than in saudi arabia one of the world s top producers npr s fatma tanis went to a date market and festival in the heart of saudi arabia s date country unidentified crowd speaking arabic fatma tanis byline it s 5 a m in the morning and it s already crowded at the date festival in buraydah a city in northwest saudi arabia that s famous for the fruit hundreds of white pickup trucks packed to the brim with boxes of dates are lined up row after row men are standing on the roofs of trucks shouting out numbers as they try to sell dates by the tens of kilos khaled alsalameh speaking arabic tanis i meet khaled alsalameh who s been in the business for 20 years he tells me he s selling 10 different kinds of dates this year to saudi customers and foreigners saudi dates are known for their quality and variety attracting producers from around the world who come here to study the palm trees and learn how to grow sweet meaty dates alsalameh through interpreter the question i get asked most by americans and europeans is how i got my dates to be round and big so i tell them the secret you have to trim the palms to allow room for the fruit to breathe the more space a date has the more it can grow tanis they re also interested in the different kinds says salameh alsalameh through interpreter these dates might all look the same shape even color but they taste completely different tanis date connoisseurs can tell the difference there is sukkari the most popular one sweet like its name in arabic it s golden brown with caramel notes and a melt in the mouth texture then ajwa small and dark in color it s chewy with notes of cinnamon and cloves another is khalas chestnut brown with nutty tones and the list goes on nearly all of the people organizing the event or selling dates are men this is a deeply conservative part of saudi arabia that hasn t seen women taking to the workforce like in the big cities but there are a few women like mishayer alrumaih who came with a friend to stock up mishayer alrumaih through interpreter we re looking for the big round sukkari dates you have to come early to get those tanis she wants to buy tens of kilos to put in the freezer at her house to keep fresh and eat throughout the year she s also looking for the semi ripe rutab dates available just a few weeks each season it s when half of the fruit is golden yellow juicy and crunchy and the other half is caramel brown and dissolves on the tongue alrumaih through interpreter everyone should get to try it once in their life it s amazing indescribable you have to taste it tanis dates are a cornerstone of saudi hospitality alrumaih says considered one of the best gifts one can give every gathering party or dinner in saudi arabia must begin with a service of dates and arabic coffee they re a staple for breaking the fast during ramadan too there are also dates that are covered in chocolate stuffed with dried fruits or nuts date ice cream milkshakes pastries you can find them in savory dishes even skin care products made from date seed oil alsalameh speaking arabic tanis but most saudis like alsalameh and alrumaih agree the best way to eat a date is by itself that makes sense at a nearby farm where lines of thousands of date palms are cared for six years before they start producing fruit the owner abdullah alqateeb points at his more than 10 000 trees with pride abdullah alqateeb speaking arabic tanis there s no point in having snickers or other chocolates when you can have dates he jokes he says they re packed with vitamins too alqateeb speaking arabic tanis he reaches up to a tree to pluck one and marvels dates are a blessing he says we re lucky to have them fatma tanis npr news buraydah saudi arabia transcript provided by npr copyright npr
if you are looking to pass your savings on to your children this trio of high yield stocks could help with that goal if you are looking to create generational wealth or a nest egg that you can pass on to your kin you need to focus on companies that have survived the tests of time you should also pay close attention to dividends since they can provide a boost to returns and give you something to hold on to when markets inevitably get turbulent realty income o 0 71 bank of nova scotia bns 1 47 and procter gamble pg 0 08 are all names that should be on your short list for creating a lasting fortune 1 a leg up on its peers realty income is a real estate investment trust reit that owns single tenant properties its tenants are responsible for most of the operating costs of the assets they occupy this is known as a net lease in the industry any single property with just one tenant is high risk but over realty income s more than 11 000 locations it is actually a pretty low risk approach to owning real estate notably the inflation that is spiking costs today is mostly affecting the reit s tenants which have to pay property operating costs realty income has a number of impressive statistics behind it for example it is a dividend aristocrat with over 25 consecutive years of annual dividend increases under its belt the yield is a generous 4 4 although it s heavily focused on retail assets 78 of rents it has exposure to non retail properties the remainder and europe about 10 of rents to add a little diversification and it has an investment grade rated balance sheet and is often afforded a premium valuation that very last point may sound bad but it gives realty income access to low cost capital and the ability to profitably grow its portfolio with deals that peers couldn t take on because of their smaller size and higher costs rarely cheap realty income is a name for which it s probably worth paying full price 2 canada and beyond bank of nova scotia or scotiabank as some call it is one of the largest banks in canada canada has a highly regulated and very conservative banking industry leaving a small number of banks with entrenched positions even though growth isn t material in canada it is highly unlikely that scotiabank s is going to suddenly lose its place in its core market which provides it with a solid foundational business many of the company s peers have used similarly strong core operations to push into the united states for growth but scotiabank has taken a different approach about half of the company s business is in canada and the rest falls into broader global buckets while some of that is located in the united states a far more significant portion is from latin america this positions scotiabank in emerging markets that are expected to have higher growth rates over time that s a good combination for long term wealth building today scotiabank offers a very generous 5 3 yield and it has paid a dividend every year since 1833 u s investors will have to pay canadian taxes and dividend payments will vary with exchange rates but if you can see the long term value of having some emerging market exposure in the mix this is a high yield bank you ll want to examine 3 a dividend king procter gamble is an iconic brand manager in the consumer staples space with a collection of high end labels that you almost certainly know well like bounty and gillette the company has long differentiated its products by spending heavily on research and development to ensure they offer premium benefits to justify their premium prices moreover its giant scale means it has the resources to advertise heavily and support strong retailer relationships it is one of the best run companies in the staples sector investors know this and tend to afford it a premium price right now the yield is 2 6 which is better than the broader market but not particularly high for procter gamble for value conscious types it might be best put onto the watch list in case there is a sell off that said this is a stock that s worth the wait most notably its long term success is highlighted by the fact that it has increased its dividend annually for more than 50 consecutive years making it a dividend king and with its entrenched industry position that streak doesn t seem likely to end anytime soon what s notable is that procter gamble like its peers is working through a period of elevated inflation that could lead to a buying opportunity if investor sentiment turns negative slow and steady dividend payers if there s a theme across these three stocks it is that they are all dividend paying companies that have proven themselves through hard times realty income is the youngest of the group but it is a dominant name in the reit space bank of nova scotia has used a conservative core business canadian banking to expand into high growth regions and procter gamble is an industry leader with iconic brands backing an incredible streak of annual dividend increases all three should at least be on your watch list if not your buy list today
maine s department of marine resources patrick keliher issued the following summary of the state s lobster industry and the various factors bearing down on it this year as i have promised before i want to make sure you are as informed as possible as the situation around right whales evolves there have been several developments in the last week many of which speak to the seriousness of the situation my goal is to keep you informed and to ensure that you have the information necessary to engage in important upcoming conversations maine lobstermen s association v national marine fisheries service as you know dmr is a participant in the lawsuit filed by mla which asserts that the national marine fisheries service nmfs erred by failing to rely on the best scientific information in the biological opinion bi op released in may 2021 and failed to account for the positive impact from conservation measures previously adopted by the maine lobster fishery unfortunately on september 8 judge boasberg sided with nmfs and ruled that nmfs reasonably explained how it estimated right whale populations nmfs appropriately assessed what was the best available information and nmfs met the requirements under the administrative procedures act while this does not preclude nmfs from considering the arguments made by the mla dmr and others in the future and choosing to take a less conservative approach to a revised biop and rule the judge will not force nmfs to do so i am extremely disappointed by this decision and i continue to believe that the assumptions nmfs made in the bi op overstate the risk in the maine lobster fishery we are evaluating our options at this time but i can confirm that after consulting with governor mills to leave all our options open we have directed our legal team to file a notice of intent to appeal nmfs announces scoping period on september 8 noaa announced a scoping period to consider additional rulemaking measures to achieve a 90 risk reduction in atlantic coast fixed gear fisheries including the lobster fishery as you will recall the conservation measures established in the lobster fishery under phase i were implemented via rulemaking earlier this year originally phase ii was intended to address risk in other trap pot and gillnet fisheries along the atlantic coast this would have been followed by phase iii which intended to consider additional risk reduction in all atlantic coast fixed gear fisheries including the lobster fishery however in the recent ruling in the lawsuit between the environmental groups and nmfs usually referred to as cbd v ross or the cbd case judge boasberg ruled that the final whale rule was invalid because it did not reduce takes below the potential biological removal pbr which is the number of individuals that can be lost due to human causes without undermining the sustainability of the stock within 6 months of implementation this ruling has accelerated the timeline for risk reduction over what was initially presented in the bi op as a result nmfs has expanded the scope of phase ii to include all fisheries currently regulated under the atlantic large whale take reduction plan this means that the lobster fishery will need to achieve a 90 risk reduction under phase ii as opposed to under phase iii nmfs is planning to hold only one remote public hearing during the scoping period on september 27 at 4 30 p m i feel strongly that nmfs should be holding multiple in person hearings during the scoping period and will continue to request they hold additional meetings governor mills has sent a letter to the secretary of commerce demanding that noaa do their job and face the fishermen that their rules will impact currently this scoping webinar is your only opportunity to communicate directly with noaa during the development of these measures so i strongly urge you to understand what is being discussed as described below and in the scoping notice and consider providing noaa with your thoughts about how such measures will impact you and your business you can learn more and register to attend the scoping hearing here written comments are also being accepted until october 11 if additional meetings are added we will be sure to let you know atlantic large whale take reduction team meeting concurrent to the ongoing scoping period the atlantic large whale take reduction team trt is beginning work on achieving the phase ii 90 risk reduction in us fixed gear fisheries based on recent updates and model runs nmfs has informed the trt that the measures implemented in may 2022 achieved a 50 risk reduction getting to a 90 risk reduction is a significant task and it will not be easy we are facing big changes to fixed gear fisheries i e lobster gillnet in maine and this could include trap and or endline reductions closures and additional weak rope at the most recent trt meeting on september 8th nmfs presented two examples to demonstrate what it will take to achieve a 90 risk reduction the first example by nmfs included year round closures of all fixed gear fisheries in federal waters managed under the alwtrp from maine to florida in additional to vertical line reductions and weak rope in state waters this achieved a 94 risk reduction a second example included seasonal and area based closures of fixed gear fisheries 50 vertical line reductions and broader weak rope implementation to reach an 89 risk reduction specific to maine the example included closing federal waters of zone a and b in june and july federal waters of zones c d and e october january and federal waters of zones f and g february march i want to re iterate that these are not actual proposals on the table but were used by nmfs to illustrate the magnitude of measures needed to achieve large risk reductions as you can tell from the above examples achieving a 90 risk reduction is going to be very difficult and there are going to be significant impacts to the lobster and gillnet industries in maine while the above illustrations are just examples they give you a feel for how extensive the next round of risk reductions may be whatever measures are ultimately implemented they are likely to impact fishermen in all zones and the changes are coming fast the trt is meeting the week of september 19th to continue developing measures to achieve 90 risk reduction and will meet again in november to vote on measures to put forward for implementation this timeline is very aggressive and will not allow for the many rounds of discussion that dmr staff had with the industry during the development of the phase i measures governor mills also pressed secretary raimondo for more time to develop these measures so that we can better understand how adverse impacts to maine s coastal communities might be lessened but both the governor and i strongly doubt that there are any measures that would achieve this draconian reduction that maine would support regardless we need to be at the table and ensure maine s voice is heard seafood watch red listing on september 5 the monterey bay aquarium s seafood watch program released new ratings assigning red listings to a number of fixed gear fisheries including the lobster fishery in maine seafood watch claims the basis for this decision is the critical status of the north atlantic right whale and that current management measures in both canada and the u s do not go far enough to mitigate risk of entanglement in fishing gear seafood watch has ignored the information that dmr has provided on behalf of this industry including that there has not been a right whale entanglement attributed to maine lobster gear in eighteen years and no deaths ever attributed to maine lobster gear seafood watch has also not considered recent conservation measures enacted within maine s fishery or that more measures will be implemented soon i am outraged by this decision and will continue to urge consumers to recognize the industry s longstanding commitment to right whale protection and sustainable harvesting similarly governor mills continues to advocate for maine s lobster industry and in a strongly worded letter to seafood watch the governor along with maine s congressional delegation have called for the listing to be reversed what is dmr doing to help after all that background the question that i get most often these days is what is dmr doing in summary our legal team is working very hard on behalf of the industry and is coordinating closely with mla s legal team to understand the ramifications of judge boasberg s most recent decision in the mla case and explore available options dmr s legal team will be filling an intent to appeal in this case in the coming days dmr is still working with our attorneys on our remedy brief that will be submitted to the court on the cbd v ross case in early october dmr secured 3 million dollars as proposed by governor mills in her biennial budget to help cover our growing legal costs dmr and governor mills have told noaa and the u s secretary of commerce that the current federal scoping plans are insufficient to solicit good industry input into a situation of critical importance to the entire coast of maine and have asked for this decision to be revisited dmr has been requesting access to the updated decision support tool dst so that we can do our own analysis of potential risk reduction scenarios and with the help of industry members look for those solutions that minimize the impacts of these federal actions to the greatest degree we can noaa continues to deny us access to this updated tool stating that it is not yet peer reviewed ironically just two years ago noaa gave us access to a previous version of the same tool before it had been peer reviewed governor mills and maine s congressional delegation have called on seafood watch to reverse their decision on the status of maine lobster dmr will continue to work with the maine lobster marketing collaborative to share the real information about this industry s stellar track record in lobster conservation and the many sacrifices already made on behalf of right whale protection going forward i promise to continue to keep you all updated and will be as transparent as possible about this evolving situation in that spirit dmr will be holding an in person meeting of the lobster advisory council meeting on september 26th to discuss the scoping and trt process and anticipated changes if you have questions please feel free to reach out to my office and we will do our best to help sincerely pat
versailles pennsylvania as if to emphasize that this river town of 1 200 has zero in common with the royalty that once ruled at the eponymous location outside paris royalty far removed from the concerns and the despair of its people this youghiogheny river town is pronounced in its own unique appalachian way ver sales that pronunciation also holds true for the towns of versailles kentucky as well as versailles ohio it has to do with the choppy way the early scots settlers in all three of these towns tended to emphasize second syllables over the first but one can imagine it also had a little bit to do with not having anything in common with the palace that for centuries symbolized a ruling class deeply out of sync with the rest of its nation the versailles in ohio is a charming and thriving little historic village the one in kentucky s bourbon country is the epicenter of american horse breeding and it has had robust population growth for 100 consecutive years the versailles here in western pennsylvania struggles last week president joe biden showed what it looks like when the ruling class loses all connection with the realities of the pain and stress of the people it serves his white house shindig to celebrate his own economic accomplishments was an orgy of self back patting and bragging over the inflation reduction act experts agree that it won t reduce inflation and there was a bit of irony to the fact that stocks plunged and with them many ordinary people s retirement savings over terrible inflation news even as biden was speaking the new inflation data showed a deeply troubling increase core inflation was 6 3 in august up from 5 9 in july the dow plunged a staggering 1 200 points on the news that inflation had only barely slowed down to 8 3 the future of america s bright and the promise of america is real it is real biden shouted counting on the strength of his own assertion to overpower the reality it is not lost on average voters for biden or for trump that this administration is wildly out of touch with the crippling effects that inflation is having on their lives eggs are 40 more expensive than a year ago coffee 18 groceries generally 11 you don t have to be a republican to be unhappy with that biden s tone deafness continued the following day which was spent in michigan lecturing people whose median income is 36 842 that they ought to buy an electric car to save money in much of the detroit area the 62 900 cadillac lyriq ev that biden drove as a stunt at his publicity event costs more than a three bedroom two bath home with a detached garage hours later biden traveled to delaware to vote in his home state s primary using a taxpayer funded jet and motorcade to vote in person rather than casting an absentee ballot as presidents barack obama and donald trump had done when they were in office it costs over 2 500 per minute to transport a sitting u s president all of this happened just two weeks after biden had announced college loan forgiveness a transfer of funds to the most privileged people in the nation with the brightest prospects at the expense of everyone else he followed that up a week later by standing outside independence hall in philadelphia draped in sinister red lighting and delivering one of the most odious speeches a president has ever given expressing his loathing for half of the people living in this country even abraham lincoln who had much more solid ground upon which to denounce his political enemies as moral inferiors was capable of exercising some restraint for months republicans seemed to be in the catbird seat in terms of voters preferring them over democrats in november s midterm elections their advantage may have diminished recently in large part because of trump s return to the spotlight and his feud with the doj whatever the outcome in november several things will be missed along the way in measuring the outcome if they win democrats will claim they benefited from their legislative accomplishments at the tail end of the summer they will also say their message of demonizing half of the country worked brilliantly and that the abortion issue played right into their hands if republicans retake both the house and the senate it won t be because they ran an effective national message so far they haven t but perhaps they weren t supposed to perhaps if they win more than 25 seats in the house and at least two in the senate it will be because they turned the election into a referendum on biden all you ever hear in the national news is how trumpy the republicans are i ve seen a lot of these campaigns across the country and i often wonder whether the reporters saying such things are attending the same meet and greets or town halls as i did or are they seizing on one fragment of a sentence and turning that into a 1 000 word think piece about what it all means such stories drive the news and social media but will they determine the election probably not when barack obama was handed his devastating midterm results in both 2010 and 2014 he was personally popular with the voters it was his policies that weren t when donald trump s party lost during the 2018 midterm elections he was not personally popular but his policies were the two men lost for different reasons obama because he overreached trump because of his personal comportment if biden gets a november shellacking it will not be because he didn t do enough legislatively it won t be because voters don t personally like him it will be because biden has lost touch with the concerns of the common men and women who make things move in this country the welders the mechanics the energy workers and waitresses the farmers and small business owners as well as the suburban parents whose grocery utility and housing bills have skyrocketed while their incomes have remained stagnant many such people have told me they voted for biden just two years ago but they have little sympathy for him now they are watching a man dance about and brag about his climate change bill all the while vilifying them or their family members heedless of the challenges they face biden s answer to 5 gas is for you to buy a 60 000 vehicle that alone explains just how out of touch he has become

roschetzkyistockphoto istock editorial via getty images rivian s nasdaq rivn r1t and r1s are fantastic electric vehicles with sleek futurist design profiles and enough interior space to fit plenty of people and payload starting at a cost of 73 000 and 78 000 respectively these are upmarket vehicles to meet the growing global demand for electric passenger transport to state this future looks strong would be an understatement as the list of states and countries on a planned phase out of combustion engine vehicles has grown significantly indeed california the european union the united kingdom and south korea all feature on this now fast growing list that is expanding the total addressable market of ev manufacturers this comes on the back of explosive demand growth for evs as global sales reached 6 6 million in 2021 more than double its year ago figure rivian is a highly capitalized ev company with several corporate partnerships there is a partnership with amazon amzn to deliver 100 000 rivian electric vans and a recently signed partnership with mercedes dmlry to jointly manufacture electric vans in europe this will see rivian grow its international footprint with a significantly lower capital expenditure overlay and with the expertise of the german automobile major whilst irvine based rivian does not directly compete with tesla s tsla best selling sedans the company s r1s and r1t will be going head to head with the tesla model x and upcoming cybertruck rivian has anchored itself around building cars for more outdoors and adventure orientated consumers the market for evs is set to become intensively competitive with several ev manufacturers emerging publicly over the pandemic years manufacturing a new ev is very capital heavy it requires a deep pool of funds to support and maintain long periods of cash burn and heavy capital expenditure this has historically created a darwinistic backdrop for ev manufacturers and is sure to reduce long term competition in the space to only a handful of the fittest and most competitive companies deliveries of vans to amazon underway as r1t and r1s realize production ramp rivian s financials are too early stage to pull away significant investment decisions the long term story is in its infancy the company last reported earnings for its fiscal 2022 second quarter which saw revenue come in at 364 million from zero in the comparable year ago period gross profits were negative at 704 million net loss came in at 1 7 billion with cash burn from operations lower at 1 2 billion total free cash outflow for the quarter stood at 1 56 billion broadly in line with the first quarter of 2022 for some context with rivian s market cap currently at 36 billion its total cash burn for the first half of the year amounts to nearly 9 of this the company has raised a material amount of cash to remedy the high cash burn and heavy capital expenditure phase of ev manufacturers raising a gargantuan 12 billion when it went public late last year cash and equivalents of 15 billion as of the end of its last reported quarter provide significant cash runway visibility at the current rate of burn however management is likely getting nervous with a stock price that is down 78 from its 52 week high and as the spectre of a recession haunts the us economy this will reduce the pathways to raising more cash r1 pre orders accelerated to hit 98 000 as the company reached the 8 000 vehicles produced milestone since its start of production rivian is targeting exiting fiscal 2022 with 25 000 vehicles produced key to continued success next year will be the inflation reduction act which as part of its broader investment allocation of 370 billion in decarbonization initiatives over the next decade will provide 7 500 in electric vehicle tax credits the credits will be renewed in january 2023 and will last until the end of 2032 providing a boost for the fledging yet fast growing us ev sector rivian s vehicles are made in illinois so the company is in a better position than some of its peers who outsourced production to other countries and will be ineligible for the credit animal spirits greed and fomo rivian went public in the latter half of 2021 valued at over 100 billion this was the largest us ipo since 2014 and came at the top of the bull market the next few months would see consecutively high inflation numbers that the fed had to match with interest rate hikes that have all but collapsed the valuation of growth stocks and threaten to further pull away liquidity from an already embattled stock market the rise and fall of rivian s commons is much a tale of euphoric animal spirits and greed as it is of a prosperous and wealthy future ahead as ev demand goes parabolic at one point rivian had a market capitalization greater than incumbents general motors gm and ford f so rivian s fight with tesla is multi faceted of course people looking to buy a pickup truck from next year will have to choose from a list that includes either the r1t or the cybertruck but the real fight will be capturing the vivid imaginations of ev investors to maintain the still exuberant animal spirits that pushed once pushed its market to incredible heights the near term outlook will be dominated by macro factors which look torrid and continue to deteriorate so investors should not be in a hurry to buy the commons
another sign of the shifting balance of power in the region was putin s carefully worded statement ahead of his meeting with xi jinping china s premier the meeting itself was xi jinping s first foray outside china since the pandemic hit it was billed as a gathering of asia s strongmen but talks in the ancient silk road desert city of samarkand in uzbekistan left no doubt as to who was the junior partner in this relationship putin said he acknowledged chinese concerns about the kremlin s war in ukraine it was the first significant admission of differences between beijing and moscow over the conflict while he praised beijing s balanced position putin said he would explain himself on the sidelines of the meeting by contrast xi did not mention ukraine at all in his remarks stating instead that china was willing to work with russia to demonstrate the responsibility of big powers and ironically to instill stability and positive energy in a world of chaos even india which has shied away from explicitly condemning russia for the invasion spoke out narendra modi india s prime minister told putin that today s time is not a time for war and stressed the importance of democracy and diplomacy and dialogue his comments drew a response from the russian leader who said the kremlin would do our best to end this as soon as possible as the tectonic plates shift and putin suffers setbacks on the battlefield the russian leader s waning influence is clearer than ever and observers are left wondering who will rescue the russian president from this self inflicted disaster will china long a junior partner in the relationship with moscow seize this moment to make its neighbour into a vassal state axis of convenience analysts said putin s acknowledgement of frictions between the countries was telling i think what we saw was pretty clear evidence of where the balance of power within the eurasian landmass itself has shifted says maximilian hess a fellow at the foreign policy research fpr institute putin acknowledging xi s concerns which he didn t even directly vocalise himself is certainly a very clear sign that there are differences in opinion of how to approach ukraine and russia s approach to it alexander gabuev a senior fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington dc agrees that the relationship between russia and china is far from equal russia is reorienting itself to china but their relationship now is deeply asymmetric china is clearly the stronger partner that said the chinese are skillfully massaging russia s ego with their rhetoric and their broader attitudes toward each other helps china doesn t care about alexei navalny and russia doesn t care about xinjiang that provides a type of glue for their relationship that makes it more comfortable for them to talk easy or not putin has a reason to be humble the man who has vowed to only deal with friendly nations is quickly losing them moscow has also suffered setbacks in ukraine amid a lack of manpower and supply challenges several stories suggest momentum is shifting towards ukrainian counterattacks
stubbornly high inflation has wall street worried that the federal reserve will respond by raising interest rates until the united states tumbles into recession taking the weakening global economy with it while analysts say the u s economy grew in the third quarter signs of trouble are multiplying here and abroad higher mortgage rates are chilling the u s housing market energy shortages are hurting german factory output and recurring coronavirus lockdowns are hobbling chinese businesses the fed and other central banks are tightening credit to fight historically high inflation even as three of the world s main economic engines the united states europe and china are sputtering with the united states and other governments also reducing spending on pandemic relief measures the global economy is getting less support from policymakers than at almost any time in 50 years the world bank said on thursday in a new report that warned of rising global recession risks i see a bumpy path ahead said daleep singh chief global economist for pgim fixed income we re in a world in which the shocks are going to keep coming fedex s stock plunged friday pulling broader financial markets down as well after the package delivery company s chief executive raj subramaniam said he expected a worldwide recession rate hikes are little help for estonia s 22 percent inflation europe s worst central banks meanwhile are engaged in the most aggressive campaign of rate increases since the late 1990s according to citigroup this month central banks in europe canada australia and chile have hiked rates and the fed is expected to do so for the fifth time since march at its meeting next week some economists fear that the world s central bankers are misreading the global economy in their rush to raise rates just as they did in the opposite way last year when they insisted inflation would prove temporary and resisted acting the cumulative effects of multiple countries tightening credit at the same time could strangle global growth i don t really get the sense that many or any central banks are paying huge attention to how their policies are affecting the rest of the world said maurice obstfeld of the university of california at berkeley the former chief economist of the international monetary fund the fed s rate hikes are driving the dollar up against other major currencies which makes imported goods less expensive for americans while making it harder for people and businesses in other countries to afford products made outside their borders major oil importers such as tunisia have been especially hard hit since crude is priced in dollars the stronger greenback also hurts developing nations that have large dollar debts as their local currencies lose value against the dollar it takes more turkish lira or argentine pesos to make debt payments falling food and fuel costs offer poorer nations little relief despite raising its benchmark lending rate by two and a half points since march the fed has been unable to slow the economy enough to take the pressure off prices on thursday initial jobless claims fell for the fifth straight week in the latest sign that the labor market remains too hot for the central bank s comfort though strong hiring is good news for american workers many economists have said that unemployment will need to increase before inflation cools the labor department s report this week that consumer prices in august were 8 3 percent higher than one year ago little changed from 8 5 percent in july disappointed investors some analysts expect the fed to keep hiking beyond the 3 8 percent level that policymakers suggested in june would complete their anti inflation work on friday economists at deutsche bank said the fed s benchmark lending rate could hit 5 percent next year roughly twice the current level wall street firms such as oxford economics this week said the fed will hit the brakes hard enough to corral prices even if it sends the united states into a brief downturn higher for longer inflation more aggressive fed monetary policy tightening and negative spillover effects from a weakening global backdrop will combine to push the u s economy into a mild recession the firm said in a note to clients since 1981 u s and global growth have largely moved in tandem according to citigroup research in each of the four global recessions since 1980 the united states which accounts for roughly one quarter of world gross domestic product or gdp slowed either right before the global economy fell into a slump or at the same time the imf said this summer that the global economy was in danger of slipping into recession as a result of aftershocks from the war in ukraine the pandemic and inflation the imf alarm followed a world bank warning of the risk of global stagflation a toxic combination of persistently high prices and anemic growth there is no official definition of a global recession though the world bank uses the term to describe a fall in per person global gdp some economists say a broad decline in a number of metrics such as industrial production cross border capital flows employment and trade or an economic slump involving a large number of major economies distinguishes a true global recession we have the u s canada and europe all in recession over the second half of this year and early next year whether you call that a global recession or not is in the eye of the beholder said ben may oxford economics director of global macro research but we are going to go through a very weak patch it s going to feel like a recession the big worry is europe which is struggling to adjust to the loss of russian natural gas supplies moscow reacted to european sanctions after the invasion of ukraine by slashing shipments of natural gas to europe by roughly 75 percent according to barclays as energy prices soared consumers and businesses on the continent felt the pinch after years of holding borrowing costs below zero the european central bank has raised rates twice since july to curb inflation that tops 9 percent and plans more such moves despite a weakening economy it s their most dramatic shift in policy since the global financial crisis the energy supply shock hits them much harder than the u s said economist carmen reinhart of harvard s kennedy school of government some economists say a broader adjustment is underway after decades in which global integration kept a lid on price pressures in the united states and other advanced economies external forces now are fueling inflation governments in the united states europe and china are encouraging greater domestic production via subsidies and investment restrictions reshaping global supply chains will cost more as will efforts to speed the transition from fossil fuels to address climate change said dana peterson chief economist for the conference board the days of ultralow inflation are probably over she said global economic activity contracted in the second quarter for the first time since the early days of the pandemic in 2020 if that contraction turns into a full blown recession in the months ahead traditional fixes will not be available with inflation raging near 40 year highs in the united states europe canada and the united kingdom central bankers are intent on raising rates not lowering them the customary remedy for low growth in 2008 when an imploding housing bubble ignited a global financial crisis the chinese government stepped up with a nearly 600 billion wave of infrastructure spending followed by years of generous financing by state banks the total rescue amounted to more than one quarter of china s gross domestic product far more than the united states spent on stimulus according to a study by the organization for economic cooperation and development in paris the chinese spending translated into orders for factories in the united states and europe copper mines in peru and iron ore producers in australia today china is preoccupied with its own troubles including a debt ridden property sector and flagging export growth ahead of a sensitive communist party congress in october which is expected to grant chinese president xi jinping an unprecedented third term the yuan this year also has fallen almost 9 percent against the dollar and is hovering near the symbolically important level of 7 yuan to the greenback chinese leaders are more reluctant to use levers they ve used in the past said may china is less likely to be the spender of last resort
us uk relations enter new chapter as new pm king settle in associated press file london president joe biden arrived in london to pay his respects to queen elizabeth ii at a time of transition in u s u k relations as both a new monarch and a new prime minister are settling in the hawkish approach of prime minister liz truss to russia and china puts her on the same page as biden but the rise of truss 47 who once called the relationship special but not exclusive could mark a decidedly new chapter in the trans atlantic partnership on trade and more of high concern for biden officials in the early going of truss s premiership is her backing of legislation that would shred parts of the post brexit trading arrangements in northern ireland analysts say the move could cause deep strain between the u k and the european union and undermine peace in northern ireland white house press secretary karine jean pierre said the move would not create a conducive environment for crafting a long awaited u s uk trade deal coveted by truss and her conservative party she s signaled that she s willing to go to the mattresses on this and that s going to cause a rift not just between the u k and eu but the uk and the u s said max bergmann director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and a former senior state department official in the obama administration it s one that s going to keep the white house up at night biden arrived in london late saturday and had been set to meet with truss on sunday but the prime minister s office said saturday they would skip the weekend hello opting instead for a meeting in new york at the u n general assembly on wednesday though truss still planned to gather with other world leaders converging on london for the royal funeral the white house confirmed the u n meeting just as the president boarded air force one the two close allies now find themselves in a period of political uncertainty on both sides of the atlantic not unlike his fellow septuagenarian biden king charles iii faces questions from the public about whether his age will limit his ability to faithfully carry out the duties of the monarch charles 73 and biden 79 discussed global cooperation on the climate crisis last year while both attended a summit in glasgow scotland they also met at buckingham palace in june 2021 at a reception the queen hosted before a world leaders summit in cornwall truss finds herself as biden does facing questions about whether she has what it takes to lift a country battered by stubborn inflation borne out of the coronavirus pandemic and exacerbated by russia s invasion of ukraine unleashing chaos on the global energy market all the while britain and the rest of europe is carefully watching to see what the upcoming u s midterm elections will bring for the democratic american president after he vowed upon taking office that america is back to being a full partner in the international community after four years of republican donald trump pushing his america first worldview it certainly is a time of change and transformation in the u k said barbara a perry presidential studies director at the university of virginia s miller center she added we don t know what will happen in our midterms we don t know what will happen in 2024 truss a former accountant who was first elected to parliament in 2010 hasn t had much interaction with biden the u s president called her earlier this month to congratulate her truss as foreign secretary accompanied her predecessor boris johnson on a white house visit last year it s been more than 75 years since winston churchill declared there was a special relationship between the two nations a notion that leaders on both sides have repeatedly affirmed still there have been bumps along the way tony blair was derisively branded by the british tabloids as george w bush s poodle for backing the 2003 american led invasion of iraq david cameron and barack obama had a bromance but obama also had his frustrations with the brits over defense spending and the u k s handling of libya following the 2011 ouster of muammar gaddafi margaret thatcher and ronald reagan forged a close alliance in the midst of the cold war with the prime minister once telling students that the republican president s really good sense of humor helped their relationship but there were difficulties too such as when thatcher and members of her cabinet bristled at the reagan administration s initial neutrality in the falklands war the white house wasn t expecting truss s announcement in may when she was foreign secretary that the government would move forward with legislation that would rewrite parts of the northern ireland protocol the agreement was part of the u k s 2020 brexit withdrawal from the eu that was designed to avoid a hard north south border with ireland that might upset northern ireland s fragile peace now in the first weeks of truss s premiership biden administration officials are carefully taking the measure of the new british leader analysts say there is some trepidation in the administration that undercutting the northern ireland protocol could plunge europe into trade turmoil at a moment when biden is working mightily to keep the west unified in confronting russia over its aggression against ukraine brexit could once again become the issue the issue that can make it difficult for all of europe to work together at a time when it is critical for europe to work together bergmann said if you re the biden administration this is not the time for the two of your closest partners getting into fights to be certain there were areas of friction between biden and johnson who had a warm rapport with former president donald trump biden staunchly opposed brexit as a candidate and had expressed great concern over the future of northern ireland biden once even derided johnson as a physical and emotional clone of trump johnson worked hard to overcome that impression stressing his common ground with biden on climate change support for international institutions and most notably by making certain britain was an early and generous member of the u s led alliance providing economic and military assistance to ukraine in the aftermath of the russian invasion the former prime minister also unsuccessfully pressed biden starting days into his administration to begin negotiations on a new u s u k trade deal just as the u k regained control over its national trade policy weeks before biden took office and following the end of a post brexit transition period but biden largely kept focus on his domestic to do list in the early going of his presidency passing trillions in spending on coronavirus relief infrastructure and more and put negotiations on trade deals on the back burner elliot abrams chairman of the conservative foreign policy group vandenberg coalition said that truss needs biden to make a new u s u k trade deal a priority queen elizabeth s funeral won t be the setting for tough bilateral conversations but it still marks a moment for the two leaders to begin taking stock of each other truss who succeeded johnson after he was forced to resign in the face of a string of scandals has lagged in the opinion polls she also won her election with a smaller margin than her recent predecessors and is looking for an early win i think if i were truss i want recognition of the leading role britain s played far more than any other country outside the united states in

london u s president joe biden arrived in london to pay his respects to queen elizabeth ii at a time of transition in u s u k relations as both a new monarch and a new prime minister are settling in the hawkish approach of prime minister liz truss to russia and china puts her on the same page as biden but the rise of truss 47 who once called the relationship special but not exclusive could mark a decidedly new chapter in the trans atlantic partnership on trade and more of high concern for biden officials in the early going of truss s premiership is her backing of legislation that would shred parts of the post brexit trading arrangements in northern ireland analysts say the move could cause deep strain between the u k and the european union and undermine peace in northern ireland white house press secretary karine jean pierre said the move would not create a conducive environment for crafting a long awaited u s uk trade deal coveted by truss and her conservative party she s signalled that she s willing to go to the mattresses on this and that s going to cause a rift not just between the u k and eu but the uk and the u s said max bergmann director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and a former senior state department official in the obama administration it s one that s going to keep the white house up at night biden arrived in london late saturday and had been set to meet with truss on sunday but the prime minister s office said saturday they would skip the weekend hello opting instead for a meeting in new york at the un general assembly on wednesday though truss still planned to gather with other world leaders converging on london for the royal funeral the white house confirmed the un meeting just as the president boarded air force one the two close allies now find themselves in a period of political uncertainty on both sides of the atlantic not unlike his fellow septuagenarian biden king charles iii faces questions from the public about whether his age will limit his ability to faithfully carry out the duties of the monarch charles 73 and biden 79 discussed global cooperation on the climate crisis last year while both attended a summit in glasgow scotland they also met at buckingham palace in june 2021 at a reception the queen hosted before a world leaders summit in cornwall truss finds herself as biden does facing questions about whether she has what it takes to lift a country battered by stubborn inflation borne out of the coronavirus pandemic and exacerbated by russia s invasion of ukraine unleashing chaos on the global energy market all the while britain and the rest of europe is carefully watching to see what the upcoming u s midterm elections will bring for the democratic american president after he vowed upon taking office that america is back to being a full partner in the international community after four years of republican donald trump pushing his america first worldview it certainly is a time of change and transformation in the u k said barbara a perry presidential studies director at the university of virginia s miller center she added we don t know what will happen in our midterms we don t know what will happen in 2024 truss a former accountant who was first elected to parliament in 2010 hasn t had much interaction with biden the u s president called her earlier this month to congratulate her truss as foreign secretary accompanied her predecessor boris johnson on a white house visit last year it s been more than 75 years since winston churchill declared there was a special relationship between the two nations a notion that leaders on both sides have repeatedly affirmed still there have been bumps along the way tony blair was derisively branded by the british tabloids as george w bush s poodle for backing the 2003 american led invasion of iraq david cameron and barack obama had a bromance but obama also had his frustrations with the brits over defence spending and the u k s handling of libya following the 2011 ouster of muammar gaddafi margaret thatcher and ronald reagan forged a close alliance in the midst of the cold war with the prime minister once telling students that the republican president s really good sense of humour helped their relationship but there were difficulties too such as when thatcher and members of her cabinet bristled at the reagan administration s initial neutrality in the falklands war the white house wasn t expecting truss s announcement in may when she was foreign secretary that the government would move forward with legislation that would rewrite parts of the northern ireland protocol the agreement was part of the u k s 2020 brexit withdrawal from the eu that was designed to avoid a hard north south border with ireland that might upset northern ireland s fragile peace now in the first weeks of truss s premiership biden administration officials are carefully taking the measure of the new british leader analysts say there is some trepidation in the administration that undercutting the northern ireland protocol could plunge europe into trade turmoil at a moment when biden is working mightily to keep the west unified in confronting russia over its aggression against ukraine brexit could once again become the issue the issue that can make it difficult for all of europe to work together at a time when it is critical for europe to work together bergmann said if you re the biden administration this is not the time for the two of your closest partners getting into fights to be certain there were areas of friction between biden and johnson who had a warm rapport with former president donald trump biden staunchly opposed brexit as a candidate and had expressed great concern over the future of northern ireland biden once even derided johnson as a physical and emotional clone of trump johnson worked hard to overcome that impression stressing his common ground with biden on climate change support for international institutions and most notably by making certain britain was an early and generous member of the u s led alliance providing economic and military assistance to ukraine in the aftermath of the russian invasion the former prime minister also unsuccessfully pressed biden starting days into his administration to begin negotiations on a new u s u k trade deal just as the u k regained control over its national trade policy weeks before biden took office and following the end of a post brexit transition period but biden largely kept focus on his domestic to do list in the early going of his presidency passing trillions in spending on coronavirus relief infrastructure and more and put negotiations on trade deals on the back burner elliot abrams chairman of the conservative foreign policy group vandenberg coalition said that truss needs biden to make a new u s u k trade deal a priority queen elizabeth s funeral won t be the setting for tough bilateral conversations but it still marks a moment for the two leaders to begin taking stock of each other truss who succeeded johnson after he was forced to resign in the face of a string of scandals has lagged in the opinion polls she also won her election with a smaller margin than her recent predecessors and is looking for an early win i think if i were truss i want recognition of the leading role britain s played far more than any other country outside the united states in supporting ukraine said abrams who served in senior national security and foreign policy roles in the trump george w bush and reagan administrations and i think i d want some positive economic message to give the british people which could be that the free trade agreement negotiations are starting madhani reported from

as i have promised before i want to make sure you are as informed as possible as the situation around right whales evolves there have been several developments in the last week many of which speak to the seriousness of the situation my goal is to keep you informed and to ensure that you have the information necessary to engage in important upcoming conversations maine lobstermen s association v national marine fisheries service as you know dmr is a participant in the lawsuit filed by mla which asserts that the national marine fisheries service nmfs erred by failing to rely on the best scientific information in the biological opinion bi op released in may 2021 and failed to account for the positive impact from conservation measures previously adopted by the maine lobster fishery unfortunately on september 8 judge boasberg sided with nmfs and ruled that nmfs reasonably explained how it estimated right whale populations nmfs appropriately assessed what was the best available information and nmfs met the requirements under the administrative procedures act while this does not preclude nmfs from considering the arguments made by the mla dmr and others in the future and choosing to take a less conservative approach to a revised biop and rule the judge will not force nmfs to do so i am extremely disappointed by this decision and i continue to believe that the assumptions nmfs made in the bi op overstate the risk in the maine lobster fishery we are evaluating our options at this time but i can confirm that after consulting with governor mills to leave all our options open we have directed our legal team to file a notice of intent to appeal nmfs announces scoping period on september 8 noaa announced a scoping period to consider additional rulemaking measures to achieve a 90 risk reduction in atlantic coast fixed gear fisheries including the lobster fishery as you will recall the conservation measures established in the lobster fishery under phase i were implemented via rulemaking earlier this year originally phase ii was intended to address risk in other trap pot and gillnet fisheries along the atlantic coast this would have been followed by phase iii which intended to consider additional risk reduction in all atlantic coast fixed gear fisheries including the lobster fishery however in the recent ruling in the lawsuit between the environmental groups and nmfs usually referred to as cbd v ross or the cbd case judge boasberg ruled that the final whale rule was invalid because it did not reduce takes below the potential biological removal pbr which is the number of individuals that can be lost due to human causes without undermining the sustainability of the stock within 6 months of implementation this ruling has accelerated the timeline for risk reduction over what was initially presented in the bi op as a result nmfs has expanded the scope of phase ii to include all fisheries currently regulated under the atlantic large whale take reduction plan this means that the lobster fishery will need to achieve a 90 risk reduction under phase ii as opposed to under phase iii nmfs is planning to hold only one remote public hearing during the scoping period on september 27 at 4 30 p m i feel strongly that nmfs should be holding multiple in person hearings during the scoping period and will continue to request they hold additional meetings governor mills has sent a letter to the secretary of commerce demanding that noaa do their job and face the fishermen that their rules will impact currently this scoping webinar is your only opportunity to communicate directly with noaa during the development of these measures so i strongly urge you to understand what is being discussed as described below and in the scoping notice and consider providing noaa with your thoughts about how such measures will impact you and your business you can learn more and register to attend the scoping hearing here written comments are also being accepted until october 11 if additional meetings are added we will be sure to let you know atlantic large whale take reduction team meeting concurrent to the ongoing scoping period the atlantic large whale take reduction team trt is beginning work on achieving the phase ii 90 risk reduction in us fixed gear fisheries based on recent updates and model runs nmfs has informed the trt that the measures implemented in may 2022 achieved a 50 risk reduction getting to a 90 risk reduction is a significant task and it will not be easy we are facing big changes to fixed gear fisheries i e lobster gillnet in maine and this could include trap and or endline reductions closures and additional weak rope at the most recent trt meeting on september 8th nmfs presented two examples to demonstrate what it will take to achieve a 90 risk reduction the first example by nmfs included year round closures of all fixed gear fisheries in federal waters managed under the alwtrp from maine to florida in additional to vertical line reductions and weak rope in state waters this achieved a 94 risk reduction a second example included seasonal and area based closures of fixed gear fisheries 50 vertical line reductions and broader weak rope implementation to reach an 89 risk reduction specific to maine the example included closing federal waters of zone a and b in june and july federal waters of zones c d and e october january and federal waters of zones f and g february march i want to re iterate that these are not actual proposals on the table but were used by nmfs to illustrate the magnitude of measures needed to achieve large risk reductions as you can tell from the above examples achieving a 90 risk reduction is going to be very difficult and there are going to be significant impacts to the lobster and gillnet industries in maine while the above illustrations are just examples they give you a feel for how extensive the next round of risk reductions may be whatever measures are ultimately implemented they are likely to impact fishermen in all zones and the changes are coming fast the trt is meeting the week of september 19th to continue developing measures to achieve 90 risk reduction and will meet again in november to vote on measures to put forward for implementation this timeline is very aggressive and will not allow for the many rounds of discussion that dmr staff had with the industry during the development of the phase i measures governor mills also pressed secretary raimondo for more time to develop these measures so that we can better understand how adverse impacts to maine s coastal communities might be lessened but both the governor and i strongly doubt that there are any measures that would achieve this draconian reduction that maine would support regardless we need to be at the table and ensure maine s voice is heard seafood watch red listing on september 5 the monterey bay aquarium s seafood watch program released new ratings assigning red listings to a number of fixed gear fisheries including the lobster fishery in maine seafood watch claims the basis for this decision is the critical status of the north atlantic right whale and that current management measures in both canada and the u s do not go far enough to mitigate risk of entanglement in fishing gear seafood watch has ignored the information that dmr has provided on behalf of this industry including that there has not been a right whale entanglement attributed to maine lobster gear in eighteen years and no deaths ever attributed to maine lobster gear seafood watch has also not considered recent conservation measures enacted within maine s fishery or that more measures will be implemented soon i am outraged by this decision and will continue to urge consumers to recognize the industry s longstanding commitment to right whale protection and sustainable harvesting similarly governor mills continues to advocate for maine s lobster industry and in a strongly worded letter to seafood watch the governor along with maine s congressional delegation have called for the listing to be reversed what is dmr doing to help after all that background the question that i get most often these days is what is dmr doing in summary our legal team is working very hard on behalf of the industry and is coordinating closely with mla s legal team to understand the ramifications of judge boasberg s most recent decision in the mla case and explore available options dmr s legal team will be filling an intent to appeal in this case in the coming days dmr is still working with our attorneys on our remedy brief that will be submitted to the court on the cbd v ross case in early october dmr secured 3 million dollars as proposed by governor mills in her biennial budget to help cover our growing legal costs dmr and governor mills have told noaa and the u s secretary of commerce that the current federal scoping plans are insufficient to solicit good industry input into a situation of critical importance to the entire coast of maine and have asked for this decision to be revisited dmr has been requesting access to the updated decision support tool dst so that we can do our own analysis of potential risk reduction scenarios and with the help of industry members look for those solutions that minimize the impacts of these federal actions to the greatest degree we can noaa continues to deny us access to this updated tool stating that it is not yet peer reviewed ironically just two years ago noaa gave us access to a previous version of the same tool before it had been peer reviewed governor mills and maine s congressional delegation have called on seafood watch to reverse their decision on the status of maine lobster dmr will continue to work with the maine lobster marketing collaborative to share the real information about this industry s stellar track record in lobster conservation and the many sacrifices already made on behalf of right whale protection going forward i promise to continue to keep you all updated and will be as transparent as possible about this evolving situation in that spirit dmr will be holding an in person meeting of the lobster advisory council meeting on september 26th to discuss the scoping and trt process and anticipated changes if you have questions please feel free to reach out to my office and we will do our best to help

imaginima there has been a tendency to lump the whole european continent together and predict the worst case scenarios in the aftermath of the ukrainian war rising fuel costs and falling euro following the ecb review of monetary policy with so much negativity priced in the vanguard ftse europe etf nysearca vgk is now available for less than 51 after it suffered from a one year drop of nearly 27 as shown in the chart below data by ycharts however europe consists of many countries and regions which have been impacted differently by supply chains and high commodity prices and this thesis attempts to look beyond the gloom to identify opportunities while also highlighting the risks i start by providing an overview of country exposure country level diversification as seen by the table below in addition to the u k france and germany vgk holds stocks of companies located in many other countries like austria belgium denmark finland greece ireland italy the netherlands norway portugal spain and sweden interestingly it has 15 2 of its assets dedicated to switzerland which includes pharmaceuticals and financial institutions country level diversification vanguard this diverse country level exposure in itself constitutes diversification and includes a whole swath of value opportunities that pass under the radar as many of the holdings are currently trading cheaply this is in contrast to the u s where there are limited opportunities because valuations still remain above historical averages despite the recent stock market downturns furthermore in spite of the majority of countries suffering on a global basis vgk in blue underperforms both the s p 500 in orange and the vanguard ftse all world ex us etf veu in purple hence purely from the valuations perspective europe is far from a superbubble comparison of performances seeking alpha this undervaluation is not normal as despite being faced with an unprecedented energy crisis that risks causing a rationing of natural gas for its industries europe possesses some of the worldâ s most competitive multinationals which can shift production to other countries where they operate moreover vgk seeks to track the performance of the ftse developed europe all cap index now these are developed markets not underdeveloped or developing countries whose economies have to be rescued at the first signs of deterioration of the balance of payments or acute currency devaluations to this end many european states have developed resiliency in their economic models namely through elaborate welfare systems financed by taxpayers money thus it may happen that there may be a capping of surging energy prices with higher taxation for oil companies to finance widening national trade deficits for this matter the vanguard etf has only 5 76 of exposure to energy companies also the abrupt raising of interest rates by the ecb european central bank or the bank of england can lead to economic slowdowns but this does not mean that there will be a crisis of apocalyptic dimension which would suddenly blow vgk s holdings out of existence the holdings strengths and weaknesses as investors will notice the first ten holdings out of the total of 1369 are not from germany or italy whose economies have a higher dosage of industrials which should be impacted the most by rising energy costs normally when we think of germany we automatically associate the country with automakers the holdings vanguard well vgk does not include any of these big german automakers as part of its top twenty holdings but on the other hand holds shares of sap se sap as shown above after some short term headwinds due to its exposure to russia this german enterprise software and cloud play should benefit from more sales as the products of its american competitors become more expensive in europe and other parts of the world as a result of a strong dollar along the same lines vgk includes other companies who should benefit from currency windfall gains despite a lower euro or gbp being bad for inflation the etf also includes behemoth allianz otcpk alizf as well as other insurance plays like zurich insurance otcqx zurvy which are seen as beneficiaries of the ecb s policy of rising interest rates the reason is that in addition to investing insurance companies also hold policyholders money in banks and when interest rates go up the value of their assets goes up too as a matter of fact the fund dedicates about 15 of its assets to financials including banks like hsbc plc otcpk hbcyf furthermore one sector that is seen as defensive in times of trouble is healthcare which constitutes about 15 of vgkâ s assets including big names like swiss based roche ag otcqx rhhby and novartis nvs as evidenced by the one month stock performance of these two companies the health sector has held up well on the other hand the consumer discretionary sector represented here by luxury brand lvmh moã t hennessy lvmh has suffered by 9 during the last month and this despite seeing revenues increasing by 13 in the second quarter of 2022 on a year on year basis there has been a slight drop on a sequential basis though instilling doubts in the minds of investors as to whether there may be further pains going into the second half of the year remaining on the cautionary side industrial holdings which constitute 15 of vgk s total assets are likely to suffer the most as in addition to suffering from higher energy and material input costs they are likely to face an uncertain demand outlook this uncertainty appears to have been priced in siemens otcpk siegy 40 downside since the start of 2022 discussing the outlook still europe s largest manufacturing company has not capitulated yet and recently commissioned one of the biggest green hydrogen production plants in germany in a way this shows europe s commitment to green technology while the u s gets stuck with its oil companies thus europe is better prepared for global warming while on the other side of the atlantic ocean many choose to keep their heads buried in the sand this implies that there is a risk that the u s federal government falls short of having sufficient money to bail out flooded areas or locations ravaged by major fires or hurricanes still the future remains uncertain not only in the old continent but pretty much everywhere in the world including the u s where confidence has now given place to doubt as the fed now has to apply the most drastic monetary tightening policies after a rise in the cpi consumer price index in these circumstances europe deserves a fresh look and scrutinizing the price action vgk reached a low of 49 97 on the first day of september which coincided with russia cutting and not resuming natural gas supply to germany it is now currently trading at 50 25 and tested the 50 50 level on july 14 therefore 50 25 50 50 seem to constitute a resistance level also when the ecb hiked rates by 75 basis points vgk subsequently rose by about 2 to 53 51 which shows that investors appreciate the fact that the ecb is prepared to do what it takes to fight inflation also many corporations which have cash are fighting back through commodity hedging like volkswagen otcpk vwagy which gained 400 million euros in this way consequently sticking to the diversification rhetoric not all holdings are likely to witness the same level of headwinds namely those based in france this country is in a unique situation as it was not relying as much on russian oil as germany due to having more nuclear plants and engineers are working very hard to fix older ones before winter it is much therefore less vulnerable to the war in ukraine concluding with the dividend rationale therefore it is not all gloom and there are many pockets of opportunities for those who have been long cash and who want to diversify into an income generating etf vgk pays one of the highest yields at 4 38 as seen in the table below dividend grades www seekingalpha com now one of the reasons for yields being so high is vgk losing value also the chart above shows that the quarterly dividend payments are non uniform the reason is that in contrast with some u s counterparts european companies have no intention of becoming dividend aristocrats instead when the business is not faring well they cut the dividend and when conditions improve they raise yields that s why a high dividend does not mean their business is underwater and they are desperately trying to lay out a value trap thus the higher dividend payment made in july shows that the underlying fund is doing well as an alternative to vgk and for those like myself whose brokers provide them access to european listed funds there are the lyxor cac 40 dr ucits etf for french equities the xtrackers xdax income etf for germany and the lyxor core uk eq all cap dr etf which provide access to many of the holdings i mentioned above they also pay good dividends however the vanguard etf remains cheaper with an expense ratio of only 0 08 and you get all the stocks in the same basket finally the ukrainian conflict and high commodity prices all have the hallmarks of a predictable recession where investors as well as the common people already know in advance about many of the pains to come therefore while there could be further downside in vgk in case of a winter recession occurring in germany or further pains in the u k as the pound s value dwindles down i do not foresee a market crash of apocalyptic proportions as is the case during a normal recession
we can t afford congress it s driving america s cost of living through the roof any tax cut or economic stimulus we might get this spring is peanuts compared to how washington keeps jacking up the price of everything that s important by itself last month s energy bill will make food cars gasoline and even light bulbs more expensive washington is also the culprit behind high medical bills and health insurance washing machines that have doubled in price and our wonderful more expensive lo flo toilets that don t flush right all this is on top of what red tape already costs us a 2004 government report admitted that federal regulations cost our economy at least 1 1 trillion each year that s 3 666 per person so multiply that by the number of people in your household and remember that s before the 2007 energy bill and in addition to taxes the new energy laws are a leftist s dream and a supply sider s nightmare as 2008 starts we re paying 3 often more for a gallon of gasoline that s up about a fourth 64 cents from a year ago the heritage foundation calculates the new energy bill will boost gas prices over 5 a gallon by 2016 yet rather than let us produce more oil domestically congress keeps areas off limits from drilling that could raise supply and lower prices someday you might save gas since congress has dictated that new cars must soon get 10 percent more miles per gallon but that depends on your being able to afford a new car sticker shock on new cars will get worse because engineering them to meet the mandate will raise car prices by 5 000 to 7 000 per car according to general motors compounding the engineering challenge is the congressional requirement that more ethanol be mixed into the gasoline that lowers mpg because ethanol contains less energy in return for this mileage reduction your tax dollars are used to pay ethanol producers a 51 cent per gallon subsidy since the new law compels the sale of 35 billion gallons of ethanol up from the currently mandated 8 billion gallons a year the subsidy costs to taxpayers will rise from 4 billion to 17 5 billion annually this is why food prices keep going up as more corn goes into ethanol food processors must bid against the government subsidy to buy corn so must livestock producers who need the corn to feed the cattle chickens and other animals even before the four fold increase in the ethanol mandate one fifth of corn production already goes to ethanol this will worsen the 9 billion a year extra that consumers already pay in food prices because ethanol subsidies have taken so much corn out of the food and feed supply thanks to congress the era of cheap and plentiful food in america may be over sadly they ll just propose more food stamps as a solution could we just plant more corn and maybe end 23 billion in farm subsidies the ethanol mandate is so massive there s not room to plant more corn to avoid higher food prices the national environmental trust estimates the new mandate will require us to plant an additional 82 5 millon acres of corn 129 000 square miles that would take every square inch of tennessee kentucky and ohio presuming you could evacuate the people and plant every acre then there s congress bright idea about light bulbs banning thomas edison s invention of the incandescent bulb as a smart shopper i can buy them on sale for only 25 cents each but i can t find the new curlicue fluorescent bulbs for less than 2 apiece i ve bought some anyway since they re said to last eight times longer and save 80 percent more energy but i resent congress telling me i ve got no choice i m tempted to be ornery and stock up on the old school bulbs before they re banished to consumer prison i had the same dismay when the feds banned 99 cent cans of freon making us spend a hundred dollars to fix the coolant in our car air conditioning there s a cultural factor too we lose a little refinement when the piggy tail lights replace decorative bulbs in candelabras mirror lights etc or we can t find small incandescent lights for christmas decorations these mandates come from the same folks who brought us the 900 washing machine up from 400 or so before federal mandates kicked in and the pricier 1 6 gallon per flush toilet which wastes water because you have to flush multiple times federal red tape is also the biggest reason why health care is so expensive for each hour spent with patients our doctors nurses and their staff must spend almost another hour doing the paperwork dictated by federal regulations no wonder we re losing jobs to the rest of the world they don t drown themselves in silly red tape that makes the price of their products uncompetitive but we do presidential candidates take note if you want to woo middle class voters don t offer them one shot rebates or other economic stimulus gimmicks bring back common sense and make life in america affordable again ernest istook is a distinguished fellow in government relations
any comprehensive plan to reform health care will contain complex and likely contentious provisions the recently enacted massachusetts plan based on a proposal by governor mitt romney is no exception it contains complex provisions that have raised questions and concerns but much of this controversy stems from confusion about the provisions therefore understanding these provisions especially in the context of the larger reform is important four points of confusion the individual mandate under federal law nearly all hospitals are required to provide a certain level of treatment to all patients who visit their emergency rooms regardless of those patients ability to pay governor romney sought a way to prevent the free rider problem those who take advantage of emergency services skip out on the charges leaving taxpayers to cover the bill romney proposed that state residents either purchase health insurance or if they chose not to do so self insure by posting a 10 000 bond that could be put towards the cost of any hospital care they might use but be unable to afford the democrat controlled legislature rejected the governor s proposal and forced on state residents a different choice buy health insurance or pay a fine while many oppose a mandate to buy insurance even basic catastrophic insurance to protect the community from individuals not paying their bills on philosophical grounds they should still have a firm factual understanding of the massachusetts mandate which may be less problematic than they realize thanks to regulatory changes that are a part of the massachusetts plan residents will be able to satisfy the mandate merely by purchasing catastrophic coverage through a high deductible health plan or a health savings account hsa with this regulatory change the plan will promote hsa high deducible plans and make health care coverage more accessible and somewhat more affordable for individuals the state will also provide lower income individuals with a subsidy essentially a voucher to help them purchase health insurance an approach similar to the refundable health tax credits that many support at the federal level these changes make the mandate far less of a burden on individuals than it otherwise would have been the new employer mandate the governor s original proposal did not include an employer mandate the legislature however decided to add requirements for employers to its final legislation for years employers in massachusetts that purchased coverage for their employees have had to pay a health insurance premium tax to the state s uncompensated care pool this tax applied only to employers paying for insurance not to employers that didn t provide coverage despite that many of their employees benefited from the uncompensated care pool ideally the plan should have repealed the existing premium tax instead the legislature inserted a provision that will require companies that do not make any provision for insurance to pay a levy set at a maximum of 295 per employee per year into the state s uncompensated care pool the governor vetoed this provision under his line item veto authority but the legislature will likely vote to reinstate it still this requirement though objectionable actually is quite limited this new fee can easily be avoided firms subject to it need only offer their employees a section 125 cafeteria plan and give them the opportunity to buy coverage through the new health insurance connector on a pre tax basis to escape the levy at little expense further the actual assessment is likely to be less than the statutory maximum of 295 because the other legislative provisions in the plan are designed to reduce the demand on the uncompensated care pool the regulation of health insurance massachusetts is one of the most highly regulated health care markets in the nation in particular insurers in the state s individual health insurance market have been required to provide a comprehensive standardized benefit package with little flexibility in this legislation however governor romney was able to achieve some deregulationof the health insurance market the health care reform plan achieves four regulatory changes first it allows small businesses and individuals to buy insurance through the connector which will expand coverage options especially for those in the individual market second it allows hmos to also offer hsa qualified high deductible health plans which are more affordable than other plans third it permits insurance plans offered through the connector to contract with health care providers as they choose relieving them of the costly any willing provider requirements that prevent plans from steering patients to providers that offer the best value and fourth it permits insurers to offer plans to individuals between the ages of 19 and 26 subject to fewer costly state mandates and puts a two year moratorium on any new insurance mandates while the state conducts a review of all mandated benefits the governor projects that this new flexibility could reduce average premiums for individuals from 350 to 194 per month while more deregulation is desirable with the state s political and regulatory climates romney s changes constitute significant progress the role of the connector as in many states that heavily regulate health insurance in the small group and individual markets massachusetts sets underwriting rules imposes rating restrictions and mandates the inclusion of certain services in health coverage and like other states it does little to promote choice portability or individual ownership the critical ingredients of a true consumer based health care system the cornerstone of the new plan is an innovative mechanism to promote real consumer choice the legislation creates a health insurance connector a marketplace in which individuals can shop for and buy health care coverage from competing health insurers conceptually the connector is like a stock exchange which is just a single market organizing the sale and purchase of equities and securities it is also similar broadly to the federal employee health benefit program fehbp which allows federal employees to choose from a variety of competing private health insurance plans and keep the plan of their choice if they change jobs within the federal government under the new massachusetts plan instead of picking a plan for their employees small businesses can let their employees participate in the connector and provide a cash contribution to the plan of each employee s choice individuals can also choose to use the connector all participation is voluntary the connector is not a regulatory agency it does not purchase health plans on behalf of individuals or businesses and it does it not impose a comprehensive standardized health benefit package requirement instead it is a marketplace for small businesses and individuals to purchase coverage from insurers competing for their business the connector is a new market mechanism that will enable small business employees and individuals to buy personal portable health insurance of their choice outside the place of work without losing the tax benefits afforded by federal law to employer sponsored coverage the connector is a major innovation and a model for other states conclusion states are taking the lead in health care reform and massachusetts new system includes important innovations much can and should be learned from states efforts successful health care reform in the united states is much more likely to come from such experimentation and its lessons than from imposing solutions from washington state experimentation in health care follows in the footsteps of welfare reform and embodies the benefit of federalism comprehensive health care reform is difficult especially in a divisive political environment the massachusetts plan is not perfect it contains some unwise features that reflect the state s liberal politics though these are not as damaging as they might initially appear but the plan also includes several creative policy innovations that move towards the goal of a consumer based health system and that other states should watch closely robert e moffit ph d is director of and nina owcharenko is a senior policy analyst in the center

russian president vladimir putin speaks with chinese president xi jinping before an extended format meeting of heads of the shanghai cooperation organization summit sco member states in samarkand uzbekistan september 16 2022 sputnik reuters vladimir putin infamously kept queen elizabeth ii waiting for 14 minutes during a state visit in 2003 officials at the palace were already nervous the russian president was notoriously tardy in future years showing up late to meetings with former us presidents donald trump barack obama and even keeping the pope waiting for almost an hour some believed he wouldn t dare do that to a monarch but when the delay materialised then home secretary david blunkett and his guide dog were audibly annoyed my then dog barked very loudly blunkett recalled in an interview this year when he apologised to his host the late queen s decision to break royal protocol with a six word reply captured the mood dogs have interesting instincts don t they how the tables have turned the man who often left his ex wife waiting for hours when they started dating was himself standing alone on thursday the offender was no monarch or holy see but the president of kyrgyzstan sadyr japarov the leader of the world s 142nd biggest economy isn t exactly a household name the moment was captured on camera putin awkwardly shuffling his cue cards around as he stood waiting for japarov to eventually saunter into shot if there was any doubt over putin s place in the current world order this excruciating 45 seconds proved that the russian bear is wounded russian president vladimir putin waits before a meeting with kyrgyz president sadyr japarov on the sidelines of the shanghai cooperation organization sco summit in samarkand uzbekistan september 15 2022 sputnik reuters another sign of the shifting balance of power in the region was putin s carefully worded statement ahead of his meeting with xi jinping china s premier the meeting itself was xi jinping s first foray outside china since the pandemic hit it was billed as a gathering of asia s strongmen but talks in the ancient silk road desert city of samarkand in uzbekistan left no doubt as to who was the junior partner in this relationship putin said he acknowledged chinese concerns about the kremlin s war in ukraine it was the first significant admission of differences between beijing and moscow over the conflict while he praised beijing s balanced position putin said he would explain himself on the sidelines of the meeting by contrast xi did not mention ukraine at all in his remarks stating instead that china was willing to work with russia to demonstrate the responsibility of big powers and ironically to instill stability and positive energy in a world of chaos even india which has shied away from explicitly condemning russia for the invasion spoke out narendra modi india s prime minister told putin that today s time is not a time for war and stressed the importance of democracy and diplomacy and dialogue his comments drew a response from the russian leader who said the kremlin would do our best to end this as soon as possible as the tectonic plates shift and putin suffers setbacks on the battlefield the russian leader s waning influence is clearer than ever and observers are left wondering who will rescue the russian president from this self inflicted disaster will china long a junior partner in the relationship with moscow seize this moment to make its neighbour into a vassal state axis of convenience analysts said putin s acknowledgement of frictions between the countries was telling i think what we saw was pretty clear evidence of where the balance of power within the eurasian landmass itself has shifted says maximilian hess a fellow at the foreign policy research fpr institute putin acknowledging xi s concerns which he didn t even directly vocalise himself is certainly a very clear sign that there are differences in opinion of how to approach ukraine and russia s approach to it alexander gabuev a senior fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington dc agrees that the relationship between russia and china is far from equal russia is reorienting itself to china but their relationship now is deeply asymmetric china is clearly the stronger partner that said the chinese are skillfully massaging russia s ego with their rhetoric and their broader attitudes toward each other helps china doesn t care about alexei navalny and russia doesn t care about xinjiang that provides a type of glue for their relationship that makes it more comfortable for them to talk easy or not putin has a reason to be humble the man who has vowed to only deal with friendly nations is quickly losing them moscow has also suffered setbacks in ukraine amid a lack of manpower and supply challenges several stories suggest momentum is shifting towards ukrainian counterattacks a ukrainian serviceman stands at the checkpoint near the recently retaken area of izium ukraine thursday sept 15 2022 evgeniy maloletka ap despite the bloody backdrop russia remains determined to challenge the world order a goal that it shares with its chinese counterpart a statement issued by moscow and beijing during this year s winter olympics stated their friendship was one with no limits or forbidden areas of cooperation but despite the warm words it is a relationship that foreign policy expert and independent analyst bobo lo describes as an axis of convenience it is worth remembering that relations between china and russia have not always been cordial for almost a quarter of a century the two nations were cold war adversaries with the relationship characterised by bitter quarrelling from the 1960s over borders and invasions of afghanistan and vietnam but whether or not their relationship is based on convenience or ideology both see opportunities for more trade mutual de dollarisation and an opportunity to win new customers after all china needs fuel to fire up its factories russia needs cash and technology to build its economy and both need friends but can putin s eastern pivot save the kremlin from disaster for russia where oil and gas revenues account for more than a third of the nation s budget finding a new home for the millions of barrels of oil that the eu and other countries plan to shun is a priority soaring prices helped russia earn 1bn 880m a day in the first 100 days of the war analysts at barclays say high gas prices have also helped to prop up gazprom it conservatively estimates that at 70bn the state backed energy firm has already generated more revenue this year than in the whole of 2021 which was already the most profitable for the group in recent years but sanctions have squeezed revenue streams and sources for cash are narrowing by the day russian oil going cheap russia used to supply around a third of the european union s oil imports and 40pc of its gas while oil imports have fallen more slowly the bloc s share of gas from russia has dropped from around 40pc before the war to around 20pc today partly due to russia cutting off supplies but signs of a looming cash crunch are already evident europe s pivot away from moscow has forced it to sell oil at a steep discount in asian markets in some cases depriving it of the full benefit of higher prices oil and gas revenues fell 13pc to 11 1bn last month the lowest since june 2021 the eu currently imports around 3 million barrels of oil per day from russia but the bloc s plan to stop using moscow s crude from december and all oil products from next february will have a bigger impact on russian revenues other countries are following suit iea data show that the us south korea and japan which were on average importing a million barrels of oil a day before the war have reduced purchases to almost zero today that leaves around four million barrels of oil every day without a home china india and turkey have already picked up some of the slack the three countries have increased russian imports from around 2 million barrels of oil per day before the war to more than 3 million barrels in the last few months however gabuev says there are limits to how much oil china can purchase from moscow as analysts at morgan stanley highlight russia is already the largest crude oil supplier to china accounting for around a fifth of imports over the past two months analysts say this is far above historical averages they note that even saudi arabia has not supplied more than 20pc of china s imports over a 12 month period in the last decade there s only so much black gold even china can burn other options include increasing supply to countries in africa which imports 4 million barrels per day south america which imports 1 5 million barrels and other asian nations which need 7 million barrels though with south korea and japan already shunning russian crude the last option looks unlikely courting more market share could also spark diplomatic tensions all those countries have existing suppliers from which russia would need to take market share morgan stanley analysts said in a note tiptoe through the red lines russia is also looking east to build the power of siberia 2 pipeline which is expected to run through mongolia from western russia and will power china s energy hungry economy once built around 50bn cubic meters of natural gas will run through the pipeline per year representing a third of what russia used to sell to europe russian energy minister alexander novak claims this will replace the nord stream 2 pipeline that was planned to run to germany the eastern gas pipelines have been in the works since 2006 with power of siberia 1 now up and running and china agreeing to a 30 year deal to import natural gas its successor is expected to begin building works in 2024 there s no other big market apart from china that russia can sell its gas to says gabuev so building a pipeline there is the easiest way forward he adds that the project provides a win win solution for both countries it s going to be the cheapest gas that china gets from anywhere any concern that mongolia is an unreliable partner in the project has also gone while flows of gas through the nord stream 1 pipeline are unlikely to resume any time soon barclays believes that a full cut off from europe is unlikely it believes the turkstream pipeline which runs under the black sea and delivers gas to turkey serbia and hungary can keep gazprom profitable if gas prices remain high trade ties between russia and china are also growing goods traded between the two countries surged 31pc to 117 2bn in the first eight months of 2022 according to chinese customs data that s already 80pc of last year s record total meanwhile chinese spending on russian goods soared 60pc in august compared with a year ago while its shipments to russia jumped 26pc to 8bn in august but russia remains a small part of china s trade at just 2 8pc of its total trade volume that figure is dwarfed by the eu and us william jackson chief emerging markets economist at capital economics says the importance of two of the largest trading blocs in the world means china will remain cautious when it comes to trading with moscow china is a vastly larger economy it s more integrated in the global economy it s really russia that s more dependent on china than the other way around he says chinese officials are worried about sanctions on russia and the risks that secondary sanctions could be introduced that could affect them they re not going to help russia out at the expense of their own broader interests for beijing the west is a much bigger market than russia it would be a big risk to face that threat of sanctions from the west just for the sake of continuing to do business with them gabuev says the relationship between china russia and the us is more nuanced china understands that it mustn t cross american red lines he says but the real question for them is if we throw vladimir putin under a bus does it fundamentally change our relationship with the us or will washington just pocket that win and keep up its pressure on taiwan xinjiang and intellectual property theft in short dumping russia will not result in any real improvement in relations with the us so why would they do it i think beijing will be careful not to cross any red lines but otherwise it is going to be happy exploring opportunities putin s middleman russian president vladimir putin right and turkey s president recep tayyip erdogan pose for a photo prior to their talks on the sidelines of the shanghai cooperation organisation sco summit in samarkand alexandr demyanchuk sputnik kremlin one country that hess at the fpr believes the world must keep an eye on is turkey he says ankara is providing russia with one of the biggest loopholes for the current sanctions regime since the start of the war moscow has found ways to import sanctioned goods via nations that haven t cut ties with the kremlin and turkey is one of them it has become a destination for billions of pounds more in imports from countries that aren t supposed to be trading with vladimir putin s regime gabuev notes that turkey s exports to russia have grown by 50pc since the start of the war it s also quickly becoming a middleman for luxury goods pre orders for the new iphone have more than doubled since last year notes gabuev even though apple pulled out of the country at the start of the war the price has gone up significantly though he notes from conversations with russian friends to use the russian term there s been an increase in parallel imports in english that s called smuggling many people pre order the phones to go to turkey but everyone knows the real destination is russia both hess and gabuev believe washington will need to engage in a charm offensive with turkey s president recep tayyip erdoğan to cut off this channel but they must tread carefully turkey has a lot of leverage at the moment over sweden and finland s accession to nato it also helped to broker a grain deal between russia and ukraine says gabuev istanbul turkiye august 07 a view of ship navi star carrying 33 000 tons of corn from ukraine to ireland as it is passes through the bosphorus on august 07 2022 in istanbul turkiye anadolu agency russia is going to become like iran mcdonald s has a different name but it tastes exactly the same says one analyst still based in russia the golden arches may have been dismantled but they ve been replaced with a new firm vkusno i tochka which broadly translates as delicious that s all in russian lots of people have already fled including gabuev he says friends who are still there say life is more or less normal at the moment prices are up a little bit many western brands have left but people can still go to shops in istanbul for zara and h m for the middle class nothing has changed really while russia has stopped publishing all but the most selective statistics jackson at capital economics says the economy today is also in better shape than some might have predicted russia has been drawing down its savings he says they ve returned to the domestic bond market and they ve been helped in this regard by the fact that the rouble has strengthened which means inflation has really come down a long way that allowed the central bank to lower interest rates this week to 7 5pc that means borrowing costs for the government are lower than they were a few months ago jackson adds at the same time we ve seen a surge in energy prices russia s been in quite a strong position so even though it has defaulted on its foreign bonds there s little to worry about on the fiscal side at the moment capital economics also highlights that russia didn t often issue debt on international markets anyway the outstanding value of its foreign exchange bonds amounted to 37bn which it says is comparable to chile and the philippines looking ahead goldman sachs notes that russia is also increasingly issuing debt in chinese yuan liquidity in the yuan market recently overtook that of the dollar market while some companies including aluminium giant rusal and polyus russia s largest gold miner are already issuing yuan denominated debt this is likely to be followed by the sovereign goldman said in a note but gabuev says pain is coming as are fundamental changes to russia s economy sanctions will take time the real pain is a year from now when the eu shuns russian energy and a price cap takes effect we are currently in month eight a shortage of parts due to sanctions is also expected to hit the economy more russia currently makes cars without basic safety features like airbags and anti lock braking systems in order to keep local production going you ll have to be a formula 1 driver just to go to the shops says one russian analyst gabuev says these problems will mount up russia is behind on making cutting edge semiconductors by between ten and 15 years according to some reports but i think that s optimistic the lag could be more like 30 years so either they smuggle them in or wait until china catches up with the technology either way it will take years so what does that mean for consumers and the wider economy russia is going to become like iran says gabuev think about what technology was like in the 1990s when cars and electronics were made before the era of modern chips we re going to see more patchwork solutions maybe we ll see more walkmans he jokes for hess the endgame is near russia is going from an autocratic market economy to an autarky with the trappings of a market economy but it isn t one at all because the state will continue to dominate he says it s going to look more like north korea or turkmenistan even though russia is larger and has more

president joe biden arrived in london to pay his respects to queen elizabeth ii at a time of transition in u s u k relations as both a new monarch and a new prime minister are settling in the hawkish approach of prime minister liz truss to russia and china puts her on the same page as biden but the rise of truss 47 who once called the relationship special but not exclusive could mark a decidedly new chapter in the trans atlantic partnership on trade and more of high concern for biden officials in the early going of truss s premiership is her backing of legislation that would shred parts of the post brexit trading arrangements in northern ireland analysts say the move could cause deep strain between the u k and the european union and undermine peace in northern ireland white house press secretary karine jean pierre said the move would not create a conducive environment for crafting a long awaited u s uk trade deal coveted by truss and her conservative party she s signaled that she s willing to go to the mattresses on this and that s going to cause a rift not just between the u k and eu but the uk and the u s said max bergmann director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and a former senior state department official in the obama administration it s one that s going to keep the white house up at night biden arrived in london late saturday and had been set to meet with truss on sunday but the prime minister s office said saturday they would skip the weekend hello opting instead for a meeting in new york at the u n general assembly on wednesday though truss still planned to gather with other world leaders converging on london for the royal funeral the white house confirmed the u n meeting just as the president boarded air force one the two close allies now find themselves in a period of political uncertainty on both sides of the atlantic not unlike his fellow septuagenarian biden king charles iii faces questions from the public about whether his age will limit his ability to faithfully carry out the duties of the monarch charles 73 and biden 79 discussed global cooperation on the climate crisis last year while both attended a summit in glasgow scotland they also met at buckingham palace in june 2021 at a reception the queen hosted before a world leaders summit in cornwall truss finds herself as biden does facing questions about whether she has what it takes to lift a country battered by stubborn inflation borne out of the coronavirus pandemic and exacerbated by russia s invasion of ukraine unleashing chaos on the global energy market all the while britain and the rest of europe is carefully watching to see what the upcoming u s midterm elections will bring for the democratic american president after he vowed upon taking office that america is back to being a full partner in the international community after four years of republican donald trump pushing his america first worldview it certainly is a time of change and transformation in the u k said barbara a perry presidential studies director at the university of virginia s miller center she added we don t know what will happen in our midterms we don t know what will happen in 2024 truss a former accountant who was first elected to parliament in 2010 hasn t had much interaction with biden the u s president called her earlier this month to congratulate her truss as foreign secretary accompanied her predecessor boris johnson on a white house visit last year it s been more than 75 years since winston churchill declared there was a special relationship between the two nations a notion that leaders on both sides have repeatedly affirmed still there have been bumps along the way tony blair was derisively branded by the british tabloids as george w bush s poodle for backing the 2003 american led invasion of iraq david cameron and barack obama had a bromance but obama also had his frustrations with the brits over defense spending and the u k s handling of libya following the 2011 ouster of muammar gaddafi margaret thatcher and ronald reagan forged a close alliance in the midst of the cold war with the prime minister once telling students that the republican president s really good sense of humor helped their relationship but there were difficulties too such as when thatcher and members of her cabinet bristled at the reagan administration s initial neutrality in the falklands war the white house wasn t expecting truss s announcement in may when she was foreign secretary that the government would move forward with legislation that would rewrite parts of the northern ireland protocol the agreement was part of the u k s 2020 brexit withdrawal from the eu that was designed to avoid a hard north south border with ireland that might upset northern ireland s fragile peace now in the first weeks of truss s premiership biden administration officials are carefully taking the measure of the new british leader analysts say there is some trepidation in the administration that undercutting the northern ireland protocol could plunge europe into trade turmoil at a moment when biden is working mightily to keep the west unified in confronting russia over its aggression against ukraine brexit could once again become the issue the issue that can make it difficult for all of europe to work together at a time when it is critical for europe to work together bergmann said if you re the biden administration this is not the time for the two of your closest partners getting into fights to be certain there were areas of friction between biden and johnson who had a warm rapport with former president donald trump biden staunchly opposed brexit as a candidate and had expressed great concern over the future of northern ireland biden once even derided johnson as a physical and emotional clone of trump johnson worked hard to overcome that impression stressing his common ground with biden on climate change support for international institutions and most notably by making certain britain was an early and generous member of the u s led alliance providing economic and military assistance to ukraine in the aftermath of the russian invasion the former prime minister also unsuccessfully pressed biden starting days into his administration to begin negotiations on a new u s u k trade deal just as the u k regained control over its national trade policy weeks before biden took office and following the end of a post brexit transition period but biden largely kept focus on his domestic to do list in the early going of his presidency passing trillions in spending on coronavirus relief infrastructure and more and put negotiations on trade deals on the back burner elliot abrams chairman of the conservative foreign policy group vandenberg coalition said that truss needs biden to make a new u s u k trade deal a priority queen elizabeth s funeral won t be the setting for tough bilateral conversations but it still marks a moment for the two leaders to begin taking stock of each other truss who succeeded johnson after he was forced to resign in the face of a string of scandals has lagged in the opinion polls she also won her election with a smaller margin than her recent predecessors and is looking for an early win i think if i were truss i want recognition of the leading role britain s played far more than any other country outside the united states in supporting ukraine said abrams who served in senior national security and foreign policy roles in the trump george w bush and reagan administrations and i think i d want some positive economic message to give the british people which could be that the free trade agreement negotiations are starting madhani reported from

i speak to the topic from consumption to production the role of special ago industrial processing zones in nigeria let me begin with a quote from my book published in 2017 bearing this title from consumption to production if a society spends one hundred dollars to manufacture a product within its borders the money that is used to pay for materials labor and other costs moves through the economy as each recipient spends it due to this multiplier effect a hundred dollars worth of primary production can add several hundred dollars to the gross national product gnp of that country if money is spent in another country circulation of that money is within the exporting country this is the reason an industrialized product exporting commodity importing country is wealthy and an undeveloped product importing commodity exporting country is poor developed countries grow rich by selling capital intensive thus cheap products for a high price and buying labor intensive thus expensive products for a low price this imbalance of trade expands the gap between rich and poor the wealthy sell products to be consumed not tools to produce this maintains the monopolization of the tools of production and assures a continued market for their product i submit that centralto our economic growth crisis is the failure to achieve rapid industrialization the mis management of our investment in the acquisition of necessary capital stock capital stock is the plant equipment and other assets that help with production the country s investment portfolio will reveal huge amounts budgeted to purchase plants and equipment for example refineries iron and steel sugar refining fertilizers and so on what has also become clear is that unlike countries where rising capital stock has led to rising living standards and high productivity we have remained a non industrialized underdeveloped country tied closely to industrialization but not always connected in public discourse is arguably the most challenging economic issues faced by the country currently balance of payment and foreign exchange crises what we see manifesting as shortage of foreign exchange and the precipitous decline of the national currency is in large part because we consume high value products that we do not produce and export low value raw materials nigerians especially urban elites have developed an appetite for imports including expensive luxury goods such as automobiles foreign drinks and clothes electronic and household consumer goods for example the country s top imports are refined petroleum 7 75billion cars 3 03billion wheat 2 15b packaged medicaments 1 38b telephones 771m andspecial purpose ships 4 billion in contrast what does nigeria export coconuts cashews cocoa beans rough wood petroleum gas and crude petroleum thataccounts for 70 8 of all its exports among others additionally for a country to sustain economic progress it must build infrastructure acquire factory facilitiesfor manufacturing such infrastructure includesbridges railways highways power plants dams airports and others which are intermediate and capital goods we manufacture almost none locally all are imported as demand grows for imports the more the pressure on foreign exchange where does the dollar revenue come from crude oil and paltry raw materials export that is not near enough we are in a situation of accelerating deficit size and where the balance has to be covered by foreign loans the country then finds itself in an encircling debt crisis there are two common sources of financing import bills the first is to attract foreign capital concessional loans or grants the second is to earn foreign exchange through export of goods and services especially manufactured goods no nation can survive an indefinite foreign exchange crisis therefore the most effective strategy for rapid growth is to promote the sustained expansion of foreign exchange earnings through exports of manufactures to overcome the bop in the long run and grow the economy at a fast rate we must counter import expansion with faster export earnings more precisely export of processed and manufactured products we have long shortchanged ourselves exporting raw materials that others use as basis for wealth generation i have brought the above into this discourse to establish the inescapable nexus of manufacturing capability and a nation s balance of payment the assured way that nations achieved growth in the long run is by either a making its locally manufactured goods competitive in the external markets with attendant foreign exchange earnings increasing the income elasticity of exports and b making foreign goods less competitive and non attractive to domestic consumers decreasing the income elasticity of imports currently nigeria is not fulfilling either condition due to the weak domestic technological and industrial capabilities of local companies 2 0 reliance on short term crude export has stoked balance of payment crisis the pathology of oil dependency and the periodic crash of oil prices transmit its impact through slow economic growth constrained fiscal space and through direct effects on prices and activity for both importers and exporters it channels its indirect effects via trade and other commodity markets monetary and fiscal policy responses and investment uncertainty through these channels oil prices have immediate repercussions for example the damaging inflation nigeria is experiencing began and increased steadily throughout 2020 it accelerated from 15 7 year on year in december to 17 3 in february 2021 its highest level since april 2017 according to the nbs urban inflation rose to 19 09 and rural inflation hit 18 13 in june 2022 the surge in food prices persisted ever since the pandemic compounded by domestic security problems the country s lack of food securityand was capped by the ukraine russia war meanwhile the national currency weakens leading to foreign exchange restrictions nigeria has relied on the trading and export of crude petroleum and agricultural raw materials for decades however the reliance on the easy path or easy money has proven to be a disastrous strategy nigeria s production and export structure has remained less diversified relative to comparators 3 0 the remarkable rise of china as contrast to nigeria forty four years ago china s per capita income was only one third of that of sub saharan africa today china is the world s largest manufacturing powerhouse it is a production not a consumption nation this is why china s yearly exports 3 3 trillion 2021 mostly manufactures surpassed the combined gdp of all african nations 2 7 trillion 2021 it produces nearly 50 of the world s major industrial goods including crude steel 50 of global supply cement 60 of the world s production coal 50 of the world s production vehicles more than 25 of global supply and industrial patent applications about 150 of the u s level china is also the world s largest producer of ships high speed trains robots tunnels bridges highways chemical fibers machine tools computers and cellphones among others the remarkable rise of china follows that of other successful asian manufacturing powerhouses such as south korea their growth evolution showed that economic growth happens on the back of expanded manufactured exports exports is prerequisite for a sustainable current account balance compatible with the fast rate of economic growth the trends for primary commodity prices and their low income elasticities of demand suggest that african countries including nigeria will not achieve prosperity from export earnings from these goods as they have done for decades one cannot but agree with a great scholar who said first the only way for a country to develop is to industrialize second the only way for a country to industrialize is to protect itself and third anyone who says otherwise is being dishonest the nigerian economy remains agrarian in nature it continues to face heavy barriers including those within international systems in achieving industrialization as implicit in nicholas kaldor s laws the promotion of long term economic growth requires industrialization the faster the expansion of industry in a country the greater its long run growth kaldor s proposition is explicit that the faster the overall rate of growth of manufacturing the greater the rate of export earnings second law the faster the rate of growth of manufacturing production the faster the rate of growth of the economy as a whole 4 0 a hostile industrial ecosystem for companies and business enterprises the source of growth and locus of wealth is the factory level of its firms and business enterprises wealthy nations process their god given resources including crude petroleum they nurture strong companies driven by good governance compare nigeria s nnpc and saudi s aramco the nigerian company has four refineries according to opec the country exported 27 73bn worth of petroleum products in 2020 while the value of the country s petroleum imports in 2020 was 71 285bn the country has an installed refining capacity of 445 000 barrels per day from four 4 refineries that refined zero barrels of oil in 2020 2021 because the refineries have broken down and are inoperable saudi aramco s refining capacity is 5 4 million barrels per day 860 000 m3 d on 11th may 2022 saudi aramco became the largest most valuable company in the world by market cap surpassing apple inc saudi aramco operates the world s largest single hydrocarbon network the master gas system its net income in 2021 was us 109 385 billion while total assets was us 331 818 billion another example the textile and ready made garments industry in nigeria tells a story of arrested development and of lost glory once a vibrant and dynamic sector in nigeria the sector exported to countries in the african region it achieved an annual growth rate of about 70 percent and constituted 25 of the manufacturing sector s labor force of over one million workers between 1960 and the late 1980s there were around 115 factories across the cotton textile and garments ctg value chain which engaged in several stages of the value chain such as spinning weaving and garment production in 1980 the nigerian textile manufacturing capacity was valued at n420 billion and investment worth of us 3 billion in 1999 by 2007 nigeria had only 26 textile and ready made garment rmg companies in operation with employment of roughly only 24 000 people the near demise of the industry in nigeria coincided with the rise of asian producers including china china s export value of rmg was approximately us 266 41 billion in 2020 specifically a dual process occurred the growth of chinese imports combined with massive influx of chinese company representatives to nigeria while nigerian traders flocked to china to import garments and textiles into nigeria there were by 2008 50 000 chinese textiles personnel in nigeria and 20 000 nigerians in china in 1972 the world bank approximated the gross domestic product gdp of bangladesh at us 6 29 billion it grew to us 368 billion by 2021 with us 46 billion of that generated by exports and 82 of which was ready made garments in the year 2016 2017 the rmg industry generated us 28 14 billion which was 80 7 of the total export earnings in exports and 12 36 percent of the gdp the industry nigeria swapped its rmg production nation status for a consumption nation status the country engaged in a race to the bottom ladder of poor nations when it s reliance on crude oil became a pathology 5 0 self inflicted de industrialization and slow structural transformation the structure of nigeria s economy for most of the past decades has remained largely skewed to low productivity agriculture sector the sector contributed most to nominal output when compared to the industry and services sectors in periods 1960 to 2022 the output contribution of the industrial sector consistently declined on the average from 15 6 between the period 1971 1980 to 5 7 and remains under 10 until now this trend suggests that nigeria has experienced a process of premature de industrialization since the 1970s in addition the trend depicts that structural transformation of the economy is slow or non existent by contrast the sectoral contribution of services to nominal output has been on the rise for over three decades the service sector contributed an average of 24 3 in 1981 1990 and rose to 29 5 in the 2000s in sum nigeria embarked on a path to industrialize but totally derailed and got into a cycle of premature de industrialization until the present time in other words thepremature deindustrialization that we see in nigeria has nothing to do with a fundamental decline in the significance of manufacturing as an engine of growth i attribute the failure of industrialization to the country s specific governance and leadership shortcomings it is the mismanagement of capital stock investment and the waste of the stock through inoperability like refineries fertilizer plants and in the extreme creation of white elephant junk yards our enormous investments in capital stock have sadly disappeared into black holes of private pockets or have degraded into the forest of white elephants this is why we are in large part a consumption rather than a production nation 6 0 the dissipative forces of white elephant projects as one writer remarked nigeria has become the world s junkyard of abandoned projects worth billions of naira it is staggering in its impact and befuddling to imagine the widespread nature and magnitude of project abandonment several years ago the federal government appointed a former minister of works general kotangora to lead an assessment of abandoned projects according to his report at the time therewere an estimated 4 000 uncompleted or abandoned projects belonging to the federal government with an estimated cost of n300 billion which would take 30 years to complete given the execution capacity of government the impact of these failed projects has been clearly irreversible in terms industrial and financial lossesand human resources irretrievably wasted almost two decades after this report in 2011 the report of the presidential projects assessment committee ppac showed that the federal government had spent over n7 78 trillion on 11 886 ongoing and abandoned projects nationwide as at june 2011 the report singled out ajaokuta steel complex started over 30 years earlier on the sum of us 4 5 billion was spent this is a classical white elephant lying waste the committee in their report stated that the actual number of ongoing federal projects could be 20 higher than the reported 11 886 similarly the total sum expended on the projects could surpass the n7 78 trillion contained in the report to the neighborhood of n8 trillion 7 0 what can we learn from dynamic industrializers china s modernization started in 1978 under its leader deng xiaoping the keys to his approach were 1 maintain political stability at all costs 2 focus on the grassroots bottom up reforms starting in agriculture instead of in the financial sector 3 promote rural industries despite their primitive technologies 4 produce manufactured goods instead of only natural resources 5 provide enormous government support for infrastructure buildup follow a dual track system of government private ownership instead of wholesale privatization and 6 move up the industrial ladder from light to heavy industries from labor to capital intensive production from manufacturing to financial capitalism and from a high saving state to a consumeristic welfare state china s strategy mimics the historical sequence of the british industrial revolution despite dramatic differences in political institutions the 1988 1998 period was china s first industrial revolution this phase featured mass production of labor intensive light consumer goods across china s rural and urban areas relying first mainly on imported machinery during this period china became the world s largest producer and exporter of textiles the largest producer and importer of cotton and the largest producer and exporter of furniture and toys special economic zones as industrial policy tool one of the most important pillars of deng s push to modernize china involved the reopening and integration into the global system to fast track china s economy deng adopted an export led model of development that had worked for japan and some of the asian tigers namely taiwan and the republic of korea the industrial organization model he chose was the establishment of special economic zones sezs the institutional reforms include significantly reducing state regulation and tax rates by these zones were able to attract foreign firms to do business in china generate exports and earn foreign exchange the more long term objective is to acquire firsthand technical skills business management production engineering and work organization from western enterprises the experiment that took place in the four initially opened sezs had mixed outcomes with shenzhen serving as the prime example of the successes possible under the sez model sezs have contributed 22 of china s gdp 45 of the country s total national foreign direct investment and 60 of exports sezs are estimated to have created over 30 million jobs increased the income of participating farmers by 30 and accelerated industrialization agricultural modernization and urbanization clearly the numerous special economic zones sezs and industrial clusters that emerged after the country s reforms are without doubt two important engines of china s remarkable development there were nearly 5 400 sezs in 2019 more than 1 000 of which were established in previous five years in china the sezs and industrial clusters have made crucial contributions to china s economic success foremost the sezs especially the first several successfully tested the market economy and new institutions and became role models for the rest of the country to follow together with the numerous industrial clusters the sezs have contributed significantly to national gdp employment exports and attraction of foreign investment the sezs have also played important roles in bringing new technologies to china and in adopting modern management practices in 2010 foreign multinationals accounted for two thirds of value added in high tech production in china for 55 of total exports and 90 of high tech exports 8 0 why special agro industrial processing zones sapzs six characteristics and functions economies that have most successfully achieved rapid industrial development through the use of sezs underscore that zones are not only an investment but first and foremost an industrial policy tool agro industrial sector is the largest industrial globally worth over 8 trillion dollars compared with it iron and steel among others worth 1 trillion dollars let me outline six characteristics and functions of sapzs sapz is an instrument of economic and industrialization strategy the african development bank defines the special agro industrial processing zones as an integrated demand and supply side agro industrial ecosystem comprising production processing distribution marketing with a continental and global reach aimed at transforming africa s agriculture from an incremental existential mode into a business industrial complex the sapz has its origin in the bank s staple crops processing zones scpz initiative which was launched as a flagship programme under the feed africa strategy the bank conceptualizes the original scpz as an agro based spatial development initiative advanced to agglomerate agro processing activities within areas of high agricultural potential with the aim to boost productivity and integrate production processing and marketing of selected commodities the sapz which can be applied to the full range of agricultural production activities as recognized by the fao i e crops livestock fisheries and forestry is a unique spatial brand of the afdb that is designed to achieve the twin objectives of agricultural transformation and rural development through agro industrialization sapz is a spatial solution for rural transformation and sustainable urbanization the afdb envisages that the location of sapzs in rural areas would provide spatial solutions to the challenges of uneven economic geography posed by rural underdevelopment and to stem rural urban migration in african countries african urbanization is occurring as the fastest but unsustainable rate in the world half of the continent s total population will be living in urban areas by 2030 this will pose more development challenges for the continent s already overburdened infrastructure transportation and housing in cities the location of sapzs with attendant improved infrastructure especially roads and public utility and employment opportunities associated with such zone activities provide the foundation for transforming rural poles of poverty to zones of prosperity the location of agribusiness agglomerations in large geographical areas as implied in the sapz model can serve as a catalyst for the growth of secondary or intermediary towns cities to modernize the rural landscape sapz spatial clustering and agglomeration is an industrial policy instrument we design the sapz model as an appropriate and prioritized industrial policy in the context of the wider development process as a variety of special economic zones it stimulates the clustering of economic actors such as firms and farms within the desired geographic space it combines attributes of sezs and free trade zones ftzs which include logistics and warehousing services in addition to agriculture transformation centres atcs deliberately located within farming communities in development terms an sapz as an industrial policy strategy is designed to fast track structural transformation by modernizing farming techniques technologies and traditional practices of the agrarian sector agglomeration and clustering in space which countries have deployed to great effect enhances productivity and economic efficiency asia has 75 of all special economic zones sezs in the world as at 2018 out of which china alone had over 2 500 china alone hosts over half of all sezs in the world for example vietnam has major concentrations of economic activity in its two economic centers hanoi and ho chi minh city which collectively account for more than 60 of the country s gross domestic product vietnam has 376 industrial parks the most prevalent instrument for manufacturing and industrial growth in asia vietnam in the past two decades emerged as a global leader in agribusiness and a top exporter in several commodities and products that are important in nigeria s agribusiness sector in 2019 vietnam generated export earnings of at least us 3 billion from each of the following commodities cashew nuts rice cassava fish coffee tea black pepper and rubber resulting in total agricultural export revenue of us 40 billion these eight value chains have experienced strong export growth founded on productivity growth in on farm and off farm segments and improved coordination of investments across the value chains access to remunerative export markets has generated broad based gains in the incomes of farmers and higher returns for agribusinesses thus increasing foreign exchange earnings and public revenues south korean government aggressively pursued an economic development strategy with a central focus on manufacturing sector growth driven byindustrial complexes more than 900 industrial clusters account for 62 of the country is manufacturing production and 80 per cent of total exports the path of industrial development in south korea revolved around building industrial complexes and clusters scattered across the country and it initiated the measures and policies that enabled industrialization these industrial complexes have as a result as of the end of 2018 a total of 1 207 industrial complexes had been built in south korea forty four national industrial complexes 664 regional general industrial complexes twenty seven metropolitan high tech complexes and 472 agricultural and industrial complexes been the backbone of korean industrialization these 472 agro industrial parks constitute 40 total the sapz programme stimulates investment in infrastructure although agriculture in africa is predominantly a private sector business its success is likely to be determined by targeted public investment in physical infrastructure and human capital development and adequate capacity of government institutions for regulation of private investments such as sapz type projects improved physical and institutional infrastructure especially roads and energy and logistic services and aggregation that facilitates transition to value addition activities through agro industrialization represent important drivers of agricultural transformation sapz as a catalyst for private sector development the afdb identified the private sector as a key partner in mobilizing investment for the development and implementation of sapzs the bank has traditionally supported private sector development in africa because of the sector s potential to drive and sustain economic growth in complement with public sector efforts in the case of the sapz model the private sector is likely to be the main source of strategic investments to finance agro industrial processing activities the afdb envisages that the participation of the private sector in the operation and management of sapz activities will include both foreign and domestic private investments comprising a mix of large medium and small scale investors evidently local micro and small enterprises mses would be involved in the operation of sapzs sapz as a strategy for human capital development growth and shift in the structure of agricultural production beyond the agrarian level requires higher skills and knowledge the transformation of the sector would contribute to rising labour productivity and the creation of new employment opportunities a major challenge with respect to the deployment of sapzs concerns skills development and upgrading across the agriculture and agro industrial value chains in addition to measures to increase labour productivity effective labour market planning must consider the requirements for the implementation of sapzs this isin the sense of supporting skills formation and entrepreneurship training needed for putting labour to productive use in agriculture and agribusiness as i end this lecture i emphasize the need for deeper involvement of engineering professionalsin national development plans it is a great misunderstanding to hold the view that what happens for example at a country s central bank necessarily alone determines the country s economic growth according to michael best commenting on america s war time endeavor both fiscal and monetary policies were involved but they were subservient to the transformation of the nation s productive structures factories and laboratories the massive increase in federal r d funding during world war ii laid the institutional foundation of the s t infrastructure that enabled the emergence and postwar of america s regional innovation system best 2018 pg 7 8 my emphasis today is on the need to strategically promote the buildingof industrial technological capabilities for manufactured exports invest more in infrastructure and institutions that foster ease of doing business the factory of national firms is the furnace where long term fortunes are formed the wealthiest nations are the ones with the strongest industrial capacities the united states has 12 85 million manufacturing jobs employing 8 5 of the workforce manufacturers contribute over us 2 3 trillion to the economy of the united states every quarter over 9 trillion every year china leads the world in terms of manufacturing output with over us 2 01 trillion in output manufacturing constitutes 27 of china s overall national output which accounts for 20 percent of the world s manufacturing output germany italy turkey and south korea have the highest percentage of their workforce employed in manufacturing how do we move forward the summary of this paper is that behind the wide and terrifyingly widening wealth gap between developed production nations and poor meaning consumption nations like nigeria is the huge gap in scientific and technological knowledge to produce and sell to others if crude oil was the basis of wealth nigeria will not be too far down the prosperity ladder yet we are sadly among the poorest on earth rich nations on the one hand have a long history of producing learningfrom their mistakes and selling to consumption nations a poor nation on the other possess enormous natural resources but lag far behind in the technological knowledge necessary to transform their natural endowment to high value goods first we need elite agreement an intent that this country must develop south korea china and other asian nations achieved a high degree of industrialization and sustained growth over four to five decades nigeria remains relatively an underdeveloped consumption nation the examples i reference demonstrate clearly how the agenda mindset and policies of the political elite made up of politicians bureaucrats and the private sector have exerted an extreme impact on the economies of their society the dramatic economic extremes in income divergence highlights the impact ruling elites and leaders can have in the economic welfare of states second you hear industry people say that venturing into the manufacturing industry in nigeria requires a lion heart due to dysfunctional infrastructure corruption and rent seeking at ports airports government offices and so on there is a long list of challenges finance infrastructure electric power skilled work force exchange rate complex and difficult destabilizing bureaucracy dependence on imported technology and machines local manufacturing companies these are surmountable challenges why are these so hard to achieve if not for vested and self interests that come before public interest third nigeria promoted industrialization after gaining political independence we have not sustained the momentum in fact nigerian politicians and bureaucrats over the last five decades are complicit in truncating the

higher inflation has led to higher bond rates which in turn leads to falling bond prices sharply higher interest rates and inflation have increased market volatility and infected most sectors of the stockmarket but rising bond rates specifically corporate bond rates has led pension fund actuaries to meaningfully lower their calculations of the value of the future liabilities owed to members of their schemes corporate bond yields are used as the discount rate to work out the present value and the further out into the future the payment is due the more sensitive its value is to changes in the applied rate the net result of surging corporate bond yields has been a dramatic reduction in the liabilities owed by these defined benefit schemes to their members there is real world logic to this math if a corporate bond is paying a sufficiently high return so that a pension fund can buy it rather than invest in a riskier asset such as equities then there s a higher likelihood of meeting the liability when it comes due advertisement what all of this means is that pension funds are now highly incentivised to de risk and switch more assets out of higher risk asset classes and into low risk ones such as government and corporate bonds by doing so they can match assets to liabilities and reduce much of the anxiety that they ll fall short of what has been promised to pension holders there does appear to be evidence this is occurring as some listed fund managers have reported a trend of equity de risking this has as much to do with attempting to flee the volatility of share market as it does being lured by the higher nominal returns from fixed income the driving force of financialisation the influence of pension funds on global markets should not be under estimated some believe the advent of the pension fund is what kick started an era of financialisation accelerating the growth of global sharemarkets so these shifts in incentives are worth monitoring at present the world s top 300 pension funds account for us23 6 trillion of assets according to wtw s thinking ahead institute advertisement about two thirds of those assets are in defined benefit schemes north america also accounts for just under half of total pension assets while europe and asia pacific account for a quarter each about 55 per cent of assets is invested in equities 31 per cent in bonds and about 15 per cent in alternative assets somewhat surprisingly north american pension funds have a modest 16 per cent invested in bonds ironically where bond yields have near or even below zero such as japan and europe the allocation to bonds is much higher australia of course has its own large pool of pension assets as our superannuation system has swelled to 3 4 trillion and will continue to grow but the total market is still dominated by large us european and asian pension assets australia accounts for 4 2 per cent of the pool managed by the top 300 pension funds for some context nokia usa s corporate pension fund is about the same size at hostplus at us45 billion australiansuper is the largest of the local pension funds and just sneaks into the thinking institute s top 20 list ranking behind seven us pension giants such as calpers calsters and texas teachers the distinction of australia s pension system is that it is dominated by defined contribution funds in which there is no promised future pay out to members this some believe is why australian funds tend to have a more aggressive asset allocation compared to peers as they re free of the burden of a liability but it could be argued that both types of pension funds solve for same issue to accumulate enough assets to finance a retirement whilst taking the least amount of risk so there s no reason why a global shift of pension savings from risky volatile stocks into safer high yielding assets won t manifest itself in australia

london president joe biden arrived in london to pay his respects to queen elizabeth ii at a time of transition in relations between the u s and u k as a new monarch and prime minister are settling in the hawkish approach of prime minister liz truss to russia and china puts her on the same page as biden but the rise of truss 47 who once called the relationship special but not exclusive could mark a decidedly new chapter in the trans atlantic partnership on trade and more biden arrived saturday in london and had been set to meet today with truss but the prime minister s office said saturday they would skip the weekend hello instead they will meet wednesday in new york at the u n general assembly her office said though truss still planned to gather with other world leaders converging on london for the royal funeral the white house confirmed the u n meeting just as the president boarded air force one of high concern for biden officials in the early going of truss premiership is her backing of legislation that would shred parts of the post brexit trading arrangements in northern ireland analysts say the move could cause deep strain between the u k and the european union and undermine peace in northern ireland white house press secretary karine jean pierre said the move would not create a conducive environment for crafting a long awaited u s uk trade deal coveted by truss and her conservative party she s signaled that she s willing to go to the mattresses on this and that s going to cause a rift not just between the u k and eu but the u k and the u s said max bergmann director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and a former senior state department official in the obama administration it s one that s going to keep the white house up at night the two close allies now find themselves in a period of political uncertainty on both sides of the atlantic like biden king charles iii faces questions from the public about whether his age will limit his ability to faithfully carry out the duties of the monarch charles 73 and biden 79 discussed global cooperation on the climate crisis last year while both attended a summit in glasgow scotland they also met at buckingham palace in june 2021 at a reception the queen hosted before a world leaders summit in cornwall truss finds herself as biden does facing questions about whether she has what it takes to lift a country battered by stubborn inflation borne out of the coronavirus pandemic and exacerbated by russia s invasion of ukraine unleashing chaos on the global energy market all the while britain and the rest of europe is carefully watching to see what the upcoming u s midterm elections will bring for the democratic american president after he vowed upon taking office that america is back to being a full partner in the international community after four years of republican donald trump pushing his america first worldview it certainly is a time of change and transformation in the u k said barbara perry presidential studies director at the university of virginia s miller center she added we don t know what will happen in our midterms we don t know what will happen in 2024 truss a former accountant who was first elected to parliament in 2010 hasn t had much interaction with biden the u s president called her earlier this month to congratulate her truss as foreign secretary accompanied her predecessor boris johnson on a white house visit last year bumps along the way it s been more than 75 years since winston churchill declared there was a special relationship between the two nations a notion that leaders on both sides have repeatedly affirmed still there have been bumps along the way tony blair was derisively branded by the british tabloids as george w bush s poodle for backing the 2003 american led invasion of iraq david cameron and barack obama had a bromance but obama also had his frustrations with the brits over defense spending and the u k s handling of libya after the 2011 ouster of muammar gaddafi margaret thatcher and ronald reagan forged a close alliance in the midst of the cold war with the prime minister once telling students that the republican president s really good sense of humor helped their relationship but there were difficulties too such as when thatcher and members of her cabinet bristled at the reagan administration s initial neutrality in the falklands war the white house wasn t expecting truss s announcement in may when she was foreign secretary that the government would move forward with legislation that would rewrite parts of the northern ireland protocol the agreement was part of the u k s 2020 brexit withdrawal from the eu that was designed to avoid a hard north south border with ireland that might upset northern ireland s fragile peace now in the first weeks of truss premiership biden administration officials are carefully taking the measure of the new british leader analysts say there is some trepidation in the administration that undercutting the northern ireland protocol could plunge europe into trade turmoil at a moment when biden is working mightily to keep the west unified in confronting russia over its aggression against ukraine brexit could once again become the issue the issue that can make it difficult for all of europe to work together at a time when it is critical for europe to work together bergmann said if you re the biden administration this is not the time for the two of your closest partners getting into fights to be certain there were areas of friction between biden and johnson who had a warm rapport with former president donald trump biden staunchly opposed brexit as a candidate and had expressed great concern over the future of northern ireland biden once even derided johnson as a physical and emotional clone of trump johnson worked hard to overcome that impression stressing his common ground with biden on climate change support for international institutions and most notably by making certain britain was an early and generous member of the u s led alliance providing economic and military assistance to ukraine after the russian invasion the former prime minister also unsuccessfully pressed biden starting days into his administration to begin negotiations on a new u s u k trade deal just as the u k regained control over its national trade policy weeks before biden took office and following the end of a post brexit transition period but biden largely kept focus on his domestic to do list in the early going of his presidency passing trillions in spending on coronavirus relief infrastructure and more and put negotiations on trade deals on the back burner elliot abrams chairman of the

these oil and gas businesses have an average dividend yield of 5 8 when your hard earned money is on the line it s easy to overcomplicate an investment decision but often the simplest course of action can be effective while also letting you sleep well at night for many risk averse investors looking for a steady return the simple decision could be to turn to dividend stocks that have a good chance of growing their earnings and their payouts over time the energy industry has been home to high yield dividend stocks for years and the current imbalance of global oil and gas supply paired with rising demand and years of underinvestment adds a layer of reliability not seen in the energy industry for some time baker hughes bkr 1 81 devon energy dvn 1 39 and kinder morgan kmi 0 88 stand out as three particularly attractive oil and gas companies to consider now value investors should take a look at baker hughes lee samaha baker hughes there are two reasons to buy baker hughes the first is to take advantage of energy prices staying relatively high the second is to get in on the boost as it potentially catches up with the performance of peers such as schlumberger and halliburton the idea that energy prices particularly for oil will stay high is based on the argument that the dearth of investment since 2014 when energy prices slumped and the cautiousness currently displayed by the oil majors will restrain the growth of supply as such energy prices are likely to remain high for an extended period and not experience their historical volatility similarly the high price of oil will induce further growth in spending benefiting baker hughes the second argument relates to baker hughes underperformance relative to peers the reasons for this come down to its exposure to russia chip and component shortages due to the supply chain crisis and some disappointing execution many of these issues are likely to prove temporary and management is taking action to restructure the company and better align its businesses that should result in cost savings in the future all told baker hughes has an opportunity to play catch up with its peers and benefit from ongoing strength in its end markets hitch your passive income wagon to this high yield energy stock scott levine devon energy the energy sector is replete with oil and gas stocks that provide ample dividends to shareholders shares of devon energy for example currently offer investors a mouthwatering 8 6 dividend yield a distribution that high may have some conservative investors questioning the sustainability of the payout but a closer look at devon s recent natural gas deal as well as its financials suggests that this stock is a worthy consideration focused on onshore assets located in the u s devon energy is a leading exploration and production company earlier this month the company took a giant step in expanding the natural gas niche of its portfolio inking an agreement with delfin midstream the deal a liquefied natural gas lng export partnership has the potential to total 2 million tons annually of lng production this should translate to a healthy increase in free cash flow for devon energy an increase that can ultimately be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends as of the end of the second quarter devon energy had a net debt to ebitda ratio of 0 4 suggesting the company has taken a conservative approach to leverage placing it on secure financial footing in addition the company s 2022 free cash flow forecast of 6 5 billion suggests that the company has room to strengthen its balance sheet even further by retiring debt for those who are interested in not just growing their passive income stream but are on the prowl for a bargain opportunity devon energy s stock is particularly alluring currently shares of devon energy are trading at seven times forward earnings representing a steep discount to their five year average forward earnings multiple of 20 a high yield and growth prospects to boot daniel foelber kinder morgan just a couple of years ago pipeline and infrastructure giant kinder morgan s growth prospects looked weak capital expenditures were at a 10 year low as investors questioned the long term viability of natural gas infrastructure in an increasingly renewable world fast forward to 2022 and global shakeups in the energy industry make the reliability of natural gas more attractive than ever for energy dependent countries in europe and asia the u s is a net exporter of oil and natural gas so while domestic growth prospects remain limited there are opportunities for the u s to boost natural gas production cool and condense the gas into a liquid and then ship it to buyers around the world lower production costs opened the door to lng investment projects and now that margins are rising due to higher lng end market prices the investment thesis for lng is more attractive than ever for lng to work there needs to be a balance of natural gas production lng export terminals regasification import plants and associated pipelines for the importing countries increased natural gas demand not to mention widespread government support to boost lng imports is a boon for the u s natural gas industry the lng market is dependent on pipelines that connect production points like those in west texas or the utica shale in the appalachian basin to lng liquefaction plants as natural gas output grows there will need to be more takeaway capacity and associated storage that s where kinder morgan comes in kinder morgan remains one of the most reliable passive income sources on the market with a current dividend yield of 6 1 long term contracts make for a stable business model that generates enough cash flow to support the dividend even during downturns in the oil and gas market this reliability was put on display in 2020 when kinder morgan s business suffered only minor performance declines add it all up and you have a no brainer high yield dividend stock
you may not see these game changing stocks this cheap ever again there s little question that 2022 is set to go down as once of the most challenging years for investors on record through the first six months of the year the benchmark s p 500 produced its worst return since 1970 that doesn t happen by accident it s a function of historically high inflation persistent supply chain problems and a weakening u s economy things have been even worse for the tech centric nasdaq composite ixic 1 79 which has lost as much as 34 of its value on a peak to trough basis since hitting its closing high in november the magnitude of the nasdaq s decline has kept the widely followed index firmly entrenched in a bear market however peril on wall street often begets opportunity that s because every significant decline in the major indexes throughout history including the nasdaq composite has eventually been put into the rearview mirror by a bull market rally sometimes bear markets roll out the red carpet for patient investors and offer once in a generation buying opportunities what follows are three beaten down companies that have once in a generation buying appeal for long term investors intel the first buying opportunity you may never see again is the chance to load up on shares of semiconductor giant intel intc 1 74 below 30 to be fair intel and its semiconductor peers are facing a mountain of headwinds at the moment supply chain issues and historically high inflation are doing a number on enterprise demand meanwhile the return of workers to the office has lowered demand for personal computers pcs in spite of these challenges intel and its 5 1 dividend yield could be a phenomenal buy for patient investors to begin with rumors of intel s demise appear to be greatly exaggerated based on data compiled by mercury research for the first quarter of 2022 intel held 88 4 of server central processing unit cpu market share along with an 81 7 share of desktop pc pcus and a 77 5 share of mobile pcus excluding internet of things devices even with advanced micro devices slightly chipping away at its market share in server and mobile pcus it s evident that intel s top dog status in processors will continue to be a source of incredible cash flow for the company to add to this point businesses have been shifting data into the cloud at an accelerated pace in the wake of the covid 19 pandemic this bodes well for data center server demand for years to come another significant tailwind for intel is the recent passage of the chips and science act which president joe biden signed into law last month the chips act will provide nearly 53 billion in subsidies to chip manufacturers and designers so they can build facilities to produce and hire domestically as businesses homes and cars become more technologically dependent the need to manufacture semiconductor solutions is only going to climb that s a key impetus behind intel s 20 billion investment to build two manufacturing plants in ohio intel should also benefit from the eventual spinoff and initial public offering ipo of autonomous vehicle company mobileye even with a lowered valuation of 30 billion for its upcoming ipo this would be nearly double what intel paid for mobileye 15 3 billion five years ago mobileye s revenue hit a record 460 million up 41 in the second quarter although it s struggling mightily amid economic uncertainty now is the ideal time to pick up an absolutely dominant cash flow giant like intel on the cheap planet 13 holdings for the second once in a generation buying opportunity look no further than the u s cannabis space specifically small cap multi state operator mso planet 13 holdings plnh f which can be purchased for a little over 1 per share in february 2021 marijuana stocks were all the buzz democrats narrowly taking hold of congress following joe biden s victory in november appeared to pave the way for cannabis to be legalized at the federal level but after 20 months in the oval office biden is no closer to signing marijuana reform bills into law than was his predecessor donald trump wall street has not been happy with the lack of progress on the reform front and u s marijuana stocks have paid the price however a lack of federal reform hasn t stopped individual states from giving the green light to medical marijuana and or adult use consumption roughly three quarters of all u s states allow cannabis use in some form with favorability to marijuana steadily improving over decades federal reform is still likely sooner than later what makes planet 13 such a game changing stock to buy is its approach to expansion within the cannabis industry whereas most vertically integrated msos have attempted to plant their proverbial flags in as many legalized markets as possible planet 13 has just three operating dispensaries the thing is two of these three dispensaries are behemoths and unlike anything the cannabis industry has ever seen the company s flagship dispensary is the las vegas superstore in nevada just west of the strip this store spans 112 000 square feet that s bigger than the average walmart and offers an unrivaled selection of dried cannabis and high margin derivatives such as beverages and edibles its other large retail location is in orange county california about 15 minutes from disneyland the orange county superstore spans 55 000 square feet with 30 of this space devoted to selling these stores focus as much on the customer experience as they do on sales which is what makes them unique in addition to its superstore concept which will be expanding to chicago illinois next planet 13 holds a dispensary license in florida which will allow the company to develop an unlimited number of community based stores that total roughly 4 750 square feet once fully built out florida is on pace to be the nation s third largest market for marijuana sales by 2024 planet 13 s unique operating model makes it a no brainer buy for long term investors in the nasdaq bear market pubmatic the third once in a generation buying opportunity created by the nasdaq bear market is none other than small cap adtech stock pubmatic pubm 5 21 which can be bought for less than 20 share investors don t have to look far for evidence that advertisers have pared back their spending amid an uncertain economic environment following back to back quarters of declines in u s gross domestic product all ad driven businesses have been whacked by wall street and that includes pubmatic but as noted earlier peril begets opportunity one of the biggest factors working in favor of advertising companies like pubmatic is time even though recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle they usually last for only a couple of quarters by comparison periods of expansion are measured in years simply being patient and holding onto an adtech stock like pubmatic should allow investors to take advantage of the natural growth of the u s and global economy over time as well as the expansion of ad spending but pubmatic has more in its sails than just long term growth trends for starters it s a programmatic ad sell side platform ssp which means its job is to help publishers sell their digital display space most ssps have consolidated over time leaving few options for publishers to choose from this makes pubmatic a logical choice as businesses shift their ad dollars from print to digital to build on this point pubmatic has been growing organically at a considerably faster pace than the digital ad industry as a whole whereas the digital ad industry is expected to generate 14 annualized revenue growth through 2025 pubmatic s organic growth rate has predominantly stuck between 25 and 50 again it helps being one of the few ssps for publishers to choose from something else that really stands out about pubmatic is the company s choice to design and build its own cloud based infrastructure instead of relying on a third party to handle its programmatic ad solutions pubmatic is set to benefit from economies of scale as its revenue grows the end result should be higher operating margins than its peers if you still need more convincing consider this pubmatic ended june with 183 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities to go along with no debt pubmatic can easily weather economic downturns while continuing to reinvest in its cloud driven programmatic ad platform

these big time dividends look attractive right now stocks have been under a lot of pressure this year weighed down by rising interest rates to combat inflation if there s a silver lining to the sell off dividend yields move inversely to stock prices because of that many dividend yields are much higher right now two dividend stocks with big time yields are epr properties epr 0 66 and medical properties trust mpw 18 80 that s largely due to the sell off in their stock prices this year here s why income focused investors won t want to miss that opportunity the financial flexibility to execute its strategy shares of epr properties have tumbled more than 20 from their most recent high that pushed the real estate investment trust s reit dividend yield up to 7 7 it s more than double the reit sector s average and several times the 1 6 dividend yield on an s p 500 index fund while rising interest rates have played a role because they make it more expensive for reits to borrow money that s not the only factor weighing on epr properties stock price the other issue is that one of the experiential real estate focused reit s largest tenants cineworld group the parent company of regal cinemas filed for bankruptcy due to its large debt load and the continued effect of the pandemic on cinema attendance that has investors concerned regal might not pay rent however epr properties tends to own the industry s most profitable locations while it held 3 of the theaters in north america these locations captured 8 of the box office because of that regal will likely continue paying rent or risk losing a profitable location to another operator even if cineworld stops paying rent epr properties has plenty of cushion to maintain its big time dividend the company expects to generate 150 million of excess cash after paying its dividend this year meanwhile it has a solid investment grade balance sheet with lots of liquidity 168 million of cash and an undrawn 1 billion credit facility and no debt maturing until 2024 that gives it the financial flexibility to continue expanding its experiential real estate portfolio as it strives to diversify away from theaters it made nearly 240 million of investments during the first half of the year and planned to invest 500 million to 700 million on acquiring experiential real estate this year those deals should grow its rental income and reduce its exposure to the theater sector helping further improve the long term sustainability of its big time dividend getting a healthy dose of liquidity to continue making deals medical properties trust s stock price has plunged over 40 from its peak earlier this year that has pushed the healthcare reit s dividend yield up over 8 a big weight on the company has been the effect of rising interest rates on its ability to access capital to finance new acquisitions that s evident in the reit s revised acquisition outlook cfo steve hamner noted on the reit s second quarter conference call that we previously predicted that our 2022 acquisitions volume will be in the 1 billion to 3 billion range however hamner noted given the rapid and dramatic development in the capital markets and the global economic environment even since our last earnings call acquisitions will very likely be on the low end of that range that s a big difference for a reit that has acquired over 3 billion of real estate in each of the last couple of years with debt and equity capital more expensive medical properties has turned to capital recycling to give it the funds to make acquisitions the reit recently unveiled a series of deals that will free up 600 million of liquidity it can use to bolster its balance sheet and make accretive acquisitions those future deals should help grow its funds from operations enabling medical properties trust to continue increasing its dividend which it has done for the last eight straight years investors are also overlooking the positive effect inflation has on the company s rental income medical properties trust s leases have embedded rate escalation clauses many of which link to the inflation rate because of that the company expects its rental income to rise by 57 million or 4 4 next year that embedded rent growth can help support a higher dividend don t miss this opportunity shares of epr properties and medical properties trust have tumbled this year because of that their dividend yields have spiked to eye catching levels those payouts look safe given the liquidity both companies have to pay dividends and execute their strategic plans that makes them look like attractive buys right now that income focused investors might regret not taking advantage of in the future

environment following back to back quarters of declines in u s gross domestic product all ad driven businesses have been whacked by wall street and that includes pubmatic but as noted earlier peril begets opportunity one of the biggest factors working in favor of advertising companies like pubmatic is time even though recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle they usually last for only a couple of quarters by comparison periods of expansion are measured in years simply being patient and holding onto an adtech stock like pubmatic should allow investors to take advantage of the natural growth of the u s and global economy over time as well as the expansion of ad spending but pubmatic has more in its sails than just long term growth trends for starters it s a programmatic ad sell side platform ssp which means its job is to help publishers sell their digital display space most ssps have consolidated over time leaving few options for publishers to choose from this makes pubmatic a logical choice as businesses shift their ad dollars from print to digital to build on this point pubmatic has been growing organically at a considerably faster pace than the digital ad industry as a whole whereas the digital ad industry is expected to generate 14 annualized revenue growth through 2025 pubmatic s organic growth rate has predominantly stuck between 25 and 50 again it helps being one of the few ssps for publishers to choose from something else that really stands out about pubmatic is the company s choice to design and build its own cloud based infrastructure instead of relying on a third party to handle its programmatic ad solutions pubmatic is set to benefit from economies of scale as its revenue grows the end result should be higher operating margins than its peers if you still need more convincing consider this pubmatic ended june with 183 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities to go along with no debt pubmatic can easily weather economic downturns while continuing to reinvest in its cloud driven programmatic ad platform

anointed the godmother of plant based living by the new york times last year bestselling author frances moore lappé is a household name to many because she ushered in the modern vegetarian era with the 1971 publication of diet for a small planet quickly vaulting soy beans and veggie burgers into american kitchens and inserting the excessive land and water use of animal based foods into the national conversation if you go what frances moore lappé keynote address where common ground country fair common ground education center unity when 11 a m saturday more info mofga org the fair since its publication 51 years ago the landmark book has sold more than 3 million copies and has been reprinted and reissued many times including a 50th anniversary edition last year next weekend lappé delivers the saturday keynote address at the common ground country fair in unity when i reached lappé who goes by frankie at her home in cambridge massachusetts by phone she said she was looking forward to speaking at the vegetarian friendly fair hosted by the maine organic farmers and gardeners association which was founded the same year diet for a small planet was published this year s fair marks the common ground s return after going dark for two years because of the pandemic it brings back so many memories of the whole journey said lappé who was just 26 when her book was published the 1970s was the era of questioning and so much questioning over our relationship to the earth and to consumerism it was a great time to become an adult people were feeling empowered to change their lives they were questioning in a positive way in the forward to the original edition lappé began by telling readers this book is about protein how we as a nation are caught in a pattern that squanders it and that our heavily meat centered culture is at the very heart of our waste of the earth s productivity the book provides detailed information with considerable updates for the 50th anniversary edition about the problems created by animal agriculture along with the proposed solution of eating plant based proteins it concludes with more than 120 practical pages of vegetarian and vegan recipes and menu ideas refreshed for the most recent edition with submissions from food heavyweights including bryant terry alice waters and mark bittman diet for a small planet was a major part of the 1970s zeitgeist and it kicked off a wave of vegetarian happenings including the 1972 publication of both the vegetarian epicure by anna thomas and the george bernard shaw vegetarian cookbook by the playwright s housekeeper alice laden in 1973 lappé s publisher issued recipes for a small planet by ellen buchman ewald who introduced lappé to vegetarian cooking and helped create the recipes for lappé s book advertisement i was born in 1973 and while i was growing up in litchfield maine a copy of lappé s book was ever present in my non vegetarian childhood kitchen the same year i was born the iconic moosewood restaurant opened in ithaca new york and the following year it self published the now classic moosewood cookbook at first the moosewood restaurant served fish alongside vegetarian and vegan dishes but later transitioned to an all vegetarian and heavily vegan menu today the restaurant continues under the new ownership of danica wilcox daughter of one of the co founders in maine the influential hollow reed opened in portland s old port in 1974 and the following year town farm restaurant opened in bar harbor both relatively short lived establishments were widely viewed as vegetarian restaurants however each served aquatic animals meaning the restaurants were pescatarian but not actually vegetarian although the town farm restaurant did publish an all vegetarian cookbook in 1979 in 1975 a major vegetarian happening was the united states first ever world vegetarian congress held at the university of maine in orono all of these endeavors were bolstered by the popularity of diet for a small planet even so few anticipated that what began as a one page handout lappé distributed in the late 1960s would enjoy instant success and lasting cultural impact i thought that maybe my book would appeal to a few hundred people in the greater bay area of san francisco when i wrote it lappé said it was a big shock when it started to sell and sell in diet for a small planet lappé shows how food is wasted by the transformation of mountains of grain into much smaller quantities of animal flesh every edition has advocated for people to eat meals centered on plants both as a way to safeguard the environment and to feed the hungry soon lappé would add better democracy increased social justice and more equitable community economics to the benefits of a plant based food system advertisement democracy is the root of all solutions lappé told me we the people are not making these decisions because there is so much corruption of big agribusiness in food policy realizing how much of the american food system was shaped by the influence of money in politics lappé has worked to improve american democracy in the years since the book s initial publication she co founded the center for living democracy and has published many books on the subject most recently daring democracy with adam eichen during our conversation lappé spoke of the erosion of political rights and civil liberties in the united states during the past decade she pointed to the annual freedom in the world index which has measured the u s s slide from ranking alongside top democracies in 2010 to ranking alongside emerging democracies by 2020 freedom house which maintains the index says u s democracy is threatened by and has suffered because of inequities created by racism money in politics and extremism fueled by partisan polarization lappe s message of freedom democracy and simple plant based living is sure to resonate at the common ground fair as i wrote last year mofga has been known for its vegetarian friendly vibe since the organization s 1971 founding fair vendors serve many vegan and vegetarian eats diet for a small planet played a role in cultivating this plant based culture at mofga according to abbie mcmillen an early mofga organizer and its newspaper s first editor and roberta bailey who has written the harvest kitchen recipe column in the mofga newspaper since 1984 both told me last year that lappé s book shaped their thinking about food lappé a vegetarian herself who is trying to get herself to switch to oat milk in her morning coffee acknowledges the long list of problems facing humanity yet she remains hopeful she told me she wasn t an optimist but a possibilist advertisement the theme song of my life lappé said is the more choices we make that align ourselves with the world we want for ourselves and others the more that world builds food is a connector to everything frankie s feijoada 6 servings this recipe was one of the favorites from the first edition with updates from a brazilian friend for the 20th anniversary edition from diet for a small planet 1 4 cup oil 1 large onion chopped 2 cloves garlic minced 2 scallions white and light green

it s saturday afternoon and my tween and teenage daughters are after some brandy it s not the alcoholic tipple that they are hankering for even if their fix of choice is many parents would argue equally bad for them the brandy they desire is brandy melville a fashion outlet beloved in their circle for its comfortable sweatpants cropped t shirts and ribbed vest tops decorated with floral sprigs unless you have teens and tweens in your life it s unlikely that the label will have crossed your radar despite it having 97 stores worldwide so popular is brandy melville among nine to 15 year old girls that like madonna no full name is required it s just brandy the celebrities who wear the brand are famous enough to need no surname kendall bella gigi taylor and ariana its airy distressed wood interiors reeking of laidback californian cool make brandy melville s stores feel welcoming to everyone only they re not since at least 2012 brandy melville has only sold its flimsy crop tops skirts and dresses in one size xs s equivalent to a uk dress size two to six depending on the cut and while this sizing might be perfect for your nine or 10 year old daughter when she first discovers the brand it can be catastrophic for your older taller or wider daughter or even your petite nine year old when her allegiance keeps her coming back to buy more brandy years after puberty has set in brandy was where i bought most of my clothes from the age of about 11 remembers 16 year old molly i loved it all my friends wore it and it felt like belonging to a club girls can be really judgmental at secondary school but i felt if i wore brandy i d be safe from criticism molly s eyes well up as she continues i remember being 13 and going in to buy something nothing fitted none of the jeans would zip up and the tops were so tight they looked embarrassing my body had changed i was mortified in tears in the changing room i ate nothing for the rest of the day i felt like a big fat failure it sounds stupid now but at 13 you re too young to realise the clothes should fit you and that you shouldn t have to change your body to fit the clothes
patience can pay off handsomely for america s aged investors it s been a year to remember but in all the wrong ways the s p 500 which is often viewed as the best barometer of stock market health delivered its worst first half return since richard nixon was president to boot the technology dependent nasdaq composite which has been largely responsible for lifting the market to new highs over the past year has firmly plunged into a bear market while periods of heightened volatility and uncertainty are unnerving for all walks of investors it can be an especially trying time for retirees folks who ve hung up their work coats for good may not have the ability to deal with significant drawdowns in their principal investment but there s a silver lining amid this turmoil for retirees bear markets have a rich history of rolling out the red carpet for patient investors young and old alike every single double digit percentage decline in the major u s indexes throughout history has eventually been cleared away by a bull market rally in other words every bear market is a bona fide buying opportunity best of all retirees don t have to chase highly volatile growth stocks to generate significant returns a number of rock solid and reasonably low volatility companies are ripe for the picking right now by aged investors what follows are three perfect stocks for retirees that can turn 300 000 into 1 million by 2030 enterprise products partners the first ideal stock for retirees to buy that has the potential to generate at least a 233 total return including dividends paid by 2030 is energy stock enterprise products partners epd 1 86 admittedly the idea of investing in an oil stock might not sound palatable to retirees oil and natural gas demand fell off a cliff during the initial stages of the pandemic which sent west texas intermediate crude oil futures plunging very briefly to negative 40 barrel such historic volatility is likely still fresh in the minds of retired investors however enterprise products partners is a completely different beast and was virtually unaffected on an operating basis by the pandemic that s because it s a midstream energy company midstream providers are effectively energy middlemen that help crude oil and natural gas get from the drilling grounds to storage tanks or processing plants in enterprise product partners case it owns over 50 000 miles of transmission pipeline 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage space 19 deepwater docks and 24 natural gas processing facilities the beauty of midstream energy companies is that virtually all use fixed fee or volume based contracts structuring contracts this way removes the volatility associated with oil and natural gas price swings and makes enterprise products operating cash flow highly predictable this cash flow predictability is important as it allows the company to outlay capital for infrastructure projects and acquisitions without adversely impacting its quarterly distribution i e dividend or profitability additionally enterprise products partners distribution coverage ratio dcr never dipped below 1 6 during the worst of the covid 19 pandemic the dcr is the amount of distributable cash flow from operations relative to what was actually paid to shareholders a figure at or below 1 would signal an unsustainable payout the icing on the cake the company has increased its base annual distribution in each of the past 24 years and is currently parsing out a completely sustainable 7 1 yield alphabet a second perfect stock for retirees to buy that can turn a 300 000 initial investment into 1 million in eight years is faang stock alphabet googl 1 82 goog 1 80 the parent company of internet search engine google streaming platform youtube and autonomous vehicle company waymo among others alphabet is a great example for retirees that dividends aren t necessary to grow your nest egg while dividend stocks are typically mature time tested businesses with generally low volatility retirees can get low volatility and considerably juicier growth prospects from a company like alphabet alphabet s foundation has long been its internet search engine google looking back multiple years data from globalstats shows that google has controlled between 91 and 93 of worldwide internet search share with an 88 percentage point lead over its next closest competitor google has become a veritable monopoly and is therefore able to command strong pricing power when placing ads this competitive advantage i e cash cow operating segment isn t going anyway anytime soon but what s been really exciting is watching alphabet put its incredible cash flow from google to work in other fast growing arenas for instance youtube has become the second most visited social media site on the planet with 2 48 billion monthly active users with so many eyeballs watching videos youtube has delivered solid subscription growth and is pacing nearly 30 billion in annual run rate revenue from ads alphabet s investments in google cloud should begin paying dividends sooner than later as well though we re still in the very early innings of cloud service growth google cloud has snatched up 8 of global cloud spending according to a second quarter report by canalys although this is a money losing segment for the moment the high margins associated with cloud services should play a role in helping alphabet double its operating cash flow over the next four years in case these competitive advantages aren t enough consider that alphabet is cheaper now than it s ever been as a publicly traded company a forward year price to earnings multiple of less than 18 it s rare that investors can find such a high quality company with such a reasonably low earnings multiple visa the third perfect stock for retirees that can turn an initial investment of 300 000 into 1 million by 2030 is payment processor visa v 1 70 the big concern wall street has right now with payment processors is how they ll perform with inflation hitting four decade highs and u s gross domestic product gdp declining in back to back quarters because financial stocks like visa are cyclical they re prone to weakness during contractions and recessions however the economic cycle is a two sided coin that very much favors the optimist although recessions are inevitable they tend to last for no more than a couple of quarters by comparison virtually every economic expansion has been measured in years a bet on visa is simply a bet that u s and global gdp and therefore consumer and enterprise spending will increase over time which is a virtual guarantee beyond just playing a numbers game to their advantage retirees will also appreciate visa s leading role in the u s i e the top market for consumption in the world as of 2020 visa held a 54 share of credit card network purchase volume and was the only major payment processor to significantly expand its share of credit card network purchase volume following the great recession to add to the above this is a company with plenty of opportunity beyond the borders of the u s since most global transactions are still being conducted with cash visa can choose to organically expand its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions of the world or make acquisitions to broaden its presence such as it did with the visa europe buyout in 2016 but the real secret sauce to visa s success might just be management s financial discipline visa strictly acts as a payment processor and doesn t lend though it could very easily generate interest income and fees as a lender doing so would expose it to potential loan losses during recessions and require it to set aside capital to cover said loan losses since visa doesn t lend it s not required to take these protective measures and therefore bounces back from recessions much faster than other financial stocks finally keep in mind that while visa s 0 75 dividend yield isn t much to look at on a nominal basis the company has increased its quarterly payout by more than 1 300 since doling out its first quarterly dividend in 2008

mark pratt associated press boston the sex lives of constipated scorpions cute ducklings with an innate sense of physics and a life size rubber moose may not appear to have much in common but they all inspired the winners of this year s ig nobels the prize for comical scientific achievement held less than a month before the actual nobel prizes are announced thursday s 32nd annual ig nobel prize ceremony was for the third year in a row a prerecorded affair webcast on the annals of improbable research magazine s website the winners honored in 10 categories also included scientists who found that when people on a blind date are attracted to each other their heart rates synchronize and researchers who looked at why legal documents can be so utterly baffling even to lawyers themselves more what s being built next to laser alleys in springettsbury more york city schools consider weapon sniffing dog more spring garden police issue warning after two armed robberies even though the ceremony was prerecorded it retained much of the fun of the live event usually held at harvard university as has been an ig nobel tradition real nobel laureates handed out the prizes using a bit of video trickery the nobel laureates handed the prize off screen while the winners reached out and brought a prize they had been sent and self assembled into view winners also received a virtually worthless zimbabwean 10 trillion bill curiosity ig nited learn more about some of the winners get your ducks in a row science is fun my sort of a tagline is you re not doing science if you re not having fun said frank fish a biology professor at west chester university in pennsylvania who shared the physics ig nobel for studying why ducklings follow their mothers in single file formation it s about energy conservation the ducklings are drafting much like stock cars cyclists and runners do in a race he said it all has to do with the flow that occurs behind that leading organism and the way that moving in formation can actually be an energetic benefit said the appropriately named fish whose specialty is studying how animals swim he shared the prize with researchers at the university of strathclyde in glasgow scotland who found that the ducklings actually surfed in their mother s wake that syncing feeling eliska prochazkova s personal experiences inspired her research on dating that earned her and colleagues the cardiology ig nobel she had no problems finding her apparent perfect match on dating apps yet she often found there was no spark when they met face to face so she set people up on blind dates in real social settings measured their physiological reactions and found that the heart rates of people attracted to each other synchronized so is her work evidence of love at first sight it really depends on how you define love prochazkova a researcher at leiden university in the netherlands said in an email what we found in our research was that people were able to decide whether they want to date their partner very quickly within the first two seconds of the date the participants made a very complex idea about the human sitting in front of them a cruel sting solimary garci a herna ndez and glauco machado of the university of sa o paulo in brazil won the biology ig nobel for studying whether constipation ruins a scorpion s sex life scorpions can detach a body part to escape a predator a process called autotomy but when they lose their tails they also lose the last portion of the digestive tract which leads to constipation and eventually death they wrote in the journal integrated zoology the long term decrease in the locomotor performance of autotomized males may impair mate searching they wrote that s a moose dummy magnus gers won the safety engineering ig nobel for making a moose crash test dummy for his master s thesis at kth royal institute of technology in stockholm which was published by the swedish national road and transport research institute frequent moose vs vehicle collisions on sweden s highways often result in injuries and death to both human and animal gers said in an email yet automobile makers rarely include animal crashes in their safety testing i believe this is a fascinating and still very unexplored area that deserves all the attention it can get he said this topic is mystical life threatening and more relevant than ever can you speak legalese anyone who has ever read a terms of service agreement knows that legal documents can be downright incomprehensible that frustrated eric martinez a graduate student in the brain and cognitive science department at the massachusetts institute of technology who also has a law degree from harvard he francis mollica and edward gibson shared the literature ig nobel for analyzing what makes legal documents unnecessarily difficult to understand research that appeared in the journal cognition ultimately there s kind of a hope that lawyers will think a little more with the reader in

green isn t a color that most would associate with bmw but if you re in the market for a 7 series that really makes a statement we ve stumbled across two very compelling options the first is a 2019 alpina b7 xdrive that has been listed up for sale through perfect auto collection in akron ohio it is likely one of the brightest models ever adorned with an alpina badge and being offered for 93 995 with 28 399 miles 45 703 km on the clock the color in question comes from the bmw individual program and is dubbed java green metallic this isn t the first time we ve seen a high end bmw model finished in this color as earlier this year the world s only bmw x5 competition painted in java green metallic was delivered to an enthusiast in the united states heck we ve even seen an audi a7 painted in the same color read also 2023 bmw 7 series and i7 land in australia from au 268 900 it s not just the paint that makes this b7 stand out it is also adorned with a number of chrome accents including across the front grille side window surrounds rocker panels and tailgate a set of silver wheels also catch the eye if this 7 series is a little too outlandish and pricey for your taste perhaps this second one will be more up your alley it is a completely stock 2018 bmw 750i and has been finished in a shade dubbed signal green in these photos posted by coggin bmw treasure coast in fort pierce florida the color seems somewhat dull but a quick google search shows that signal green can really pop under the right light this 750i is also quite a bit cheaper than the b7 xdrive and is available for 56 000 with 34 058 miles 54 811 km on the clock that s quite the bargain particularly when you consider that 2018 750i models started at around 100 000 when the car was new
scientists from the university of british columbia the university of bern and the stanford center for ocean solutions have concluded that without strong measures to mitigate the devastating effects of climate change global fish socks by biomass will not be able to recover to sustainable levels the researchers used computer modeling to track fish stocks by biomass from 1950 to 2001 sadly the research showed that stocks declined from historical levels in 103 of 226 marine area studies the scientist s data showed that stocks would struggle to rebuild without intervention due to the effects of global warming commenting on the research dr william cheung professor at the institute for the oceans and fisheries and lead author stated more conservation oriented fisheries management is essential to rebuild over exploited fish stocks under climate change however that alone is not enough climate mitigation is important for our fish stock rebuilding plans to be effective tropical ecoregions in asia the pacific south america and africa are experiencing declining fish populations as species both move further north to cooler waters and are also unable to recover due to fishing demands these regions are the ones that feel the effects of global warming first and our study shows that even a slight increase of 1 5 degrees celsius could have a catastrophic effect on tropical nations that are dependent on fisheries for food and nutrition security revenue and employment while iof postdoctoral fellow and study co author dr juliano palacios abrantes stated to rebuild fish stocks climate change must be fully considered we live in a globalized world where situations are interconnected we are seeing this most significantly in tropical regions but also in the arctic where many exploited species are slow to mature or ireland canada and the usa with high fishing mortality rates these climate effects even when we looked at conservation focused scenarios are making it too difficult for fish stocks to bounce back you can find the original study here

investors should be looking toward the next phase for tesla s business many investors may feel they have missed the boat with tesla tsla 5 59 while the stock has been up over 1 800 in the last three years it has dropped more than 25 since early january that shouldn t be too much of a surprise however with the stock valued for much success coming into this year but investments should be made looking forward not back tesla and the ev sector in general is entering a new phase and the company is positioning itself to continue to lead the way forward while returns over the coming years may not match prior results tesla has a lot of irons in the fire it s worth looking closely at whether now is a good time to invest expanding product lineup the second quarter was a challenging one for tesla global supply chain snarls and rising raw material costs particularly impacted its two new factories that are in the midst of ramping up in texas and germany production at its shanghai factory as well as consumer demand was hindered by lockdowns as china continued to implement its zero covid policy but with all those headwinds tesla still grew second quarter sales by 42 year over year and generated 621 million in free cash flow that s not bad for what constituted a tough quarter and the company is making headway in growing its product portfolio ceo elon musk said the tesla semi truck would begin deliveries as soon as this year and the cybertruck pickup model should still be on track to launch next year too beyond that a lower priced ev is expected to be added to its product portfolio as it reduces costs tesla s energy segment is also ramping up production its gigafactories haven t just increased battery production to support tesla s vehicle manufacturing growth the company has been increasing production of battery storage and solar systems that it sells separately to customers the below chart shows the comparable growth in the first six month periods of the years since 2019 in its second quarter report the company said it continues to ramp up megapack storage production as customer interest remains strong and well above our production rate roadway ahead one crucial negative for investors has always been the company s valuation if as analysts believe on average one assumes earnings in the back half of 2022 are 50 higher than the first half tesla stock is trading at a price to earnings p e ratio of about 75 based on this year s earnings but the company is working to bring costs down in a recent investor conference tesla head of investor relations martin viecha said tesla s cost per vehicle was 84 000 in 2017 and has dropped to 36 000 per vehicle more recently continuing that trend will allow tesla to get into the lower priced ev market that should help create mass penetration for the ev sector the company recently filed documents saying it is evaluating the potential to build a lithium hydroxide refining facility on the gulf coast of texas that would be another way to streamline its supply chain and control costs the company said commercial operations could begin by the fourth quarter of 2024 if the project moves forward that could also help tesla benefit from incentives included in the inflation reduction act the new law already gave tesla a boost as it resumes some tax credits that had expired for consumers buying new evs tesla was well past the previous limitation that ended those credits after a manufacturer sold more than 200 000 vehicles lower priced vehicle models and more of its supply chain based in the u s will also help it meet eligibility requirements the future certainly looks bright for tesla while a p e above 70 is an extremely high valuation if the company continues to grow at or near 50 for several more years that won t seem so rich for investors looking years or decades down the road buying tesla right now could make good sense
these fast growth dividend stocks could help income investors beat inflation the tech industry is generally not regarded as a place to find dividends let alone rapid dividend growth however as many tech companies mature they elect to offer payouts and in a few cases increase them at a rapid rate these huge increases appeal to more investors as 8 3 year over year inflation has hurt many on a fixed income also many stocks offer payouts well above the average s p 500 dividend yield of about 1 6 investors looking for such dividend stocks should consider broadcom avgo 2 48 digital realty trust dlr 2 76 and texas instruments txn 0 01 let s find out a bit more about these three hypergrowth dividend stocks 1 a cash cow stock with tons of dividend growth firepower justin pope broadcom connectivity is a popular investment theme on wall street and for a good reason the world is increasingly digital various technologies including streaming the internet of things gaming and autonomous driving rely on sending data from one location to another broadcom specializes in semiconductor solutions for connectivity and networking applications you ll find its products in devices including consumer electronics routers automated factory equipment bluetooth devices data centers and more the company is growing and very profitable broadcom s grown its revenue by an annual average of nearly 30 over the past decade partially aided by the immense growth of smartphones worldwide additionally the business generates almost 0 49 of free cash flow from every revenue dollar giving the company billions in cash to spend each year sharing those profits with shareholders through a dividend has become routine for broadcom management raised its dividend annually for 13 consecutive years putting it on the path to becoming a dividend aristocrat the dividend yields a solid 3 3 at the current share price but the payout s rapid growth is what s most impressive shareholders have received annual raises averaging 18 over the past three years outpacing even the hot inflation rates of today the dividend payout ratio is quite manageable at 44 leaving room for broadcom to remain financially flexible broadcom is trying to diversify its business by getting into software it acquired symantec in 2018 and ca technologies in 2019 to form its infrastructure software division which now makes up about a quarter of broadcom s total sales these two deals totaled almost 30 billion in value but there are more deals to come the company has a pending agreement to acquire cloud software company vmware for 61 billion in cash and stock investors will want to monitor the developments of broadcom s pending acquisition and follow the company s financial performance significant purchases take time to digest properly and large deals don t always help a company however broadcom s juicy and growing dividend is well funded by cash profits and a successful acquisition could strengthen the business over the long term 2 digital realty has delivered steady dividend increases for over a decade jake lerch digital realty trust if you re looking for a tech focused company delivering consistent dividend growth digital realty trust is a name you should know the real estate investment trust reit develops properties for use as data centers then leases space to customers data centers are in effect the warehouses that store the world s electronic data with the rise of cloud computing the demand for data centers has skyrocketed and as demand for its properties increased digital realty passed along steady cash returns to shareholders the company increased its annual dividend for more than 10 years straight its current dividend yield stands at 4 06 yet there are risks for digital realty the first is a common one for reits rising interest rates as interest rates rise reits lose some appeal as investors can easily swap into risk free government notes or bonds and capture similar or even higher amounts of income moreover reits run the risk of having to refinance their typically high debt loads at higher interest rates which can eat away at profit margins and potentially threaten dividend payouts the second risk is that cloud companies may choose to build and operate their own data centers cutting digital realty out of the process altogether that s the position held by jim chanos one of the world s most prominent short sellers chanos is betting against digital reality arguing that some of its biggest customers alphabet microsoft amazon will eventually turn against it so far the bet seems to be paying off digital realty s stock price is down 33 year to date high inflation combined with rising interest rates will keep shares under pressure in the short term however longer term investors might find digital realty s steady dividend income too good to resist mainly if you believe that the cloud revolution is only getting started 3 the old line chip company at the center of new tech will healy texas instruments texas instruments declared its first dividend in 1962 but it took 42 years before it set out on its current dividend growth path ti paid less than 0 09 per share in dividends when rich templeton became ceo in 2004 after becoming company head templeton put his company on a path of annual dividend hikes so significant were the increases that its dividend increased at a compound annual growth rate of 25 between 2004 and 2021 ti has just approved its latest increase which is a more modest 8 still today s dividend amounts to 4 96 per share annually yielding about 3 its 2021 dividend claimed 62 of the company s free cash flow this has left the company with enough cash to hike dividends buy back shares or invest in its business ti supports this dividend by designing and building analog and embedded semiconductor chips since the latest digital chips cannot function without ti s analog chips this virtually ensures a long term book of business for the semiconductor stock about 62 of its revenue comes from the industrial and automotive sectors also its chips are an essential component of apple s iphone and analysts widely believe the client that provides 9 of ti s revenue is apple in total ti makes about 80 000 products that serve 100 000 customers those customers took revenue to 10 1 billion in the first half of 2022 14 higher than in the same time frame in 2021 net income rose 22 in that period to 4 5 billion as ti limited its cost of revenue growth to 2 during that time ti s stock price has fallen 17 2 over the last year slightly lagging the s p 500 which fell 14 1 still it has sidestepped the massive drop of other tech stocks moreover the falling stock price means investors can buy this growing dividend payer at 17 9 times earnings that low valuation along with ti s critical role in tech should keep its dividend growth on a sustainable path
