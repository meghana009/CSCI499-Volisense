approximately 2 premium relative to peers as of october 2022 the board is not content with performance that is only in line with peers and is actively considering all opportunities available to aimco to further enhance and unlock stockholder value and will leave no stone unturned 3 we have enhanced aimco s corporate governance profile and embraced emerging best practices aimco is accelerating the declassification of the board to be effective at the 2023 annual meeting when all directors will be elected to annual terms aimco has committed to opt out of the maryland unsolicited takeover act or muta prior to the 2023 annual meeting aimco is transitioning the timing of the company s annual meeting date so the 2023 annual meeting will be held by the end of the third quarter of 2023 and the 2024 annual meeting will be held by the end of the second quarter of 2024 aimco is asking stockholders to approve amendments to the company s charter at the 2023 annual meeting to eliminate super majority requirements to amend the bylaws and remove directors allow directors to be removed by stockholders without cause and expand stockholder rights to replace directors effective as of the 2023 annual meeting aimco is amending the company s bylaws to lower the threshold for stockholders to call a special meeting to a simple majority of shares outstanding 4 we have a proven track record of active stockholder engagement and have steadily enhanced our investor relations efforts the new aimco board and management team have met with stockholders representing more than 80 of aimco s outstanding shares of common stock over the past 13 months the new aimco board and management team took seriously the outreach from jonathan litt of land buildings following his september 2022 letter to the board quickly engaging with mr litt to hear his views directly within fewer than 90 days of mr litt s writing and in response to a broad survey of stockholders aimco committed to implementing significant governance enhancements in 2021 aimco launched an all new website and produced a webcast and 73 page strategic overview presentation aimco attends major industry conferences including btig and nareit in 2022 and is committed to ongoing engagement with investors aimco has reached out to no less than a dozen sell side equity research analysis and are in continuous discussions aimco has provided in depth quarterly disclosures on development and redevelopment projects and components necessary to calculate nav 5 land buildings nominees are not additive to the aimco board and there is no case for change we acknowledge that james sullivan is an experienced real estate analyst but he has no public company board or executive management experience and does not provide any expertise that is not currently represented on the new aimco board the election of either james sullivan or michelle applebaum would displace a current aimco board committee chair with significant public reit board and corporate real estate experience as well as extensive experience overseeing value enhancing m a transactions the removal of michael stein from the board is unwarranted given new aimco s strong results and would impair aimco s ongoing strategic review leading proxy advisor firm glass lewis stated in its december 1st report1 we do not believe board change is warranted at this time 6 settlement discussions with land buildings have not been constructive its demands have been unreasonable and not in stockholders best interest aimco recently held discussions with land buildings and offered to appoint mr sullivan to the aimco board under aimco s proposal mr sullivan was invited to serve on the investment committee as well as the audit compensation and human resources and nominating environmental social and governance committees aimco also offered to appoint the highly qualified pat gibson as chair of the investment committee ms gibson is an experienced real estate investor and a new independent director on the aimco board who mr litt has approved of previously mr litt rejected the proposal land buildings has unreasonably refused to entertain any settlement proposal that does not result in the removal of michael stein a vital member of the aimco board given his experience overseeing strategic corporate transactions and unlocking stockholder value land buildings demanded that mr sullivan be appointed chairman of the board s investment committee and that four of aimco s other independent directors resign from the committee while we recognize mr sullivan s experience as a research analyst the board does not believe he has the experience to chair a committee of a public company board of directors given his lack of previous public board experience corporate capital allocation and investment real estate management and or development experience and his non existent track record of value creation at a public company _______________ 1

in this piece we will take a look at the top 15 digital transformation companies in the u s for more companies head on over to top 5 digital transformation companies in the u s digital transformation is a diverse field and one that continues to evolve with time as the name suggests this sector simply involves the transformation of traditional analog sources of data or business processes into digital data and processes for a host of different benefits it traces its way back to the 1950s when the semiconductor was invented and allowed the conversion of analog computing to digital computing the next big shifts started to occur from the 1960s onward with the introduction of computer aided design in manufacturing in the 70s before this digital planning systems started to make their way across corporations as a method of letting them manage their inventory in the 1960s from then on these systems were expanded to also bring materials requirement planning mrp and manufacturing resource planning mrp ii to firms all these were brought under the umbrella of what is now termed enterprise resource planning erp a leading technology that continues to evolve today and is at the heart of what is termed a digital transformation however backend processes are not the only ones that have been digitally transformed the late 1990s were the era of the internet and naturally this was blended with the newly set up erp systems this integration enabled firms to communicate with each other to share different information such as delivery status order invoices and demand forecasts the latter is particularly important for avoiding the bullwhip effect which is the result of a demand mismatch between two companies at different ends of the supply chain finally another aspect of digital transformation is the digital storefront which allows companies to interact with customers over the internet naturally the vast scope and the countless benefits offered by digital transformation lead

yellowstone jamie dutton wes bentley and sarah atwood dawn olivieri seem to be forming something of a genuine romantic bond in episode 6 one that he questions her motivations for she appears offended by the suggestion that her interest in him is led by business considerations but by the end of the episode they begin plotting together to try to oust his father john dutton as governor and install him but when a news report shows john comforting emmett s widow at the branding instead of going to see the president providing him a real optics win sarah gives jamie an ominous sounding warning i

for chef nigel jones calabash represents community the new oakland restaurant he s opening with partner hanif sadr of komaaj in san francisco has been in the works since 2019 on the road to its debut the partners faced construction delays a global pandemic and a slowed approval process from the city of oakland so you could also say the restaurant s story is one of endurance but as of wednesday december 7 calabash is open it s been a journey jones says and i feel like we are here at the right place and hoping it s the right time to call calabash a restaurant is perhaps an oversimplification it s an all day dining option meant to move with the day s rhythm of eating and drinking service begins at 8 a m with breakfast and coffee shelving and a fridge will soon serve as a marketplace for customers to quickly stock up on items and condiments like chow chow a sweet pepper relish from wanda s cooking bags of red bay coffee eggs and more the main counter will house a carving station for the day s special such as a roast chicken along with grab and go salads or bread and sumac labneh dips offered alongside bowls of hearty beef and barley stew with roast vegetables or sandwiches to be eaten at home or at calabash there s also a full cocktail bar and a separate wine bar to meet thirsty customers at the end of the day paired alongside the aforementioned dips it brings a healthier late night food option to the town including for industry folks looking for a place to go after work sadr and jones say we can be in that space and dance between the angles and the options provide food through different ways sadr says azalina eusope was part of the original calabash team with plans to feature her malaysian dishes but amicably parted ways as she began focusing on opening her own restaurant in san francisco the team does plan to sell her sauces and products through the marketplace however for those who know the food at jones nine year old jamaican restaurant kingston 11 jones says his dishes will be different the food jones prepares is influenced by the caribbean and african diaspora as well as california but maybe doesn t fit with kingston 11 for breakfast the menu includes roasted duck over grits with house dried tomatoes and capers a main entree meanwhile features a curried crab with vegetables atop jasmine rice he s still approaching the food with a jamaican mindset meaning meats will be marinated for at least 24 48 hours and will still emphasize caribbean spices and flavors it gives me the freedom to create different things that i m inspired by and not being pigeonholed where i have to stick to one concept jones says sadr s half of the menu set off under a komaaj subhead focuses on northern iranian cuisine and mazze a farsi word that means flavor but also refers to dips salads whatever you eat before the food or on the side of the main course sadr says most items will be vegan vegetarian or gluten free and will combine fresh and preserved ingredients a staple of iranian food he adds many of the dips such as mirzaghasemi which combines roasted eggplant and tomato or maazst sabzi an herby labneh dip can be purchased a la carte or as part of a platter featuring six to eight bowls of dip and vegetable salads with bread this allows diners to try many of sadr s foods at once and can be purchased into the night alongside the drinks located on the ground floor of luxury apartment complex alta waverly calabash lands in an unusual spot for a longtime oakland entrepreneur like jones but he says it is done with purpose jones sees calabash as an opportunity to bridge the gap between oakland s newer residents many of whom jones acknowledges work in tech and perhaps live in the building right above calabash with the longtime oakland families the new residents want to be part of the oakland experience jones says vice versa people from oakland proper have an opportunity now to come into this block and feel like okay this is still my town i m not ceding any space to anybody we want to make everybody feel comfortable together the two cuisines are not typical pairings on a single menu but to jones and sadr it makes sense for sadr it s an opportunity to bridge another gap helping iranians and non iranians to connect through food literally on top of each table that blend of culture will happen through the food and that will really give me hope to create a more diverse and also more flexible more understanding community sadr says cocktails are approachable drinks made with fresh ingredients intended to play off of sadr s herby and spice inflected dips the sol verde features mezcal brucato chaparral lemon citron oleo and a habanero serrano tincture the wine bar meanwhile will pour selections from napa valley with plans to bring in producers to chat about their wines if i was to come up with a mantra it s bringing the food and our culture to the people jones says i feel like oakland and the bay area we ve got a lot of beautiful people in terms of their heart their culture and creativity and i feel that s what we ve done here it s a beautiful space and beautiful food for beautiful people calabash 2300 valdez street suite a oakland is open 8 a m to 9 p m monday through thursday 8 a m to 10 p m fridays and saturdays and 8 a m to 3 p m sundays

municipals saw more cuts on the short end of the curve following a slightly weaker u s treasury market while equities ended in the black ahead of tuesday s consumer price index report and the two day

president of municipals at amerivet securities last week secondary trading totaled around 56 8 billion bids wanted totaled around 8 633 billion slightly higher than the prior week s total of 8 22 billion according to bloomberg spreads fell for the week once more with 10 year notes falling by 7 5 basis points to 2 57 marking the sixth straight week of falling yields as we try to end the year on a high note after a year of record losses he said with yields falling again munis outperformed usts again with 10 year ratios now yielding 72 34 versus 76 29 one month ago those ratios were at 80 63 as this is a sign that many investors are coming back to the muni market he said since the highs back on oct 26 wong said munis yields have fallen about an average of 75 basis points due to small supply and the fed seeming to have gotten inflation under control which have brought yields down to which investor sentiment has improved the muni curve steepened last week by 3 4 basis points to 105 basis points for the third time since august investors added money to mutual funds seeing 47 million of inflows after the prior week s outflow of 1 4 billion according to refinitiv lipper this is only the tenth weekly inflow we have had this year as investors have had a mass exodus out of fixed income funds due to higher yields as the fed rose rates to combat record high inflation he said we have seen 10 year yields decline to 2 57 from its peak of 3 39 in mid october this decline in rates has been positive news for investors as munis had been down almost 13 for the year but have crawled back in recent weeks to be down by only 8 he said the decline in rates in the last month and a half has been driven mainly by light supply with just 4 4 billion in the 30 day supply as well as inflation being in check and december being a strong month for cash reinvestment all eyes on fomc the december federal open market committee meeting combined with the release of inflation data will test the good cheer currently prevailing in the bond market said msci research strategists andy sparks tamas hanis and edina szirma a 50bp hike is widely expected given high inflation and a tight jobs market but the market is pricing in a recession and falling treasury yields and a weakening dollar are undermining the fed s efforts to dampen price pressures said james knightley ing s chief international economist a hawkish fed message will likely fall on deaf ears unless the data start proving the central bank right last month s consumer price index showed unexpectedly low inflation and triggered one of the sharpest rallies of the past several years as the 10 year ust fell by almost 60 basis points through dec 6 the surprisingly strong november employment report had a relatively modest impact on yields suggesting that the market s focus is more on inflation than on the strength of the labor market msci research strategists said the market has confidence that the fed can successfully drive inflation much lower than the current 7 7 rate of the past year they said they noted market implied inflation by june 2023 is below 3 and by december 2024 is near the fed s inflation target of 2 in line with these expectations current market pricing shows the fed raising the federal funds rate to 5 over the next three meetings followed by a pause and then cutting rates by the fourth quarter of 2023 they said however the way forward is still uncertain and depends on the stickiness of inflation appropriateness of the rate policy to address it and how much economic damage monetary tightening could cause they said over the past two years the fed and market pricing have consistently undershot inflation further as chair jerome powell has reiterated monthly inflation can be very volatile and may be misinterpreted msci research strategists note the cpi release may help confirm last month s inflation report or show it to be an anomaly they said either way the fomc meeting taking place after the release of the inflation data will provide investors with insights into how the fed is viewing inflation trends secondary trading new york city 5s of 2023 at 2 54 california 5s of 2023 at 2 45

will hike rates 50 basis points after four consecutive rate hikes of 75 basis points the fed is very likely to hike 50bps in december as they have made this policy course quite clear appleton partners said in a monday report after a barrage of 75 bps hikes over the past four fomc meetings wells fargo looks for the committee to tighten policy at a slower pace in december and raise the fed funds target range 50 bps to 4 25 4 50 while the fed will move at a more typical pace they will still be raising interest rates now and into 2023 said bankrate com chief financial analyst greg mcbride the ultimate stopping point is unknown as is how long rates will stay at that eventual destination much is being made that the federal reserve is slowing the pace of their rate hikes presumably at this meeting mcbride said but the 0 75 pace that had prevailed for the last meetings was the outlier a step that hadn t previously been taken in 28 years but was employed meetings consecutively given the urgency of the task of getting inflation under control he said the months ahead will see the fed raising interest rates at a more customary pace the downshift in the pace of tightening wells fargo strategists said follows signs that inflation is finally beginning to ease all three of the major u s inflation indices came in cooler than expected in october wells fargo strategists said that said the november employment report showed that the labor market remains very tight which argues for another rate hike in excess of only 25 bps while the recent moderation in price growth is encouraging they said it is merely an initial step in what is still likely to be a difficult journey in returning inflation to the fed s 2 target on a sustained basis they noted that policymakers appear weary of reading too much into a single month s data given inflation has proved more persistent than expected this past year wells fargo strategists said the post meeting statement and the quarterly update to the summary of economic projections are both likely to signal that the tightening cycle is far from over as a result the statement will continue to highlight elevated inflation and participants will still see the balance of risks to the upside morgan stanley strategists said on balance these changes will allow chair powell to justify the step down in pace while maintaining the fed s commitment to fighting inflation the fed will enter 2023 just 50bp shy of where it sees the likely peak and it will seek more flexibility in its approach according to morgan stanley strategists in the statement ongoing increases could be replace with some further increase which is intended to be interpreted as plural or singular they said the chair will then have the opportunity in the q a to underscore that there is more work to be done they added morgan stanley strategists expect to see the policy rate peaking at 4 625 in february despite continued high readings our expectation remains firm that job gains slow meaningfully in the prints ahead they said thereafter we continue to see the fed holding rates steady until december 2023 when it begins to normalize policy in steady 25bp increments

russia is running low on ammunition as its ukraine invasion careens toward the one year mark and it may soon be forced to use older unreliable rockets and artillery shells some built decades ago according to a senior u s military official the new ammunition what the pentagon calls fully serviceable could be used up by early next year as the war continues despite the winter weather said the official who briefed the press monday on the condition of anonymity russia also appears to be running low on precision guided munitions moscow is faced with relying more heavily on degraded rockets and shells which could ratchet up risks to its own troops and leave unexploded ordnance strewn across ukraine or finding some way to replenish new stocks despite international sanctions designed to stamp out its war effort read next va starts early review of claims for veterans with terminal illnesses under the pact act so this essentially puts russian forces in a position to have to make a choice about what risks it s willing to accept in terms of increased failure rates unpredictable performance and whether or not these degraded conditions would require any type of refurbishment which of course requires a certain amount of expertise and time the official said earlier this month avril haines the director of national intelligence told a gathering of u s officials in california that russia was using up ammunition at a really pretty extraordinary rate and faster than its own defense industry could replace it according to nbc news even at the beginning of the war when russian president vladimir putin ordered the invasion on feb 24 his forces have at times used the aging rockets and shells despite the risks of ammunition built as long ago as 40 years degraded ammunition can injure or kill troops who fire it you load the ammunition and you cross your fingers and hope it s going to fire or when it lands that it s going to explode the official said but unexploded ordnance can also contaminate battlefields long after wars end and threaten generations of civilians meaning ukraine could be saddled with the danger and cleanup if it successfully repels the russian invasion many pacific island nations still struggle with unexploded ordnance dropped during world war ii according to the state department in afghanistan one of the most war torn countries in the world more than 20 000 people are estimated to have been injured or killed by unexploded ordnance between 2001 and 2018 according to a study by brown university s costs of war project ultimately the russians will likely try to replenish their stocks of new ammunition through domestic production refurbishment of old stocks and foreign suppliers the official said this is why it s not surprising that they re reaching out to countries like iran and north korea to try to obtain some more dependable ammunition evidence from the battlefield shows russia has already been relying on iranian made drones on dec 10 alone the ukrainians reported that russian forces waged 15 separate attacks on three cities using the drones according to the institute for the study of war but the u s has warned nations that might consider trading with russia that they too could be sanctioned dozens of countries have levied sanctions against moscow and about 1 000 multinational companies have announced they will reduce operations in russia due to its invasion putting its economy under immense pressure meanwhile russia s defense spending spiked 40 in the first months of the war reuters reported and putin has plans to boost spending by 43 in the coming year according to bloomberg news deputy u s treasury secretary wally adeyemo said in october that his agency issued guidance making clear that we are willing and able to sanction people companies or countries that provide ammunition to russia or support russia s military industrial complex existing sanctions crippled russia s ability to produce weapons and replace those destroyed in ukraine and blocked it from getting microelectronics needed by its military industrial complex according to the treasury department beyond the ammunition shortage russia has faced a raft of troubles including logistics breakdowns low morale and high casualty rates after nearly 10 months of fighting in ukraine putin ordered the invasion with hopes of quickly capturing the capital kyiv and dismantling the independent democratic government led by ukraine president volodymyr zelenskyy who has received historic backing from nations around the world as u s officials routinely point out none of that has been achieved although intense fighting has continued amid significant ukrainian gains in the eastern part of the country zelenskyy who was named time s person of the year this month has turned out to be a worthy opponent to putin and his military defense secretary lloyd austin said ukraine is likely to keep the upper hand over russia this winter due to moscow s difficulty supplying troops and low morale which is likely to be heightened as it has begun forcing veterans back into service to continue the war travis tritten can be reached at travis tritten

the heads of household in 25 000 nycha apartments will soon have an opportunity to vote on how to best raise capital and complete repairs in their individual complexes choosing from one of three funding models for those elections to be considered valid at least 20 percent of heads of household named on leases must cast a ballot new rules state though nycha says it will strive to achieve turnout far greater adi talwar a view of nycha s st nicholas houses near the intersection of frederick douglass boulevard and west 127th street in harlem ballots from one in five lease holders are all it will take to complete a permanent binding vote on the future funding and management of new york city housing authority developments according to election rules issued monday by the public housing agency following decades of disinvestment in new york city s public housing stock the heads of household in 25 000 nycha apartments will soon have an opportunity to choose how to best raise capital and complete repairs in their individual complexes by turning a development over to private management by entering into a newly created form of public ownership or by maintaining the current public housing model for those elections to be considered valid at least 20 percent of heads of household named on leases must cast a ballot the rules state draft rules issued by nycha in october set the voter threshold at 10 percent driving significant opposition from tenants who called it shameful absurdly low and a sham democratic process during a public comment period that ended last month many tenants meanwhile say they will need more details on the different plans to make an informed choice and worry transformative decisions will still be made by a small minority of residents i understand that nycha needs funding otherwise nothing is going to change said gowanus houses president andreas tyre but you could lose that safety net and that s a fear of mine the elections will take place as hundreds of thousands of residents the public housing authority and elected officials contemplate how to raise revenue to correct an estimated 40 billion in capital needs while preserving a vital source of affordable housing the traditional public housing model has faced years of underfunding disregard and mismanagement with residents suffering the consequences in the form of busted boilers broken elevators and toxic lead paint thousands of tenants may choose to shift their developments into two alternative structures one option the rental assistance demonstration permanent affordability commitment together rad pact program is already underway at 58 developments that have been turned over to private corporations that handle management rent collection and renovations state lawmakers in june approved a plan to create a third option that would allow nycha to transfer developments into a benefit corporation known as the preservation trust billed as a publicly controlled alternative to rad pact the preservation trust will have the power to issue bonds and borrow money for sorely needed capital improvements both rad pact and the trust switch apartment subsidies from section 9 to the section 8 program which comes with more federal funding and is traditionally used on the private market the preservation trust legislation signed by gov kathy hochul and backed by mayor eric adams included a stipulation that nycha create a minimum voter threshold for elections to be considered valid giving tenants a chance to weigh in instead of having a key decision about their future imposed on them central to the act is providing residents the power to determine the future of their developments developments will only transfer to the public housing preservation trust if the residents of that development vote to join the trust reads a version of the final rules issued by nycha the opt in clause included in the legislation helped secure support from lawmakers but raised concerns among residents that a small minority of informed tenants could determine the lasting fate of an entire complex the 10 percent voter threshold initially proposed in nycha s draft rules confirmed those fears for many residents about a third of the 192 public comments submitted in response to the draft rules took aim at the low threshold all told 62 people criticized the 10 percent figure with 51 commenters proposing a specific higher threshold according to an analysis by nycha s voting rules working group the voting percentage should be increased to 80 percent of the development 10 percent is not a majority and the majority should rule wrote one tenant of the rutgers houses on the lowest east side in november voting should be democratic if 51 or higher of people make a decision then that s the majority should be respected 10 is ridiculous wrote another both names were redacted from the public comments shared with city limits one person who submitted a comment by email called the 10 percent threshold shameful what kind of sham democratic process is this they wrote this is a major irreversible decision but few nycha tenants know or understand the process in part because nycha has created such a confusing timeline for voting and hasn t clarified what s truly at stake working group member victor bach the recently retired senior housing policy analyst at the community service society a city limits funder said discussions over the voter threshold took up more of the task force s time and attention than any other aspect of the procedure but he declined to discuss the conversations out of respect for the private nature of the committee s work i wish it were higher but i m not sure that conforms with reality bach said the working group considered general election turnout data among nycha residents from 2007 to 2021 the data presented by nycha showed that an average of 21 7 percent of registered voters cast ballots in general elections during that 14 year period but turnout ranged from 45 3 percent during the 2016 presidential election to 3 7 percent in 2011 an off year vote that featured races for queens and bronx district attorney where long time incumbents were running unopposed howard houses tenant association president naomi johnson said the group met for months to negotiate really tough issues in an intelligent and respectful way some of us disagreed at times but everyone knew that we were all working with the residents interests in mind johnson said in a statement with these rules in place i am confident that residents will come together to do what is best for their developments a spokesperson for nycha said the authority took the public comments to heart in making a final decision on the quorum in consultation with resident leaders policy experts and tenant advocates we are grateful for their hard work and consideration throughout this collaborative process the spokesperson said nycha and the working group met weekly for four months held eight public town hall meetings accepted public comments for nearly two months and included all public voices who reached out in its decision making process under the rules set to be issued tuesday third parties with expertise in elections will conduct the vote investigate any allegations of irregularities and certify the vote results tenants will have a 30 day period to cast their ballots by mail or online as well as a 10 day in person voting period a vote will be null and void if fewer than 20 percent of heads of households cast ballots and a run off will be held in the event of a tie between two of the options but the voting procedure document adds nycha will strive to achieve turnout far greater than this minimum threshold through resident engagement after six elections are completed the authority will reconsider revising the minimum turnout threshold the rules define eligible voters as any resident over the age of 18 who has signed a lease including in cases with co heads of household but the rules don t specify whether multiple votes from one apartment would be used to reach the 20 percent threshold a nycha official said they could factor into the 20 percent so long as the voters are co heads of household state sen julia salazar brooklyn who introduced the preservation trust legislation that passed into law said nycha seemed responsive to tenant concerns by agreeing to lift the threshold to 20 percent based on input from the tenant working group going back to the resident working group after the draft regulations and after the public comment period and saying we need to increase this threshold was the most important change they could make to give the vote credibility and to encourage turnout salazar said the ideal would be 100 percent turnout i think we should aspire to higher than 20 percent but i think it s a reasonable minimum standard for election results to be valid ed reed mayoral photography office mayor eric adams and new york gov kathy hochul at the signing of legislation to create the new york city housing authority nycha preservation trust in june but several tenants who spoke with city limits monday said they still disagree with turning over the future of their developments to the will of so few residents barbara williams the former president of the polo grounds tenant association said she would like to see the voter threshold increased to 51 percent of residents or at the very least 40 percent i think that might be sufficient because this is going to affect people s lives going forward said williams 74 who has lived at the polo grounds since 1988 nycha she said has played a crucial role in preserving affordable housing in new york city despite worsening conditions that stem from years of disinvestment and mismanagement she said the current conditions are now used to justify a transformative change that will forever erode public housing in the united states i think this was something strategically done to allow public housing to get into the condition it s in she said manny martinez south jamaica houses residents association president and chair of queens south on the citywide council of presidents also said a larger portion of residents votes should be required it will be a decision made by a few people for many martinez said voting is a huge part of our society this is a vote to change your rights many residents do not yet know about their options or realize that they may be called on to vote at all according to an august survey of 293 public housing residents by the community service society the survey part of the organization s annual report on the experience of low income renters saw 39 percent of respondents say they did not have enough information to determine whether they would prefer to enter the trust convert their buildings to rad pact or maintain the status quo about 29 percent said they preferred rad pact 18 percent said the trust and 13 percent said they d prefer their development to remain in section 9 public housing the results show before any development faces the preservation decision process it is necessary that residents be informed and provided with even handed reliable resident friendly information about the three choices the report s authors wrote in its voting procedure rules nycha committed to presenting tenants with clear and comprehensive information on the three voting options and providing a physical needs assessment that lays out the development s capital needs nycha understands significant outreach will be required before any vote is held pursuant to these voting procedures the new rules state they must understand their rights through the trust and within pact as well as how those rights compare to their existing rights in section 9 and nycha must provide residents the opportunity to raise their questions and concerns and to have them addressed the document continues the authority said it will conduct comprehensive outreach over the 100 days before the vote the level of outreach will be crucial for actually engaging tenants said bronx river houses resident maria arnold 65 she said many of her neighbors have not even heard of the preservation trust while others do not know the difference between that plan and rad pact people need to be better educated before they are asked to vote on something she said city limits is starting a new beat dedicated exclusively to covering nycha send us feedback and story ideas to nycha citylimits org

a new interpretation by the colorado department of labor and employment cdle could have significant tax impacts under internal revenue code section 409a 409a many bonus and incentive programs require that the intended recipient remain employed with the employer through the date of payment if the employee quits before the payment date the employee is not entitled to receive the bonus in fact many bonuses are granted specifically in order to retain the employee in interpretative notice and formal opinion info 17 the cdle interprets the colorado wage act as prohibiting an employer from requiring the employee be employed on a certain date in order to receive a bonus if all other conditions to receive the bonus have been met see my colleague s article here for more discussion about the new guidance in general if the cdle interpretation is applied to retention bonuses the bonuses might not in fact be forfeitable if the employee quits before the payment date since these bonuses are typically designed to be exempt from 409a tax rules under the short term deferral exception which requires there to be a substantial risk of forfeiture this could mean that there is no longer a substantial risk of forfeiture the amount could be considered deferred compensation that is subject to 409a and all of 409a s restrictions and an extra 20 tax for any violation earlier vesting and disregard of substantial risk of forfeiture could have other tax and accounting impacts as well including the timing of federal state income taxation and fica taxation and which taxable year is allocated the company deduction under the all events test for liabilities for example an employer s calendar year bonus may be payable in the following year after financial statement preparation review board certification etc but subject to the requirement that the individual remain employed through the actual payment date if the bonus cannot be forfeited even if the individual quits before the intended payment date then there would presumably be deferred compensation earned and vested in one calendar year and paid in a later calendar year beyond the short term deferral period that is subject to 409a complying with 409a may not be difficult where the payment date is sufficiently specific but being subject to 409a restricts the employer from paying earlier or later than the intended date among other things the unintended imposition of 409a rules onto the bonus structure would open up many traps for an unwary employer with tax consequences of any 409a violation falling primarily on the employee this interpretation would have even greater impacts and difficulties for compliance on other types of awards that are common such as restricted stock unit or incentive award arrangements that extend over many years to the extent they would be otherwise subject to the colorado s wage act in many of these arrangements the only vesting condition is that the individual continue to be employed if these time based vesting awards are no longer effective in colorado employers legitimate purpose of rewarding retention of key employees would be thwarted it seems unlikely that colorado intended this result an example in info 17 which is based on the facts in an actual case describes an extreme factual situation the employer fires the employee the day before the bonus is payable in contrast arguably if a primary condition of the bonus is retention itself perhaps that is sufficient to take a retention bonus out of the purview of info 17 however info 17 does not appear to make that distinction if the guidance was intended to address only the extreme type of employer behavior we hope that the cdle will clarify the guidance accordingly employers should incorporate these considerations into any new bonus and incentive arrangements and consider the possible impacts on any already existing arrangements

one of the pleasures of being a litigator is that we constantly learn the pleasure multiplies as a law blogger where articles we write inspire litigation arguments and litigations we fight inspire articles recently my blogging and litigation worlds merged cross inspiring one another in some interesting ways a client who came across one of my articles about her case engaged our firm to represent her and her late husband s estate when the outlook seemed dire then an article from earlier this year by my co blogger peter sluka germinated a legal argument in the case challenging enforceability of a stock transfer restriction in a shareholder s agreement our opponent argued caused a 50 stock interest worth millions of dollars to be forfeited because the deceased shareholder attempted to bequeath the shares to his widow in violation of a transfer restriction limiting permissible bequests only to one s issue coming full circle as i researched more about this niche area the things i learned for the litigation are now the inspiration for this week s article the case to which i allude is worbes corp v sebrow about which we wrote earlier this year a prior appellate decision in a related case sebrow v sebrow we wrote about last year two weeks ago bronx county commercial division justice fidel e gomez issued a decision and order in worbes denying as patently premature our opponent s pre discovery motion for summary judgment denied our clients cross motion also on prematurity grounds and granted our clients leave to allege several new counterclaims including to challenge enforceability of the stock transfer restriction on public policy grounds our clients filed the amended pleading last week arguing public policy to challenge enforceability of a stock transfer restriction might sound like a shaky proposition but as it turns out there are several strands of interrelated new york case law invalidating stock transfer restrictions and buy sell agreements on public policy grounds where the effect of the agreement is to cause forfeiture or annihilation of a valuable closely held business interest for little or no consideration in the case peter sluka wrote about earlier this year atlantis mgt group ii llc v nabe 2022 ny slip op 30399 manhattan commercial division justice jennifer g schecter ruled that a buy sell provision in an llc operating agreement triggered upon breach of any provision of the agreement and forcing the sale of a member s interest to the other for 1 a forfeiture for a dollar is a draconian grossly disproportionate unreasonable unenforceable penalty by punishing any breach however minor with forfeiture of valuable interests in exchange for a mere dollar justice schecter ruled the intent of the provision is purely punitive and unenforceable as against public policy atlantis relied on case law outside of the closely held business context see e g truck rent a ctr inc v puritan farms 2nd inc 41 ny2d 420 beltway 7 props ltd v blackrock realty advisers inc 167 ad3d 100 but there are several lines of case law akin to atlantis in the closely held business context first the court of appeals has held that a stock transfer restriction absolutely prohibiting inheritance of a decedent s stock without consideration to the deceased shareholder s estate is void as against public policy in quinn v stuart lakes club inc 80 ad2d 350 a corporation s by law provided that when a shareholder died his stock shall be considered void which the court characterized as survivorship lottery prohibiting inheritance of a shareholder s stock so the last survivor shall fall heir to the corporation the court ruled that such a restriction prohibiting by operation of law transfers upon death is not to be given effect affirming this holding the court of appeals ruled we agree that article 9 of the corporation s by laws is void as an absolute restraint on the power of alienation violative of the public policy in this state quinn v stuart lakes club inc 57 ny2d 1003 second under new york law a stock transfer restriction with terms so onerous it would result in annihilation of property is unenforceable lam v li 222 ad2d 290 rafe v hindin 29 ad2d 481 affd 23 ny2d 759 in lam the court explained in new york certificates of stock are regarded as personal property and the right of transfer is a right of property so if another has the arbitrary power to forbid a transfer of property by the owner that amounts to annihilation of property quotations omitted lam ruled that the onerous terms of an option for one shareholder to purchase the stock of another for just 10 effectively prevent defendant from transferring the stock to anyone but plaintiff rendering the option unreasonable and unenforceab in rafe the court found that since no price is stated at which the plaintiff must sell to defendant and which the latter is required to pay to the plaintiff for the plaintiff s stock the contract may be construed as rendering the sale of the plaintiff s stock impossible to anyone except to the individual defendant at whatever price he wishes to pay rafe concluded the restriction is not only not reasonable but it is against public policy and therefore illegal third the appellate division has held that interpretation of a partnership agreement to bestow a windfall upon one business owner to the detriment of another violates the rule that a contract should not be interpreted to produce a result that is absurd commercially unreasonable or contrary to the reasonable expectations of the parties in re lipper holdings llc 1 ad3d 170 under this principle in cole v macklowe 99 ad3d 595 the court reversed a decision holding that a partner was automatically divested of his partnership interest by not exercising a buy sell provision in the partnership agreement upon termination of employment holding that cole s failure to sell his interest did not divest him automatically of the interest not only is the agreement void of any language mandating this result held the court the interpretation of the agreement urged by defendants allowing them to acquire plaintiff s partnership interest for no consideration represents a windfall to the defendants that is absurd not commercially reasonable and contrary to the intent of the parties the words they use vary but all of these cases essentially say the same thing equity in a closely held partnership corporation or limited liability company is valuable personal property under this principle a transfer restriction or buy sell agreement that would impose a forfeiture atlantis cause an ownership interest to become void quinn result in annihilation of property lam and rafe or bestow a windfall lipper and cole is vulnerable to attack as unenforceable under public policy

five days after the largest raid in the history of post world war ii germany it is becoming increasingly clear how extensive the right wing terrorist network is against which it was directed on december 7 some 3 000 special police force officers searched 150 properties across germany since then 25 people have been held in pre trial detention and 29 others are under investigation the federal prosecutor accuses them of being members or supporters of a terrorist organization but they are only the tip of the iceberg querdenker and anti vaxxer demonstration in frankfurt am main march 2022 those arrested are said to have planned to invade the bundestag along the lines of the american coup plotters of january 6 2021 capture members of parliament and government trigger riots across the country and then carry out a coup chief federal prosecutor peter frank said the group was pursuing the goal of eliminating democracy in germany by using violence and military means federal interior minister nancy faeser social democratic party spd said the investigations provided a glimpse into an abyss of terrorist threats from the reichsbürger milieu in the meantime numerous details have been released to the public about those arrested whose names the chief prosecutor only disclosed in the form of initials many of them have been known for their right wing extremist views and activities for years or decades a striking number were or are members of the military or the state security apparatus in any case it soon became clear that the authorities were by no means as surprised about the abyss of terrorist threats as interior minister faeser now claims in the mid 1990s the 69 year old rüdiger von pescatore who is said to have led the military arm of the group was the commander of a paratrooper battalion of the 25th airborne brigade a predecessor of the ksk special forces unit he left the bundeswehr armed forces in 1999 because he had taken weapons from old east german stocks and was sentenced to two years probation of the 165 pistols and rifles that disappeared at the time only 11 have ever turned up again the 54 year old peter wörner is a trained elite soldier in the ksk on instagram there are also photos showing him with american special forces in the us he was a member of the same battalion as pescatore in the 1990s he is part of the prepper scene and has recently worked as a survivalist trainer in april this year officers found firearms ammunition magazines and other weapons in his home wörner is also said to have had contact with the group that planned to kidnap health minister karl lauterbach and then organize a coup this group blew apart in the summer with the media reporting about it maximilian eder 63 was a colonel in the bundeswehr and led an armoured infantry battalion in kosovo in 1999 before retiring in the autumn of 2016 he served for a time in the ksk with the onset of the pandemic he became a leading figure in protests against anti covid measures during the flood disaster in the ahr valley the retired colonel showed up in uniform set up a command centre and authorised deployment orders his chief of staff was peter wörner eder eventually had to pay a 3 500 fine for the unauthorized wearing of a uniform shortly before his arrest in a video eder called for a coup before christmas andreas meyer 58 an active ksk soldier is also among the accused the staff sergeant was deployed several times as a logistician in afghanistan and has published a book about his experience he is said to have smuggled members of the group into barracks using his military id several police officers are also among the accused chief inspector ivonne g works as a criminal investigator in the minden lübbecke district police department in north rhine westphalia according to information from news weekly der spiegel she is said to have attracted attention in the past as a coronavirus denier a state security officer from lower saxony who is also accused is said to have been on sick leave for some time michael fritsch a chief detective in lower saxony has already been removed from his position he is a reichsbürger and was the lead candidate of the querdenken party diebasis for the 2021 federal election during the raids police found a substantial arsenal of weapons nine millimetre pistols swords knives stun guns combat helmets night vision equipment and the service weapons of a female and male police officer who are among the suspects in addition the group is said to possess a dozen iridium satellite phones at a cost of 1 500 each which work even if the cell phone network breaks down heinrich xiii prince reuss who is considered the ringleader of the group has long been known for his anti semitic statements and his support of reichsbürger ideology at a digital fair in zurich switzerland for example he agitated against the power of jewish big capitalists and declared that the federal republic was not a sovereign state but was dominated by the allies to this day the speech was published on youtube his strange name comes from the fact that in the noble family of reuss all male descendants are called heinrich to avoid confusion they are numbered with roman numerals starting anew with each century the family has distanced itself from heinrich xiii calling him a bitter old man who subscribes to conspiracy theory misconceptions but his role is no accident old aristocrats who as reuss did for 30 years litigate for the return of expropriated juncker property and dream of the restoration of the german reich and old prussian glory are to be found in abundance in the right wing extremist milieu long before beatrix von storch born duchess of oldenburg became a member of the afd she campaigned for the restitution of the large aristocratic estates expropriated after the war an example of the arrested group s close ties to the afd is berlin judge birgit malsack winkemann who represented the far right party in the bundestag for four years her judicial appointment was confirmed by the berlin administrative court as recently as october even though the police had long been investigating her for forming a terrorist organization and her contacts with the afd s ultra nationalist flügel wing grouping her racist statements against refugees and her participation in a querdenken demonstration in berlin were well known however malsack winkemann is only one link between the terrorist cell and the afd among the accused are at least two others who are or were active at regional level in the afd in addition alexander q who runs a qanon channel on telegram with 130 000 subscribers is said to be among the supporters of the terrorist cell during the ahr valley flood disaster he spread the lie that the flood waters had washed up the corpses of 600 children who had been locked up and killed in order to extract a rejuvenating metabolic product from them one can only understand the emergence of the terrorist cell against the backdrop of years of the downplaying and promotion of far right groups by the secret service and other state authorities in 2003 proceedings to ban the far right german national party npd failed because the supreme court judges concluded that there were so many security agency employees in the party s leadership that the npd was in substance an operation of the state when president of the office for the protection of the constitution hans georg maassen advised and promoted the afd at least two dozen state informants were part of the support network of the neo nazi national socialist union nsu without the state allegedly knowing of their existence the connections between the nsu the secret service and the murder of kassel district president walter lübcke remain murky to this day with the return of german militarism and the ukraine war the crimes of the nazis and their collaborators are being systematically trivialized the establishment parties have integrated the far right afd into parliamentary work and adopted its policies letting the virus rip in the pandemic refugee baiting and implementing a massive military build up in this climate right wing terrorist groups such as the one that has now been exposed can develop the arrest of two dozen right wing extremists will not change this only an independent socialist offensive of the working class can stop the fascist danger

principal executive office in south san francisco california is a biotechnology company that manufactures synthetic dna and dna products synthetic dna products allow users to design and modify dna for the purposes of academic research enhancing specialty chemical production and developing healthcare treatments among other uses throughout the class period defendants repeatedly assured investors that the company possessed innovative proprietary technology relating to its synthetic dna products that positioned twist for significant future growth specifically defendants claimed that twist had already achieved substantial growth during the class period growing from a customer base of approximately 1 300 diagnostic companies hospitals research institutions and others at the end of fiscal year 2019 to approximately 2 900 customers at the end of fiscal year 2021 similary defendants reported skyrocketing gross margins which purportedly grew from 12 8 in fiscal year 2019 to 39 1 in fiscal year 2021 with margins projected to reach 40 for fiscal year 2022 during the class period defendants also announced plans to build a factory of the future in wilsonville oregon the oregon facility which would purportedly provide hundreds of jobs and occupy 110 000 square feet by august 2022 when twist reported its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 defendants projected annual capital expenditures between 95 million and 100 million largely attributable to building out this new manufacturing facility the truth about twist s actual financial health was revealed on november 15 2022 when scorpion capital scorpion published a lengthy report the scorpion report alleging that twist is a cash burning inferno that is not a going concern specifically scorpion alleged that among other things twist s purported dna chip technology is a farce comparable to theranos inc s now infamous non existent blood testing technology and that twist s growth and revenues are unsustainable among other issues according to the scorpion report twist is perpetuating its fraud through false reporting of capital expenditures and gross margins which scorpion claims are actually negative indeed scorpion s investigation of the forthcoming oregon facility revealed no evidence that twist is preparing to begin manufacturing there suggesting that the company is using the facility to hide large operating expenses as fraudulent capital expenditures scorpion further alleged that twist s growth is dependent upon unsustainable pricing strategies such as using below cost prices to undercut competitors by as much as 70 to 85 ultimately the scorpion report concluded that twist is operating a ponzi like scheme that will end in bankruptcy in response to the revelations in the scorpion report the price of twist common stock fell 7 57 per share or nearly 20 from a close of 38 00 per share on november 14 2022 to close at 30 43 per share on november 15 2022 the complaint alleges that throughout the class period the defendants made materially false and or misleading statements as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about twist s business and operations specifically as alleged in the scorpion report defendants overstated the commercial viability of twist s synthetic dna manufacturing technology while engaging in accounting fraud and using unsustainable pricing to inflate the company s true financial condition and prospects as a result of defendants wrongful acts and omissions and the significant decline in the market value of twist s common stock plaintiff and other members of the class have suffered significant damages what can i do twist investors may no later than february 10 2023 move the court to serve as lead plaintiff for

finally succumbs with chapter 11 filing the company had been losing ground for more than a decade he reported the company bet in the 2000s that natural gas would be scarce in coming years and then went on a buying spree as a result the company bought natural gas assets and companies at high prices and incurred lots of debt that story ended with chesapeake in bankruptcy court but that was then and this is now as the old saying goes the difference obviously is that oil and gas prices came out of the basement and shot into the attic petroleum companies that survived the loss of demand and low prices now look like winners again about chesapeake energy the company is an independent exploration and production company that produces oil natural gas and natural gas liquids or ngls from

basis had revenue of 7 32 billion since it came out of bankruptcy in february 2021 it has been actively buying and selling assets and companies in november 2021 it bought vine energy which is also involved in shale plays in louisiana for cash and shares january 2022 saw chesapeake acquire chief and assets held by tug hill for cash and shares these two companies also operated in marcellus shale area of pennsylvania that same month it agreed to sell its assets in wyoming for cash in its third quarter 2022 investor presentation it could point to several achievements that should make it attractive to investors competition chesapeake noted in its 10 k for 2021 that it competes with both integrated and independent oil and natural gas companies in addition it faces indirect competition from alternative energy including wind solar and electric power still it feels it has competitive advantages it said we believe that our technological expertise combined with our exploration land drilling and production capabilities and the experience of our management team enables us to compete effectively this performance chart compares chesapeake with two leading exploration and production companies that produce both oil and gas the first is canadian natural resources ltd cnq financial and the second is conocophillips cop financial despite its fall from grace earlier chesapeake is now keeping up with the big kids in its industry financial strength bearing in mind that chesapeake recently went through chapter 11 proceedings my assessment of its financial status will start with a history of its long term debt to get itself out of its legacy debt worth some 20 billion the company canceled its existing common shares and new common stock were issued to lenders that has turned out to be a good deal for lenders but for legacy shareholders investing in chesapeake was a disaster at emergence from the proceedings the company negotiated 925 million of debtor in possession financing a 600 million rights offering and a 2 5 billion exit financing package chesapeake also received permission to use fresh start accounting which meant it could become a new entity for financial reporting purposes turning to its current financial situation which began on feb 9 2021 it receives this assessment from gurufocus chesapeake receives a 5 out of 10 ranking for its financial strength based on its debt as measured by the interest coverage ratio its debt to revenue ratio and altman z score starting with the interest coverage ratio of 10 28 the company is on solid ground producing 10 28 in operating income for every dollar of interest on the debt the debt to revenue ratio comprises trailing 12 month debt of 2 71 billion and trailing 12 month revenue of 7 32 billion that s a ratio of 0 37 which is adequate the altman z score is 1 75 which puts it on the high end of the distress zone and just below the grey zone which begins at 1 80 overall it appears 5 out of 10 is a reasonable ranking for this formerly bankrupt stock profitability chesapeake receives a ranking of just 4 out of 10 for profitability based on its operating margin piotroski f score the trend of the operating margin and the consistency of its profitability the trend of the operating margin is measured over the past five years and the consistency of profitability is measured in previous years not months logically then we should expect a low ranking because these two measures take in the period when chesapeake filed for and went into chapter 11 the operating margin is relatively good with the light green bar signifying an above average margin for the oil and gas industry the piotroski f score has risen to 6 out of 9 after finishing 2021 at 3 out of 9 growth all those red bars on this table signal a company in trouble however these are three year metrics and so they include the bankruptcy period when chesapeake came out of bankruptcy it had much cleaner financial statements so if we were to break out these metrics on a year by year basis the last one would be much better here s what president and ceo nick dell osso said in releasing the first quarter 2022 earnings momentum continues to build for chesapeake as we execute our returns focused strategy we delivered record quarterly adjusted free cash flow initiated our 1 billion share and warrant repurchase program and continued realizing the synergies anticipated from the vine transaction which we look forward to replicating with our recently closed chief assets reflecting on second quarter improvements the company announced in its earnings release it had increased its base dividend by 10 and that it had retired some 670 million or approximately 7 6 million common shares it also doubled its shares and warrants buyback allocation to 2 billion more of the same came in the third quarter report as the company announced it had increased the quarterly dividend and repurchased common shares and warrants for this company growth in the past year is almost the opposite of the previous two years dividend and share repurchases chesapeake has both a base dividend and a variable dividend in the third quarter of 2021 the company adopted a variable return program that would lead to additional variable dividends beginning in march 2022 these payments would be equal to the sum of adjusted free cash flow from the prior quarter less the base quarterly dividend multiplied by 50 for the most recent quarter the company paid a base dividend of 55 cents and a variable dividend of 2 61 for a total of 3 16 per share based on a share price of 98 42 on dec 12 that works out to a yield of 9 74 is that yield sustainable it will be as long as it can generate similar or higher adjusted free cash flow that in turn depends on both the economy and oil and gas prices it is worth repeating that this is a variable dividend which provides flexibility for the company and occasional bonuses for investors turning to share buybacks chesapeake reported in its third quarter earnings release that it had bought back 11 6 million shares so far in 2022 still that s only a fraction of the new shares created coming out of chapter 11 the company also reported that 80 of the shares it repurchased came from former creditors that suggests many creditors have recovered much of what was owed to them it also should remind current investors that previous shareholders suffered heavy losses valuation since chesapeake s reorganization was in the immediate past many measures of valuation are not available however it has a price earnings ratio of 5 13 which is better than 67 96 of companies in the oil and gas industry it has a meaningless five year ebitda growth rate so there is no peg ratio similarly there is not enough data available for the gf value chart it is worth noting that share price has leveled out in recent months after a fairly steady rise gurus chesapeake is a favorite of howard marks trades portfolio of oaktree capital management he owned 9 800 000 shares at the end of the third quarter those shares represented a 7 32 stake in the company and 11 32 of his fund s assets under management jim simons trades portfolio renaissance technologies is also a significant investor with 1 071 820 shares while charles brandes trades portfolio of brandes investment had the third largest holding at 163 301 shares altogether 12 gurus have positions in the company institutional ownership shot up to just under 98 of shares outstanding at the end of 2021 before settling down to 69 64 at the end of the third quarter of 2022 conclusion chesapeake has risen from the ashes of a bad strategy call the unmanageable debt load was shed and lenders accepted new common shares to cover their potential losses and since shareholders are lowest in the pecking order they had to take the big losses since emerging from bankruptcy the company has turned itself around and is now a solid performer with a high dividend will it continue to deliver capital gains and dividends again tell me where oil and gas prices are going and you may know the answer

respiratory illnesses exerting significant impacts the territory s chief medical officer of health says we re only at the beginning of a harsh season of respiratory illnesses that are stressing the health care system pharmacies and schools by ethan lycan lang on december 12 2022 the territory s chief medical officer of health says we re only at the beginning of a harsh season of respiratory illnesses that are stressing the health care system pharmacies and schools after more than two years of pandemic regulations like masking and isolation that kept contagions more contained than usual this fall places around the world are dealing with a tripledemic as the new york times dubbed it a rise in cases of respiratory syncytial virus rsv covid 19 and influenza and the yukon isn t immune we re just staying very watchful dr sudit ranade the yukon s chief medical officer of health said in an interview last week i think that many jurisdictions had a couple of weeks where their health care system was severely strained and that strain seems to be reducing we haven t gotten to that point yet though it s not clear whether respiratory viruses are more prevalent than they have been in the past they re certainly spreading more than they have in the past two flu seasons in fact flu seasons practically disappeared during the first two years of the covid 19 pandemic when governments across the world including the yukon introduced restrictions to prevent the spread of airborne illnesses but the yukon like other jurisdictions around canada and the world eased its public health restrictions this year the state of emergency ended in march along with mask mandates and vaccine requirements then in november the territory shifted its pandemic strategy to handle covid 19 like any other respiratory illness reducing testing and isolation requirements as a result the yukon s hospitals pharmacies and schools are feeling extra strain this fall ranade said it s unsurprising to see respiratory illnesses resurge as the territory s pandemic response changes when we relaxed restrictions on the ways in which people can get together then we re going to see a rise in all of the respiratory viruses that would have been transmitted normally he told the star ranade said reinstating health regulations like mask mandates and physical distancing measures would be difficult to impose after more than two years of pandemic related regulations pandemic fatigue he said has reduced the public s appetite for renewed restrictions in a news conference on nov 25 canada s chief public health officer dr theresa tam addressed a rise in respiratory illnesses across the country this fall she encouraged canadians to take precautions against the rise in respiratory illnesses this season but didn t signal a return to health related mandates speaking of rsv influenza and coronavirus strains tam said there is an increased likelihood that we will encounter one or more of these viruses as we interact with others in schools workplaces and social settings especially indoors and if masks are not being worn she urged canadians to stay up to date on vaccinations and voluntarily take precautions like masking up to reduce this flu season s impact on the country s extremely stretched health systems here in the yukon shortages of hospital beds and health care workers along with an absence of any walk in clinic in the territory are already making it difficult for yukoners to access medical services a bad flu season could make things even worse influenza a is already circulating at significant levels in the territory and several seriously ill children have had to be medevaced to b c children s hospital in vancouver more than 3 000 yukoners are currently on the territory s waitlist for a family doctor meaning emergency rooms are overburdened by people seeking non emergency services like prescriptions for antibiotics ranade also said if more people need to be admitted to hospitals for treatment of respiratory illnesses capacity could become an issue fast the yukon hospital corp yhc website has indicated that inpatient beds at whitehorse general have been extremely limited since at least dec 1 though space at the dawson city and watson lake community hospitals was still shown to be available earlier this week in an email to the star yhc spokesperson isaac macdonald said whitehorse general s emergency department is seeing an increasing number of patients coming in with flu like symptoms we anticipate a significant flu season this year with higher than average respiratory illness cases the email said macdonald added that numbers are higher than they were in the pandemic but in line with years before covid 19 restrictions still he said longer emergency wait times may be coming as a result case numbers for respiratory illnesses in the territory seem small between nov 15 and today the yukon reported 84 influenza cases 24 covid cases and four rsv cases but those figures don t paint the full picture ranade noted there are still a substantial portion of people who would have these diseases but whose symptoms are mild enough that they would not present to a place where they would get tested he said at the beginning of november the total number of officially confirmed yukon covid 19 cases stood at 4 983 figures from yukon classrooms are more illustrative of the toll this year s respiratory season is taking on the territory for the first two weeks of november about 23 per cent of students at yukon schools were absent for at least part of the first two weeks of november according to figures provided by the department of education in an email last monday those numbers are actually similar to last year s average from the same time last year but ted hupé the president of the yukon association of education professionals said some classrooms have been hit harder than others while the overall average is not unusual hupé said he d heard from rural classrooms that have had up to 80 per cent of students out sick that s made it hard to staff schools he said when students get sick it s usually followed by teacher absenteeism a few days later or a week later because schools are one big petri dish on a good day he said that s led to teachers covering each other s classes in some instances the system doesn t have the capacity to cover all the bases he said adding that he hopes the upcoming holiday break will help ease the spread of illnesses christmas is coming at a good time joanne gibson the president of the yukon pharmacists association said pharmacies are having trouble staying staffed with pharmacists out sick or having to stay home with sick kids unable to go to daycare she also said pharmacists are working to ensure they have enough antibiotics in stock to treat respiratory infections as more yukoners seek treatment gibson said she hopes pharmacists could bring some relief to emergency rooms and doctors later this month though starting dec 28 she noted pharmacists will be able to make prescriptions for minor ailments though they won t be able to prescribe antibiotics necessarily she hopes the new authority will take some of the burden off doctors working to treat more serious issues see gibson s column on flu shots p 7 that could be a big help because according to ranade the yukon is just at the beginning of its respiratory illness season and yukoners need to prepare aside from getting vaccinated against covid 19 and influenza health and social services reports only 8 610 yukoners have received their flu shot since roll outs started in october ranade recommended yukoners take preventative health care action this respiratory season a balanced diet regular sleep and exercise prepare the immune system to handle viruses ranade said when vaccinations and a healthy lifestyle fail to stave off sickness ranade said it s important that people isolate themselves from others as best they can and mask up when they have to go out in public for groceries and other necessities i think it s the simple practical things that we re going to start kind of continuing to reinforce he said but they re the things that i think people have been more attuned to over the last couple of years

by joey roulette and steve gorman reuters nasa s orion capsule barreled through earth s atmosphere and splashed down in the pacific ocean on sunday after making an uncrewed voyage around the moon winding up the inaugural mission of the u s agency s new artemis lunar program 50 years to the day after apollo s final moon landing the gumdrop shaped orion capsule carrying a simulated crew of three mannequins wired with sensors plunked down in the ocean at 9 40 a m pst 1740 gmt off mexico s baja california peninsula demonstrating a high stakes homecoming before nasa flies its first crew of artemis astronauts around the moon in the next few years this was a challenging mission and this is what mission success looks like nasa s artemis i mission manager mike sarafin told reporters after splashdown adding that his team didn t immediately notice any issues with orion s return from space a u s military helicopter and a group of fast boats approached the capsule after splashdown for about five hours of inspections before orion is hoisted aboard a u s naval vessel for a trip to san diego california the splashdown capped a 25 day mission less than a week after passing about 79 miles 127 km above the moon in a lunar fly by and came about two weeks after reaching its farthest point in space nearly 270 000 miles 434 500 km from earth roughly 30 minutes before splashing down the capsule committed to a fiery 20 minute plunge into earth s atmosphere when it shedded its service module in space exposing a heatshield that reached peak temperatures of nearly 5 000 degrees fahrenheit 2 760 degrees celsius during its blazing fast descent atmospheric friction slowed the capsule from 24 500 miles per hour 39 400 kph to 325 mph followed by two sets of parachutes that helped brake its speed to an expected 20 mph at splashdown the capsule showed a perfect descent rate navias said the capsule blasted off on nov 16 from the kennedy space center at cape canaveral florida atop nasa s towering next generation space launch system sls now the world s most powerful rocket and the biggest nasa has built since the saturn v of the apollo era the debut sls orion voyage kicked off apollo s successor program artemis aimed at returning astronauts to the lunar surface this decade and establishing a sustainable base there as a stepping stone to future human exploration of mars mission engineers will spend months examining data from the artemis i mission a crewed artemis ii flight around the moon and back could come as early as 2024 followed within a few more years by the program s first lunar landing of astronauts one of them a woman with artemis iii nasa expects to name its crew of astronauts for the artemis ii mission in early 2023 nasa s johnson space center director vanessa wyche told reporters though orion encountered some unexpected communication blackouts and an electrical issue during its voyage around the moon nasa has given high marks to the performance of both sls and orion so far boasting that they exceeded the u s space agency s expectations this has been an extraordinarily successful mission nasa administrator bill nelson told reporters by coincidence the return to earth of artemis i unfolded on the 50th anniversary of the apollo 17 moon landing of gene cernan and harrison schmitt on dec 11 1972 they were the last of 12 nasa astronauts to walk on the moon during a total of six apollo missions starting in 1969 the artemis program named after the twin sister of apollo marks a major turning point for nasa redirecting its human spaceflight program beyond low earth orbit after decades focused on space shuttles and the iss nasa considered re entry the single most critical phase of orion s journey testing whether its newly designed heat shield can withstand atmospheric friction and safely protect astronauts that would be on board it is our priority one objective sarafin said at a briefing last week there is no arc jet or aerothermal facility here on earth capable of replicating hypersonic re entry with a heat shield of this size nasa officials have stressed the experimental nature of the artemis i mission marking the first launch of the boeing nyse co built sls and the first combined with orion which previously flew a brief two orbit test launched on a smaller delta iv rocket in 2014 the capsule was built by lockheed martin nyse compared with apollo born of the cold war era u s soviet space race artemis is more science driven and broad based enlisting other countries and commercial partners such as elon musk s spacex and the space agencies of europe canada and japan orion s european space agency supplied service module a housing for its propulsion system that was jettisoned before the capsule s descent into earth s atmosphere performed beautifully esa s mission manager philippe deloo said in a statement this is a great day not only for america but it s a great day for all of our international partners that s the difference from 50 years ago nelson said

decades that was one of the reasons kbw upgraded its recommendation on banks in sept 2021 to overweight but the group hasn t fared particularly well amid a broader stock selloff on fears that the fed would trigger an economic downturn that would increase loan losses bank fundamentals proved strong but multiples still narrowed and remain cheap and this is despite higher eps estimates the analysts noted the slowing revenue growth will make positive eps revisions more challenging and will hurt the group s ability to trade higher they added within its larger call the analysts said investors should favor bigger lenders especially those with wall street operations over smaller banks that rely solely on earning interest income under its most likely scenario kbw said that morgan stanley

economists at goldman sachs expect fed policy makers on wednesday to signal their median expectation is for rates to hit a range of 5 to 5 25 up by half a percentage point from their last projection some investors also continue to make moves in anticipation of the fed cutting interest rates during the second half of 2023 rate cuts generally act like steroids for stocks and other investments but the fed has been insisting it plans to hold rates at a high level for some time to ensure the battle against inflation is won even if inflation is indeed on its way down the global economy still faces threats from the rate increases already pushed through the housing industry and other businesses that rely on low interest rates have shown particular weakness and worries are rising about the strength of corporate profits broadly inflation data and fed is yesterday s news focus on earnings risk was the title of a report published monday by strategists at morgan stanley the next big milestone for markets comes tuesday when the u s government releases the latest update on inflation at the consumer level economists forecast that inflation slowed to 7 3 last month from 7 7 in october the data will arrive as the fed begins its two day policy meeting on what to do with interest rates besides raising short term rates the fed is also making other moves with its vast trove of bond investments that should effectively allow longer term yields to rise the yield on the 10 year treasury which helps set rates for mortgages and other economy setting loans rose to 3 61 from 3 59 late friday the two year yield which tends to more closely track expectations for the fed rose to 4 39 from 4 34 wall street was rising monday to open a week where central banks are likely to unload the year s final barrage of interest rate hikes meant to drive down the world s painfully high inflation the s p 500 was 0 7 higher in afternoon trading trimming its loss for the year to 16 9 the dow jones industrial average was up 296 points or 0 9 at 33 771 as of 2 49 p m eastern time and the nasdaq composite was 0 5 higher the indexes are coming off their first weekly loss in three weeks the main reasons for wall street s struggles for much of this year have been high inflation and the higher interest rates engineered to combat it on wednesday markets expect the federal reserve to announce its last rate hike of the year following a blitzkrieg that began in march higher rates slow the economy by design and risk causing a recession if they go too high all while dragging down prices of investments one upside for investors is that the fed has hinted it will dial down the size of its rate hikes leading to expectations for a more modest increase of 0 50 percentage points wednesday that would follow four straight mega hikes of 0 75 percentage points each was triple the fed s usual move and they lifted the central bank s key overnight rate to a range of 3 75 to 4 after starting the year at virtually zero other central banks around the world are also likely to raise their own rates by half a percentage point this week including the european central bank any dial down in the size of rate hikes would mean less added pain for markets and the economy such hopes have helped stocks and bonds rally since mid october as investors have taken data reports to mean the worst of inflation has finally passed and would allow the fed to ease up but expectations for a slowdown in rate hikes may also be setting some investors up for disappointment if central banks signal this week they ll ultimately take rates higher than markets expect while they aren t the clear majority of the market many traders are betting the fed s overnight interest rate will top out at a range of 4 75 to 5 next year for example in overseas stock markets asian indexes fell amid signs of a surge in coronavirus infections in china the country is in the midst of easing some of its zero covid pandemic restrictions which stifled the world s second largest economy on wall street microsoft rose 2 and was the biggest single force lifting the s p 500 the london stock exchange group agreed to a 10 year deal where it will move data to microsoft s cloud and spend at least 2 8 billion microsoft is also taking a 4 ownership stake in the company shares in horizon therapeutics jumped 15 2 after amgen announced it would acquire the biopharmaceutical company for about 26 4 billion stocks of energy producers were also making big gains after the price of oil rose last week crude prices scraped their lowest levels of the year on worries about a weakening global economy which would mean less demand for energy ap business writer elaine kurtenbach contributed from bangkok and ap business writer matt ott contributed from washington

a philadelphia farmer has partnered with a school in west chester to use some of its farmland for organic farming and agricultural education christa barfield the owner and operator of farmerjawn agriculture will lease 123 acres of westtown school s land beginning in january the acres will be used for organic farming educational programs and to stock a farm market nobody knows where their food comes from and that s a tragedy in itself barfield told phillyvoice and so for farmerjawn to be able to be a beacon of understanding of where food comes from and the importance of knowing who your farmer is it s everyone s right to know who s growing their food westtown school located 20 miles west of philadelphia in west chester is a quaker coeducational day and boarding school for students in pre kindergarten through 12th grade a portion of the campus 600 acres has been leased for farming use since 1996 although the land around westtown has been cultivated for hundreds of years starting with the lenni lenape people upon the announcement of the former farmer s retirement westtown began a farmland task force and commenced a months long search for a community minded partner with a commitment to a regenerative relationship with the land the task force was impressed by barfield s experience approach and strong alignment with the school s mission and strategic vision and is pleased to invite her to campus as our new partner westtown s head of school chris benbow said in a release barfield will farm half the land and use it to stock a 3 000 square foot farm market already located on the school premises which will operate under the farmerjawn name beginning in april using crops grown onsite she hopes to create sunflower seeds potato chips and a hot sauce line to be sold at the market the farm will also supply local food businesses food artisans and chefs mike prince peter breslow consulting public relations the remaining acreage will become a farming incubator made up of five to 10 acre cooperative farms operated by a cohort of black farmers farmerjawn launched a farmer incubator for black and brown adults this year offering agricultural entrepreneurship opportunities as well as education on farming and impacting urban networks and food systems so far 10 people were chosen out of 50 applications and seven have already graduated essentially people who have interest in farming and need a place to start this gives them the land and gives them access to equipment and resources to be able to feel successful in this venture as they get off the ground barfield said and that s what we want to provide but with a specific focus on black and brown individuals who in many ways have been robbed of the opportunity for advancement in every aspect whether looking at trying to start a business or just housing or food access and insecurity all of the farming on the land will be done organically since part of the farmerjawn mission is to advocate for healthy organic food through regenerative farming practices it allows us to heal the land for the people that are growing on it and that are living near it barfield said because a lot of those chemicals yes they re airborne and you know the people that are farming the land are directly impacted by whatever chemicals are being sprayed and the people that live in that community and the children that go to school and the faculty that work there are heavily impacted by breathing in the air outside of just feeding people there s a physical impact environmental impact as well as a social impact jubilee justice an organization that supports black farming communities helped make the connection between barfield and westtown school as they hoped to have a black farmer in the role several experienced farmers went through the proposal process to lease the westtown farmland but barfield notes that in choosing her the school revealed its desire for change i decided to become a farmer five years ago and have been farming for the last two and a half years barfield said that means looking at the differences you know change is what i see and so this partnership with the school is very telling to me they have a want to be anti racist and to be in alignment with this vision for black and brown infusion in agriculture and also they recognize their need for regenerative and organic reformation of lands because their land has been farmed very conventionally it s been sprayed with roundup for decades barfield formerly worked in health care before becoming a philadelphia based urban farmer in 2018 when she created farmerjawn agriculture some of farmerjawn s top priorities are nutritional security for local citizens and restoring access to farmland and farming for black farmers barfield s organization includes a retail and garden learning center in germantown a community supported agriculture csa business and five acres of land in elkins park we actually really connected the food system between the urban locations that we have the suburban locations that we have and now this rural location barfield said and we create one succinct true system a complete new system for the philadelphia region which i m really really excited about

with the holidays fast approaching and the possibility that the current federal estate and gift tax exemption being reduced from 12 060 000 per person for 2022 to approximately 6 000 000 as of january 2026 the importance of deciding whether to make significant monetary and or property gifts to one s children grandchildren and other loved ones is significantly higher for high net worth individuals the potential loss of millions of dollars of the gift and estate tax exemption is an important issue especially if the size of the gift could result in the payment of a gift tax additionally the recent drop in the value of one s stocks and other assets creates and opportunity to give away potential appreciated assets at a time they are of lower value thus reducing the amount of one s exemptions that needs to be used as to the issue of taxation of a gift a donor can gift up to 16 000 per donee per year for the year 2022 free of any gift taxes this amount increases to 17 000 per donee per year in 2023 the donee recipient of the gift is not taxed on the amount of the gift even if it is greater than 16 000 however if the donor makes a gift in excess of 16 000 per donee in any calendar year he or she is required to file a gift tax return by april 15th of the following year the filing of a federal gift tax return does not mean that the donor will have to pay any gift taxes as they will be able to apply their federal exemption for federal estate and gift taxes to the amount of any gift above the 16 000 per donee in any calendar year for example a single non married donor makes a gift of 100 000 in the year 2022 to his son or daughter 16 000 of the gift is tax free and 84 000 would be subtracted from the donor s federal exemption amount of 12 06 million dollars for federal estate and gift taxes available through 12 31 2022 the federal exemption increases to 12 920 000 in 2023 if the donor is married their spouse can join in on the gift and then reduce the taxable amount of the gift to 68 000 and only 32 000 would be subtracted from the life time exemption for each donor it should be noted that new york does not have a gift tax the existence of the largest approximately twelve million dollar federal estate and gift tax exemption which expires on 12 31 2025 unless made permanent by law creates a great opportunity for individuals to remove highly appreciating assets from their taxable estate it is also a great way of reducing the assets one owns which may be subjected to one s long term care costs because the above stated exemption expires sunsets as above stated many affluent individuals are using the current exemption and the 2023 exemption to make significant gifts they are also taking advantage of the internal revenue service previously stating that they will not claw back into one s taxable estate any gifts made before the exemption changes if it is later reduced the other issue that needs to be addressed by the donor is whether he or she wants the gift to the donee to be an outright gift that is free of any trust this is a decision that often requires consideration of a number of factors such as the age of the donee child or adult the ability of the donee to appropriately manage his or her financial affairs and whether or not the donee is financially responsible the creation of an irrevocable trust for the beneficiary is a prudent way of gifting and managing assets for a loved one the trustee of the trust can be given the discretion to use the assets and income of the trust to or for the benefit of the trust beneficiary as delineated in the trust the trust can also specify the age the trust beneficiary is to receive the trust assets outright and the trust can also have more than one beneficiary additionally the assets transferred to the irrevocable trust will be protected against any claims the beneficiary ies could have against them until the time the trust makes a distribution to them outright additionally one can give the trustee s the authority to continue the trust beyond the set termination date if doing so is in the best interest of the beneficiary the assets in the trust will also not be subject to equitable distribution claims in new york in the event the beneficiary gets divorced furthermore if the beneficiary develops any disabilities during the term of the trust and the beneficiary needs any federal and or state aid a properly drafted trust will allow the beneficiary ies share to be continued as a special needs trust for the beneficiary which will not impact their eligibility for any federal and or state programs in conclusion unless one is making a relatively small gift to a donee and there are no concerns as to the donee squandering or wasting said monies an outright gift may not be appropriate in most instances the use of a trust to hold the gift is a much wiser option even the three wise men would have approved of it

as concerns about china s dominant economic position in industry mount natural resources minister jonathan wilkinson is unveiling a new international alliance aimed at securing the critical minerals needed to transition off fossil fuels wilkinson announced the sustainable critical minerals alliance monday at the united nations biodiversity conference underway in montreal days after canada published its critical minerals strategy to grow the sector domestically the new alliance includes canada the united states the united kingdom france germany australia and japan critical minerals are essential if we want to reach our climate objectives wilkinson said at the same time the processing manufacturing and recycling of critical minerals are a generational opportunity for canada but also for our partners and allies critical minerals refer to metals and minerals like lithium nickel copper and cobalt that are essential to the energy transition because they re used for things like electric vehicle batteries solar panels and wind farms today s announcement is a step forward for a global economy that is more resilient clean inclusive and sustainable speaking to reporters earlier at the cop15 biodiversity conference prime minister justin trudeau put the country s focus on critical minerals more bluntly we don t want to be reliant on authoritarian states for our sources he said so that s one of the reasons why canada over the past years has really set up this entire supply chain we suddenly bounced up to number 2 in the global rankings of battery supply chains right after china out of nowhere because we ve been putting all these pieces into place he added the voluntary alliance aims to build market share for its members through collaboration to do this members are pledging to centre indigenous communities and climate concerns in supply chains as it s expected environmental social and governance esg metrics will become increasingly important for attracting investment for example if a canadian mining company can secure a high esg rating by lowering its greenhouse gas emissions and employing a certain percentage of indigenous people it will be easier to attract investment from a u k bank the mining industry has long been proven to be neither sustainable nor just in canada and around the world says standearth s alicia guzmán as a new critical mineral alliance is launched at cop15 specifically the commitments countries in the alliance are taking on include adopting a nature positive approach that prevents biodiversity loss restoring ecosystems reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building a circular economy by promoting the reuse and recycling of critical minerals the voluntary commitments also include supporting local and indigenous communities by respecting the respective rights and interests and fostering ethical corporate practices which was not defined in the announcement the alliance is also calling for its members to co operate on its vision of sustainable mining at international institutions like the united nations environment assembly the international energy agency the world bank and the organization for economic co operation and development
many low lying areas are under the threat of sea level rise which could make them uninhabitable by 2100 according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change the world will continue to experience severe climate related disasters unless global warming is reduced below 2 degrees celsius preferably to 1 5 degree celsius we can confront climate related disasters and live safely through climate enactment presently the united states has taken the lead by implementing the inflation reduction act one of the three climate relevant laws passed in the last 12 months to protect the people ira was passed in the legislature in august the act makes a financial commitment to lessen the cost of transitioning into clean energy as well as providing an enabling environment for green jobs about 370bn has been budgeted to fight climate change some of it in the form of tax credits and rebates to help consumers save thousands of dollars on energy efficient appliances plug in vehicles and renewable electricity for their homes coral davenport reported in the new york times experts say the ira is the largest bill to be passed that addresses climate change focusing on infusing clean energy into the economic social system of the country the bill targets reducing carbon emissions by 42 per cent as projections place the country to achieve its net zero targets it would also invest 391bn into climate change and energy security a pathway to make the us energy independent some investment areas in the ira are 128bn for renewable energy 30bn for nuclear power 13bn for electric vehicle incentives 36bn for home energy 37bn for advanced manufacturing 32bn for rural economies and 3bn tax incentives for installing carbon capture it also makes allocation for disadvantaged communities forestland farmers environmental justice climate smart agriculture and decarbonisation achieving and implementing a policy such as ira requires sound fiscal measures ira is a fiscal policy that generates revenue through an increase in tax and proceeds from government initiatives according to the report spending for ira is derived from a minimum tax of 15 per cent on large corporations and one per cent excise tax on stock buybacks other areas where the ira spending is coming from include internal revenue service tax enforcement funding methane fee superfund fee and savings from health care initiatives with 500bn in ira spending as estimated and 737bn in revenues expected over the next 10 years the country will save 237bn developed countries can emulate this policy by raising levies on fossil fuel proceeds and using the fund to reduce the cost of transitioning to clean energy and investment similarly developing countries like nigeria can utilise climate funds as an incentive to lower the cost organisations incur while switching to green operations according to gates notes leaders can confront the climate crisis by providing enabling environment for private sector investment in clean energy start ups and prioritising public investments in green technology research and development ira provides a climate resilience framework which could help countries to curtail the disastrous impact and risk of losing lives property and settlements to hazardous effects according to national centers for environmental information report the us has lost more than 1bn to 15 weather climate disaster events from january 1 2022 to october 11 2022 in lagos nigeria we experience flooding often as the lagos wall a sea defence to protect lagos atlantic city and victoria island alone could not stop the perennial flooding the signing of the ira highlighted how finances would be generated through tax incentives and tax credit relief on the other hand provisions are made for vulnerable and disadvantaged communities suffering the effect of emissions also residential energy cost is reduced to adopt and improve home energy efficiency it also captures improvements in electricity heating ventilation air conditioning transportation aviation and industrialisation for a climate resilience framework countries must prioritise sustainable policies to mitigate the effect of climate change in making these policies climate adaptation mechanisms and preventive actions must be key regarding provisions that can be implemented to help communities the signing of the ira will address the climate change effect by opening up the us to opportunities in energy transition this is somewhat of a template for developing countries like nigeria emulating the ira will accelerate other countries efforts and aid the world s commitments to confront the climate crisis

daniel radcliffe jonathan groff and lindsay mendez in merrily we roll aong joan marcus dreams don t die they sing their words as much a reflection on their own lives as our wishes for the play world they re inhabiting merrily we roll along that famous flop has never completely worked not in harold prince s original production not fully in any of the five subsequent revivals i ve seen but our desire for stephen sondheim and george furth s heartbreaker of a musical to feel greater than the sum of its parts never wanes and now at new york theatre workshop this aspiration is finally realized something is stirring on east 4th street where maria friedman s reputation redefining merrily has transferred 10 years after its premiere from london s menier chocolate factory friedman herself a veteran of the show as an actor rescues the property from the excellent score bad book files and using the now standard version fashioned by sondheim and furth after the broadway closing in 1981 creates a piece that feels remarkably whole the result is musical theater heaven in a two and a half hour package i didn t want it to end err start yes merrily is famously told backwards much like the drama by kaufman and hart that inspired it it begins well finishes in 1976 at the swanky manse of composer turned movie producer franklin shepard jonathan groff who is celebrating the release of his latest picture with his sycophantic hollywood pals frank has it all but does he really his ex wife beth katie rose clarke took him to the cleaners he s estranged from his son carter harris alternating with colin keane and his current marriage to his broadway star former paramour gussie krystal joy brown won t survive the night frank is also divorced from his best pals once the musical half of a wildly successful broadway songwriting team his longstanding partnership with lyricist charles kringas daniel radcliffe ended after charley embarrassed him on national television the third in their triumvirate novelist drama critic mary flynn lindsay mendez has turned into a self destructive alcoholic after spending 20 years secretly loving frank furth and sondheim gradually peel back the layers to reveal the choices that led them to their current states until frank charley and mary have their first meeting as idealistic young dreamers on a rooftop in 1959 it s the reverse chronology that so often renders the show unplayable namely the actors hitting the emotional beats necessary to get from the desperation of the first act to the optimistic innocence of the second friedman who first staged this merrily as a student production in 2010 isn t hung up on the tricksiness of the book she refocuses it as a memory play where frank s past experiences come to life around him in his house in the hills through the glow of amith chandrashaker s lighting you can practically imagine the hollywood sign taunting him in the background of soutra gilmour s moneyed set this choice not only makes sense of the unconventional storytelling but makes the back half of the show before the three friends have been corrupted by life and success even more devastating than usual especially in the hands of the three best pals at the center lindsay mendez katie rose clarke jonathan groff and daniel radcliffe in merrily we roll along joan marcus groff mendez and radcliffe are the other reason for the production s sterling success giving career best performances not only do they have palpable chemistry but you actually buy them as friends and i ve seen this show plenty of times where you don t you can sense the gut punching disappointment when their relationships come crashing down and the palpable joy they find in the successes that paved the way they sing the absolute hell out of sondheim s best score old friends opening doors and our time have never sounded better radcliffe s adorably bashful charlie is filled with nervous energy which he uses to huge success in franklin shepard inc a number that absolutely brings down the house on the page frank is a cipher and you never really know what makes him tick groff grounds him in the reality of a man who watched all his dreams come true and it s only after he reaches the height of his powers that he realizes it s not what he wants at all it s mendez who s the revelation though making a three course meal out of mary when all furth left was hors d ourves that she finds so much nuance in a relatively one note role is a testament to her intelligence as an artist the supporting performances are a little rougher around the edges furth left some sharp lines as crumbs for gussie the broadway star who steals frank away from his wife but brown doesn t use them as well as mendez does she plays the stock villain to good effect but doesn t add much reg rogers could come on a little stronger as joe josephson the broadway producer who while still married to gussie first took a chance on frank and charley clarke could use a little more color here and there too but her not a day goes by is filled with the perfect amount of crushing disappointment conductor alvin hough jr brings the best out of his nine piece band which plays jonathan tunick s orchestrations with such verve that they sound three times the size kai harada s sound design allowing us to hear every instrument is on par gilmour s stylish costumes and cookie jordan s wigs are fascinating realistically declaring the changing tastes and styles of the passing years and decades is this merrily we roll along as it was meant to be all along i think so friedman s production is something of a miracle finding the beating heart at the center of a story about friendship dreams regrets and times gone by they have a good thing going indeed
