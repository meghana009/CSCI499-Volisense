a nationwide tradition viewed by some americans as a patriotic display recognizing service and sacrifice represents for others a sectarian religious symbol amounting to desecration complaints about the popular wreaths across america day when fresh evergreen wreaths are placed at gravesites of military veterans at national and local cemeteries are climbing in the weeks leading up to this year s event says the founder of a civil rights advocacy organization that s protesting the practice we have no problem if people reach out and want a wreath on their deceased veterans graves but to put them everywhere to blanket them without permission of the surviving families is unconstitutional an atrocity and a disgrace said mikey weinstein founder of the military religious freedom foundation the crucifix is at the crux of the opposition weinstein who is jewish and his supporters who include jews muslims buddhists sikhs the jedi church as well as christians believe the wreath pays homage to christianity this should be an aspect of respect weinstein said it s almost like a fundamentalist christian gang sign to put a symbol of the christian season of christmas on any grave amber caron spokeswoman for the maine headquartered wreaths across america said the wreaths each hand made of 10 boughs of balsam tied with a red velveteen bow are veterans wreaths not christmas wreaths we are not decorating graves but honoring american heroes she said the idea of placing wreaths on deceased military members graves began informally at arlington national cemetery in december 1992 when a family who owns a wreath making business in maine donated their leftover stock to the army run cemetery in virginia since becoming a nonprofit in 2007 wreaths across america has expanded to 3 100 burial sites including 145 of 154 national cemetery administration properties caron said individuals as well as groups such as american legion posts and scouting programs contributed 24 9 million to wreaths across america in the fiscal year ending june 30 2020 tax forms show volunteers are expected to lay nearly 2 million wreaths on graves during this year s observance on dec 18 the mission caron said is to remember all the fallen honor those that serve in the military and their families and teach the next generation the value of freedom weinstein calls the custom proselytizing to argue that it isn t a christian symbol is preposterous he said imagine if that was an atheist satanic or jewish symbol throughout history wreaths have been laced with symbolism from various cultures including paganism and often denote the spiritual belief in life everlasting and the rebirth of the spirit weinstein s organization requested in 2014 that wreaths across america not place wreaths at headstones of departed service members that display the jewish star of david known in hebrew as magen david leaving live flowers or wreaths at headstones is normally not a jewish ritual in 2017 a photo circulated with a wreath from the program leaning on a headstone with a star of david some jewish families request the wreaths caron said and sometimes volunteers unintentionally place them at a grave with the jewish star wreaths across america s official policy states that the organization is not affiliated with any religion or political view she pointed out the program follows the policies of cemeteries that grant permission for the annual remembrance ceremony caron said sign up for free military brief your weekly local update on local military news and events sent straight to your inbox sign up view all of our newsletters success thank you for subscribing to our newsletter view all of our newsletters at cemeteries that don t have formal policies volunteers do not place a wreath on the headstones of those graves marked with the star of david out of respect for jewish custom the organization s policy states we simply pause and pay our respects the only exception is when families of the deceased request a wreath and then their wishes are honored the national cemetery administration honors that policy to the best of our ability said michael brophy director of the fort logan national cemetery complex in denver which has more than 105 000 graves the federal agency allows wreaths across america to set wreaths at gravesites but does not carry out any function of the program brophy said volunteers do but cemetery staff check graves to see if any graves are marked incorrectly brophy said anyone who has concerns about gravesite decorations or other issues should contact the cemetery he said fort logan keeps a list of requests regarding such matters brophy said and abides by them as a general matter of course for any reason of concern we try to try to reach a mutual accommodation and respect the wishes of families of loved ones interred brophy said weinstein said his organization has received thousands of grievances since wreaths across america expanded nationwide 15 years ago this year the office has fielded an overwhelming number of complaints weinstein said producing hundreds of angry phone calls letters and emails about the program he s calling for cemeteries to require families permission instead of an opt out system to address the matter fort logan a national cemetery under the auspices of the department of veterans affairs has not received any complaints brophy said it seems to be quite popular he said of the wreath laying event which this year has raised enough money for volunteers to place 12 000 wreaths at fort logan in a yearly rotation so that all graves are periodically covered he expects up to 2 000 volunteers for the public ceremony that starts at 10 a m on dec 18 the united states air force academy for the eighth time will place donated wreaths on all 1 350 gravesites on the military installation in colorado springs said spokesman dean j miller wreaths were donated from contributions of americans nationwide he said and are arriving from the air force services agency in san antonio texas no taxpayer dollars were used for the wreaths he said no religious affiliation is associated with wreaths by the academy and all requests to opt out of such honors received from families of veterans interred at the academy cemetery are honored miller said in an email the academy s mortuary affairs officer said in her nearly 30 years in her post she has never received a request to opt out from families of interred veterans sponsorship of the 15 wreaths topped the goal of covering all 2 600 gravesites at the pikes peak national cemetery this year said wreaths across america cemetery coordinator jennifer kendig she s a member of the american legion ladies auxiliary in falcon so many people come out and support this event because it means a lot to honor the veterans that have passed kendig said it s heart warming to see fundraising produced enough money to buy more than 3 000 wreaths this year with the overage offered to other area cemeteries or applied to next year s ceremony she said sponsoring organizations receive 5 from every wreath sold some of which is donated to veterans organizations in the falcon area she added weinstein said he and his wife started the organization he heads after their children attended the air force academy and were subject to anti semitism over the past 16 years he said his organization has represented nearly 77 000 clients who oppose certain practices pertaining to the military that they believe have religious overtones most wish to remain anonymous weinstein said for fear of retribution but he believes they all have the right to dissent when religion primarily christianity is infused into the military culture and lifestyle people say you re scrooge weinstein but this is wrong and un american to assume every veteran would want a wreath on their grave he said these veterans have given their all for this country and they can t fight back now we re going to continue fighting for them
from birch gold group we are living in strange times to demonstrate how strange at least partly here s a brief state of the economy as 2021 winds down between november 8th and december 1st the dow jones industrial average lost 2 400 points that loss is quite substantial but the dow s volatility has been incredible since january the dow has whipsawed all year long it lost then regained more than 1 200 points in january again in may then again late may through june you might think the dow was nervous investors certainly are which brings us to the present moment and more proof that the state of the u s financial markets could be described as perilous at best all it takes is the fed signal to panic wall street much like the bat signal which immediately gets batman to spring into action the fed signal has appeared recently re appointed chairman powell mentioned the possibility of discussing faster tapering of asset purchases sometime note this wasn t an official declaration the next fomc meeting is dec 14 according to a recent wall street journal article powell only gave a hint of potential tapering mr powell during a senate hearing on tuesday said it would be appropriate for the fed to consider accelerating the reduction of its asset purchase stimulus program at its meeting on dec 14 15 basically powell talked about talking about considering a small change in the fed s plans no action was taken nothing changed even that was too much for wall street the dow immediately lost 650 points on november 29 wolf richter called what was supposed to be a hugely profitable day for retailers red friday and leveled sharp criticism at wall street and already the crybabies on wall street have come out in force clamoring for the fed to end the tapering of its asset purchases and to push out the expected interest rate hikes into distant infinity and to maybe even re start qe all over again before they even ended it because you know stocks aren t ever allowed to drop not even a little bit off their ridiculously inflated highs during what was supposed to be a popular holiday travel week major travel companies listed on the s p 500 took a huge hit after powell s remarks royal caribbean 13 2 norwegian cruise line 11 4 carnival corporation 11 0 united airlines 9 6 according to wolfstreet the damage wasn t limited to the travel sector major companies like american express lost 8 5 in value visa took a 2 7 hit and apple dropped 3 2 for context that s about 80 billion of paper profits disappearing shortly after powell s comment if we look at the numbers the fed s ongoing quantitative easing qe buys up 120 billion in bonds per month every month since march 2020 wall street s fear of losing even a fraction of that free money resulted in plunge of 120 billion in stocks in a single day we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us either that s a gross overreaction or wall street and the stock market are simply puppets of the fed either way this taper talk isn t the factor highlighting the market s fragility omicron stampedes stock bulls one word that spooked wall street and mainstream media in a major way on december 1st was omicron early reports show this latest covid 19 mutation to have only mild symptoms and fast transmission but that didn t stop the dow from going crazy on mainstream media reports of the first case in california average djia fell around 462 points or 1 3 to close near 34 022 according to preliminary figures a pullback of more than 980 points from the blue chip gauge s intraday high extreme volatility like this is a symptom of fear that can be triggered at a moment s notice even if the market bounces back quickly after this kind of abrupt drop the canny observer sees just how fragile the market is at a time like this when fundamentals are weak and prices absurdly high any bad news could send everyone trampling one another to get to the exit but where are they running to typically fleeing the stock market means hoarding cash however one of the smartest investors alive claims that cash isn t safe ray dalio cash is not a safe investment just the few examples above clearly show that the market is extremely volatile right now they also serve as a good reminder of how fragile the u s financial market is if all it takes is a new virus variant powell s prognostication or other minor media triggers to spook the market into a downward spiral then it s a good idea to keep a frequent eye on your money ray dalio founder of the world s largest hedge fund bridgewater associates and one of the sharpest analysts in the world agrees cash is not a safe investment because it will be taxed by inflation know how to balance a portfolio when equities go down then you see the bond market gold go up wealth is not destroyed as much as it is transferred and if you know how to balance those investments that s the most important thing be in a safe well balanced portfolio you can reduce your risk without reducing your return we know the markets are overvalued dalio seems to think that excess wealth will transfer and the solution is a well balanced portfolio basically that means own different kinds of assets so that when one asset class goes up you can transfer the wealth into lower priced assets his claim that diversification reduces risk without reducing return is well documented so take a look at your own portfolio and determine whether it s diversified into assets that can reduce your risk during volatile times like these don t neglect the so called alternative assets like physical precious metals by diversifying with physical gold and silver you ll gain exposure to assets that may perform very differently over the long term you ll also enjoy a significant advantage in a high inflation environment dalio s advice reminds us it s our own responsibility to do everything we can to ensure our savings are both diversified and balanced our risks are managed and our futures secured
the risk of renewed war with russia is dangerously near and patriot missiles cannot help ukraine in such a timeframe moscow might use a move by washington to give patriot missiles or other strategically impactful weapons to ukraine as a pretext to justify invasion as fears of a new russian invasion of ukraine in the winter of 2021 2022 grow kiev has renewed requests for military aid it hopes could offset russia s quantitative geographic and technological military advantages besides asking for more javelin anti tank missiles to help counter russia s powerful mechanized forces in november ukrainian defense minister oleksii reznikov requested air defense missiles he specifically named the u s built patriot pac 3 according to air force magazine to offset russia s powerful arsenals of cruise and ballistic missiles as well as its large air force the latest pac 3 patriot model is particularly designed for terminal phase missile defense the ukrainian air force already announced plans to upgrade four of its brigades with thirty six to forty batteries of new surface to air missile systems by 2025 sympathetic u s congressional representatives have also promoted the transfer of air defense missiles to ukraine for several years when russia intervened in ukraine in 2014 to 2015 moscow mostly did not employ airpower to preserve deniability should russia invade ukraine again on a larger scale its warplanes and many cruise and ballistic missile platforms could cause massive devastation that cripples radars power plants commander centers and munition depots in ukraine and destroy artillery batteries and columns of armored vehicles attempting to reinforce the frontline it s fully understandable that kiev wants modern air defenses to mitigate the damage of such a scenario but the risk of renewed war with russia is dangerously near and patriot missiles cannot help ukraine in such a timeframe ukraine s soviet air defense legacy ukraine s remaining jet fighters and bombers are dated and could play a supporting role at best against russian airpower if they are not destroyed on the ground by missiles and airstrikes in the opening days of the onslaught furthermore rebuilding the air force with modern aircraft is a decade long project that will cost billions of dollars instead ukraine s primary air defense must come from its hundreds of old soviet era surface to air missile batteries however the russian military is deeply familiar with these forty year old systems and has had ample time to devise countermeasures including electronic warfare and radar homing missiles even worse ukraine s systems are all nearing the end of their service life and require upgrades or depend on parts like klystrons a type of vacuum tube only available via smuggling from russia to be fair ukrainian firms have made progress in developing domestic substitutes and upgrades for various systems but some components are proving nearly impossible to replace furthermore only a minority of ukraine s surface to air missile batteries have ballistic missile defense capabilities with which to offset the four brigades of precise iskander ballistic missiles moscow has deployed around ukraine s borders but on the upside ukraine s air defenses have mass and multi layer coverage that might impede or delay a russian attack ukraine s air defense mainstay is its reported 250 towed s 300pt and faster deploying self propelled s 300ps surface to air missile systems north atlantic treaty organization nato codename sa 10 and sa 10b grumble with a range of up to fifty six miles ukraine also has a few battalions of tracked s 300v1 sa 12 giant systems which can also shoot down short range ballistic missiles the three s 300 types are dispersed into five or six brigades and a similar number of independent regiments each battery can threaten both high altitude aircraft and low flying cruise missiles and engage many targets simultaneously though the s 300 s capabilities are respected ukraine s s 300s are early types with a drastically shorter range fifty six to sixty five miles than post soviet models ukraine s second air defense pillar is its seventy two tracked medium range buk m1 nato codename sa 11 gadfly air defense systems in three regiments these are supplemented by a smaller number two regiments five battalions of s 125m pechora sa 3 goa refurbished into service from 2015 to 2017 with new radar guidance seekers and indigenous propellant reportedly these fixed quad rack launchers are situated for defense of strategic infrastructure and integrated into the control network of s 300 systems both the buk m1 and updated s 125s are effective out to twenty to twenty five miles and can threaten high flying aircraft though the static s 125s are vulnerable to standoff strikes ukraine s defense sector is also making progress refurbishing and fielding two regiments of retired medium range 2k12 kub systems sa 6 gainful which could be interoperable with the buks and possibly three batteries of fixed long range s 200 sa 5 gammon systems a properly integrated air defense network shouldn t rely solely on the organic radars of its missile units fortunately ukraine has also developed the new 79k6 pelican mobile phased array surveillance radar with a range of 250 miles and the 80k6ks1 phoenix 1 spinoff designed to support buk missile batteries separately the ukrainian ground forces deploy four regiments of short range mobile 9k33m3 osa akm sa 8b gecko mod 1 with a range of nine miles and a decent maximum altitude of 40 000 feet ukrainian tank and infantry formations also integrate 23 and 57 millimeter flak cannons man portable igla surface to air missiles dozens of tunguska and zsu 23 4 shilka self propelled air defense cannons and 9k35 strela 10 or sa 13 gopher and a half dozen 9k330 tor m1 sa 19 surface to air systems all for short range protection against low flying airplanes drones and helicopters ukraine s air defense dilemma ukrainian defense expert mikhail zhirikov writes there is a lot of talk about the possible purchase of american patriots but in our conditions this is unrealistic since it is very expensive and it is unlikely that washington with all allied relations will give permission for their supply outside nato indeed sales of advanced weapons take years to arrange under far less difficult circumstances and export controls would make transfers of the patriot highly sensitive even if washington gave the patriot batteries to kiev on its own dime it s far from clear that ukraine s air force could afford their high operating and maintenance costs indeed ukrainian forces would need to invest massive resources in training hundreds if not thousands of troops to operate the complex and unfamiliar system and devise a way to integrate the u s built patriots into its soviet and domestic radars and missile batteries most frustratingly moscow might use a move by washington to give patriot missiles or other strategically impactful weapons to ukraine as a pretext to justify invasion after all russian president vladimir putin wants ukraine to remain influenceable by military coercion and has communicated that transferring strategically relevant weapons to ukraine crosses a red line that could justify an invasion these threats may be objectionable but their objectionability doesn t make the risk of war go away options for ukraine s air defense the patriot isn t the only system to attract ukrainian interest the deputy mayor of mariupol a strategic port city which came under a rocket artillery barrage in 2015 that killed thirty civilians claimed he was looking into purchasing the iron dome system that was developed by israel to counter palestinian rockets iron dome batteries could certainly protect against long range rocket artillery and perhaps cruise missiles but funding to adopt the expensive and specialized system seems unlikely the national advanced surface to air missile system nasams combining norwegian launchers and control systems with u s built aim 120 advanced medium range air to air missiles amraams has also been suggested as a short to medium range air defense solution the radar guided weapon has an engagement range of up to fifteen miles and up to 52 000 feet nasams would still involve u s export controls but might be easier to integrate and faster to acquire than patriot but faster in the sense of fewer years rather than say next month however in late november 2021 it was reported the biden administration was considering an alternative supplying man portable fim 92 stinger missiles to ukraine these shoulder launched weapons have a maximum range of five miles and an altitude of 11 000 feet and are guided by a combined infrared negative uv light seeker stingers can t threaten high flying warplanes nor stop ballistic missiles however they do threaten russia s surveillance drones used for targeting deadly missile and artillery strikes as well as transport and attack helicopters and may also be useable for last ditch cruise missile defense the stinger threat might also compel russian attack aircraft to release their predominantly unguided weapons from higher altitudes with lower accuracy as they did in the syrian civil war or expend limited stocks of precision guided munitions as tactical level weapons stingers would be less sensitive than patriot missiles though moscow would surely still complain moreover stinger missiles would not require specialized infrastructure would be easier to train soldiers to operate and could be dispatched to the field relatively quickly of course stingers wouldn t address ukraine s high altitude missile defense needs but most likely nothing can in the near term unfortunately transfers of kinetic weapons to ukraine may increase russian paranoia and belligerence and whether a weapon s military and or symbolic benefits outweigh the risk of anti deterrence i e making russia more not less likely to attack must be carefully considered during times of high risk helping ukraine upgrade its many outdated air defense systems could yield greater and faster security benefits for lower cost and political risk sébastien roblin writes on the technical historical and political aspects of international security

i read with interest and some amazement the ronald reagan guide to the joe biden presidency nov 28 jamelle bouie of the new york times maintains biden s first year is comparable to ronald reagan s first year in 1981 the approval rating of both went down bouie a young man born in 1987 could have no memory at all of reagan i was in the u s senate during all of his tenure and remember well reagan s remarkable first days and the year that followed when joe biden s presidency began on jan 20 2021 america s economy was actually doing fine considering that the pandemic something with which no living person has had any experience was approaching its first anniversary through president donald trump s personal pushing and intercession a vaccine deemed over 90 effective had been discovered tested and approved in an amazing nine months despite most scientific projections saying it would take three to five years or more the announcement of the pfizer vaccine came just days after the election a coincidence some say the vaccine restored hope for better days ahead despite displacements up and down the economy due to the pandemic on inauguration day 2021 the stock market was behaving well as it has continued to do during biden s first year on biden s first day the dow stood at 30 930 a number signaling economic strength the dow had achieved a very healthy 56 7 increase over trump s four year term compare all this to reagan s first day on jan 20 1981 which followed the presidency of jimmy carter the dow that day was slightly under 1 000 and stood slightly below its level on the day carter had taken office four years earlier upon reagan s inauguration the iranian revolutionary regime finally released 52 american hostages it had held for 444 days of captivity the iranians did not fear carter but for reagan they figured they d better clean up their act furthermore on that first day of reagan s presidency paul volcker chair of the federal reserve board faced a prime interest rate of 21 5 10 times higher than the rate on biden s first day inflation in 1981 was running at 13 3 several times higher than on biden s first day not unlike the unemployment rate of over 10 that greeted reagan in short reagan s first day was a serious mess far worse than biden experienced volcker was a carter appointee reagan would later reappoint just as biden is now reappointing jerome powell a trump appointee to the fed post the main thing to fix was the inflation number and reagan told volcker to continue doing what he must to battle inflation even though reagan understood that he was inviting a recession but it was the right thing to do reagan got his recession which certainly dragged down his poll ratings as he knew it would so yes both biden s and reagan s approval ratings declined in their first year and yes both declines were caused by policy choices each new president made but there the similarities end reagan s policy choice was the right one biden s policy choices have been uniformly wrong on immigration crime afghanistan the worst case rampant government expansion and resulting inflation one after the other it s enough to bring down anyone s positives having said all that i liked joe biden during my senate years i found him to be a very friendly guy hard not to like we were not among each others closest friends but we were good friends we served on the foreign relations committee together for 10 years i had hardly arrived in washington when one evening the senate stayed in session late the senate dining room stayed open so i went down for dinner sen joe biden came to my table asking to join me i said sure and he proceeded to tell me that he had a soft spot for minnesota senators he noted that he was 29 when first elected in 1972 one must be 30 to serve but his birthday was in november and the swearing in wasn t until early january during that interim joe lost his wife and daughter in an automobile accident and he decided to stay home with his two surviving sons biden is a strong family man he advised mike mansfield the democratic senate leader but mansfield was not about to lose a senator whose election was a surprise delaware was not then the safe democratic state it is now mansfield was a reserved fellow so he asked minnesota s hubert humphrey to come with him to persuade biden to join the senate we minnesotans know who did most of the talking at that meeting hubert told joe he could commute daily from wilmington and be home every night with his boys and that he and mansfield would try to arrange votes so joe would not miss many biden was convinced he loved the senate from day one and he ever after had a soft spot for minnesota senators i still consider joe a friend and i suspect he feels the same way rudy boschwitz was a republican u s senator from minnesota 1978 91 and ambassador to the u n commission on human rights 2005

hamish mcrae city bids for tomorrow s giants as fca eases listing requirements for new companies going public on stock exchange the fightback has begun from friday the financial conduct authority eased the listing requirements for new companies seeking to go public on the london stock exchange among the changes are that they only have to float 10 per cent of their capital against 25 per cent beforehand and dual class shares that give founders a higher proportion of the voting power will in some cases be allowed the changes are the result of two reviews ordered by the government which aim to claw back some of the business that london has been losing to new york and to a lesser extent european centres such as amsterdam one of the reviews focused on the so called fintech sector financial technology while the other looked more generally at ways in which london could increase its competitiveness particularly vis à vis europe this change to listing is just one element of the mix there are others that have been put forward such as making it easier for foreign financial workers to get short term visas that are probably just as important in bringing business to london this all makes a lot of sense even if that business is highly speculative take the spacs special purpose acquisition companies these are the blank cheque enterprises where a company is listed as a vehicle for taking over established enterprises without specifying what the targets might be i happen to think that it is nuts to raise money on this basis during the south sea bubble in 1720 there was a company launched to carry out an undertaking of great advantage but nobody to know what it is it got its capital in an afternoon the story is cited as an extreme example of speculative mania and indeed it was but if investors are prepared to stump up for spacs it surely is not the role of a financial centre to try to stop them they will go elsewhere this year there have been 13 spacs launched in amsterdam backed by big name investors such as bernard arnault founder of lvmh and the richest person in europe there has been just one spac in london this is important seen from the point of view of the financial services industry the aim is to bring business to london that would have gone elsewhere but look at this from the point of view of uk based investors is there easy enough access to high tech companies with high growth potential this year there have been 13 spacs launched in amsterdam backed by big name investors there has been a surge of ipos in london since the start of the year nearly 100 compared with 29 last year the results well they have been a mixed bag for example the foreign exchange transfer company wise is currently down 13 per cent from its ipo opening share price in july deliveroo is also down by a similar amount on the other hand the cyber security company darktrace while off from its highs a month ago is still up more than one third on its launch in april oxford nanopore is up more than 10 per cent since its float at the end of september mind you track a little further back to the hut group which launched 15 months ago and it is down by almost three quarters from its opening price taken overall it might well have been better this year for investors to skip new issues and pop any spare cash into the us high tech giants alphabet parent of google is up 65 per cent this year microsoft up more than 50 per cent and apple more than 25 per cent i worry too that by the time a company comes to market most of the early gains have been taken out by their private equity and venture capital backers that is fine for investors with access to those backers it is fine too for wealthy families with private offices which can invest directly into start ups but not so good for small investors who want to play their role in supporting small companies that just might grow into big ones loosening the rules for listing requirements in london does not solve this wider problem it can t on the other hand insofar as it makes the uk a more attractive place to raise capital it will encourage more start ups particularly high tech ones that is good for the economy it is the job of the professionals to help investors filter out the winners from the duds at least these are real companies and not just cybercurrencies and a tiny number of these firms that are floating now will eventually become the giants of the future

by krystal hu and juby babu reuters donald trump s new social media venture said on saturday it had entered into agreements to raise about 1 billion from a group of unidentified investors as it prepares to float in the u s stock market the capital raise details of which were first reported by reuters on wednesday underscored the former u s president s ability to attract strong financial backing thanks to his personal and political brand he is working to launch a social media app called truth social that is at least several weeks away digital world acquisition corp the blank check acquisition firm that will take trump media technology group corp public by listing it in new york said it will provide up to 293 million to the partnership with trump s media venture taking the total proceeds to about 1 25 billion the 1 billion will be raised through a private investment in public equity pipe transaction from a diverse group of institutional investors trump media and digital world said in a statement they did not respond to requests to name the investors trump media inked its deal with digital world to go public in october at a valuation of 875 million including debt the social media venture is now valued at almost 4 billion based on the price of digital world shares at the end of trading on friday trump supporters and day traders snapped up the stock many wall street firms such as mutual funds and private equity firms snubbed the opportunity to invest in the pipe among those investors who participated were hedge funds family offices and high net worth individuals reuters reported on wednesday family offices manage the wealth of the very rich and their kin some wall street investors are reluctant to associate with trump he was banned from top social media platforms after the jan 6 attack by his supporters on the u s capitol amid concerns he would inspire further violence the capitol attack was based on unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud in last year s presidential election as our balance sheet expands trump media technology group will be in a stronger position to fight back against the tyranny of big tech trump said in a statement on saturday the deal also faces regulatory risk u s senator elizabeth warren asked securities and exchange commission chairman gary gensler last month to investigsate the planned merger for potential violations of securities laws around disclosure the sec has declined to comment on whether it plans any action trump media and digital world said the per share conversion price of the convertible preferred stock pipe transaction represents a 20 discount to digital world s volume weighted average closing price for the five trading days to dec 1 when reuters broke news of the capital raise if that price averages below 56 in the 10 days after the merger with digital world has been completed the discount will grow to 40 with a floor of 10 the companies added digital world shares ended trading on friday 44 97 trump had 89 million followers on twitter 33 million on facebook and 24 5 million on instagram at the time he was blocked according to a presentation on his company s website investors attending the confidential investor road shows were shown a demo from the planned social media app which looked like a twitter feed reuters reported first quarter rollout since trump was voted out of office last year he has repeatedly dropped hints that he might seek the presidency in 2024 special purpose acquisition companies such as digital world had lost much of their luster with retail investors before the trump media deal came along many of these investors were left with big losses after the companies that merged with spacs failed to deliver on their ambitious financial projections truth social is scheduled for a full rollout in the first quarter of 2022 it is the first of three stages in the trump media plan followed by a subscription video on demand service called tmtg that will feature entertainment news and podcasts according to the news release in a slide deck on its website the company envisions eventually competing against amazon com s aws cloud service and google cloud reporting by juby babu in bengaluru and krystal hu in new york editing by daniel wallis and cynthia osterman
the international monetary fund is likely to lower its global economic growth estimates due to the new omicron variant of the coronavirus the global lender s chief said at the reuters next conference on friday in another sign of the turmoil unleashed by the ever changing pandemic omicron has spread rapidly to at least 40 countries since it was first reported in south africa last week officials say and many governments have tightened travel rules to try to keep it out a new variant that may spread very rapidly can dent confidence and in that sense we are likely to see some
the right to free speech must not be trumped by famous people s demands to shield their reputations human rights barrister geoffrey robertson gives a stark warning after meghan s attack on the press this win is precedent setting proclaimed meghan markle immediately after last week s court of appeal decision against the mail on sunday even though the court took pains to explain that it was not setting a precedent at all the appeal court judges ruled that this newspaper s decision to publish half of a letter from meghan to her father had indeed been a breach of her privacy as she claimed yet her win was simply an application of laws that had been developed in fact created by judges over the past 15 years and this is significant this case has drawn attention to a dangerous increase in judge made restrictions on free speech that increasingly prevent our society from holding the rich and powerful to account those laws have troubling implications for freedom of expression and in this case they were applied after a summary judgment which is to say without a proper trial where the facts and evidence would be closely scrutinised now there are loud demands that parliament should intervene to strengthen our protections for free speech our first law to protect privacy came in 1360 before the invention of printing to punish people who listen under walls and windows or in the eaves of a house to frame slanderous and malicious tales such eavesdroppers were deemed a common nuisance put in the stocks and pelted with rotten eggs yet her win was simply an application of laws that had been developed in fact created by judges over the past 15 years and this is significant writes geoffrey robertson a right to privacy did not exist in the common law of england until 1998 however when the blair government adopted into british law the european convention on human rights article 8 framed after second world war to stop raids of the kind carried out by the gestapo declared that everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life his home and his correspondence and this is what meghan invoked in her claim against the mail on sunday yet article 10 of the same convention proclaimed that everyone has the right to freedom of expression suppose these two rights were to clash at the time it was said that the courts should apply a presumption in favour of free speech that the two rights were not to be weighed against each other and this assuaged the media s concerns by 2005 this entirely sensible approach was rejected by the courts however in favour of giving privacy an equal value to freedom of expression judges were required to perform a balancing act weighing inevitably according to their own values the importance of each right as it applied to the facts of the case and so the rich and famous were handed a new legal weapon which was relentlessly taken up by reputation lawyers the problem of course is that these two rights cannot sensibly be balanced at all and so the rich and famous were handed a new legal weapon which was relentlessly taken up by reputation lawyers the problem of course is that these two rights cannot sensibly be balanced at all judges for example generally exclude any right to amusement or entertainment or even the right to enjoy the hypocrisy of public figures instead they solemnly intone that what is of public interest is not to be confused with what interests the public a mantra that usually enables them to rule against popular newspapers this newly developed law has had serious impact on public interest reporting there has been a recent upsurge in threats against publishers and human rights organisations from lawyers in london catering for foreign individuals who fear allegations of corruption or human rights violations truth is no defence to a privacy claim and the cost of fighting an action is a serious deterrent to exercising the right of free speech moreover the right to privacy is not merely subjective but uncertain and unpredictable for example the court of appeal said that the mail on sunday could potentially have avoided liability by publishing only one paragraph of the letter from meghan s father but which paragraph and any selection would open the editor to the charge of cherry picking and where documents are concerned it may be important to see them fully in context for example the court of appeal said that the mail on sunday could potentially have avoided liability by publishing only one paragraph of the letter from meghan s father pictured meghan and her father then there is the question of whether the letter was truly private in the first place as there was no trial the evidence was never tested this approach puts the judge in the editor s chair a position that in libel actions judges have always declined to occupy for very good reasons meghan s crusade against the media would have little traction in her preferred state of residence where the first amendment to the us constitution passed because of hostility to british sedition laws prohibits the making of any law that infringes on media freedom there are privacy laws in the united states but to avoid violating the first amendment they concentrate on gross invasions without newsworthy interest such as publication of medical records their big debate over privacy will come in a different context next year when a supreme court packed with trump appointees is likely to overturn roe v wade the right of women to have abortions which is based on their right to privacy their big debate over privacy will come in a different context next year when a supreme court packed with trump appointees is likely to overturn roe v wade the right of women to have abortions which is based on their right to privacy pictured a protest against the supreme court roe v wade hearing meghan might more usefully defend that right in the us rather than continue her courtroom crusade against the media in the uk should parliament intervene and define privacy in a statute that solution is appealing but it overlooks the difficulty of setting out the myriad factual situations that could give rise to a claim and reformers should be careful of what they wish for mps are self interested there is no class that more ardently desires a law to cover up their peccadilloes any laws they draft might well stop publication of photographs of a future matt hancock breaching his own rules by embracing a lover in the privacy of his own office the best way forward which could be taken either by parliament or the supreme court would be to return to the position such that the right to free speech set out in article 10 of the convention should have a presumption in its favour over right to privacy laid down in article 8 finding a balance between two incomparable rights is unworkable and subjective instead we should focus on the real question of whether the defendant crossed the red line that of inhumanity this does not mean that we should go back to a time when privacy rights did not exist they are a necessary protection for citizens against cruelty and unfair media demonisation but they must be confined to cases where victims deserve compensation the growth in privacy claims is just one aspect of laws that increasingly chill investigative journalism invoked by a growing breed of lawyers who promise the rich and famous to restore their often over hyped reputations even national newspapers struggle to pay the exorbitant legal costs of mounting a defence let alone small publishers and human rights organisations which strive to expose abuses and corruption abroad but are threatened with bankruptcy by the prospect of legal reprisals in london increasingly it may be said that britain is not a country which has free speech it has expensive speech
pozole played a large part in danny mena s childhood in mexico city you go to the nearest restaurant bring your pots and containers and you reheat it at home he remembers my dad would always get it without vegetables we would sit and wait for it and we d eat two quesadillas with tortillas made of thick masa while we were waiting based on hominy the stew is a staple throughout the country with as many variations as there are regions in mexico now the chef and owner of la lonchería in brooklyn new york mena recently launched the first edition of bowl of zole a celebration of the dish gathering ten mexican chefs working in new york city he asked each to bring their best version meanwhile arik torren a partner in the event and the founder of fidencio mezcal invited 33 mezcal producers to pour their wares danny mena photo by aaron adler the point mena is quick to clarify wasn t so much to find perfect pairings between the mezcals and pozoles instead it was to celebrate foods and drinks that have been produced in mexico for hundreds of years but have only recently made their way across the border like mezcal pozole dates to precolonial times the nahuatl people called it pozolli or foam after the foam produced by boiling hominy the large dry corn kernels that define the dish pork a frequent addition became common after the spanish colonized mexico from there the variations are endless in guerrero the locals make pozole verde turned green by the addition of pumpkin seeds a red chile spiced version is more common around mexico city and jalisco at bowl of zole the variations extended to sinaloan style with a pigs head broth from luis arce mota at la contenta and colima style with blue point oysters from hugo orozco at las santas there was even a matzo ball version from chai trivedi at kitsch in the hotel indigo and a pozole inspired riff on ramen from julian medina of la chula mezcal of course boasts a similarly large range of expressions the flavors change depending on the type of agave used and the place it was grown the roasting method the distillation and the distiller it was fascinating to find tasting through a fraction of the 100 plus mezcals on hand at bowl of zole that the best combinations showed a sort of synchronicity between the earthy nutty flavors of the hominy and the roasted umami character of the mezcals and the elevated alcohol of a mezcal wasn t such an issue next to the richness of the stews it was even refreshing cleansing the palate between spoonfuls granted the sides offered with pozole are regularly cabbage oregano and chile piquín not a shot of mezcal mena says but he suggests that may soon change honestly we didn t even see the boom of mezcal in mexico city until ten years ago but a shot of mezcal may just be one of the best companions for your pozole broth mena s pozole verde inspired by a dish he ate at mexico city s los talucos was one of the standouts at the event richly flavorful yet surprisingly refreshing and light as he d made it with a vegan stock then added a paste of pumpkin seeds tomatillos and chiles deeply umami it s especially good with del maguey s earthy salty wild tepextate mezcal from oaxaca s sierra norte or nuestra soledad s light and vegetal espadín mezcal from ejutla south of oaxaca city pozole verde recipe adapted from made in mexico the cookbook by danny mena with nils

washington ap the biden administration has plenty of options to make good on its pledge to hit russia financially if president vladimir putin invades ukraine from sanctions targeting putin s associates to cutting russia off from the financial system that sends money flowing around the world the united states and european allies have made no public mention of any plans to respond militarily themselves if putin sends troops massed along the border into ukraine a former soviet republic with close historical and cultural ties to russia but now eager to ally with nato and the west instead payback could be all about the money secretary of state antony blinken this week promised financial pain high impact economic measures that we ve refrained from taking in the past president joe biden on friday said the u s had developed the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very very difficult for mr putin the united states over the past decade already has put a range of sanctions in place against russian entities and individuals many of them over russia s invasion and annexation of crimea and its support for armed separatists in eastern ukraine in 2014 u s sanctions also have sought to punish russia for election interference malicious cyber activities and human rights abuses since 2014 the west also has helped ukraine build up its military so while putin denies any intention of launching an offensive his troops would face a ukrainian army much more capable of putting up a fight the sanctions now imposed on russians include asset freezes bans on doing business with u s companies and denial of entry to the united states but in seeking to punish russia the west over the years has weighed even bigger financial penalties that includes the so called nuclear option blocking russia from the belgium based swift system of financial payments that moves money among thousands of banks around the world the european parliament this year approved a nonbinding resolution calling for that step if russia does invade ukraine when the u s successfully pressured swift to disconnect iranian banks over iran s nuclear program the country lost almost half of its oil export revenue and a third of its foreign trade said maria shagina an expert on sanctions and energy politics affiliated with the carnegie moscow center think tank the impact on russia s economy would be equally devastating shagina writes russia depends on its oil and natural gas exports for more than one third of its federal revenues and depends on swift to make the petrodollars flow russia has worked since 2014 to insulate its domestic financial systems from such a cutoff a swift cutoff would cause indirect pain for western economies as well john herbst a former u s ambassador to ukraine and career diplomat said friday he believed that while swift is not off the table it would be a last resort the biden administration earlier this year further limited russia s ability to borrow money by banning u s financial institutions from buying russian government bonds directly from state institutions but the sanctions didn t target the secondary market leaving this as a possible next step other possible tools and targets herbst noted financial sanctions targeting people close to putin and their families and more sanctions on russian banks and on russia s vital energy sector

hildale joseph and taylor barlow went into business a year ago keeping their day jobs while piling a farm load of extra work on their plate the father son duo an electrical contractor and police officer respectively have owned finney farm since september of 2020 the hildale based business specializes in raw milk raw butter raw cream raw milk cheese cream top yogurt and small batch frozen yogurt more recently they ve added grass fed beef to their wares the ranch in hildale home to some 41 milking cows is named after the original owner winford finney barlow it has a few distinguishing features one of which is its idyllic locale the ranch located on land abutting the backside of zion offers a stunning view of red cliffs and a wide open sky finney farm is also unique in that they use brown swiss cows rather than the holstein cows more commonly employed on dairy farms holstein cows produce more milk but brown swiss cows produce more cream appropriately enough brown swiss calves one of which was welcomed just last week start life with a cream colored coat that darkens as they get older milk from brown swiss cows is also said to be better for cheese making cheese from basic cheddar to aged artisanal is one of finney farm s staples some of their crowd pleasing varieties include plain and seasoned squeaky cheese braided smoked mozzarella and cheeses flavored with jalapeno berries and even beer sourced from the edge of the world brewery in hildale the milk and cream produced by finney farm is unpasteurized it goes straight from the cows being milked via a tube to a vat where it s flash chilled bottled and kept cold it has a shorter shelf life than milk in regular stores and also costs a bit more because of the smaller scale of production and the fluctuating price of the hay fed to the cows milk at the hildale shop located at 1320 n canyon st which looks like a tiny red barn currently costs about 7 the same gallon costs about 9 at the finney farm store in st george at 511 e st george blvd and a bit more than that at the cedar city location at 755 s main st along with milk cream and cheese you can also buy yogurt and ice cream which are farm fresh but pasteurized for a longer shelf life finney farm stores also stock organic foods produced by other businesses including local honey and elderberry syrup jams and tinctures produced by elderberry family farms of payson utah a raw deal proponents of raw milk and dairy say it tastes better and is healthier than regular store bought milk pasteurization does kill bacteria but it also kills vitamins that you need joseph barlow said the way i look at it is how did god make the milk come out of the cow it came out the way that it comes out i think it s better for you along with helping the body better absorb nutrients like calcium iron and vitamins b and a joseph barlow says raw milk suits many people with allergies he s had customers who are lactose intolerant tell him they can drink finney farm milk with no trouble likely because raw milk spurs the production of lactase enzyme in the intestinal tract the barlows say their products are healthy because their cows are healthy finney farm s grass fed cows are never given soy artificial hormones or antibiotics they have room to mingle and are rotated out to allow the cows to have calves and restore their milk giving capacities raw milk also has its opponents sale of raw milk is banned in 20 states on the grounds that it might contain bacteria that can make people sick utah takes a more open minded approach it allows dairy farms producing raw milk to sell their products but only at stores owned by the farm it s also mandated that raw milk be sold within 9 days of being milked the barlows options were expanded in august of 2020 when then governor gary herbert signed a bill legalizing the sale of raw butter and cream growing an agricultural business is launching into a new business just as a pandemic starts to be disastrously bad timing the barlows don t think so they have seen the opposite effect as joseph barlow estimates sales have gone up about 20 percent as covid 19 has made more people interested in shoring up their health particularly their immune system with talk of supply chain shortages dominating the news in recent months joseph said it s a great time to buy local especially when you have a nation of unrest there s a comfort to know that you have a dairy in town or a farm in town he said i think that s always a good thing when you fill the unrest the barlows have never operated a ranch of this size they had a learning curve when it came to operating their on site cheese processing plant and other machinery still they didn t come in completely cold joseph barlow grew up in the salt lake area before moving to hildale 30 years ago as a kid milking the family cow was one of his chores as an adult he s raised beef pigs and cows so taylor barlow s growing up years had a rural flavor as well working with his dad goes pretty smoothly taylor barlow said when he was younger he worked at his dad s electrical contracting business joseph barlow said they bring different strengths to their latest enterprise taylor has more of the business mind i m more of the herdman mind he said both father and son are always thinking of ways to grow their business they d like to expand finney farm products further north in the state and hope to get products like their artisanal cheese onto the menus of fine dining establishments in the region they also plan to one day expand their hildale location we d like to build a new store and get rid of the little store joseph barlow said we could sell soft serve and in the summer or when it s cold you can come in and eat your ice cream being right here at the mouth of the canyon we figure we can grow more by just building a bigger store here copyright st george news saintgeorgeutah com llc 2021 all rights reserved

latest to do so mandating that public schools and colleges stock free pads tampons and other products in their restrooms in michigan the city of ann arbor recently passed a law tostock all public toiletswith menstrual products in florida legislation that would require free products in school restrooms has been introduced twice but has yet to pass recent studies have shown that about a quarter of menstruating students struggle with access to period products and that many teens still feel a stigma around menstruation this country already expects schools to provide toilet paper and soap says damaris pereda the national programs director of period a nonprofit advocacy group why she asks shouldn t students who menstruate have the same access to basic supplies so that if something happens they just go to the restroom and get their things and continue to live their lives access to period products has an impact on learning loss currently many schools keep menstrual products in the school nurse s office la johnson npr at those schools while you can get a period product you often have to walk across the campus while you re still bleeding through pereda says what happens in that case is that a lot of students feel ashamed and like they ve lost some of their dignity right now there is little national data about teenagers access to menstrual products but what little information there is suggests the lack of access is worse for poor students the only publicly available study tracking the impact of period poverty among u s teenage students which was funded by period found that 23 percent of students have struggled to afford period products california addressed this lack of access in2017 by requiring schools in low income districts to provide free period products in schools the legislation passed in october expanded that access to all schools and requires products to be in half of a school s bathrooms it becomes a barrier to education says christina garcia the democratic state assemblywoman who introduced the legislation which was signed by gov gavin newsom d in october these are our most vulnerable kids who already have a lot of barriers this should not be one of them nicky dawkins who runs period s miami chapter is hoping the recent legislative win in california will help mobilize educators students and health professionals across florida we don t want to continue to band aid this problem dawkins says we want to solve the issue which is done through passing bills the study also found that 70 of students felt that their school environment made them feel self conscious about their period at miami arts amani feels like the stigma can be seen everywhere they told npr that there isn t a nurse that students can go to when they need period products or have questions about their period there are people who think they re dying because they started bleeding amani said they freak out and don t know what to do and if schools were more open about menstruation we could lessen the stigma alfredo de la rosa the founder and principal of miami arts charter told npr that while the school does not employ a nurse students can go to an administrator s office if they need menstrual products a female assistant principal or delegate if she is absent is assigned to provide menstrual products to any young lady who requests them he said in an email activists see period products as a medical necessity advocates say the issue goes beyond stigma to affect the quality of education as well the study found that 4 in 5 menstruating teens said they have either missed class time or know someone who missed class time because they did not have access to period products pereda says this learning loss often happens when students need to go home because they are unable to find products they need then they don t want to come back to school or if they do they ve already lost that time all because they didn t have access period products at school like amani margaret schedler approached her school about stocking the bathrooms with period products she s a junior at the altamont school a private college prep school in birmingham ala schedler says the administration was receptive to the idea and agreed to her plan to have her school club raise money for the project the school provides and pays for menstrual products to students in the front office and nurse s office la johnson npr now schedler s club ladies of lavender relies on student donations to provide menstrual products in altamont s restrooms even though the club receives a lot of donations schedler says it still feels unfair that the students bear this responsibility especially because they have to hold donation drives every month and students often complain that they ve already donated supplies in the past schools should realize that isn t a choice schedler argues and if they want to support menstruating citizens they should do the bare minimum and make sure that public and state funded places have period products that people can use cost is often cited as a factor when considering whether to provide widespread access to these products free the tampon an advocacy group focused on getting period products in state budgets estimates that it costs 5 7 per year per studentto supply period products advocates working with the office of legislative services in new jersey are estimating the cost of the recent law requiring schools to provide period products to students in public schools at about 750 000 per year advocates say the costs bring benefits for students a pilot program in new york cityfound that attendance increased by 2 4 among girls at a city high school after making tampons and pads available in its restrooms others argue that the question of cost sidesteps a larger point menstrual products should be treated in the same way you treat restocking toilet paper says michele anzabi one of the presidents of the period chapter at the university of pennsylvania it s a medical necessity and therefore it shouldn t be hindered by conversations about cost but treated as something that needs to be addressed copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
kunstler fury rising if anything political pressures may prevent the white house from going far enough binghamton university political science professor olga shvetsova argued in order to halt the virus she said vaccines must not only be mandated but that fully vaccinated people need to be tested regularly to stop the emergence of new variants we cannot allow people to be sick but not too sick shvetsova said that s what created delta and that s what created omicron it s not only about preventing people from being terribly sick it s about preventing them from being sick in invisible ways as reported in the washington examiner of course ms shvetsova is not a medical doctor and it s reasonable to doubt that politics represents any kind of science at all but just a pretense of it in order to affect some academic respectability which prompts one to wonder what shreds of respectability remain in the universities run by jacobin maniacs answer almost none and zero cred too lately and note that having surrendered entirely to this kind of intellectual racketeering higher ed is just another major institution whirling around the drain there s a lot to marvel at though in the manifold insanity of ms shvetsova s quoted views starting with her overall totalitarian gusto no ambiguity there about the need for coercion for pushing people around with no reference to legal niceties note political science is a field apart from the study of law which doesn t pretend to be science the bit i love most is it s about preventing from being sick in invisible ways huh you know what else is invisible your thoughts you could be harboring hostile thoughts about the folks who seek to push you around which could lead to the accusation that you are an enemy of the state prof shvetsova was not the only one out of her lane in the covid thunderdome this week wall street shill jim cramer took a few minutes off of pimping stocks on his cnbc tv show to declare that the us army should be used to force vaccinations on the vax resistant acting president anthony fauci and his political advisor joe biden used the hatching of omicron to beseech the multiply vaxxed to booster up overlooking the perhaps embarrassing reality that the mrna vaccines do nothing to stop the spread of covid though they do have quite a downside in relative harm from adverse reactions for instance a new study and warning from the american heart association concluded that mrna vaccines dramatically increase risk of developing heart disease between 11 and 25 percent twitter slapped an unsafe warning on anyone attempting to transmit this news on its sacred app unsafe to whom or what why to the sacred narrative of course which is that the usa must be kept in a never ending paranoid uproar over covid certainly until at least past the 2022 elections in order to maintain all the emergency mail in ballot provisions that enable voting fraud meanwhile the emerging reality of omicron is that it has a much lower transmission coefficient than its predecessor the delta variant and produces only mild symptoms of illness someone should tell acting president fauci that halloween is over and he can stop trying to scare everybody anyway two federal judges rendered decisions striking down acting president fauci s vaccine mandates the second ruling penned by u s district judge terry a doughty of louisiana s western district featured a particularly lusty and detailed diagnosis of the mandate s constitutional impropriety and extended the injunction against vax mandates to all fifty states this leaves the usa in a distinctly exceptional position among the other nations within the loose confederation of western civ thanks to manifestations of sanity on the federal bench the vax mandates appear doa here now while austria and germany have rushed into full blown psychotic fugues over omicron announcing harsh punishments for their unvaxxed and coincidentally wrecking another christmas season among people whose teutonic devotion to the ancient pagan solstice rites runs hot and deep there is obvious awareness among german vax protesters as seen on their t shirts and placards that 2021 is looking like a nauseating rerun of 1933 is it not amazing that the german politicians don t see that in their diktats the covid psychosis is just a reassignment of the trump derangement which was provoked by the generalized anxiety about collapsing industrial societies the reasons for the collapse are not hard to grok a declining resource base especially affordable economically plausible oil a financial system purposefully detached from on the ground material reality and sets of grossly foolish over investments in complexity in the techno narcissistic effort to work around all that the epic trump and covid hysterias with a side dish of climate neurosis managed to distract the masses from those essential economic quandaries but now the breakdown in all the channels of production trade and money is roaring in our faces and just at christmas time too when the sore beset people seek just a few weeks respite from their travail and despair don t be surprised by their rising fury over this in the days ahead kunstler
waterloo as festive parties and family gatherings kick off throughout the month residents might not me able to enjoy their favourite cocktail this holiday season the liquor control board of ontario lcbo is warning ontarians of a product shortage with many high demand beverages in low supply it s disappointing jacquie marin an lcbo shopper told ctv news the stock of a lot of things is low and sold out because they re talking about a supply chain so it s a disappointment for people especially at christmas time the lcbo cites transportation issues and the ongoing pandemic as the root of the problem peter carr a management sciences lecturer at the university of waterloo believes changes to consumer demand is also to blame people are buying a lot more goods rather than services because they re not going out and doing things carr said the lcbo s chief supply chain officer nick nanos says foreign champagnes tequila scotch and wines from outside canada and the u s will likely be affected by the shortage products from new zealand australia and south america and expected to be impacted industry professionals expected the supply chain issue to continue into the new year and ask customers to remain patient with stores and suppliers just be open minded be patient be kind to the staff and understand a lot of products may be in limited supply said andrew teichman president of drink ontario nanos said some international products will be available but people should shop early to avoid disappointment
commentary across the developed world central bank officials continue to reassure the public that the global spike in inflation over the past nine months is transitory and that inflation should return to pre pandemic rates sometime in 2022 at the same time the u s federal reserve has begun to taper its purchases of government debt which should reduce the money supply while the bank of canada recently ended its program of quantitative easing where the bank buys government bonds or other assets to inject money into the economy thereby initiating a gradual tightening of this historical episode of expansionary monetary policy indeed central bankers including bank of canada governor tiff macklem believe the recent surge in inflation is primarily due to covid related supply chain disruptions combined with a surge in consumer spending associated with massive government payments meant to mitigate the effects of the lockdowns business closures and job losses but there are longer run factors also at work which central banks refuse to publicly acknowledge as outlined in my new study published by the fraser institute these factors will make developed economies including the canadian economy more prone to inflation for the foreseeable future simply put inflation occurs when the demand for goods and services exceeds the capacity of the economy to meet that demand at existing price levels and demand remains a function of the total money supply and the rate the money supply turns over a phenomenon economists call the velocity of money to illustrate the concept if the total money supply equals 100 and total spending equals 200 the money supply is said to turn over twice if the same 100 was associated with 100 of spending the velocity of money would equal one within this framework a slowdown in the growth of the money supply engineered by the central bank for example when the bank of canada ends quantitative easing will slow the growth of overall demand other things constant and thereby reduce the rate of inflation however if the velocity of money increases it could offset the impact of tighter monetary policy on inflation arguably a dramatic decline in the velocity of money has helped maintain relatively low rates of inflation over the past three decades by way of illustration the velocity of money in the united states in the first half of 2021 was about half the average value over the 1991 2000 period the decline in the velocity of money partly reflects relatively low interest rates over the past few decades when interest rates are relatively low households and businesses are more willing to hold cash balances in their chequing and savings accounts the velocity of money also reflects inflation expectations if inflation is expected to remain subdued as it has been over recent decades households and businesses have weaker incentives to spend their savings to get ahead of expected rising prices given the likelihood of rising real interest rates as central banks reverse their quantitative easing programs and the growing potential for households and businesses to anticipate faster inflation given the recent acceleration of inflation the velocity of money may increase substantially going forward if it returns to anything close to its average value over the 1991 2000 period aggregate demand for goods and services will increase dramatically even if the total money supply does not grow at all of course if the economy s capacity to supply goods and services increases sufficiently an accelerating turnover rate of the money supply need not be inflationary unfortunately all developed economies will face serious constraints on the growth of their productive capacities aging populations imply stagnant labour force growth rates while increased government regulations and higher taxes meant to direct and pay for a transition from carbon fuels to green energy sources will restrain the growth of labour productivity based on this scenario all segments of the canadian economy may soon face much higher interest rates than in the recent past if the fight against inflation is left largely to monetary policy in this regard policymakers should among other things improve the environment for business investment to help improve the supply side of the economy views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the epoch times

the number of americans who consider themselves unemployed fell by 542 000 in november alone and with the end of special pandemic related welfare payments the number of people claiming unemployment benefits has fallen to 2 million from 18 million at the beginning of the year another 200 000 new jobs were registered in november and the overall number of people entering the workforce rose again in short the us is racing towards the full employment level at which the federal reserve starts to consider raising interest rates joe biden simply put america is back to work and our jobs recovery is going very strong bloomberg president joe biden said he expected the year on year decline in the jobless rate to be the fastest in history after falling to just 4 2 per cent in november this is just above the 4 per cent long run unemployment rate that the fed considers full employment and where wages and prices start to rise the move towards full employment as america is also grappling with a 31 year high in inflation piles further pressure on the fed to cut its us120 billion a month 170 billion bond purchases faster than it had previously announced advertisement with an earlier tightening of record cheap money growth markets such as the nasdaq were sold off down 2 per cent on friday following the employment data the incredible news that our unemployment rate has fallen to 4 2 per cent simply put america is back to work and our jobs recovery is going very strong biden says while overall us payrolls remain 3 9 million below pre pandemic levels the labour participation rate which takes in those either working or looking for work rose 0 2 points in november to 61 8 per cent the highest level since march 2020 at the start of the pandemic and in reach of its 73 year average of 62 85 per cent wages in the leisure and hospitality sector have now leapt 13 7 per cent year on year according to the bureau of labour s november figures for transportation and warehousing they are up 8 9 per cent oxford economics senior economist bob schwartz says that while overall wage growth has slowed a bit the pace is still more than enough for the fed to act on its bond buying advertisement there are more angels than pitchforks lurking beneath the weak headline number he says while wage increases did cool last month as the 0 3 per cent increase in average hourly earnings was the smallest in six months the annual gain of 4 8 per cent is still uncomfortably high and implies cost covering price increases that the fed is unwilling to tolerate for long hence we do expect the fed to accelerate its tapering of asset purchases and wind up the program three months earlier than planned at the november policy meeting bank of america economist michelle meyer reckons the latest jobs report means wage pressures will remain and the fed would have to act earlier on tapering and possible interest rates we have been arguing that the fed would likely end tapering a month earlier than planned in may rather than june but now we see them ending in march she says we still expect liftoff in june but march is in play fed chairman jerome powell said last week that the labour market was clearly making a stronger recovery than expected advertisement it now appears that factors pushing inflation upward will linger well into next year in addition with the rapid improvement in the labour market slack is diminishing and wages are rising at a brisk pace he noted on friday the bureau of labour again issued upwardly revised estimates of jobs growth in september and october showing 82 000 more jobs than had previously been reported bringing the average monthly jobs creation in america to nearly 400 000 the unemployment rate for adult men and women is now right on 4 per cent the long run average unemployment rate the fed usually considers wages and prices to rise the jobless rates for teenagers is around 11 2 per cent the country s overall employment population ratio rose by 0 4 percentage points in november to 59 2 per cent just off its pre pandemic level of 61 1 per cent in february 2020 advertisement meanwhile a relaxed ervita says she has considered driving for uber adding to the spike in self employed jobs this year in the us however she thinks driving is dangerous and that hospitality would be a better bet she says there are plenty of jobs out there but she can afford to be fussy about what she gets i am continuing to look for the same work in hospitality but i want to make sure i make the same money or better
washington ap the biden administration has plenty of options to make good on its pledge to hit russia financially if president vladimir putin invades ukraine from sanctions targeting putin s associates to cutting russia off from the financial system that sends money flowing around the world the united states and european allies have made no public mention of any plans to respond militarily themselves if putin sends troops massed along the border into ukraine a former soviet republic with close historical and cultural ties to russia but now eager to ally with nato and the west instead payback could be all about the money secretary of state antony blinken this week promised financial pain high impact economic measures that we ve refrained from taking in the past president joe biden on friday said the u s had developed the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very very difficult for mr putin the united states over the past decade already has put a range of sanctions in place against russian entities and individuals many of them over russia s invasion and annexation of crimea and its support for armed separatists in eastern ukraine in 2014 u s sanctions also have sought to punish russia for election interference malicious cyber activities and human rights abuses since 2014 the west also has helped ukraine build up its military so while putin denies any intention of launching an offensive his troops would face a ukrainian army much more capable of putting up a fight the sanctions now imposed on russians include asset freezes bans on doing business with u s companies and denial of entry to the united states but in seeking to punish russia the west over the years has weighed even bigger financial penalties that includes the so called nuclear option blocking russia from the belgium based swift system of financial payments that moves money among thousands of banks around the world the european parliament this year approved a nonbinding resolution calling for that step if russia does invade ukraine when the u s successfully pressured swift to disconnect iranian banks over iran s nuclear program the country lost almost half of its oil export revenue and a third of its foreign trade said maria shagina an expert on sanctions and energy politics affiliated with the carnegie moscow center think tank the impact on russia s economy would be equally devastating shagina writes russia depends on its oil and natural gas exports for more than one third of its federal revenues and depends on swift to make the petrodollars flow russia has worked since 2014 to insulate its domestic financial systems from such a cutoff a swift cutoff would cause indirect pain for western economies as well john herbst a former u s ambassador to ukraine and career diplomat said friday he believed that while swift is not off the table it would be a last resort the biden administration earlier this year further limited russia s ability to borrow money by banning u s financial institutions from buying russian government bonds directly from state institutions but the sanctions didn t target the secondary market leaving this as a possible next step other possible tools and targets herbst noted financial sanctions targeting people close to putin and their families and more sanctions on russian banks and on russia s vital energy sector copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed

a vicious circle of aggressive selling thin liquidity volatility and fear given the drama since thanksgiving friday it s hard to believe that the leading north american stock indices were at all time highs monday of last week it s also hard to believe that with the djia s p naz tse and vti indices down only 6 on average implied volatility has doubled and the fear greed index has plunged to levels not seen since march 2020 this year a tidal wave of retail money has flowed into the stock market market risk has increased because of all that extra new money more than half of that money has gone into passive index linked investments boosting the value of those indices and especially the value of the handful of large cap stocks which dominate those indices passive investors expect small corrections but they plan to stay the course because inevitably stocks only go up i don t expect any significant selling from that sector unless the indices remain in a bear trend for six months or more if those folks ever start selling we will see what a real bear market looks like who will take the other side of that trade other retail money has gone into active investments everything from niche hedge funds especially anything with esg in the name to yolo kids buying deep otm options some of that money has been buying the dip since last friday ouch but i bet you some hedge funds ctas have sensed trouble ahead and are hitting the bid to lock in a good performance record for 2021 regardless of who has been doing what the short term price action has been very choppy up or down the equivalent of 500 dow points in less than an hour a few times this week and the trend has been down volume has been relatively high sentiment across asset classes has taken no prisoners last week the s p and naz charts registered a bearish weekly key reversal down from all time highs bonds have soared as stocks and commodities have tanked the tlt 20 year maturity and the ultra long t bond futures contract 25 year maturity closed the week at their highest prices ytd if the bond markets were worried sick about inflation that wouldn t be happening so this must be a fear induced bid given that the short end is pricing in at least two fed interest rate increases next year the ula is up 11 points from last friday s low the biggest fastest increase since the covid ramp in february 2020 the us dollar index had its highest weekly close in 16 months when market sentiment gets fearful the usd gets bid the following currencies closed this week at their lowest ytd levels gbp cad aud nzd nor swe ind and of course turkey many other currencies are very close to their lowest levels in at least a year notable exceptions israel china the canadian dollar has closed lower for seven consecutive weeks as has the goldman sachs commodity index wti has closed lower for six straight weeks the cad had a brief rally this friday on the much stronger than expected employment report but as stocks and crude fell and the usd rose the cad reversed to close on its lows gold rallied 120 on the inflation story in early november but gave it all back the last two weeks the open interest on comex gold futures shows speculators chased the gold price higher and then bailed out as the price fell back to month ago levels silver tumbled as much as 3 50 14 from mid november highs with comex open interest falling to near 8 year lows wti crude oil dropped 27 from a 7 year high of 85 to 62 front month wti tumbled more than 11 on black friday the huge premium of front month wti over the deferred months evaporated opec went ahead with their scheduled increase of 400 000bpd my short term trading in the on my radar section of last week s notes i said that i didn t know if black friday s dramatic omicron inspired plunge in ultra thin liquidity conditions was the start of something or just a flash in the pan but i was leaning towards something stock index futures and wti opened sharply higher sunday afternoon omicron wasn t so bad after all stock indices took out friday s day session highs before the opening of the monday day session friday s nose dive looked like a flash in the pan so i bought the dow and the cad those positions were stopped for small losses tuesday morning when powell kissed transitory goodbye over the next few days i traded the s p and the cad looking for a bounce i bought futures and sold otm s p puts with a 30 vol every trade initially worked in my favour i made some money and lost some money but my p l was down 0 50 on the week i was flat going into the weekend ruefully wondering how i missed making money on the short side on my radar if i think in terms of a multi month time frame my bias is to believe that the chasing of risk assets is way overdue for a correction in terms of a day to day time frame i think we ve had a pretty good correction over the past two weeks i try to avoid taking a position based on a story for instance copper has to go a lot higher because of global electrification and a shortage of new mine supply i understand that many successful traders have made fortunes because they bet big and were right on a story the big short you don t hear about all the people who believed a story bet big and went down with the ship because they knew they had to give it a little more time stories are seductive and maybe you have to believe in something to make money from trading investing or perhaps you have to believe in yourself and your method last week i referenced a clip of the peter brandt interview with market wizards jack schwager i watched the full interview on rtv this week jack said that the 70 very successful traders he featured in his books seemed to have no personality or educational traits in common but that they all had found a way to participate in markets that suited them they all had a great appreciation of risk management control to the degree that their long term success depended more upon risk management than upon their methodology jack succinctly said that the wizards had no loyalty to a position i took that to mean that they did not believe in stories some folks would argue that you need some degree of belief in a trade to be able to stick with it during a short term setback however you define short term setback i would counter by saying that i would stay with a trade until my trailing stop was hit i believe that every person has to find their own way to trade invest that successful traders have found a unique way to trade that suits their personality time frame and risk tolerance thoughts on trading reminiscences of a stock operator has been my bedtime reading lately i bought my first copy of that book over 40 years ago and i ve re read it every couple of years since it was written 100 years ago but it still rings true today it s the story of a man finding his way to successful trading through trial and error his style is probably way too aggressive for most people including me but his observations of himself the people around him and the markets make it a good read i recommend it to you quotes from the notebook i don t believe in much but i sure do believe in reversion to the mean james clarke successful options trader 2019 my comment back in the 1980s jimmy worked for a prop trading firm in an office with no name of the door 19 floors above the cboe he described his trading methodology as being the buyer of last resort for otm s p options we were having dinner in 2019 the first time we had seen each other in several years and the subject of what do you believe in came up anything that will generate yield is being monetized diego parrilla 2016 my comment i had been impressed with the book diego parrilla and daniel lacalle wrote the energy world is flat this quote is from a subsequent interview one of my opinions back then was that option volatility was way lower than it should be because people were selling vol to generate yield that reaching for yield had become the most crowded trade in the world the lust for yield has overwhelmed prudence bob hoye 2017 my comment my friend bob hoye has been a treasure trove of quotes and this one ties in beautifully with diego s selection a small request if you like reading the trading desk notes please do me a favour and forward a copy or a link to a friend also i genuinely welcome your comments

san diego california californian jay beiler was recently walking on san diego s black s beach when he saw a disturbing looking fish he first thought was a jellyfish according to the california academy of sciences the fish was a pacific footballfish which lives in the pacific ocean at depths of 2 000 to 3 300 feet where sunlight does not reach the species has needle sharp teeth that point inward i have never seen anything quite like this before you know i go to the beach fairly often so i am familiar with the territory but i have never seen an organism that looked quite as fearsome as this beiler told nbc san diego the pacific footballfish is a species of anglerfish that can grow over 3 feet long and weigh up to 110 pounds according to national geographic the last time a footballfish was found on a san diego beach was in 2001 said ben frable collection manager at the scripps institution of oceanography as reported by nbc san diego we do not know much about the biology of these fish and that is one of the reasons we would like people to let us know when they find one on the beach so we can potentially learn a little bit more frable added

dubbed omicron there are worries that it could be more contagious and make vaccines less effective the world health organisation quickly named it a variant of concern and on monday said the global risk from the variant was very high many of us might think we are done with covid 19 it s not done with us who director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said researchers in south africa announced its discovery last week which resulted in multiple countries slamming the door shut to travel to that region that has sparked recriminations because there is no proof that the virus variant first developed there south african researchers said on monday that they first became aware of the new virus due to work conducted in botswana anne von gottberg of south africa s national institute for communicable diseases nicd said researchers there uploaded the data sequence onto a global website which gave the first hints of a new version of the virus with multiple mutations the trait that has made so many scientists so worried it s the information together that was independently detected and uploaded that made us all speak altogether she said the revelation also helped explain why the region was seeing such a rapid increase in case counts after a period of relative calm when it first announced the find last week botswana s health ministry noted that the first cases noticed were among a group of four foreign diplomats their citizenship or citizenships have not been revealed with worries growing that omicron s spread will worsen the situation in countries already fighting off winter fuelled waves of the disease in the northern hemisphere or eliminate hard fought for gains in countries that have controlled the virus spread leaders of the g7 countries were urged to meet for an emergency summit on the matter whatever they do it seems it will be too late to stop the disease s spread countries like spain sweden austria and the czech republic confirmed their first cases of omicron on monday the latest on a long list while multiple others added to their counts in south africa virologist salim abdool karim estimated there could be 10 000 new coronavirus cases by the end of the week and despite some calls that travel restrictions are unhelpful or targeting the wrong countries they continued to crop up for example japan on monday said it would ban all new foreign arrivals from tuesday the kyodo news agency reported japan s border restrictions had only been eased in early november allowing students business people and technical interns into the country as long as their sponsors took on the responsibility to monitor their movements kyodo reported japan had already suspended entry for foreigners who have recently been in botswana eswatini lesotho malawi mozambique namibia south africa zambia or zimbabwe us president joe biden on monday said the new variant was a cause for concern but not panic and that everyone should get their shots he said it would be weeks before the world knew how effective current vaccines would be against it sooner or later we are going to see cases of this new variant here in the united states biden said please wear your mask when you re indoors in public settings around other people he said he did not think additional curbs were needed meanwhile chinese leader xi jinping told african leaders in a videoconference that his country was prepared to direct 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses to the continent 600 million doses as donations while another 400 million would be produced by joint undertakings the goal is to get african vaccination rates higher xi said noting an african union goal of getting 60 per cent of the population vaccinated this year even though the vaccination rate is in single digits in large areas of the continent to help more china is prepared to send 1500 medical experts to help in africa with reporting from reuters and ap

this article is more than 2 years old universal value advisors a tale of two surveys on friday markets were disappointed by the meager 210k seasonally adjusted sa headline payroll report the establishment survey the consensus expectation was for more than 570k with the lowest survey participant at 375k remember that the bls adds a lump of more than 100k to the actual survey results each month the birth death model markets were even more frustrated because on wednesday adp had reported that private employers added 534k in november adp s report is based on their payroll business which processes paychecks for 20 of america s private employers at the same time the payroll survey is taken always the week of the month that includes the 12th its sister survey also occurs the household survey that survey showed job growth of 1 14 million sa your read that right not a typo that is a blockbuster number if there ever was one and because the much watched u3 unemployment rate is calculated from the household survey the u3 fell from 4 6 to 4 2 so which survey is correct how can there be such a divergence we have stated in this blog time and time again that one should not rely on sa data while the pandemic is still causing havoc in the u s and world economies we believe that seasonal adjustment factors can cause the resulting data to be misleading when the data is influenced by events that are unique november is normally a period when hiring occurs in the retail trade sector in all the friday instant analysis that we read retail trade was blamed for the disappointing employment data showing up as 20 4k sa in actuality retail hired 331 6k that s the not seasonally adjusted nsa number and yes once again you read that correctly the reality is that on an nsa basis both surveys actually produced very strong results and those results were corroborative see table in that the nsa payroll and household numbers are very close universal value advisors as usual markets shot first based upon the disappointing 210k headline number markets quickly concluded that the fed wouldn t be raising interest rates as early in 2022 as previously thought and treasury yields especially on the longer end of the curve nosedived the 10 year yield fell 10 basis points 0 10 percentage points on friday alone and is now down 32 basis points over the last two weeks as an aside it appears that you can use powell s public statements as a contrary indicator for several months markets have been pressuring him to turn hawkish now that he has finally conceded won t use the term transitory anymore it appears that markets have concluded that his initial position was most likely correct and while the fed s chair has now turned somewhat hawkish markets have now turned dovish will powell pivot yet again scorecard opt ins vs opt outs we have kept a weekly scorecard of the continuing unemployment claims by state since may 15 when states began to opt out of paying the extra 300 week of supplemental unemployment benefits funded by the federal government while we have read elsewhere that there were no notable differences between the opt in and opt out states our data clearly shows that not only were there differences but they appear to be significant between may 15 the base data week and september 25 the federal programs officially ended the first week of september in aggregate the opt out states had reduced their unemployment levels by 50 5 more than double the 24 2 of the opt in states at the time the federal supplements ended our view was that the opt in state data would begin to play catch up and indeed that is what seems to be happening as of november 20 the opt in states are now at 50 9 i e their unemployment is 50 9 lower than it was on may 15 accomplishing in two months what it had taken four months to accomplish when federal supplement were available universal value advisors since the federal supplements ended the opt in states have shown a much faster pace of re employment than the opt out states the conclusion appears inescapable the federal unemployment supplements were a disincentive to re employment other labor data also in past blogs we have commented on the labor force participation rate lfpr the percentage of the working age population either with a job or looking for one specifically we noted that the lfpr in canada was nearing its pre pandemic level while it was still holding near its pandemic lows in the u s again we opined that we suspected the federal supplemental programs had played a role and we were disappointed when october s lfpr did not show any improvement november s data however did show a positive move as the lfpr ticked up to 61 8 from 61 6 in both october and september even better was the progress in the most impacted demographic groups for females aged 25 34 those most likely to have young children the lfpr rose by 0 9 pct points from 76 3 in october to 77 2 in november perhaps some thawing in the child care situation and certainly impacted by a return to in person schooling for 20 24 year olds those most likely to work in lower paying service jobs the lfpr rose to 72 1 from 71 3 and for those considered unskilled to 55 7 from 55 0 we believe we will see such a positive trend for the next several months last week we commented that the 199k initial unemployment claims ics that the markets got hyped up about was a false start once again caused by the seasonal adjustment process we noted that while the sa data fell the nsa series actually showed an increase see chart at the top second bar from the right had side this past week s data release for the thanksgiving week november 27 showed the decrease in the nsa data expected in a holiday week and no surprise the sa ics rose closing observations total employment is still 2 2 million jobs lower than pre pandemic levels february 2020 but is healing other characteristics are still not as good including part time but wanting full time the number of discouraged workers the length of time of unemployment and those that couldn t look for work due to pandemic issues the shortage scare has pulled holiday shopping demand forward the national retail federation s nrf survey revealed that 61 of shoppers started their holiday shopping early hence the uptick in october retail sales while november sales were up y y black friday sales were slightly negative y y while cyber monday s were flat again according to the nrf in 2021 there were 180 million shoppers in the thursday monday holiday weekend in 2021 compared to 186 4 in 2020 and 189 6 in 2019 wsj 12 1 21 b3 fewer shop during long weekend we suspect retail sales for december will disappoint commodity prices are falling from their peak iron ore 57 lumber 54 soybeans 26 steel 25 corn 23 natural gas 22 oil 16 copper 10 aluminum 16 lead 7 the consumer confidence indexes are falling conference board 109 5 november vs 111 6 october revised down from 113 8 with intentions to buy cars and homes at 50 year lows according to the university of michigan while the media still blames the inflation on shortages and on wage gains the data says otherwise the majority of the wage gains have been in the lowest paying sectors which haven t moved the needle much on unit labor costs for the non financial business sector those unit labor costs have fallen 0 1 y y up 1 9 in q2 and 2 in q3 but prices charged are up 5 1 the fastest pace of price growth in 40 years and 5 2 percentage points above the growth in their costs was 7 3 pct points in q2 such fat profit margins won t last when demand softens much of retail spending appears to have come from bloated savings a function of the helicopter money from earlier in the year the october savings rate declined to 7 3 from 8 2 in september and 10 6 in july had the savings rate stayed at the july level consumer spending would have been negative thus consumers are spending more than they earn a condition that can t last we are still seeing the impact of the free money the data says that the causes of the current inflation are indeed transitory despite powell s statement that the fed will no longer use the term as suggested in our last blog market volatility both equity and fixed income has risen we believe it will be with us for the foreseeable future conclusion slower growth in 2022 the bond market is sending such a signal equity markets too joshua barone contributed to this blog
media coverage was eclipsed by hollywood s academy awards but on sunday feb 29 southern california supermarket workers voted 86 to end their five month old strike accepting a contract that amounts to a serious if not total victory for a determined employer offensive with national implications thus one of the most important strikes in the u s in years has ended in defeat in october of last year 97 of members of the united food and commercial workers ufcw in southern and central california voted to strike von s a supermarket chained owned by safeway a national chain the main issue was the health benefits of the workers paid entirely by the company von s wanted the workers to pay 50 of health costs under a new contract they also wanted to introduce a two tier wage system within hours two other chains with contracts pending albertson s and ralphs locked out their employees beginning in early october 70 000 members of the ufcw were on strike in the region the strike began with great enthusiasm from the workers and with a surprisingly high level of public support as struck supermarkets remained largely empty including in the big end of the year holiday season further mass transit workers of los angeles struck at the same time also over health benefits creating a strike wave atmosphere not seen in decades their strike was handed over to arbitration and they returned to work a short time later at this writing nothing has been resolved foreign readers should understand that since the u s has no national health care system health benefits are often one of the most important parts of employee compensation the average wage of a southern california ufcw worker is less than 12 per hour and most workers are guaranteed only 24 hours of work per week many workers hold the job mainly for the health benefits the international longshore and warehousemen s union ilwu the west coast dockers union shut down los angeles harbor in a one day sympathy strike and shortly thereafter did the same at the nearby san pedro shipyards they also contributed 200 000 to the ralphs strike fund all three supermarkets are part of national chains as the result of a major consolidation of retail grocery sales over the past 30 years the supermarkets claimed they needed the givebacks because of impending competition from wal mart the retail giant which is planning to open 40 new outlets in southern california in the next few years wal mart is infamous for low wages and no employee benefits everyone understood that the outcome of the strike would set a pattern for many other unions and workers in the region and nationally increasing numbers of labor disputes are precisely over health care costs nevertheless in spite of all the working class support the unions have been following the narrow legalistic strategies that have resulted in so many defeats over the past 25 years on october 31 they pulled the pickets from ralphs as a gesture of good faith to focus them on von s the employers immediately announced that they would be sharing profits and losses during the strike the union went so far as to urge people to shop at ralphs where their own members were locked out even though the chains are all national with total sales of 30 billion a year the unions shyed away from any national strategy sending a few informational pickets to outlets in northern california and elsewhere last fall the ufcw did manage to win a similar strike at kroger s the chain owning ralphs in west virginia ohio and kentucky on november 24 the ufcw did extend the strike to the ten southern california distribution centers supplying the supermarkets and the teamsters international brotherhood of teamsters ibt agreed that their 7 000 members delivering to those sites would not cross the picket lines but the ufcw did nothing to stop thousands of scab trucks delivering the sites and on dec 19 they tried to pull the pickets on dec 22 at the el monte von s distribution center ufcw members refused to close down their picket lines and they stayed up by mid january picketing resumed at some ralphs sites but strike pay had been cut from 240 to 100 per week in mid december john sweeney and rich trumpka the two top leaders of the new afl cio came to los angeles to meet with the presidents of 50 ufcw locals putting the national prestige of the organized labor movement on the line to win the strike one might well ask beyond the usual leftist cries of betrayal why they took such a risk after a long string of defeats in previous years union membership under sweeney since he took office in 1995 has fallen from 14 to 9 of the u s work force my own opinion is that in their own narrow terms with their timid strategies and tactics they underestimated the willingness and ability of the three chains to lose millions of dollars in order to break the power of the unions the unions were successful in keeping the relatively young and inexperienced work force under control no mass meetings were held to discuss strike strategy and members generally felt excluded from influence on the direction of the strike ralphs was being kept open by scabs from the notorious personnel support system inc which provides thuggish replacement workers for just these occasions but the ufcw seemed determined to follow the localist and legalist strategies of so many losing strikes of previous years not even capable of resorting to the kinds of anti scab tactics which created unions in the first place the employers said they were prepared to take a year to defeat the ufcw and without a change in strike strategy by the workers they succeeded 59 000 ufcw members voted on the three year contract over the weekend of february 28 29 by any standard the settlement must be considered an important employer victory while the supermarkets did lose 2 5 billion in income during the strike they established a precedent for many pending contracts around the country and not merely for supermarkets wall street greeted the settlement and safeway stock prices have remained firm throughout the strike the new contract provides for a two tier system current employees will receive no pay increase for the first two years of the contract but will receive a ratification bonus in the third year they will begin making monthly payments for the family health plan new employees will have lower wages and will receive only limited health coverage the two tier contract will thus open the way for pushing older employees out the door finally the contract allows the supermarkets to fire up to 630 ufcw members for misconduct on the picket lines within 36 hours of ratification in the same way there were no mass meetings during the strike the ratification vote was rushed through on a 16 page small print contract the ufcw and the afl cio declared victory for having saved the health plan for current employees for two years but no one doubts that for a strike with very strong support from the rank and file and from the public this was a massive defeat opening the way for future massive defeats it is possible that the ufcw leadership in southern california thought they could win based on the early momentum not realizing that the supermarkets had national backing and a national strategy on feb 16 rick icaza president of ufcw local 770 and a major strike leader told the los angeles times that i felt we had passed the era of the need for strikes i thought those days were over it seems highly probable that at both the local and national levels the ufcw did not want to embarrass the democratic party in an election year but aside from the short sightedness and top down character of the union strategy the decisive factor in the defeat was the absence of any challenge to the union strategy from the ufcw rank and file the ultimate issue in this strike was the corporate offensive against the outmoded private social democracy for the minority of american workers with union contracted and no longer affordable employer health plans this offensive can only be answered by a class offensive to make universal health care a political issue one no longer confined to isolated groups of workers in losing local struggles don t expect such a struggle from either the ufcw or the afl cio not to mention the democratic party

it is too soon to quantify the lasting effects of the pandemic on the world economy however in questor s view covid 19 and the lockdowns it has prompted are likely to accelerate longstanding trends in areas such as sustainability and e commerce they were already strong trends before the pandemic for example the proportion of retail sales conducted online in britain increased from 7pc to 19pc between 2009 and 2019 meanwhile 80pc of consumers surveyed in 2019 said they were seeking to reduce their plastic waste over environmental concerns since then covid has thrust sustainability and digital sales to the forefront of the fast moving consumer goods fmcg sector just over a quarter of retail sales in britain now take place online across europe 29pc of consumers surveyed last year said they had stopped buying from specific brands because their packaging was not made from sustainable materials as a result companies that fail to transition to the use of recycled materials or that lack sufficient online presence could be at a major disadvantage relative to rivals firms that can aid them in this dual sustainable and online switch could be in a strong position to generate rising profits over the long run among them is ftse 100 packaging business ds smith it focuses on supplying paper based packaging that replaces plastic and can be recycled many times over it operates in north america and across europe fmcg businesses account for more than 80pc of its customer base the company is in a strong position to capitalise on the rise of e commerce and sustainability concerns thanks to its ability to provide innovative solutions to a wide range of businesses for instance it has worked with multinational customers on packaging that will enable them to sell a growing proportion of their products through lucrative direct to consumer digital channels it also offers simple and sustainable solutions for smaller bricks and mortar businesses that are seeking to move online of course covid has also contributed to higher inflation loose monetary policy pursued in response to the lockdown induced economic slowdown has already led to consumer prices index inflation reaching 4 2pc the bank of england expects it to reach 5pc by april like most companies ds smith has experienced higher input costs over recent months alongside economic uncertainty this may have contributed to the weak investor sentiment that has caused the company s shares to fall by 17pc over the past three months

over the past 50 years a consensus has emerged on the american left that homelessness is caused largely by poverty and discrimination the solution they say is not to judge the poor souls that sleep rough but to spend more money on them san francisco has become a laboratory for these ideas writes michael shellenberger in this revelatory must read book and the results contradict almost every aspect of the left wing consensus the golden city where the hippies wore flowers in their hair spends six per cent of its annual budget on the homeless including 31 985 24 195 per head on housing alone yet while homelessness declined nationally from 2005 to 2020 here it almost doubled to 8 124 a nice climate and pricy housing cannot be the only causes other cities are as warm and more expensive but have fewer people on the streets quality of life has also declined thanks to open drug use burglaries and the prevalence of fecal matter in 2019 the city spent 100 million on street cleaning four times more than chicago despite chicago having 3 5 times more people and in three years also had to replace more than 300 lamposts corroded by urine complaints about such problems are often dismissed as an elitism that legitimises violence curious as reported attacks on the homeless declined nationwide between 2008 and 2017 from 106 to 29 yet a city that prides itself on loving its homeless population fails to provide 5 180 of them with the most basic thing they need strong shelter from the elements instead rich donors distribute tents leading to encampments shellenberger a resident environmental journalist and liberal on the slow road to damascus says that some of the blame rests with the very people who want to help historically it was assumed that housing should be used as a carrot to tempt folk off the streets quit drugs take your meds and we ll help you find an apartment
a nationwide tradition viewed by some americans as a patriotic display recognizing service and sacrifice represents for others a sectarian religious symbol amounting to desecration complaints about the popular wreaths across america day when fresh evergreen wreaths are placed at gravesites of military veterans at national and local cemeteries are climbing in the weeks leading up to this year s event says the founder of a civil rights advocacy organization that s protesting the practice we have no problem if people reach out and want a wreath on their deceased veterans graves but to put them everywhere to blanket them without permission of the surviving families is unconstitutional an atrocity and a disgrace said mikey weinstein founder of the military religious freedom foundation the crucifix is at the crux of the opposition weinstein who is jewish and his supporters who include jews muslims buddhists sikhs the jedi church as well as christians believe the wreath pays homage to christianity this should be an aspect of respect weinstein said it s almost like a fundamentalist christian gang sign to put a symbol of the christian season of christmas on any grave amber caron spokeswoman for the maine headquartered wreaths across america said the wreaths each hand made of 10 boughs of balsam tied with a red velveteen bow are veterans wreaths not christmas wreaths we are not decorating graves but honoring american heroes she said the idea of placing wreaths on deceased military members graves began informally at arlington national cemetery in december 1992 when a family who owns a wreath making business in maine donated their leftover stock to the army run cemetery in virginia since becoming a nonprofit in 2007 wreaths across america has expanded to 3 100 burial sites including 145 of 154 national cemetery administration properties caron said individuals as well as groups such as american legion posts and scouting programs contributed 24 9 million to wreaths across america in the fiscal year ending june 30 2020 tax forms show volunteers are expected to lay nearly 2 million wreaths on graves during this year s observance on dec 18 the mission caron said is to remember all the fallen honor those that serve in the military and their families and teach the next generation the value of freedom weinstein calls the custom proselytizing to argue that it isn t a christian symbol is preposterous he said imagine if that was an atheist satanic or jewish symbol throughout history wreaths have been laced with symbolism from various cultures including paganism and often denote the spiritual belief in life everlasting and the rebirth of the spirit weinstein s organization requested in 2014 that wreaths across america not place wreaths at headstones of departed service members that display the jewish star of david known in hebrew as magen david leaving live flowers or wreaths at headstones is normally not a jewish ritual in 2017 a photo circulated with a wreath from the program leaning on a headstone with a star of david some jewish families request the wreaths caron said and sometimes volunteers unintentionally place them at a grave with the jewish star wreaths across america s official policy states that the organization is not affiliated with any religion or political view she pointed out the program follows the policies of cemeteries that grant permission for the annual remembrance ceremony caron said sign up for free military brief your weekly local update on local military news and events sent straight to your inbox sign up view all of our newsletters success thank you for subscribing to our newsletter view all of our newsletters at cemeteries that don t have formal policies volunteers do not place a wreath on the headstones of those graves marked with the star of david out of respect for jewish custom the organization s policy states we simply pause and pay our respects the only exception is when families of the deceased request a wreath and then their wishes are honored the national cemetery administration honors that policy to the best of our ability said michael brophy director of the fort logan national cemetery complex in denver which has more than 105 000 graves the federal agency allows wreaths across america to set wreaths at gravesites but does not carry out any function of the program brophy said volunteers do but cemetery staff check graves to see if any graves are marked incorrectly brophy said anyone who has concerns about gravesite decorations or other issues should contact the cemetery he said fort logan keeps a list of requests regarding such matters brophy said and abides by them as a general matter of course for any reason of concern we try to try to reach a mutual accommodation and respect the wishes of families of loved ones interred brophy said weinstein said his organization has received thousands of grievances since wreaths across america expanded nationwide 15 years ago this year the office has fielded an overwhelming number of complaints weinstein said producing hundreds of angry phone calls letters and emails about the program he s calling for cemeteries to require families permission instead of an opt out system to address the matter fort logan a national cemetery under the auspices of the department of veterans affairs has not received any complaints brophy said it seems to be quite popular he said of the wreath laying event which this year has raised enough money for volunteers to place 12 000 wreaths at fort logan in a yearly rotation so that all graves are periodically covered he expects up to 2 000 volunteers for the public ceremony that starts at 10 a m on dec 18 the united states air force academy for the eighth time will place donated wreaths on all 1 350 gravesites on the military installation in colorado springs said spokesman dean j miller wreaths were donated from contributions of americans nationwide he said and are arriving from the air force services agency in san antonio texas no taxpayer dollars were used for the wreaths he said no religious affiliation is associated with wreaths by the academy and all requests to opt out of such honors received from families of veterans interred at the academy cemetery are honored miller said in an email the academy s mortuary affairs officer said in her nearly 30 years in her post she has never received a request to opt out from families of interred veterans sponsorship of the 15 wreaths topped the goal of covering all 2 600 gravesites at the pikes peak national cemetery this year said wreaths across america cemetery coordinator jennifer kendig she s a member of the american legion ladies auxiliary in falcon so many people come out and support this event because it means a lot to honor the veterans that have passed kendig said it s heart warming to see fundraising produced enough money to buy more than 3 000 wreaths this year with the overage offered to other area cemeteries or applied to next year s ceremony she said sponsoring organizations receive 5 from every wreath sold some of which is donated to veterans organizations in the falcon area she added weinstein said he and his wife started the organization he heads after their children attended the air force academy and were subject to anti semitism over the past 16 years he said his organization has represented nearly 77 000 clients who oppose certain practices pertaining to the military that they believe have religious overtones most wish to remain anonymous weinstein said for fear of retribution but he believes they all have the right to dissent when religion primarily christianity is infused into the military culture and lifestyle people say you re scrooge weinstein but this is wrong and un american to assume every veteran would want a wreath on their grave he said these veterans have given their all for this country and they can t fight back now we re going to continue fighting for them
carli pierson usa today if the supreme court reverses roe vs wade will pro life advocates care about the lives of girls and women who die from botched abortions my grandmother was turning over in her grave as the u s supreme court heard oral arguments in the mississippi case dobbs v jackson women s health organization which seeks to outlaw abortions after 15 weeks before fetal viability and contrary to five decades of supreme court precedent with this case the justices will decide whether all pre viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional by even agreeing to take this case certain members of the supreme court are considering potentially turning back the clock on women s rights and reinstating the dangers that killed my great grandmother in the early 20th century when she died from infection after a botched illegal backroom abortion we condemn from afar but where s the empathy when it comes to abortion according to the supreme court s decision in roe v wade which was reaffirmed in the 1992 case planned parenthood v casey states can t ban abortions before fetal viability or when the fetus can survive outside of the womb scientists largely consider that period to be between 22 and 24 weeks of pregnancy that viability line drawn in 1973 was a key area of questioning wednesday as mississippi solicitor general scott stewart attempted to introduce new science that pre viability fetuses can feel and that the right to abortion is not in the constitution justice sonia sotomayor noted that in the years since roe and casey the supreme court has repeatedly affirmed that abortion bans before viability present an undue burden on women pointing out that poor women of color and women with mental and physical disabilities who stand to suffer the most from bans because wealthy often white women have historically been able to travel to places where abortions are safe and accessible a botched abortion killed her that story of poverty and a botched abortion is my family s story my great grandmother died from an unsafe illegal abortion with roe possibly doomed at the supreme court prepare to see more women and girls suffer painful deaths as they seek out illegal abortions it was 1936 when my great grandmother joyce hubbard found out she was pregnant again she was 25 after the 1929 stock market crash the hubbard millar family from clinton missouri could barely feed their four kids and were experiencing homelessness joyce decided to have an abortion which was illegal at the time that decision would take her life and would tragically mark the life of my grandmother who would be sent to live with relatives as her father battled poverty alcoholism and depression women have been finding ways to end pregnancies since ancient times before roe wealthy women were able to travel to europe to seek abortions but in 1936 poor women in rural america were left with unappealing ways to end their pregnancy all of which could result in death for themselves in a university of california irvine s western journal of emergency medicine article the back alley revisited sepsis after attempted self induced abortion the authors describe some of the more well known methods that women used and continue to use to induce abortion there were oral and injectable medications like phosphorus mercury lead kerosene turpentine and detergents there also were coat hangers knitting needles sticks and crochet hooks which were often swarming with bacteria and then there was self inflicted abdominal trauma such as a belly flop onto the floor or ramming one s stomach into the edge of the bathtub in the case of my great grandmother we were never sure about the details of her death except the medical diagnosis listed on her death certificate abortion c sic infection peritonitis it s hard to know whether joyce told the truth about what she had done to end the pregnancy or how long she waited until she sought treatment she may have developed the peritonitis from a perforation in her uterus or from unsterilized instruments that scratched her insides poisoning her blood with bacteria she likely lay in her hospital bed retching for days raked by fever cramping sweats vaginal bleeding vomiting and intense pelvic pain as her body attempted and failed to fight off deadly bacteria such will be the fate of millions of american women if the supreme court dares to backtrack on women s reproductive rights because women always have and always will seek ways to end unwanted pregnancy tragedies to come according to planned parenthood about 25 million women and girls of reproductive age live in states where they are expected to lose abortion access if the united states lets states decide whether to legalize or restrict abortion as before roe v wade also according to the organization overturning roe v wade could put safe legal abortion out of reach for one third of people ages 15 to 49 who may need it in a 2004 report the world health organization estimated that 68 000 women die due to the complications of unsafe abortions with sepsis as a major cause in the united states we have largely avoided this issue thanks to the availability of access to a legal safe abortion guaranteed by the supreme court s decisions i am glad that my grandmother is not alive today to see that 85 years after her mother s death and after nearly 50 years of legal precedent women are still fighting for the right to make safe choices about their reproductive health i will not stand by quietly as women s bodies are again treated as collateral damage in a conservative war on abortion my great grandmother s death was not in vain carli pierson is an attorney and an opinion writer at usa today follow her on twitter

germany s next government is promising to end homelessness by 2030 first however it has to get a handle on how big the problem exactly is something advocates already know all too well it s quiet during the day at the caritas shelter in gesundbrunnen a diverse and working class area in northern berlin but that doesn t mean there isn t lots to do martin parlow a part time employee who organizes the shelter for the catholic social welfare organization has food to buy bills to pay and staff and resources to organize every night around 18 men come in out of the cold he says they re here for a shower a warm meal and a safe place to sleep some are drunk when they arrive others are running from the law for small time offenses most are off the grid in germany coming from elsewhere in the european union they go out again the next morning to face a variety of difficult circumstances low paid jobs or begging struggles with addiction and mental and physical ailments that go untreated the elements are their enemy some people have been coming here for years which is strange and sad because this is a really basic accommodation parlow who oversees a team of eight workers tells dw martin parlow and his team provide a warm meal and a warm bed at a berlin shelter saving homeless people s lives image william glucroft dw the shelter is warm but austere the main sleeping area has the look of a cheap backpacker hostel metal bunk beds spread out across a linoleum floor divided by simple privacy screens many of the guests the term parlow uses for those who sleep here come back every night and leave some basic possessions slippers hats drinks and body products at their bedsides parlow is in his third year at the shelter which means most of his experience has been under pandemic conditions despite widespread fear at the beginning he said the shelter refused to stop its work when covid 19 came to germany though adjustments had to be made such as reducing the number of people accommodated in compliance with social distancing restrictions there used to be 25 people allowed in on a night he said and more if a desperate situation called for it masks tests and contact tracing are luxuries the staff is now vaccinated as are some of the homeless people who come in but that was months ago with the johnson johnson shot which might be less effective now long term problem winter only solution our mission is to save lives by providing a warm bed parlow explains when this system was created 30 or 40 years ago people were dying out on the streets the advantage of being open only at night and during the winter he says is that people can come without formalities no papers shown no questions asked but there are many downsides running the night shelter is expensive around 45 50 80 per bed per night despite the limited services offered berlin s homeless network is moving towards a 24 7 model says parlow which would make it possible to provide more in terms of counseling job help and longer term housing prospects the main sleeping area is sparsely furnished image william glucroft dw even that is a stopgap in berlin and across germany a housing shortage and skyrocketing rents are making it harder to find and hold onto stable living conditions germany has a substantial low wage sector and major studies have shown that income inequality is rising a greater share of salary has to go to rent and these pressures are creeping into the middle class if you don t have the security of your own four walls everything else is so hard parlow said how do you recover from being an alcoholic if you re sharing a room with an alcoholic even huge organizations like caritas are having trouble securing affordable housing stock to pass onto people in need he added a mix of for and non profit companies working with the city offer short term space for tens of thousands of people which they can end up living in for years increased migration has caught policymakers off guard over the years as has the rush of property investors that coupled with insufficient housing regulations and a lack of enforcement has all contributed to the homeless problem homeless during a pandemic to view this video please enable javascript and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports html5 video goals plans strategies but few details germany s next government led by the social democrats spd wants to dramatically expand new housing construction with a focus on affordability and to end homelessness by 2030 the governing coalition agreement mentions putting forward a national action plan but lacks specifics on how to go about it the goal to overcome homelessness in this decade can succeed only with cooperation at all levels ingrid herden an spd spokesperson told dw in a statement that s why there will be a working group between the federal government and the states which will take on the preparatory work of presenting a national action plan germany has four year legislative periods which means the next government could take until 2025 to come up with such a plan that would leave five years to implement it it s basically true that the new government still needs to figure out what the national action plan entails and how the goals of the coalition agreement will come to life krister benjamin schramm a spokesperson for the green party told dw in a

they include using more of its own and eu funds to combat homelessness keeping a closer legal eye on evictions and lowering the bar to get people into housing both the berlin and federal governments talk about housing first a concept developed in the united states and experimented with in germany that aims to get people into their own homes with no strings attached that flips the script on other programs which require homeless people to first meet certain requirements such as dealing with addiction before they get the chance to receive a place to live fixing a problem you can t see social welfare organizations have welcomed the new political will to tackle homelessness but are waiting to see the proof in the pudding the federal association for homeless help bag w for example is calling for stronger constitutional housing guarantees more eviction protection better rent control and easier ways for those without a fixed address to get on the books so they can receive adequate health care taking action and knowing what it might cost can t happen without a firmer sense of the extent of the problem a law mandating regular and comprehensive data collection on homelessness came into effect only in 2020 and the first statistics are not expected until next year until then advocates and policymakers can only go on best estimates nationwide there were 678 000 people without a home in 2018 according to bag w that includes 441 000 refugees and 19 000 children nearly 12 had jobs and almost the same share were pensioners housing debt was the leading cause of losing a home the estimate has more than tripled since 2008 driven largely by refugees who despite their protected social status and often employable skills can more easily fall through the cracks and struggle to find solid work the true number at risk parlow said could be much higher the estimates don t catch for example young people who can t leave their parents homes or those stuck in bad relationships because they have no place else to go in berlin alone parlow thinks there could be 200 000 people in precarious housing situations waiting on the state s plans shelters like the one parlow oversees in berlin will remain on the front lines in the battle against homelessness largely outgunned by the social and economic forces they face you can solve this issue if you really want it as a society or a government

washington ap the biden administration has plenty of options to make good on its pledge to hit russia financially if president vladimir putin invades ukraine from sanctions targeting putin s associates to cutting russia off from the financial system that sends money flowing around the world the united states and european allies have made no public mention of any plans to respond militarily themselves if putin sends troops massed along the border into ukraine a former soviet republic with close historical and cultural ties to russia but now eager to ally with nato and the west instead payback could be all about the money secretary of state antony blinken this week promised financial pain high impact economic measures that we ve refrained from taking in the past president joe biden on friday said the u s had developed the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very very difficult for mr putin the united states over the past decade already has put a range of sanctions in place against russian entities and individuals many of them over russia s invasion and annexation of crimea and its support for armed separatists in eastern ukraine in 2014 u s sanctions also have sought to punish russia for election interference malicious cyber activities and human rights abuses since 2014 the west also has helped ukraine build up its military so while putin denies any intention of launching an offensive his troops would face a ukrainian army much more capable of putting up a fight the sanctions now imposed on russians include asset freezes bans on doing business with u s companies and denial of entry to the united states but in seeking to punish russia the west over the years has weighed even bigger financial penalties that includes the so called nuclear option blocking russia from the belgium based swift system of financial payments that moves money among thousands of banks around the world the european parliament this year approved a nonbinding resolution calling for that step if russia does invade ukraine when the u s successfully pressured swift to disconnect iranian banks over iran s nuclear program the country lost almost half of its oil export revenue and a third of its foreign trade said maria shagina an expert on sanctions and energy politics affiliated with the carnegie moscow center think tank the impact on russia s economy would be equally devastating shagina writes russia depends on its oil and natural gas exports for more than one third of its federal revenues and depends on swift to make the petrodollars flow russia has worked since 2014 to insulate its domestic financial systems from such a cutoff a swift cutoff would cause indirect pain for western economies as well john herbst a former u s ambassador to ukraine and career diplomat said friday he believed that while swift is not off the table it would be a last resort the biden administration earlier this year further limited russia s ability to borrow money by banning u s financial institutions from buying russian government bonds directly from state institutions but the sanctions didn t target the secondary market leaving this as a possible next step other possible tools and targets herbst noted financial sanctions targeting people close to putin and their families and more sanctions on russian banks and on russia s vital energy sector
people long drowning in a sea of misinformation are slowly awakening as cognitive dissonance strikes hard the globalist orwellian doublethink masks melt away according to â this entry over at wikipedia onâ cognitive dissonance âwho then tries to find a way to resolve the contradictory information which is a battle between their original beliefs and new information learned that contradicts those beliefs article byâ stefan stanford republished from allnewspipeline com often causing great strife and psychological discomfort within the individual who is experiencingâ cognitive dissonance a perfect example of that happening right now across america is seen in two different stories being heavily pushed by the mainstream media starting withâ this story over at the baltimore sun titledâ maryland nation keep watch for omicron but the message is the same get vaccinated and boosted coming out the same day asâ this story over at the financial timesâ titledâ moderna chief predicts existing vaccines will struggle with omicron stã phane bancel foresees â material dropâ in current jabsâ effectiveness sending stocks and oil prices lower â andâ this story over at the washington postâ titledâ existing vaccines might not be effective against omicron variant right away moderna ceo says what are americans supposed to think when they re being heavily pushed toâ get vaxxed â andâ get boosted â in one story when in another viral story they re being told these vaxxes likely won t work against omicron giving us up here on our mountaintop another reason to avoid all theseâ vaxxes â andâ boosters â as if they areâ the plague â as anp commenterâ chrism12743 â had mentioned in a very nice comment that was part of a series of comments on this november 29th anp story â people are drowning in a sea of misinformation keep publishing americans are emerging from their slumber so cognitive dissonance is now striking americans who haven t been paying attention hard as they re bombarded with two different streams of information that are highly conflicting and many of those same people already having their belief system challenged with what they re seeing as the failure of the vaxxes and the utter failure of joe biden who many of them voted for happening at the same time â dilbert â cartoon creator scott adams heavily bombards those who haven t been paying attention to the vax and the virus â withâ cognitive dissonance â in the 1st video at the bottom of this story anp fundraiser â due to renewed censorship byâ big tech â upon anp articles we re nowâ running a fundraising drive â we also want to thank everybody who hasâ donated to anpâ over the years with donations and ad revenue all that keep anp online if you re able please considerâ donating to anp to help keep us in this fight for america s future at this absolutely critical time in us history during a time of systematic â big tech â censorship and widespread institutional corruption truth seeking media and alternative views are crucial and every little bit helps more than you could know according toâ this story over at psycom net the effects that cognitive dissonance might have on a person will vary though as it s happening in the moment it can causeâ discomfort stress and anxiety â in the individual feeling it with the actual degree â of that stress and discomfort depending onâ how much disparity there is between the conflicting beliefs how much the beliefs mean to that person as well as with how well the person copes with self contradiction with some of the signs someone might be experiencing cognitive dissonance includingâ general discomfort that has no obvious or clear source confusion feeling conflicted over a disputed subject matter people calling you a hypocrite or even being aware of conflicting views and or desires but not knowing how to deal with those conflicting emotions feelings â most of us experience cognitive dissonance at one time or another although not all of us to the same degree with another cause of cognitive dissonance in america beingâ president brandon â claiming back in july thatâ you re not going to get covid if you have these vaccinations â coming soon before the bottom dropped off and many of the fully vaxxed got covid with some dying and many passing it on to others other americans are wondering what to think now whenâ brandon â tells themâ the stores will be fully stocked and the shelves full as we approach christmas only to then go to their local supermarkets andâ see empty shelves galore so with one of the best ways to deal with cognitive dissonance being to keep a totally open mind ready for your beliefs to be challenged and remaining mentally physically and emotionally flexible to deal with any such challenge that comes one s way doing so is by no means saying one should change one s own beliefs every time they are challenged but taking in and adapting to new information such as the people who once thoughâ the vax is the answer â seeing now that they re getting bombarded with numerous sources of information that are totally contradictory to each other read more at â allnewspipeline com

menafn daily forex the dax initially rallied on wednesday but as you can see we have struggled to get above the 15 500 level by giving back some of the gains it shows that we are still hanging about the 200 day ema and trying to figure out whether or not the uptrend is going to stay intact the 15 000 level is an area that a lot of people will have to pay close attention to due to the fact that it is a large round psychologically significant number and where we have bounced from previously advertisement current volatility is making great stock trading opportunities don t miss out trade stocks now if we were to break down below the candlestick for the tuesday session that would have the market clearing the 14 900 level perhaps opening up a bigger selling opportunity the dax is hanging onto the 200 day ema for its very life right now so i think the next couple of days could be crucial the thursday session might be a bit quiet as we are waiting to see what the jobs number in america is like as germany is a major exporter and will be looking for consumers the euro has rallied a bit as of late but it is still historically cheap so it means that exports are cheap as well which of course helps germany on the other hand we also have germany possibly shutting itself down if the politicians are to be believed if that happens then obviously it is going to be toxic for the economy keep in mind that the dax also has to rely on a little bit of risk appetite something that seems to be lacking in general this is a market that will make a bigger decision soon so i am going to pay close attention to this range we are in because once we break out of that i think a bigger move is almost imminent as we head into the end of the year there will be traders out there trying to make their money so it will be interesting to see how they play the dax expect choppy and noisy behavior but eventually we will get a relatively impulsive candlestick that we can pay attention to and start trading the market

are as follows lithium concentrate import of 1 73 million tons lithium carbonate import of 69700 tons export volume of 6800 tons net import of 62900 tons lithium hydroxide import volume of 3100 tons export volume of 60000 tons net export volume of 56900 tons from january to october 2021 the import of lithium concentrate the net import of lithium carbonate and the net export of lithium hydroxide have all exceeded the whole year of 2020 since the beginning of this year there has been a structural shortage of upstream lithium resources driven by domestic and foreign demand at present mature lithium resources development projects are mainly concentrated in spodumene mines in western australia salt lakes in south america as well as domestic salt lakes spodumene mines and mica lithium extraction projects china needs to speed up the development process of local lithium resources and improve the self sufficiency rate of lithium resources recently wu huayu chief analyst of guotai junan nonferrous said that the explosive development of electric vehicles and energy storage has driven the rapid growth of the lithium cobalt nickel industry the lithium cobalt nickel industry has a compound growth rate of 35 13 and 8 in the next five years coruscating new vitality until 2023 the supply and demand of the lithium industry is still in a hard shortage and the lithium salt and lithium mine is out of stock the price of lithium concentrate is at an all time high and lithium ore is still the most scarce area the lithium industry will be more scarce in 2022 than in 2021 and lithium prices will continue to make history after breaking through their previous highs from 2022 to 2025 the main contradiction in the lithium industry is the contradiction between the unbalanced and inadequate development of lithium resources and the growing global demand for lithium power citic construction investment securities estimates that by 2025 global power battery shipments are expected to be about 1000gwh based on this calculation the global lithium demand for power batteries in 2025 will be about 680000 tons of lce in addition to lithium consumption driven by the sustained growth of new energy vehicles the global consumption of energy storage batteries and small power batteries is also growing considerably by 2025 shipments are expected to grow at an average annual compound growth rate of more than 30 per cent while lithium demand in traditional industries will maintain a growth rate of 2 per cent based on the calculation of lithium demand in the next five years global lithium demand may reach 1 14 million tons of lce with an average annual compound growth rate of 25 per cent by 2025 under the tight situation of supply and demand the price of lithium concentrate has increased significantly on december 2nd the average price of spodumene concentrate 6 jing cif china reached 1900 per tonne up more than 150 since august according to smm in addition battery network noted that pilbara the main australian lithium mining company held three spodumene concentrate auctions this year and the auction prices were much higher than the current concentrate market prices of these 5 5 per cent of the lithium concentrate sold at the third concentrate auction on october 26th was sold fob hedland at us 2350 per tonne or about us 2629 per tonne fob 6 per cent cif china far exceeding the 2016 2017 high lithium ore price huachuang securities believes that the price of lithium concentrate will continue to rise sharply due to the decrease in salt lake production in the fourth quarter and the influence of downstream manufacturers stock before the end of the year the ex factory price of lithium salt is expected to rise again in the medium term the upstream lithium mine development cycle is long and the supply is expected to be difficult to change in the short term downstream electric vehicles and energy storage have accounted for more than 60 of lithium demand with the high growth of downstream demand lithium prices are expected to rise again under the tight balance of supply and demand the pace of upstream lithium resource expansion is relatively slow the new supply is difficult to match the rapidly growing demand for lithium batteries superimposed by the rise in lithium concentrate prices forcing the industrial chain enterprises to expand production and speed up australia s jadar resources jadar resources limited asx jdr announced the signing of a non binding memorandum of understanding mou on strategic cooperation with yahwa international investment and development co ltd on a global joint venture to acquire and develop lithium ore projects and supply spodumene concentrates to yahhua on december 1st ganfeng lithium 002460 announced that firefinch the company s partner in the overseas acquisition project is considering the expansion of the second phase of the goulamina spodumene project which will increase production capacity by 75 making the project one of the largest spodumene producers in the world according to the previous announcement of ganfeng lithium industry the goulamina spodumene mine has been explored and determined indicated estimated resources are 108 5 million tons of raw ore and 1 57 million tons of lithium oxide resources on november 24th china mineral resources 002738 said on the investor interactive platform that the spodumene mining and separation system with an annual capacity of 120000 tons year at the company s canadian tanco mine was officially put into operation on october 15 2021 and it is expected that spodumene concentrate will be shipped back to china by the end of the year with the global epidemic under control overseas exploration business is expected to improve next

advertisement travel chiefs have been left furious after the government imposed new restrictions on all passengers entering the uk describing it as a hammer blow for the industry bosses said forcing travellers to take a covid pre departure test to try to stamp out the omicron super variant would devastate livelihoods and see businesses fail deputy prime minister dominic raab defended the government s decision to re introduce them but admitted it was a burden for firms ministers last night said the draconian curbs were hoped to be temporary after they said new data showed an increase in the number of cases of the new strain linked to foreign travel but one leading epidemiologist who advises them on covid said britain has left it too late to halt the spread of omicron professor mark woolhouse said bringing in new curbs on travel was a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted the move which will be brought in on tuesday was welcomed by labour which has been pressing for the return of pre departure tests since the variant was first identified in south africa it comes as the uk health security agency confirmed today that the number of omicron cases in the uk has increased by 86 bringing the total number of cases to 246 elsewhere in the never ending pandemic mr raab insisted people should go to parties despite covid but said his department will not be doing one kate garraway told piers morgan how covid stricken husband derek said i love you again after his battle covid cases in south africa have soared by a massive 408 per cent in just one week while deaths rose to 21 scientists said omicron may spread easily due to sharing some genetic material with the common cold virus deputy prime minister dominic raab pictured today defended the government s decision to re introduce them but admitted it was a burden for firms people wait outside the covid 19 testing facility at heathrow s terminal 5 in west london last week as new rules on travel were enforced dominic raab tells the public they should go to christmas parties for the social interaction but admits ministry of justice will swap its own festive gathering for appropriate drinks at a smaller scale dominic raab insisted today that people should go to christmas parties despite covid but admitted his own department will not be having one the justice secretary spoke out after the government was accused of mixed messages over festive gatherings last week dr jenny harries head of the health security agency said people should not socialise if you don t need to to keep covid under control but she was over ruled by prime minister boris johnson who later backed parties to go ahead asked which of them was right on the bbc s andrew marr programme today mr raab said people should go to the parties the events he added i don t have the full context for what she dr harries said and of course the scientific advisers the public health advisers will caveat very carefully what they say but our message is this enjoy christmas this year the vaccine roll out means we re in a position to do so and we re also saying that employers that can be trusted to take common sense approach to the facts of the circumstances in their businesses and in their sectors advertisement the travel sector said the return of pre departure tests was another hammer blow for an industry which was just beginning to pick up again after the devastation wrought by the pandemic clive wratten chief executive of the business travel association said it directly contradicted assurances given by transport secretary grant shapps and he called on the government to step in and support the sector the introduction of pre departure testing with little warning is a hammer blow to the business travel industry he said public safety is a priority but businesses will fail travellers will be stranded and livelihoods devastated by the lack of coherent plans from government tim alderslade chief executive of the industry body airlines uk said the rapidly changing measures meant planning was becoming impossible he said it is premature to hit millions of passengers and industry before we see the full data we don t have the clinical evidence he added these measures must be removed as quickly as possible in line with the speed of the booster programme the airport operators association chief executive karen dee said pre departure tests were a major deterrent to travel she said most of the limited remaining demand following the reintroduction of self isolation will now fall away just as airports were hoping for a small uplift over the christmas holiday and chairman of the association of british travel agents alistair rowland told the sunday times we had got into a fragile recovery he went on that s already been shattered by the mixed messaging around the new variant this will kill it completely since last weekend demand has dropped by more than 50 per cent in terms of booking holidays for future seasons there is no consumer confidence mr raab told sky news s trevor phillips on sunday programme this morning i know that is a burden for the travel industry but we have made huge huge strides in this country we have got to take the measures targeted forensically to stop the new variant seeding in this country to create a bigger problem he added we have taken a balanced approach but we are always alert to extra risk that takes us back not forward britain s justice secretary dominic raab arrives at the bbc headquarters to appear on the andrew marr show in london today on friday transport secretary grant shapps pictured assured travellers that pre departure tests would not be introduced marking more muddled messaging from government ministers scientist warns it is too late to halt spread of omicron with new rules as new virus spreads rapidly in the uk and could become world s dominant strain in weeks britain has left it too late to halt the spread of the omicron super variant a leading scientist has warned professor mark woolhouse said bringing in new curbs on travel was a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted the edinburgh university epidemiologist said it was spreading pretty rapidly and could become the world s dominant strain professor woolhouse who is a member of the scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling which advises the government said the measures would not make a material difference as the variant is already spreading pretty rapidly he told bbc one s andrew marr show on sunday i think that may be a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted if omicron is here in the uk and it certainly is if there s community transmission in the uk and it certainly looks that way then it s that community transmission that will drive a next wave the cases that are being imported are important we want to detect those and isolate any positive cases we find as we would for any case anywhere but i think it s too late to make a material difference to the course of the omicron wave if we re going to have one advertisement shadow environment secretary jim mcmahon accused the government of being very late in making the calls that are required to keep our borders safe he told sky news well of course it was the labour party who were calling for pre testing to take place because we re very concerned that the government consistently throughout the pandemic have been very late in making the calls that are required to keep our borders safe very late in terms of trying to control the spread of that virus and what we want to do is to make sure that we don t jeopardise the vaccination rollout the worst thing in the world after all the sacrifices that we ve made is that a new variant comes in and completely takes the rug from under that programme and so it s very important the government get a grip it s very important the government takes swift action and frankly it shouldn t be for the opposition to keep continually one step ahead of the government the government needs to take control themselves professor mark woolhouse said bringing in new curbs on travel was a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted the edinburgh university epidemiologist said it was spreading pretty rapidly and could become the world s dominant strain professor

on mr draper after his 13 month battle in hospital the longest of any surviving covid patient in the highly emotional interview she discusses with mos columnist morgan how her husband managed three words hello and thank you to him on the telephone the night before the programme was recorded last month she continues it s moments like that which make you realise he is there and we have had others he will turn to me and say i love you he is there he has fought so hard to stay in this world and i m not giving up on him ever he will have moments of clarity then it s like he disappears but then he finds a voice advertisement but i think it s too late to make a material difference to the course of the omicron wave if we re going to have one the new measures for england which come into force at 4am on tuesday were announced late on saturday by health secretary sajid javid and were immediately followed by the scottish and welsh government it means passengers travelling to the uk will have to take either a pcr or a lateral flow test up to a maximum of 48 hours before they depart regardless of their vaccination status mr javid said we have always said we would act swiftly if we need to if the changing data requires it these are temporary measures we want to remove them as soon as we possibly can but before we learn more about omicron it is right that we have these measures in place shadow home secretary yvette cooper welcomed the u turn after ministers previously resisted calls to reintroduce pre departure tests but said they should have moved sooner we badly need them to learn the lessons on the importance of acting quickly on covid border measures rather than each time having to be put under huge pressure to finally act she said the department of health and social care said it had acted in part because said new analysis by the uk health and security agency suggested the window between infection and infectiousness may be shorter for omicron it said this increased the efficacy of pre departure testing making it more likely it would to identify positive cases before travel in a further move the government said nigeria was being added to the travel red list after 21 cases of the omicron variant in england were linked to travel from the west african nation from 4am on monday only british and irish nationals and residents travelling from nigeria will be allowed into the country and must isolate in a government managed quarantine hotel the omicron variant has now been discovered in 38 countries but has not yet resulted in any deaths according to the world health organization who official data shows that the proportion of positive covid tests with a mutation synonymous with the highly evolved strain is on the rise like alpha or the kent variant omicron has a specific alteration which means it can be detected through pcr tests without the need for genomic sequencing the proportion of positive tests in england with this so called s gene dropout has risen from 0 1 per cent in the past week to 0 3 per cent the equivalent of one in 330 scientists said the increase in s gene dropouts suggests there could be hundreds of omicron cases that are flying under the radar currently south africa s covid cases rise by 408 in a week as omicron wave continues covid cases in south africa have soared by a massive 408 per cent in just one week while deaths rose from eight to 21 across the same time period according to the latest figures the country s national institute for communicable diseases recorded another 16 366 cases in the last 24 hours with the vast majority in epicentre gauteng province this was a 408 per cent increase from last saturday when just 3 220 new infections were registered across the previous 24 hours it is not known which variant the new cases recorded were the omicron stricken country also recorded 21 deaths on saturday up 162 per cent from last week when 8 deaths were announced nicd data is based on lateral flow and pcr tests done across south africa every day it showed that in the country s nine provinces most new infections were recorded in gauteng with 11 607 new cases the latest figures bring the total number of cases in south africa up to 3 020 569 while the number of deaths have increased to a total of 89 956 advertisement ministers expect a breakthrough in tests of the omicron variant by the end of this week two senior sources said the time frame to assess whether omicron was mild or posed a serious threat was cut from four to six weeks a government source said positive news from porton down would mean the pre departure test would be dropped and added early clinical evidence on omicron cases showed a short period between becoming infected and being infectious which is why testing people before they leave for the uk is aimed to stop importing the variant the scottish government also announced travellers arriving in the country will also be required to take pre departure covid tests from 4am on december 7 to help slow the spread of the omicron variant international passengers will have to provide a negative pre departure test taken two days before travelling in addition to a negative pcr test on or before day two after arrival under measures agreed on a four nation basis the scottish government said the changes were informed by a uk health security agency risk assessment scotland s transport secretary michael matheson said it is essential we take steps now to keep people safe protect the rollout of the booster programme and reduce the chances of unsustainable pressure being placed on the nhs over the winter we have always said it may be necessary to quickly implement fresh measures to protect public health in scotland particularly with regards to international travel and these restrictions are proportionate and necessary to that aim we fully understand the impact the changes will have on staff and businesses in the travel and aviation sectors particularly as the new variant came at a time when we were beginning to see some signs of recovery we will not keep the restrictions in place any longer than is necessary following announcements from downing street and the scottish government a welsh government spokesman confirmed it will also introduce pre departure tests for travellers they said in line with the rest of the uk we will be taking action to move nigeria onto the red list from monday and to introduce pre departure tests for travellers into the uk and wales data in south africa shows the r rate has soared to over three per cent in recent weeks as omicron took hold in gauteng province uk finds another 26 cases of omicron covid variant britain s covid crisis presented a mixed picture today as a further 26 cases of the omicron variant were reported and hospitalisations were continuing to rise but the number of deaths is falling according to official figures uk health security agency ukhsa figures show 127 people died with the virus today down 3 1 per cent on last saturday s total of 131 but 42 848 new infections were recorded in the country over the last 24 hours up 8 3 per cent on the 39 567 recorded last week and the uk health security agency said a further 26 cases of the omicron variant have been reported across the uk with 25 of these in england meaning the total number of confirmed cases of the variant in britain now stands at 160 it is the fourth day in a row cases have risen across britain with officials discovering 75 new cases of the omicron variant in england yesterday and the number of people admitted to hospital with the virus also increased 5 6 per cent in a week to 812 on tuesday the latest date data is available for advertisement meanwhile travel group tui is set to reveal heavy losses next week after covid travel curbs continued to hamper performance across its divisions throughout the year the update will come just as renewed restrictions threaten to derail the group s plans to ramp up capacity over the winter holiday season bosses said in october that the firm was planning to hit 60 80 per cent of pre pandemic volumes and they will be looking to reassure investors that plans will be going ahead when they update the city on the full year s trading on wednesday december 8 tui revealed losses of 939 million euro 802 million in the nine months to june down from 1 5 billion euro 1 3 billion on the same period in 2020 as it benefited from an uptick in customers booking holidays to take place over the key summer period the group delivered around 2 6 million holidays over the summer doubling the 1 3 million customers in the same period last year and investors will be keen to see whether this can temper losses for the full year s trading winter holiday bookings topped one million which tui said had been driven by tourists looking or winter sun in the canary islands mainland spain egypt and cape verde but all eyes on will be on guidance for the period ahead to see how much the group has pared back plans on the back of increased european travel restrictions analysts at s p global warned in october that a return of restrictions could push a full recovery in trading volumes beyond late 2022 they said long haul destinations or destination countries with lower vaccination rates such as turkey are expected to recover more slowly because of travel restrictions or lower demand volumes will likely not approach pre pandemic levels before the second half of april september 2022 and could be further depressed by renewed or prolonged travel restrictions despite an uptick in winter holidays bookings overall remained at 54 of pre pandemic levels and the group said it was prioritising addressing the high levels of debt it had accrued borrowing during the pandemic the firm bolstered its cash reserves for the winter with a 1 1 billion euro capital increase in october raised by selling shares the new rules come after the transport secretary said on friday ministers did not want to introduce pre departure tests and unnecessarily kill off the travel sector again he insisted the government has brought forward a calibrated response to the new omicron super mutant variant which doesn t take us right back to the beginning of this on the telegraph s chopper s politics podcast he said lots of countries do require if you are going to them for pre testing we are not requiring that at the moment i heard the leader of the opposition calling for that from the despatch box at prime minister s questions this week do you want to kill off the travel sector again without knowing that you need to or do you want to take the right level of calibrated response and this government thinks we should take a calibrated response which doesn t take us right back to the beginning of this but yesterday he tweeted as the scientists work to understand new omicron variant we need to apply additional caution until picture is clearer we appreciate this will be difficult for the travel sector as we prioritise public health protect the progress of our world leading vax booster programme he also called for further action including increasing the number of booster jabs

booster programme to protect against the omicron covid variant will not start for another nine days with pressure mounting on the goal to reach all adults by the end of january the ukhsa data showed 372 577 booster doses were dished out across the country yesterday taking britain s total up to 19 8million people 34 4 per cent of the eligible population the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation jcvi said that all adults should become eligible for boosters three months after their second dose bringing down the wait time from six months but the booking service for the jabs is yet to be updated and adults who received their jab three months ago could be forced to wait until december 13 to organise their third dose ministers set a target of dishing out 500 000 doses a day to reach its january goal but if capacity is not ramped up until mid december this will not be achieved until february 8 at the current pace of the rollout experts are hopeful no10 s booster programme on steroids will help prevent britain s rising omicron infections translating into severe disease hospitalisations and deaths meanwhile scientists claimed the omicron variant may spread more easily than other covid strains because it shares some genetic material with the common cold virus and is more infectious among children a study led by cambridge massachusetts based data analytics firm nference shows the strain contains a genetic sequence common in other viruses including those that cause the common cold and also in the human genome by inserting this particular snippet into itself omicron might be making itself look more human which would help it evade attack by the human immune system said venky soundararajan who led the study posted on thursday on the website osf preprints this could mean the virus transmits more easily while only causing mild or asymptomatic disease in south africa where the mutant first arose officials warned higher hospital admissions among children during the fourth wave of infections should prompt vigilance but not panic will infections so far being mild a large number of infants admitted with covid last month in tshwane the metropolitan area that includes pretoria raised concerns the omicron variant could pose greater risks for young children than other coronavirus variants scientists have yet to confirm any link and have cautioned that other factors could be at play they do not yet know whether omicron is more infectious than other variants whether it causes more severe disease or whether it will overtake delta as the most prevalent variant it may take several weeks to get answers to these questions cells in the lungs and in the gastrointestinal system can harbour sars cov 2 and common cold coronaviruses simultaneously according to earlier studies such co infection sets the scene for viral recombination a process in which two different viruses in the same host cell interact while making copies of themselves generating new copies that have some genetic material from both parents withnail star richard e grant complains that he feels punished in 228 per night uk quarantine hotel with grim food after being caught out by sudden south africa travel rules change actor richard e grant has said he feels punished after being forced to quarantine for covid in a hotel that charges more than 228 a night and serves grim food the withnail and i star had been visiting his 90 year old mother in southern africa when the government enforced new travel restrictions to fight the omicron variant he complained of poor food at a gatwick holiday inn grant 64 posted pictures on twitter of a packaged tuna and cucumber sandwich a sausage casserole and fish and chips which he said would cost less than 30 to buy elsewhere speaking in a video posted online grant who used to present the hotel review television series richard e grant s hotel secrets said i went to southern africa to visit my 90 year old mother and got caught by the red region covid restrictions i understand there are security costs in the hotel and you ve got to pay for two covid tests but 228 a day to receive three meals of this very poor standard in a supposed four star holiday inn hotel beggars belief grant said he was confounded that a non quarantine holiday inn nearby costs 89 incl breakfast and asked how does gov justify this cost to a traveller for hospitality feels punishing a government spokesman said the majority of passengers who have used the managed quarantine service have been satisfied with the service advertisement this new mutation could have first occurred in a person infected with both pathogens when a version of sars cov 2 picked up the genetic sequence from the other virus soundararajan and colleagues said in the study which has not yet been peer reviewed the same genetic sequence appears many times in one of the coronaviruses that causes colds in people known as hcov 229e and in the human immunodeficiency virus hiv that causes aids soundararajan said south africa where omicron was first identified has the world s highest rate of hiv which weakens the immune system and increases a person s vulnerability to infections with common cold viruses and other pathogens in that part of the world there are many people in whom the recombination that added this ubiquitous set of genes to omicron might have occurred soundararajan said we probably missed many generations of recombinations that occurred over time and that led to the emergence of omicron soundararajan added more research is needed to confirm the origins of omicron s mutations and their effects on function and transmissibility there are competing hypotheses that the latest variant might have spent some time evolving in an animal host in the meantime soundararajan said the new findings underscore the importance of people getting the currently available covid 19 vaccines you have to vaccinate to reduce the odds that other people who are immunocompromised will encounter the sars cov 2 virus soundararajan said meanwhile a spate of hospitalisations in children in south africa has caused concern among experts that the virus may be more infectious in younger people although cases have been mild so far ntsakisi maluleke a public health specialist in the gauteng province that includes tshwane and the biggest city johannesburg said that out of the 1 511 covid positive patients in hospitals in the province 113 were under nine years old a greater proportion than during previous waves of infection we are comforted by clinicians reports that the children have mild disease she said adding health officials and scientists were investigating what was driving the increased admissions in younger ages and were hoping to provide more clarity in the coming two weeks since only a small percentage of south africa s positive covid tests are sent for genomic sequencing officials do not yet know which variants the children admitted to hospital have been infected with despite fears that the new strain is easily spread the world health organization who confirmed no one has died with the new super mutant omicron variant despite the strain being spotted in 38 countries the us and australia became the latest countries to confirm locally transmitted cases of the variant as omicron infections pushed south africa s total cases past three million india confirmed its third omicron infection yesterday with cases also now spotted in sri lanka south korea and malaysia and south korea reported a record daily 5 352 new covid infections and 70 deaths while a nationwide total of nine cases of the omicron variant have been confirmed the korea disease control and prevention agency kdca said on saturday the who warned it could take weeks to determine how infectious the variant is whether it causes more severe illness and how effective treatments and vaccines are against it we re going to get the answers that everybody out there needs who emergencies director michael ryan said the who said friday it had still not seen any reports of deaths related to omicron but the new variant s spread has led to warnings that it could cause more than half of europe s covid cases in the next few months health secretary mr javid yesterday met with the world health organisation s director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus describing it as productive elsewhere in a letter from nhs chief executive amanda pritchard released on friday it was revealed the booster booking service would be updated to reflect the reduction of the time between doses to three months as soon as possible and no later than december 13 it said the jabs would be delivered in descending age groups with priority given to the vaccination of older adults and those in a covid at risk group first and it confirmed that there were no supply challenges with either moderna or pfizer booster stocks while figures showed covid infections have increased in all four uk nations and remain close to record levels though the latest rise is not linked to the arrival of the omicron variant around one in 60 people in private households in england had covid in the week to 27 november up from one in 65 the previous week according to estimates from the office for national statistics ons the proportion of people in england who were estimated to have coronavirus at the peak of the second wave in early january was one in 50 this led to a surge in hospital admissions and deaths along with a nationwide lockdown however no 10 ruled out making vaccines compulsory as has been seen in austria and is being considered in germany a spokesman for the prime minister told reporters we ve set out our policy on this and we ve said it s not something that we would look to introduce you re aware of the changes we made in terms of social care settings and for nhs workers given the importance of protecting the most vulnerable in our society but there s no plans above and beyond that in that regard he added our priority is to continue to promote vaccinations and promote boosters now that we are rolling out more and more boosters to more and more people that is our priority that s our focus and that s what we re asking people to come forward and take is the omicron variant more dangerous than earlier strains and will my covid 19 vaccines still protect me if i decide to have a quick snog under the mistletoe our team of experts answer the crucial questions it has been a little over a week since scientists in botswana and south africa alerted the world about the emergence of a rapidly spreading new covid variant casting a shadow over the forthcoming festive season despite gloom from some quarters about the potential risks it poses which has seen companies scrambling to cancel christmas parties the prime minister and health secretary were adamant last week that the public should carry on as they have been recently meanwhile some of our european neighbours have reacted by imposing stringent travel bans nationwide restrictions and even mandatory vaccination amid all this it s difficult to know what to make of the risks and how we should respond to provide some clarity the mail on sunday spoke to the experts and the prevailing attitude was that while omicron must be taken seriously its emergence was not unexpected of what little is known some is concerning and some reassuring importantly based on current evidence there is no cause for panic here is what you need to know the newly discovered omicron variant of the covid 19 virus has caused panic across the globe but is this fear justified the mail on sunday has spoken to some of the uk s most eminent scientists who are optimistic however advice on snogging under the mistletoe this christmas may disappoint some some people seem very worried about the new variant should i be too intense research into omicron has only just begun so it s too soon to know much for certain so far there has been a lot of speculation which isn t helpful said dr julian tang a virus expert at the university of leicester relatively little is known about omicron even among scientists added professor mark woolhouse an epidemiologist at the university of edinburgh the facts so far are as follows on november 25 south african health officials announced an uptick in covid cases linked to a new variant due to the large number and type of mutations or changes to the variant it could be more transmissible the scientists said meaning it could spread faster than previous iterations the next day the world health organisation who declared it a variant of concern and named it omicron the 15th letter in the greek alphabet following its variant naming system omicron is likely more infectious than the currently dominant delta variant which itself was 60 per cent more infectious than the alpha variant which overtook the original wuhan virus in late 2020 millions of people such as prue leith pictured here receiving her booster jab from dr cath rose at the chipping norton health centre in oxfordshire is one of the millions of people who have received additional protection against the omicron variant since then it has been identified in more than 20 countries worldwide including britain on thursday dr michelle groome of south africa s national institute for communicable diseases said there had been an exponential increase in infections over the past two weeks in mid november the country where just a quarter of the population have been jabbed was seeing roughly 300 new cases per day last monday they recorded 2 858 cases by wednesday it was 8 561 and on friday it was 16 055 based on what s being seen there experts say the south african scientists initial assessment seems correct omicron is likely more infectious than the currently dominant delta variant which itself was 60 per cent more infectious than the alpha variant which overtook the original wuhan virus in late 2020 and it is this primarily that has caused concern how much more infectious is omicron however due to south africa s low vaccination rate it s not possible to make direct comparisons with european countries we d need to see more numbers before putting a figure on it said prof woolhouse i have read ominous things about vaccine escape does this mean our jabs won t protect us against omicron the swift spread of omicron in south africa hints that it has some capacity to overcome existing immunity but there is no suggestion that the vaccines will no longer be effective indeed scientists we spoke to believe the jabs will still provide an incredibly strong protection against serious illness which is key and this is why the booster programme which aims to have every adult offered a third dose by the end of january is still vital the swift spread of omicron in south africa hints that it has some capacity to overcome existing immunity but there is no suggestion that the vaccines will no longer be effective what we know for certain is that a south african study published last week examined medical reports of roughly three million people with lab confirmed covid it found 35 670 suspected reinfections people who d caught covid a second time after having tested positive three months or more before based on this data the scientists estimated omicron was three times as likely to cause reinfection as the delta or alpha variants this is not overly surprising said professor francois balloux director of the genetics institute at university college london the large number of mutations in the spike protein increase the omicron variant s ability to bypass immunity the spike protein is part of the covid virus that allows it to bind to healthy cells much like a key entering a lock the outer shell of the roughly spherical viral particle is covered in them most covid vaccines including the pfizer moderna and astrazeneca jabs are designed to mimic the coronavirus spike protein they work in part by teaching the immune system to create defensive cells called antibodies which recognise and attach to this part of the virus stopping the key from ever entering the lock scientists have long known that the more changes there are to the spike protein the more likely it is that covid antibodies even in a fully vaccinated individual will not recognise the virus allowing it to slip past the body s defences in omicron the spike protein has 32 mutations differentiating it from previous variants which is what has led experts to suspect that existing antibodies will be less effective in fighting it off how much this is the case isn t known this is partly because antibodies are not the only cells that the immune system develops to fight off viruses the covid vaccines also trigger the creation of t cells and b cells fighter cells that attack foreign invaders and experts believe that these cells will still be able to identify the omicron variant neutralising it before the majority of fully vaccinated people become seriously unwell a similar pattern was seen with the delta variant which arrived in the uk in march early lab studies suggested mutations to the spike protein would allow it to slip past many of our antibodies and scientists estimated the jabs would be only 67 per cent effective a massive fall from the initial 90 per cent touted by the manufacturers however half a year on experts believe protection against delta provided by the vaccines only fell by roughly three per cent we have our t cells and b cells to thank for this said virologist dr tang and i expect we ll see the same with omicron the majority of the vaccinated population will still be protected from the worst of the disease is it true that omicron is causing a milder illness than previous variants early signs again from south africa suggest that many people who catch omicron are experiencing only mild symptoms however experts have warned against making too many comparisons or forecasts at this stage based on the current evidence little is known about the severity of infection with or without vaccination caused by omicron prof balloux said south africa has a low vaccination rate but a large proportion of the population has been infected during previous covid 19 waves the population of south africa also tends to be fairly young with a median age of 27 6 years more data will be needed before we can make robust predictions about the potential threat posed by a global spread of omicron speaking at a press conference on wednesday the who s dr maria van kerkhove said we have seen reports of cases with omicron that go from mild all the way to severe there is some indication that some the patients are presenting with mild disease but it is early days the severity of covid illness depends on a multitude of factors which is what makes this a particularly difficult question to untangle and a proper answer may not come for many months the severity of covid illness depends on a multitude of factors which is what makes this a particularly difficult question to untangle and a proper answer may not come for many months the main concern is that even if it s not causing severe illness in general omicron could spread rapidly through the vaccinated population increasing the chances that it will reach vulnerable people whose immune systems have not been sufficiently trained by the vaccines or the unvaccinated professor penny ward a pharmaceutical expert at king s college london said it may be a while before we know the effect on older more vulnerable people how quickly is omicron spreading in the uk at the time of going to press there have been more than 150 cases of the omicron variant detected in the uk but scientists believe there are already many more that haven t been picked up a cluster of cases was identified in scotland while individual cases have been seen in liverpool norfolk and nottingham however the majority have been seen in london including an israeli doctor who attended a medical conference before travelling back to tel aviv where he was diagnosed experts say these will just be the tip of the iceberg because roughly only one in seven pcr tests are analysed for variants it will likely take some time before it outpaces delta which is still causing nearly 50 000 new cases each day we know from experience of alpha and delta that by the time you ve learnt it s here the horse has already bolted said dr tang considering we have so few restrictions in place it s likely this virus will propagate at speed however it will likely take some time before it outpaces delta which is still causing nearly 50 000 new cases each day professor paul hunter an infectious diseases expert at the university of east anglia said it s unlikely we ll see big omicron numbers before january will we see more restrictions on monday health secretary sajid javid confirmed that hospitalisations would be what matters more than anything when considering further measures and based on what we know so far these are unlikely to rise for some time the variant would have to significantly reduce the effectiveness of the vaccines before major social restrictions such as lockdowns were necessary in the uk experts told us studies show the booster jabs which have now been given to nearly 90 per cent of britons over the age of 70 provide an unprecedented level of protection against the virus and even if omicron dents this we re starting from an ideal position to fight it off said dr david strain clinical covid lead at the royal devon and exeter nhs foundation trust the variant would have to significantly reduce the effectiveness of the vaccines before major social restrictions such as lockdowns were necessary in the uk experts told us according to an israeli study published in november a third dose of the pfizer jab increased protection against symptomatic infection to as much as 94 per cent the effect of this is already being seen in the uk where hospitalisations are now falling particularly in older age groups even as covid cases rise dr strain explained the boosters put us in a wonderful position before this new variant arrived omicron has dented that campaign somewhat but if you are fully boosted you are still in an ideal position to defend against it disease modellers believe that the strength of the boosters is such that the nhs could tolerate even a large wave of omicron prof woolhouse said healthcare settings could probably bear some fall off in protection given just how effective the boosters appear to be however i d like to see some numbers before i say that with certainty studies looking at how effective the boosters are against this variant are a priority right now on november 25 the government announced that it would temporarily ban travellers from six southern african countries and reintroduce pcr tests for all passengers on arrival no matter where from to combat the spread of the variant and last week masks once again became mandatory in indoor public spaces including shops and public transport these measures will buy the uk some time while scientists race to analyse the variant ministers have said we ve been told that boosters are vital but the rules keep changing how will i know when and where to get mine last week the government announced that all adults would be offered a booster covid vaccine three months after their second dose it means the entire adult population will have at least been given the opportunity to have a third dose by the end of january on friday nhs england issued an update saying the rollout would begin on december 13 until then those eligible to book a booster remains as it was only those aged 40 and over those aged 16 and over with a health condition that puts them at high risk from covid and frontline health and social care workers who had their second dose more than six months ago these groups should already have received an invitation via text message or email or both after december 13 as with the initial vaccine campaign people will be invited in descending age order again this will be in the form of text or email at present if you look at the nhs covid vaccine booking website it states in a yellow box at the top of the page the nhs is working on plans to offer a booster dose to everyone aged 18 years old and over please wait to be contacted by the nhs the government recommends that people book a jab appointment or locate a walk in service through the nhs website go to nhs uk scroll down and click find out about covid 19 vaccination or google book a covid jab and click on the top result titled book or manage a coronavirus covid 19 vaccination the process is relatively straightforward and requires people to enter their name age and address the nhs uk booking form asks if you know your nhs number however it s not a problem if you don t have this to hand once this is done you will be given a list of nearby clinics where you can access the booster these might be a gp surgery a pharmacist a hub at a community centre hospital or a walk in service anyone who has trouble accessing the internet can book their booster jab through their gp but family doctors have asked that this is done as a last resort dr dean eggitt a doncaster based gp said if you ring up your surgery for help with a booster jab they should be able to organise it for you but you could be waiting on the phone for quite some time so it is far speedier to do it online eligible people who are housebound will be prioritised under the new system and should already be known to their gp who will organise a booster to be done in the home if you are housebound and are not sure if your gp is aware you should contact them patients in hospital who have not yet had their booster will also be able to receive their shot in hospital in some areas such as the isle of wight and hampshire special booster buses have been deployed offering jabs to eligible passers by in different locations on each day do we have enough vaccines to boost everyone yes but the real challenge will be finding enough people to administer them according to the government there are enough available vaccines to offer every adult in england a top up shot by the end of january to achieve this the number of boosters administered every day will have to increase from 350 000 to 500 000 speaking on tuesday prime minister boris johnson said that 1 500 pharmacies would begin providing boosters alongside temporary vaccine centres that will be popping up like christmas trees as well as 400 military personnel and a jabs army of volunteers speaking on tuesday prime minister boris johnson said that 1 500 pharmacies would begin providing boosters alongside temporary vaccine centres that will be popping up like christmas trees as well as 400 military personnel and a jabs army of volunteers gps will also be called on to carry out more boosters and will be offered up to 30 per vaccine given however gps have warned this will affect the level of care they can offer patients dr eggitt said the challenge was enormous if we re expected to vaccinate on this ambitious timeline practices will have to make the decision over what they will do less of and that may include measures such as temporarily suspending routine health checks what about christmas is it really ok to carry on as planned yes but it wouldn t hurt to be careful say experts it is too soon to say how quickly the omicron variant will proliferate but based on experience with the delta variant it will take several months before it becomes widespread this means the chances of catching omicron right now are incredibly small and that will still be so in three weeks time for this reason socialising with family is still a low risk activity i really don t think christmas is anything to worry about said prof hunter during christmas and boxing day you re actually mixing with fewer people than you do on a normal day so if anything you re reducing your chances of catching it during this period scientists point out that right now the huge presence of delta is a bigger worry with more than 50 000 new cases a day scientists point out that right now the huge presence of delta is a bigger worry with more than 50 000 new cases a day ministers have sent mixed messages with work and pensions secretary therese coffey warning the public not to snog under the mistletoe and mr javid countering that it s got nothing to do with the government who you kiss he did however encourage people to take lateral flow tests before attending christmas parties prof hunter said i think if you are older and concerned about your health and omicron i would probably recommend giving crowded christmas parties in busy bars a miss because the number of people you will be mixing with is much larger i wouldn t tell anyone to cancel their christmas day plans prof woolhouse said there s nothing in the data to suggest any need for a policy change before christmas hospitalisations and deaths are still falling i agree that taking a lateral flow test before attending a christmas party would be wise we know these tests will flag up this new variant as well as others could more jabs be needed even after the booster possibly on thursday it was announced that the uk had bought 114 million extra booster jabs from pfizer and moderna which will be used over 2022 and 2023 vaccine developers are already putting plans in place to adapt their current jabs to the new variant should it be deemed dangerous but this does not necessarily mean that new vaccines will be needed the technology used to create the pfizer and moderna jabs can be tweaked at speed to match the mutations of emerging variants last week pfizer said it was investigating the omicron variant to assess whether an adjustment was needed if it is the american firm said it could develop new doses in six weeks and begin shipping in just over three months moderna and oxford astrazeneca have also said they are analysing how effective their vaccines are against omicron however ugur sahin chief executive and co founder of pfizer s german partner biontech said we think it s likely that vaccinated people will already have substantial protection against severe disease caused by omicron despite this virus expert professor lawrence young at warwick medical school said it would be prudent for the manufacturers to adapt future boosters to the omicron variant whatever the result there are only so many mutations that can occur to the spike protein and omicron has the most we ve seen yet by far any vaccine that can be adapted to match it will have a good chance at fighting off any future variants too there seem to be more questions than answers when will we know more experts say it could be months before we have a clearer understanding of omicron scientists around the world are currently analysing the variant blood samples taken from people either previously infected with the virus or fully vaccinated against it will be exposed to omicron to see how the two interact primarily they will be looking at how effective existing covid antibodies are at neutralising the new variant even then laboratory tests can only work out how much protection prior immunity provides they do not tell us much about the severity of disease professor penny ward a pharmaceutical expert at king s college london said the only way we can know how many people will end up in hospital or dead as a result of the variant is through real world data involving people this means the more people who catch the virus the clearer the picture will become last week professor wendy barclay a virologist at imperial college london said it will take several weeks if not a few months before we have clearer answers will this blasted pandemic never end government scientific advisers warned ministers that covid would be a threat to the nhs for at least a further five years according to documents released on friday after that the scientists members of the government s virus modelling group spi m said it was likely the virus would settle into a predictable endemic state where the virus continues to circulate in the population but does not threaten to overwhelm the health service the government have already bought two more years worth of vaccine supply for annual boosters in 2022 and 2023 the government have already bought two more years worth of vaccine supply for annual boosters in 2022 and 2023 after omicron there will be another variant and another after that said prof woolhouse scientists make the comparison with russian flu a pandemic that occurred in the 1890s killing around one million people modern studies suggest that russian flu was a form of coronavirus called oc43 similar in structure to the one that causes covid professor young said the russian flu pandemic went on for roughly four years and then petered out i d expect us to see a similar pattern however prof woolhouse did have some hope the majority of deaths from russian flu happened in the first two years based on that and the strength of our vaccines i m confident the worst of this pandemic is behind us

israeli defense officials have come out strongly against the sale of 51 percent of israel s communications satellite operator spacecom to a hungarian communications corporation with ties to hungarian prime minister viktor orban the defense ministry was said to have been surprised to hear the announcement in june by the israeli company which markets services of the israeli satellite amos that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with 4ig a publicly traded corporation 4ig is owned by one of the wealthiest people in hungary lorinc meszaros who is a close associate of prime minister viktor orban israel s security establishment whose approval is required for the deal to be finalized is reportedly concerned over the transfer of spacecom considered a strategic security asset to foreign hands as spacecom also provides services to government ministries and various security agencies in israel this is a bizarre deal which abandons israel s satellite communications to unstable and undemocratic entities senior defense officials said a main concern is that the transfer of ownership of the amos satellite series will damage one of israel s strategic tools and could lead to the exposure of classified and sensitive materials about israeli citizens government ministries and various security agencies to extremist elements security officials also suspect that orban himself is behind the purchase assisted by his right hand man meszaros who has claimed in the past that he amassed his wealth with the help of god luck and viktor orban a defense official familiar with the details added that since the sale of strategic assets like the haifa port desalination plants food companies and the construction of the light rail in metropolitan tel aviv to chinese corporations there has been a decision to change policy according to the official the new policy will not allow a foreign country to purchase more than 20 percent of an israeli concern defined as having strategic importance spacecom said in response that the company is working in a managed manner with the authorized entities to receive the permits as legally required the company announced that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with 4ig on june 13 ahead of the major deal in which the hungarian company will purchase more than half of spacecom s shares that is ownership of the company at a cost of 221 million shekels 69 9 million spacecom carries a large debt of about 1 4 billion shekels and it lost 11 million in the first nine months of 2021 the company has only 96 million in its coffers yet 4ig offered to buy the controlling interest at 190 percent of the value of its shares the reason for this high price according to various individuals is meszaros desire to buy it in order to give orban control over communication satellites there have been claims that since meszaros purchased control of 4ig it has received many government contracts from orban and according to a report on the website intellinews com after meszaros took control of 4ig in 2019 its shares went up 600 percent meszaros then sold his shares in 4ig to his associate gellert jaszi who according to a report to the tel aviv stock exchange still has controlling ownership of the company the hungarians have apparently realized that the deal isn t set and that israel s security establishment will present obstacles to its finalization and have hired the services of strategist israel bachar who was an adviser to defense minister benny gantz when he went into politics and ran for election for prime minister the hungarians want bachar to promote the deal in israel from a pr standpoint but figures familiar with the details believe that bachar is being asked among other things to use his connections to promote the deal to individuals who could influence decision makers orban is a controversial figure both in israel and according to european countries who are concerned about his heavy handed conduct a report by the washington d c based ngo freedom house from may 2020 stated that hungary can no longer be considered a democracy because of the unprecedented steps orban has taken to strengthen his power since his election orban has acted to turn hungary into an illiberal democracy in which he controls almost all centers of power and uses them to consolidate his hold on government in addition to the concern over hungary s control of spacecom security officials have emphasized in the past the importance of israeli control of its satellites the launch and operation of israeli made and owned communications satellites will prevent dependence on foreign entities and ensure independence and freedom of operation to israel a report by the national security council stated in 2016 in a 2016 discussion that included members of the science ministry s national council for research and development it was stated that independent capacity in the realm of communications satellites should be seen as a national asset to be protected the council s committee on space recommended that permanent government funding be granted to communications satellites but the recommendation has not been discussed by the government consequently the 2018 state comptroller s report was critical of the conduct of political and security officials in the realm of communications satellites israeli made communications satellites under israeli ownership constitute strategic infrastructure for israel this infrastructure is of supreme importance and is required among other things to ensure the country s communications

the troubles in arkansas was a front page headline in the new york times 150 years ago this month the story printed on dec 27 1871 told of racial violence in the delta an episode later labeled as the chicot county race war or the chicot county massacre the news was emblematic of the times as reconstruction roiled arkansas and other states of the former confederacy before white rule came roaring back after 1876 and jim crow laws began enforcing racial segregation once again the inflammatory events in and around the county seat of lake village seem startling in retrospect because black arkansans were the main aggressors and whites were the main targets that was the reverse of the period s normal equation as black liberties won by the civil war were squelched in sometimes brutal fashion by the ku klux klan and other white supremacists today the chicot county bloodshed flickers only dimly in history s annals a search of the arkansas democrat gazette archives finds not a single listing for chicot county race war or chicot county massacre over the last quarter of a century nor do any articles show up in the arkansas historical quarterly archive files the central arkansas library system s indefatigable encyclopedia of arkansas does offer a summary of the turbulence the sources it lists online are mostly stories printed in 1871 and 1872 by the arkansas gazette and other newspapers of that time the encyclopedia s account begins with a snapshot of events in late 1871 chicot county was taken over by several hundred african americans the murder of an african american lawyer prompted the area s black citizens to kill the men jailed for their role in the murder and take over the area many white residents fled escaping by steamboat to memphis and other nearby river towns the situation arose in part from the radical wing of the republican party exercising its power in choosing local officials both mississippi and chicot counties populations were primarily black with blacks outnumbering whites four to one in chicot county chicot county had ranked before the civil war as one of the most prosperous in the state thanks primarily to the slave labor on large plantations that grew cotton corn and fruit around lake chicot an offshoot of the mississippi river that antebellum economy dissolved after 1865 reconstruction gave former slaves the rights to vote and hold office while at least temporarily disenfranchising former confederates many chicot county freedmen were active in the 1868 elections which brought republicans to power statewide in large measure thanks to the new black voters the county s beleaguered planters backed democratic candidates but the county s population was predominantly black so republicans swept the voting a key figure in the violence that broke out in 1871 was a well educated black republican politician james w mason illegitimate son of a prominent prewar slaveholder under reconstruction mason became the first documented black postmaster in the united states serving the town of sunnyside he later was elected to the state senate mason s abilities as well as his charismatic personality made it possible for him to draw a large number of supporters for any cause he espoused recounts the encyclopedia of arkansas this made many local whites blame him for the violence that erupted in 1871 a prelude to the december strife began in april with separate appointments of mason and rival black politician e d ragland as chicot county probate judge mason managed to install himself in the profitable office while ragland was forced to leave the county after more confrontations in the summer mason held his ground as tensions percolated the ensuing racial violence seems to have been sparked in december when black lawyer walthall g wynn possibly mason s brother in law was fatally shot in a lake village general store that sold liquor in an era when newspapers regularly reprinted dispatches from other papers part of the new york times front page coverage on dec 27 1871 came from the vicksburg miss herald its headline negroes in armed possession of a village three white murderers lynched by them other lawless acts the vicksburg paper s account peppered with inflammatory language regarding the black actions reported it appears that on monday john sanders curtis garrett and a mr dugan became engaged in a political discussion with a negro lawyer named g w wynn in the barroom kept by garrett high words passed between sanders and wynn when the former procured a bowie knife from garrett and stabbed wynn in the neck killing him instantly the three white men who took part in the quarrel were arrested at once and lodged in jail the negroes became very much infuriated and threatened vengeance and for several days rumors of mob violence were rife and yet the authorities took no steps whatsoever to prevent it friday last a large crowd of armed negroes assembled around the county jail and demanded the keys of the sheriff he at once surrendered them when the fiends entered the jail took out sanders garrett and dugan and shot beat and battered them in the most horrible manner besmearing the walls and fences with their blood and then striking their bodies with every imaginable weapon the savages next repaired to the house in which wynn was killed and tore it down and destroyed everything it contained intense excitement prevailed and many of the white citizens were moving their families away to places of safety the bloodthirsty mob having threatened to burn the town and kill every white person in it the sheriff and other officers appeared unable to do anything with the mob and no one could tell where the bloody work would end also printed on the new york times dec 27 front page was a letter from mason seemingly written after the fatal shooting of wynn but before the three white assailants were killed mason wrote that wynn has fallen another victim to ku klux violence and of hatred to republican principles simply because he dared uphold the right and to speak in behalf of the weak and needy my heart is too full to write the spirit of rebellion and hatred to the national government is more bitter now than ever martial law ought to be declared throughout the entire south during the final week of 1871 and into 1872 newspapers printed dire descriptions of the situation some exaggerated or wholly untrue a paper in bangor maine quoted a report from little rock asserting that stores and homes had been looted the dispatch said that after the three white men were killed groups of blacks went to the saunders home demanding money it was paid according to the story but the vigilantes then killed all the stock of mules horses and cows owned by large planters in the vicinity many newspaper reports blamed the radical republicans for the trouble according to the jan 4 1872 galveston daily news the instructions and advice that the radicals have been so long industriously instilling in the negro mind are bearing their natural fruit the outbreak at chicot was the legitimate offspring of such advice republican backed newspapers disputed these accounts one such paper the little rock journal wrote we learn from the governor that the reports of ravishing and various other excesses reported by the telegrams are not true the mob have charge of the town and seem to be holding it under system they have pressed prisoners and mules etc into use but otherwise have not interfered with the rights of citizens the encyclopedia of arkansas notes that the governor sent his adjutant general keyes danforth to try to contain the situation by then chicot county s sheriff had asked for federal troops on jan 6 15 members of the state guard had been dispatched to lake village later in the month 250 u s soldiers were sent from new orleans although these troops remained only a short time they helped to bring an uneasy peace to the county the governor s guards stayed until late april by which time tensions seemed to have eased after all the tumult mason retained his political power he was elected county sheriff in november 1872 meanwhile the days of republican ascendancy were dwindling in 1873 the general assembly crafted a constitutional amendment that would grant political rights to all ex confederates voter approval led to the return of segregationist democratic rule which persisted for most of a century as white supremacy regained its hold on arkansas chicot county became one of the last strongholds of black authority as late as 1883 almost all of the county s elective offices were still held by blacks before legalized segregation again took its grip statewide and prevailed until the civil rights era guy lancaster editor of the encyclopedia of arkansas suggests that the paucity of information about the chicot county troubles is what i for want of a better term will call the exemplar problem that is one particular event starts to stand out for a whole phenomenon explains lancaster whose latest published book is american atrocity the types of violence in lynching university of arkansas press it attracts a lot of attention and research and the more attention and research something attracts the more it will attract in the future because the addition of all that secondary literature makes the bar for additional work much lower he cites the example of the central high school crisis of 1957 59 there are a number of very interesting stories of desegregation and opposition to it all across arkansas but central high has acquired enough mass that it s practically its own industry now especially if you have limited time and resources it becomes easier to delve into the literature surrounding these exemplar events and perhaps offer a different interpretation than it is to tackle something unexplored this is not to say that all new publications on central high or elaine or other subjects of equal stature are by any means redundant or unnecessary because we always need new scholarship to refine our views of even the best known events lancaster believes that we are going to see more research on some of these lesser known events in the future i think that the threshold is becoming lower for all kinds of research especially with the advent of so many digital resources in today s chicot county elected officials make up a racially mixed group while the county s population is no longer as overwhelmingly black figures from the 2020 census include 53 1 percent black 38 7 percent white 5 7 percent latino and 2 5 percent other or unreported the mayor of lake village is among that 2 5 percent sliver he is a second generation chinese american named joe dan yee a longtime chicot county resident yee is still fluent in chinese it s hard to imagine where or how his ethnicity might have fit into the racially fractured chicot county of 1871 and that is a marker perhaps of at least some small advance in arkansas delta race relations over the past 150 years jack schnedler retired in 2011 as the arkansas democrat gazette s deputy managing editor for features
megan searfoss has been hoarding sneakers in connecticut searfoss the owner of two running stores in darien and ridgefield conn would normally have about 3 000 pairs of shoes in stock ahead of the holiday season but as she watched supply chain concerns in vietnam mount this summer and into the fall she secured a new storage facility and is now carrying around 4 100 pairs it s a costly gamble for searfoss who said she is extended about 165 000 more than she would typically be in november because of worries about potential shortages it s placing a big bet and anticipating that what all the analysts are saying is correct searfoss said usually we get through the new york city marathon and then we stop buying shoes we sell off what we have and go into january super super lean but we re being told not to do that because there s just not going to be any shoes the buildup of running shoes in connecticut is just one example of how supply chain woes and pandemic related shortages are affecting thousands of small businesses around the united states this holiday season while the widespread availability of vaccines is translating into a busier shopping season than last year businesses of all sizes are grappling with the impact of factory shutdowns overseas backups at ports and trucking and other labor shortages for many small businesses the unpredictability this year has forced them to make buying decisions months or weeks earlier than they normally would and to tie up more of their cash in inventory which can be risky the big thing is you really have to order in advance said dan quinn an owner of what we make a furniture business in algonquin ill which sells tables and other wares through etsy i ve got 14 weeks of projects i need to get most of that material in house as fast as possible and keep buying it until you have a stockpile basically while many small businesses are affected by manufacturing issues overseas some have used this moment to their advantage etsy which powers online stores for millions of sellers said that more than half of its u s vendors source materials from within their own states allowing them to bypass many of the supply chain problems that are impacting the global economy etsy stores don t have the complex supply chains that are vulnerable to single points of failure josh silverman etsy s chief executive said in an interview still the range of shortages can manifest themselves in unusual ways isabel amigon owner of the online store sololi is still waiting on an order of christmas tree ornaments she placed in april the manufacturer alerted her that the order would be delayed because of a shortage in strings to tie on top of the decorated orbs amigon who is based in westchester county n y said that she was worried that if she didn t get them in time for the holiday season she would have to wait until next year to make use of the inventory the string shortage has also led her to remove specific home goods items from her website such as table runners and washcloths even if i get them by the end of november i won t be able to sell all of them because most people have already bought their ornaments amigon said i placed the orders early and i still have to face this situation other missing items are more traditional than string earlier this year angela and sean arnold were planning to order another set of disney princess dolls to fill some shelves in their toy store playmatters toys in pepper pike ohio but they got a notification in september from the distributor alerting them and other toy store owners that the items were indefinitely out of stock because the factory in vietnam where the dolls are manufactured was shut down because of a covid 19 outbreak even though they anticipated shipping delays and ordered some toys in mid may instead of august they could not get ahead of the global disruption and it s not only dolls the couple has been missing out on other toys and electronics because of shipping delays or disruptions in manufacturing plants in vietnam the couple has also been forced to raise prices on some products as they face higher transportation and wholesale costs from toy vendors some things we ordered in june and july are still coming in sean arnold said because of these kind of delays etsy has viewed this moment as one in which small businesses can provide gift options that are not reliant on overseas factories and shipping extra consumer interest in small businesses whether online or offline would likely be welcome after the pandemic dealt a crippling blow to so many last year etsy said it had seen searches for living room furniture soar by 1 572 and less dramatic but significant jumps for dining tables checkers or chess boards suggesting that some shoppers are coming to the site rather than going to chain stores etsy learned how to better handle large surges in demand after face masks exploded as a category on the site during the onset of the pandemic and it has made improvements designed to mitigate shipping issues it experienced then silverman said that now virtually all items from sellers in the u s have an expected delivery date which was not the case a year ago and shoppers can filter products by geography to shop from vendors in their area which can help accelerate shipping the company also said it checks in with sellers to ensure they have enough raw materials and supplies when its technology observes jumps in demand for specific items quinn the owner of the furniture seller what we make has seen his business boom as americans grapple with long wait times and lack of availability for furniture from chains customers have been willing to wait 10 weeks for a dining table from him particularly after seeing 20 week waits at chains like west elm the big box stores don t have a lot of things they normally have so the positive for us is that people are sort of forced to look at other options whereas before they d settle for the simplest option he said still he has seen his business disrupted in other ways including a sharp increase in material prices and a scramble for reclaimed wood which typically comes from old barns the people who take down the barns for the material we use a lot of them ended up getting laid off or going on unemployment quinn said so we have had to try to stockpile material and order well in advance of what we used to do while quinn has been thriving in spite of competition from major furniture sellers the country s biggest retailers are often better equipped to handle supply chain issues than small businesses companies like walmart and amazon are massive enough that they can charter airplanes to obtain certain goods jeannine cook doesn t have that luxury cook the owner of harriett s bookshop in philadelphia noticed during the summer that publishers were having trouble delivering her book orders with some unable to even provide a timeline for when orders would arrive the problem became more widespread in late august cook who opened a second location in collingswood n j in july said that more customers were canceling their orders from the bookshop it makes me nervous because i don t want folks to feel like they can t get what they need or want cook said it s hard because we re already up against the big box companies that have so much more infrastructure than we do a recent study by adobe showed that out of stock messages in october more than quadrupled compared with october 2019 that s one reason that the retail industry including small businesses have urged the public to shop early this year to secure gifts for the holiday season i hate that we have now gone right from halloween to christmas said searfoss the proprietor of the running stores who said that she began holiday marketing on nov 1 for the first time i don t want people to feel frantic but i do think it s pretty serious that they re not going to get what they want this year she anticipated that shipping delays and out of stock issues at bigger chains might drive business to her stores people those days before christmas will be buying whatever they can from whatever local store they can she said it s just a little bit stressful for me thinking ok look at all that i ve bought searfoss said if i buy it will they come
sometimes a gas bill is not just a demand for payment it is a secret weapon and as millions of british voters see their bills spiral this spring they will find themselves in its crosshairs recently three more energy supplies went bust bulb orbit energy entice energy bringing the total number of suppliers that have failed to 24 in under 12 weeks in october european gas prices were six times higher than a year previously which means suppliers must pay more for wholesale energy than they can sell it for under the government s energy price cap and in the spring when the government raises the price cap the few surviving companies will hike their prices to claw back the losses they made over the winter it is a scary prospect but readers trying to understand our cost of living crisis must look beyond the business pages to geopolitics the russian president vladimir putin did not cause the global energy crisis but he has used it to turn his country s gas reserves into a loaded gun aimed at the west he took one look at the conditions a long winter growing demand from india and china the destruction of gas storage in countries such as the uk maintenance backlogs in gas fields elsewhere and seized his moment and in this instance he had a specific aim in mind beyond his permanent desire to humiliate the west to force european and german regulators to certify the now completed nord stream 2 pipeline that will transport far greater quantities of gas under the baltic sea to europe and provide valuable currency for a struggling russian economy don t expect more supply is his unsubtle message unless you play ball on nord stream russia has form on using gas as a weapon it twice shut off gas supplies to ukraine and its western friendly government in the 2000s when moldova elected a new pro eu government this year gazprom dramatically hiked its charges and cut deliveries by a third leading to the declaration of a state of emergency this time putin didn t even need to turn off the taps to put pressure on its rivals russia honoured its existing contracts but simply refused to pump any more gas as european demand soared following the end of lockdowns far more dramatically than any number of russian warships or bombers flying near british airspace this underlined putin s message that europe should be wary in its dealings with him after all he has his hand on europe s jugular putin s tactics may not have worked in the short term nordstream s approval is currently suspended by german regulators and he ended up ordering the pumping of more gas but he s playing a long game and has struck fear in the heart of europe s politicians british consumers have unwittingly found themselves playing a walk on part in a revolution in geopolitics one in which putin has been a pioneer carl von clausewitz called war the continuation of politics by other means but in a nuclear age the price of war is unfathomable that is why connectivity conflicts are becoming the other means of global politics countries are waging conflicts by manipulating the very things that link them together it is connectivity itself that gives people the opportunity to fight the reasons to compete and the arsenal to deploy great power politics has become like a loveless marriage where the couple are unable to get divorced and as with an unhappy couple it is the things they shared during the good times that become the means to harm in a collapsing marriage vindictive partners use the children the dog and the holiday home to hurt each other in geopolitics it is gas supply chains finance the movement of people the internet and even problems such as covid and climate being weaponised just look at the world s response to covid rather than working together to increase global supplies of vaccines masks and gowns countries such as china have used their stocks to bully others 98 countries imposed export restrictions on ppe and medicines when it comes to trade and finance one of the reasons putin wanted to fight against the west is the fact that his country has been under strict sanctions since he annexed crimea in 2013 sanctions have become a weapon of first resort with china targeting japan russia sanctioning turkey and the usa listing over 800 entities in 2020 alone russia is one of many countries that have used the internet to interfere with other nations affairs between autumn 2016 and spring 2019 there were election interference attempts in 20 democracies representing 1 2 billion people and that s before we look at questions such as cambridge analytica even migrants are being turned into bullets witness belarus s dictator and his secret services who enticed refugees from the middle east via belarus into poland and lithuania to put pressure on their governments the academic kelly greenhill has documented over 75 occasions in the last few decades when countries from cuba and morocco to libya and turkey have used forced migration to achieve political military or economic goals we may be on the cusp of a new silent pandemic like covid 19 it is spreading across the planet exponentially exploiting the cracks in our networked world and constantly mutating to evade our defences but unlike the virus which pits all of humanity against a disease this new pandemic is being deliberately transmitted it is not biological but a set of toxic behaviours that are multiplying like a virus the connections between people and countries are becoming weapons it is connectivity itself that gives people the opportunity to fight the reasons to compete and the arsenal to deploy conventional wars have been receding for decades more people now take their own lives than die in armed conflict every year but that doesn t mean we live in an age of peace academics who work on cyber issues were looking to describe the grey zone in which their world was immersed where every day they saw millions of attacks that fell short of conventional war they rehabilitated an anglo saxon word unpeace and as violence spreads from the internet to trade finance migration and beyond their word provides a perfect encapsulation of our condition british gas customers are becoming familiar with an unstable crisis prone world of perpetual competition and endless attacks between competing powers welcome to the age of unpeace
twenty one years and more than 75 000 ago linda and david brookes had a plan with retirement on the not too distant horizon they d start funneling money into their new long term care insurance policies in return when age and infirmity finally caught up with them they d get the help they need without going broke or becoming a financial burden on their four children then came the shakedown this letter is to notify you that we have recently filed for a 112 premium rate increase in your long term care insurance policy read the letter david received from genworth life insurance co this fall linda got the same notice except genworth said it wants to bump her premium by 146 percent typos they wish some kind of practical joke there s nothing funny about it a company passing the buck or in this case the bill for its own failure now we re getting warmer advertisement it s unbelievable linda brookes said in an interview last week i just can t believe it nor can the hundreds of other mainers all in their twilight years who logged in thursday for an online forum on one of the insurance industry s most colossal screw ups in modern times long term care insurance once ballyhooed as the key to peace of mind and financial security is fast becoming the boondoggle of the century the brookeses are by any measure a responsible prudent couple linda 72 is a retired social worker david 81 worked for motorola they lived for 20 years in scarborough before moving in 2015 to florida confident that when the time came for long term care not covered by medicare and most supplementary health plans their genworth policies would foot the bill no relying on their children for money no draining their assets and hoping their fixed incomes might qualify them for medicaid no dependency whatsoever beyond the coverage genworth promised them all those years ago they also thought at least at first that their monthly premiums would remain affordable while genworth had the right to make occasional adjustments any rate increases would have to first be approved by the maine bureau of insurance but increases of 112 percent and 146 percent or in the case of other maine policyholders 178 percent let me go out on a limb here and suggest that s beyond unfair advertisement it is i couldn t agree more eric cioppa the bureau s superintendent said in an interview following last week s forum if i m not here to help out consumers in this case to the extent i can what am i here for at the root of all this is an industry wide product in free fall as cioppa noted at the outset of thursday s four plus hour marathon the long term care insurance market arose about 40 years ago and was from the beginning built on a host of severely flawed assumptions insurers thought they could fund future claims over the long term by investing premium payments at an annual rate of return somewhere between 6 percent and 8 percent in reality the bonds in which all that cash was stashed have performed as cioppa noted at well under 4 percent meaning genworth like other companies that made the same mistake now finds itself in a hole that will only grow deeper as more claims pour in the insurance companies also factored in a lapse rate the number of customers who over time fail to renew their policies at between 4 and 5 percent just like the longstanding rate for life insurance policies wrong again fewer than 1 percent of long term care policyholders have let their plans lapse finally the companies miscalculated their morbidity projections or to be more blunt they thought their customers would die sooner alzheimer s and other long lasting diseases have turned that assumption on its head all of which brings us to the central question that had more than 400 genworth customers with almost 4 100 policies in maine it s the state s largest long term care provider glued to their computer screens thursday who should have to pay for this screw up the customers who signed on in good faith or the company that made a colossally bad bet advertisement linda brookes who along with her husband has already sunk 75 057 into their genworth policies since 1999 and would now see their premiums jump from 5 184 to 11 868 annually was more than ready for her turn to speak her deeply researched presentation initially clocked in at over seven minutes but she trimmed it to meet the forum s initial five minute ground rule then after the list of people wanting to speak grew beyond 200 the speaking slots were cut to a mere two minutes forcing brookes to further condense her outrage i find myself struggling to define the difference between elder financial exploitation and coercion and the premium raising practices of genworth and the maine bureau of insurance it seems a very fine distinction indeed she said referring not just to the latest proposed rate hike but to other increases and benefit cuts she and her husband already have endured in recent years unlike many others who used their allotted time simply to vent brookes then quickly listed her recommendations for cleaning up this mess impose a moratorium on all premium increases until solutions can be found that take customers concerns into account recognize the erosion of trust in not just the insurance industry but also the state officials who are supposed to regulate it factor in the savings genworth will realize from people who reduce their benefits to save their policies account for the money genworth has saved due to policyholders dying sooner than projected from covid 19 and finally allow companies like genworth to improve their cash reserves by investing in more than just the low yield bond market all good ideas here s another shift the burden of responsibility for this circus away from the policyholders and onto genworth and the other companies who from the outset were far better at selling these plans than at estimating how much they d cost that reckoning might start at the top as more than one speaker noted at last week s forum genworth president and ceo thomas mcinerney s annual compensation package is north of 9 million related read more from bill nemitz this does not appear to be reflective of a company struggling to say solvent brookes observed in her pre edited comments it s hard to say where all this is headed genworth wants its request for a rate hike wrapped up by august although superintendent cioppa won t go beyond saying it will be resolved sometime in 2022 genworth in all likelihood won t get all it wants it s up to cioppa to determine whether the proposed new rates are excessive and discriminatory but those sitting on policies still lie awake worrying how much they re going to get soaked this time advertisement as brookes put it after giving her two minutes worth at the forum the most we can do is to educate the public on an issue that has led to serious consequences for policyholders and hope the powers that be will pick up on the opportunity to actually do some good for the people by legislating effective barriers to genworth s and other insurers stunning arrogance late friday i received an email from danielle bolt senior communications manager for genworth most of it was a recap of what another company official had already said at thursday s gathering all rooted in the reality that genworth s projections like the rest of the industry s played out differently than projected bolt also listed a range of options from which genworth policyholders now can choose keep paying the full premium however jacked up it turns out to be accept further benefit cuts in exchange for a lower but still higher monthly bill or stop paying premiums now and if and when need arises genworth will pay claims up to but not exceeding the total premiums paid to date that last one s a real laugher any policyholder could have achieved the same thing simply by putting their money in a cookie jar noted bolt we are focused on leveraging the touchpoints we have with our policyholders to provide education on their coverage and potential coverage needs if only they d educated themselves first send questions comments to the editors previous

in the view of the american left we should strive for the much more desirable system of socialism you know a type of socialism that has never worked anywhere in the world but the kind that only they can oversee to achieve this they espouse the virtues of socialism over capitalism that tone of lazy economic ignorance and lack of new entrepreneurs will foretell problems for our country years of the influence of obama bernie sanders elizabeth fauxcahontas warren joe biden kamala harris aoc and the populist left wing media have left today s youngsters thinking that socialism is a utopia of wonderful things for which no one has to pay they think socialism s great offerings are free education free health care and free housing yet they are not taught history s clear lesson socialism s three great failures always end up being breakfast lunch and dinner i hope this current generation can reverse this mindset statistics show that the percentage of adults under age thirty who own a business is the lowest in thirty years today fewer than four percent own a stake in a private company compared with 6 1 percent in 2010 even more troubling this number was just under eleven percent in 1989 the trend toward a lost generation of entrepreneurs has profound implications for the growth of our economy we have raised kids who are averse to risk and hard work and more americans want a government job or a disability check when they think of free markets they think they are free because government pays for them and should gumption atrophies in a generation expecting participation trophies and stay at home covid checks maybe this generation has been raised in bubble wrap no bike riding certainly not without a helmet and shin guards no dodge ball in school no playing outside in the neighborhood no drinking from garden hoses and no talking to strangers we give ribbons for ninth place and everyone gets to play forty years ago we rode dirt bikes and bumper cars today the most popular rides are those motorized shopping carts at wal mart if we have something to fear it is that we fear too much risk is good risk teaches lessons risk provides good things failure is necessary it s a byproduct of risk and should not be ridiculed what deserves ridicule is not trying the massive student loan debt carried by kids coming out of liberal colleges might also impede their risk taking they are told that capitalism is evil and that somehow making a difference in the world involves some lame government bureaucracy job we had been importing many entrepreneurs who value the opportunity our country once represented a comedian said his immigrant father came to america from india ten years ago with only 35 in his pocket then he paused and said he had 4 6 million in stocks and bonds so i guess what i am saying is that he was not big on carrying cash obama and other liberals presuppose the evils of capitalism and capitalists to sell their statist socialist agenda but the facts are clear free market capitalism is a far more virtuous system than government and has done far more to improve the lot of mankind wherever it is allowed to flourish to see the abundance that our historically free enterprise system has bestowed on us compare the u s to the rest of the world travel to any third world country with a strong central government and a stranglehold on business and witness the poverty crime and misery spawned in places like venezuela north korea and cuba capitalism did not strap us with 30 trillion and growing in national debt borrowed from future generations to advance destructive dependency political agendas and buy votes is that moral and just businesses hire people help provide health insurance and other benefits pay taxes advertise support local charities and build the character of a community look to see who sponsors your town s little league teams those are your town s heroes how then is government more moral than business government takes money by force from people who are productive and redistributes it to its allies government adds no value and produces no product president trump proposed to an african american his platinum plan for black americans it would provide 500 billion in federally backed loans for black entrepreneurs i think it s a sting to catch hunter biden wearing blackface like this like loading related

vietnam manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi ticked up slightly to 52 2 in november photo vna the vietnam manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi ticked up to 52 2 in november from 52 1 in october signalling a second successive modest improvement in business conditions following a period of decline caused by the fourth wave of the covid 19 pandemic earlier in the year reported vietnam news agency in a report released on december 1 ihs markit said overall business conditions in the vietnamese manufacturing sector improved for the second month running in november but renewed worries about the covid 19 pandemic and associated labour shortages limited growth momentum meanwhile inflationary pressures continued to strengthen with both input costs and output prices increasing to the greatest extents since april 2011 according to the report new orders increased for the second month running as the easing of pandemic restrictions in recent months helped raise demand in the sector moreover the rate of expansion was solid and the sharpest since april new export orders also increased again but only modestly as covid 19 continued to constrain international trade higher new orders and a lower level of restrictions than seen earlier in the year meant that manufacturers were able to expand their production volumes again in november while new order growth accelerated this was not the case for output which increased at a broadly similar pace to that seen in october a number of firms indicated that labour shortages had restricted production a number of respondents indicated that workers were concerned about the pandemic and therefore were reluctant to return to work thereby making it difficult for manufacturers to expand staffing levels in line with greater workloads employment continued to fall markedly extending the current sequence of reduction to six months as a result backlogs of work increased for the third month running worries about the pandemic also impacted confidence among manufacturers with sentiment dropping from october that said firms remained optimistic that output will increase over the coming year amid hopes that the health situation will improve according to the report higher oil and transportation costs as well as raw material shortages contributed to a further increase in input prices in november moreover the rate of inflation accelerated for the third month running and was the steepest since april 2011 the same was also true for output charges which rose at a much faster pace than in october as firms passed on higher costs to their customers manufacturers expanded their purchasing activity for the second successive month in november albeit at a reduced pace despite the increase in input buying stocks of purchases declined for the first time in four months respondents indicated that the use of inputs to support production and issues securing materials were behind the drop the challenges in securing inputs were highlighted by data signalling a further marked lengthening of suppliers delivery times raw material shortages a lack of shipping capacity and issues with transportation due to the covid 19 pandemic all contributed to delivery delays that said the latest deterioration was the least marked in six months over 4 880 tonnes of rice allocated to three provinces hit by covid 19 pandemic over 4 880

can individual investors beat the s p 500 motley fool caps is a great way to find out we are often told that most people can t beat the market and the corollary to that is that we should all buy index funds an index fund is safer because with an index fund you are diversified and you ve minimized your risks but there s a downside to index funds as well the more stocks you own and an index fund represents an investment in many many stocks the worse your overall returns will be that s because an index fund is by definition a mediocrity with an index fund you own the good the pretty good the average the below average and the awful can you beat an index fund a great way to find out is to play motley fool caps in this stock picking game you pick the stocks that you think will beat the market and the software tracks your stock picks versus the s p 500 index i ve been playing caps for many years and it s given me confidence that my stock picks will indeed beat the market over time here s why individuals who pick stocks can and do outperform the market 1 index funds are limited an index fund limits itself to a category and then buys all the stocks in that category when people talk about the market they are usually talking about the u s stock market it s one of the strongest markets in the world if not the strongest so if you were to buy an index fund in australia or nigeria your returns would be limited to the overall returns in those markets some of the most popular index funds track the 500 american large caps these funds own shares in 500 companies in a variety of major industries in the u s economy a large cap stock is one that has been a big winner over time so if you buy an index fund that tracks 500 large cap stocks you re investing in the most successful u s companies how can an individual investor hope to do better than that actually there are a couple of ways 2 some sectors are stronger than others a major index fund protects you with diversity with an index fund you re going to have a partial interest in many tech stocks yes but you ll also own oil stocks grocery store chains airplanes accounting firms and more not all of these sectors are as dominant or fast growing in the u s economy as tech stocks for many years there was a fad of buying faang stocks an acronym that represented shares of facebook amazon amzn 1 54 apple netflix and google facebook is now known as meta platforms and google has become alphabet so the acronym doesn t work anymore but for many years investors in faang stocks outperformed the larger market that s because tech stocks overall have had fantastic returns over the last several decades many tech companies are growing fast and technology particularly software has very high profit margins for mature businesses so tech stocks have been very popular investment vehicles and they have definitely outperformed grocery stores and the like of course you might have a year when there s a tech wreck and all of those stocks get hammered in that particular year the holder of an index fund would outperform faang because big money would flow away from the tech sector and into whatever was performing well so an index fund limits your upside but it also protects your downside for when there s a crash 3 index funds miss the best investment prospects the only thing that beats the best stocks of today are the best stocks of tomorrow the strongest investment you can make is to buy shares of a small cap that goes on to become a mega cap the people who get rich in the stock market are the people who bought amazon when it was a 6 billion company or netflix when it was a 4 billion company if you had invested 1 000 in amazon back in the day you d be a millionaire now it s not rocket science indeed in my opinion investing is more art than science the trick to making that million with amazon was to be risk tolerant enough that you were able to buy shares in an unprofitable start up that was the top dog and first mover in internet commerce and then you had to be patient enough to hold on to your shares for a couple of decades while you allowed the miracle of compound returns to work its magic over time there s no index fund that will capture that small cap funds only own small cap stocks and sell them when the companies start to succeed they have to sell because successful small caps don t stay small caps for long and small cap funds can only hold small caps the large cap index funds wait and wait and wait until a company is obviously successful amazon joined the s p 500 in 2005 10 years after its initial public offering at the time amazon had a 19 billion market cap a 1 000 investment in amazon in 2005 will probably be worth at least 100 000 in 2025 amazon has been a fantastic stock for a lot of people but there s no question that early investors in amazon did significantly better than the late arrivals so that s the key to beating the market find those amazing small cap stocks out there the ones with huge market opportunities and buy and hold those stocks for a couple of decades
when kathleen stock opens the door she is friendly but a little on edge she has just had extra security installed at home she explains a reminder that a year in the eye of a toxic public storm has its price she leads the way down stairs lined with cheerful children s photographs having come out as lesbian relatively late in life 49 year old stock has two sons by a previous marriage her wife laura is expecting a baby in february to make tea once settled on the sofa she attempts to make sense of a rollercoaster of a year that began with an obe for services to education and ended with her resignation as professor of philosophy from the brighton based university of sussex amid angry protests over her stance on gender and transgender rights along the way she published material girls her book explaining why she believes biological sex matters and cannot be changed and had what she calls a bit of a mini breakdown i m excited in a weird way excited about my future she says there is relief too at escaping what she felt was an aggressive intimidating environment at her workplace of 18 years interestingly while some blamed the sussex standoff on a generation of students unable to tolerate views they dislike stock tells a different story most of the students i encounter are completely open minded and even if they disagree with me which i m sure a lot of them do they wouldn t hold it against me as a personal character flaw the problem she says was her peers no peer ever said to me look i really object to what you re saying and i d like to discuss it with you stock first became active in academic debates over what constitutes a woman and what that implies for access to single sex or lesbian spaces four years ago but the backlash really began with a 2018 interview she gave to the local paper in lgbt friendly brighton arguing that while most trans women wouldn t dream of harming anyone they shouldn t have unrestricted access to places where females undress or sleep because many trans women are still males with male genitalia words some find instantly offensive under the lgbtq charity stonewall s preferred definition of the term denying a trans person s stated identity is transphobic stock however insists she is doing no such thing she supports trans people s right to legal recognition of their identities and protection from discrimination violence and harassment she says but doesn t think that requires accepting people can literally change sex i don t think womanhood is a category that gets changed even by surgery let alone inner feelings i think it s to do with biology and sexual maturity but that doesn t mean i ve got any ambitions to remove the laws that give people the right to an acquired gender in certain contexts several sussex colleagues publicly denounced her on social media although strangely she says not to her face no peer ever said to me look i really object to what you re saying and i d like to discuss it with you they immediately went to defcon 1 she s a bigot arguing for single sex spaces is like the jim crow laws she remains fascinated by the performative aspects of social media debate the important thing is to show your tribe that you have the right morals and you could show that by saying i m not with her stock got used she says to being snubbed in corridors at sussex but the only time she becomes visibly distressed is describing a research talk she was due to give her department in april some graduate students organised a rival trans solidarity event with a guest speaker critical of stock and 40 of her colleagues chose that event over her talk she went off sick unable to function it just got me i can t really even say why but the things that get me are when it s your tribe yet she says she never really considered retreating instead in may she became a trustee of the controversial lgb alliance charity formed in protest at the consequences of stonewall s decision to campaign for trans as

the daughter of two english academics despite all the negative attention stock is adamant she doesn t consider herself silenced indeed she refuses to be but that isn t for her the point the point is

in late 2021 ukraine used its american fgm 148e javelin atgms anti tank guided missile against russian forces for the first time the russians continue to occupy portions of ukraine s two eastern provinces russia tried to seize this heavily industrialized area called the donbas don river basin in early 2014 but were halted by ukrainian forces moving in more quickly and fighting more effectively than the russians expected ukraine asked the united states for military assistance and received atgms and electronic equipment including counter battery radars until early 2021 the missiles had to be kept away from the ceasefire line and only used if the russians carried out a major offensive russia has been threatening to do that currently russia has nearly 100 000 troops concentrated on the ukrainian border and are openly threatening to invade that was enough to lift the restrictions on javelin use in early 2020 ukraine received another shipment of javelins this was a small order 27 million and the javelin is an expensive system each missile costs 112 00 and the reusable clu command launch unit costs 130 000 ukraine received a larger order of javelins in 2018 but these were provided free ukrainian interest in the javelin has more to do with the effectiveness of russian aps active protection systems on their latest tanks than just obtaining a modern atgm these aps systems have proved capable of defeating many existing atgm systems including those manufactured by ukraine and several other nations aps systems have been around since the 1990s and in the last decade they have improved to the point where they can regularly defeat many atgms as well as rpgs and other unguided systems the israelis have taken the lead in developing atgms that can defeat aps and the american javelin is headed in the same direction the javelin is also lighter and easier to use than ukrainian atgms and the troops at the front in eastern ukraine appreciate that the javelin was introduced in 2002 so far over 5 000 of these have been fired in combat and responses from users have led to regular upgrades the 148f javelin model entered service in 2020 the missile weighs 22 3 kg 49 pounds with disposable launch tube and battery seeker coolant unit and is fired from a 6 4 kg 14 pound clu which contains a 4x day sight and a 9x heat sensing night sight the missile has a tandem warhead two warheads to blast through reactive armor that can hit a target straight on or from the top this latter capability enables the javelin to use its 8 2 kg 18 pound warhead to destroy any existing tank including the u s m1 maximum range is 2 500 meters the seeker on the missile is fire and forget that is once the operator gets the target in the clu crosshairs and fires the missile the computer and seeker in the missile warhead memorizes the target and homes in on it the infantry loves this because it allows them to take cover once the missile is fired and indicates to the enemy where clu and its operator are ukraine develops and manufactures cheaper and nearly as effective atgms since the 1990s ukraine has been trying to develop new and competitive with israeli and american systems and in 2017 began shipping the skif atgm the russian invasion in 2014 accelerated the need for locally developed weapons because russian threats prevented ukraine from receiving new weapons from the west before 2014 these new ukrainian weapons were intended mainly for the export market but now much of the new stuff goes to ukrainian troops at least until the war with russia in eastern ukraine donbas is over skif is based on work done with neighboring belarus to develop the older shershen atgm the two countries differed on design of the joint project and each went their own way with ukraine developing the skif the ukrainian atgm is a 29 5 kg 65 pound missile stored and fired from an 8 5 kg 18 7 pound container that is mounted on a 32 kg 70 pound control unit max range of the laser guided missile is 5 500 meters the control unit contains a thermal sight and allows the operator to manually guide the missile to a moving target or designate a stationary target in fire and forget mode the firing unit can be detached from the tripod and operated up to 50 meters away from the rest of the system skif has two types of armor piercing warheads 130mm and 152mm the larger one capable of penetrating 1 1 meters of reactive and composite armor there is also a fragmentation warhead that is useful against structures skif is touted by the manufacturer as being comparable to the israeli spike lr but as a practical matter the spike uses more advanced technology and the main advantage skif has is lower price shelf life of the missiles in their sealed containers is 10 years but few of those produced over the next year or so are expected to remain on the shelf long ukraine has a long history with the development of atgms for example in 2013 ukraine tried to interest buyers in its new corsar atgm which was something of a scaled down skif the 105mm diameter cosar missile and its storage launch container weigh 18 kg 40 pounds the missile is laser homing with a range of 2 500 meters and its tandem warhead can penetrate 550mm of armor that is behind reactive explosive panels armor at the time poland expressed some interest even though poland has been using the israeli spike lr for several years but corsar is cheaper than spike and uses laser guidance rather than the more expensive fire and forget system israeli missiles employ the spike lr along with the sealed storage launch canister weighs 13 kg 28 6 pounds the canister is mounted on a 13 kg fire control system 10 kg without the tripod for aiming and firing the missile in its canister has a shelf life of twenty years and a range of 4 000 meters the spike uses a fiber optic cable so that the operator can literally drive the missile to the target although the missile can also be used in fire and forget mode israel is apparently flexible on what they charge for the spike lr saying only that it s cheaper than the similar javelin ukraine found that the export market was more crowded and competitive than they expected the larger longer ranged and cheaper than spike lr skif may not have been the answer but if it does well in donbas that will be a powerful assist for sales efforts ukraine has a lot of other potential new weapons and has made some progress in finding customers before the cold war ended in 1991 many soviet weapons design and production operations were in ukraine these were inherited by the newly independent ukraine after 1991 but most of these organizations went out of business because there were no more soviet armed forces placing large orders each year most of the foreign sales disappeared as well ukraine salvaged some weapons and design capability by selling off its large cold war stocks of soviet weapons at low prices and developing a willingness to sell to anyone who could pay ukraine now has a lot of customers in africa and asia and noted a growing demand for atgms these weapons are popular not just for their ability to destroy or disable most tanks but as highly portable and accurate artillery against all sorts of targets corsar and skif are old technology but the ukrainians still know how to produce it cheaply and reliably enough to attract some customers yet when skif or corsar fail against russian t 90s equipped with an upgraded arena aps it s time to check out what the foreigners have to offer

unstoppable stock investors can confidently put 10 000 to work in to end the year on a high note is payment processing giant mastercard ma 0 63 most payment processors have had a rough year with concerns about cryptocurrencies and fintech solutions stealing part of their pie however these worries look overblown especially for an established company like mastercard which controlled 22 of credit card network purchase volume in the u s the largest market for consumption in the world as of 2018 the best aspect of mastercard s operating model is its cyclical ties even though recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle they often only last for a couple of quarters by comparison periods of economic expansion are measured in years patient investors in mastercard are rewarded because the company spends a disproportionately longer amount of time benefiting from economic growth and since its fees are tied to the price of goods and services mastercard makes for a smart inflation play also the mastercard growth story is nowhere near complete many regions of the world are underbanked and or still reliant on cash mastercard can maintain a sustainably strong growth rate by pushing into emerging market economies over time lovesac when you think of unstoppable stocks a small cap furniture company is potentially the furthest thing from your mind but for

in the 1970s amid a wave of new laws created to control the rampant development paving over the sunshine state florida named earl starnes as its first planning director starnes faced a daunting task convince landowners that to save florida and its wetlands springs and natural resources that made it unique the state needed to impose tougher rules on big development it needed to slow the land rush lining their pockets as he toured the state in a series of public hearings to promote this new vision for planned growth starnes encountered a skeptical public that instead viewed the laws as big government that was repeated over and over and over starnes told author and university of florida journalism professor cynthia barnett in a 2000 interview they thought we were communists and sometimes i thought we were too at one heated meeting in an immokalee school cafeteria someone turned off the lights soon after the hearing started he told barnett and when they came back on the shotguns and pistols had appeared on almost every table in the room barnett recounted at the time florida had no requirements to keep sprawling new developments from overwhelming roads water supplies schools or other precious resources no efforts were underway to preserve the state s pristine springs cypress forests wetlands or mangrove fringed coasts the everglades was still considered a flood control issue not a looming environmental disaster and developers like the mackle brothers were peddling mail order paradise through the general development corporation carving cities from tens of thousands of acres on floodplains and swampland the amazing thing is that they did bring statewide planning to florida said barnett who interviewed starnes for what would become her first book there are all of these figures who kind of become forgotten and he was an important one not to forget starnes died in august just before his 95th birthday he d broken his hip in march and been hospitalized at the va said his daughter janet starnes and separated from his wife of 72 years dorothy jean thousand friends of florida earl starnes became florida s first planning director in the 1970s after the state passed a suite of new laws designed to manage growth prevent sprawl and protect wetlands springs and other resources as threats from climate change and over development once again remind florida of its precarious place those who loved and worked with starnes say his vision for urban planning and the rules he tried to put in place are worth remembering i look at all the state parks and all the critical areas and all the natural areas that do exist and will continue to exist and a lot of that happened because of that growth management concept said his daughter janet starnes i think that s really his legacy building a foundation upon which the state can and will survive even when we have these periods where we turn away from environmental protection and we turn away from the consideration of the bigger picture the laws have largely been whittled away over the decades since in 2011 state lawmakers and sen rick scott who was governor at the time rewrote the 1985 growth management act that grew out of the early laws they also disbanded the department of community affairs created to oversee growth they replaced it with the department of economic opportunity the whole idea that somehow the well being of the florida lifestyle is subsumed under economic development just shows a complete switch and how the current government views the way of life in florida said victoria tschinkel the secretary of the department of environmental regulation from 1981 to 1987 in a time of exponential everything it s time florida lives up to the kind of smart growth starnes and his colleagues at the time envisioned she said how many years did we lose on protecting coastal development because climate change somehow became a political buzzword even though it was well established that the oceans were rising she said even if you didn t agree with what was causing it you should have been ready to plan for that and a whole bunch of buildings probably never should have been built outwardly starnes a practicing architect when he was lured to tallahassee came off as a spotlight averse academic he wasn t even terribly comfortable speaking in public barnett said the son of a citrus farmer starnes was born and raised in winter haven and grew up on his father s citrus farm where he built his first boat at 13 and raised chickens he sold to the local piggly wiggly manager the manager george jenkins went on to found publix working with his hands he later said led him to the university of florida s architecture school after graduation he moved to south florida to work first with courtney stewart an early draftsman for addison mizner and the first florida trained architect to open an office in fort lauderdale when he heard about an opening with a rising young modernist alfred browning parker he moved his family to miami he later worked for rufus nims another modernist who was helping howard johnson build his motel empire rufus had designed the replica for howard johnson restaurants starnes told barnett the orange roof he said was johnson s idea as the chain grew that became the stock plans that went all over the country starnes helped design what would become the model for the motel room picture window desk chair beds bathroom courtesy janet starnes starnes an architect who worked with alfred browning parker and rufus nims also built three houses for his family that became a pattern for the industry and it still is the same pattern he told barnett johnson was absolutely convinced that the american public would buy predictability it was a philosophy that influence starnes when he moved into urban planning and politics in 1964 he won a seat on the miami dade county commission after he grew frustrated with the haphazard way the county governed growth and protected its natural treasures including biscayne bay where he took his family fishing nearly every weekend he truly believed if you re not comfortable with something then it s your responsibility to try to do something about that said janet starnes who retired two years ago from the south florida water management district after overseeing everglades restoration projects at the time development in south florida was a matter of lining up votes said audubon florida s charles lee who was 16 and a new member of the mangrove chapter of the izaak walton league when he met starnes it was all political said lee if a developer wanted to build anything no matter how environmentally destructive all they needed to do was to walk into a county commission meeting on any given meeting day and get something approved politician planner and environmental champion starnes began to put the environment first he convinced gov claude pepper to buy cape florida and create bill baggs state park he helped joe browder defeat an everglades jetport which would have carved six runways and a 1000 ft wide highway through the everglades he also worked with a small group of activists to create biscayne national monument the precursor to the national park and block plans to build a causeway connecting the bay s tiny keys when reubin askew was elected governor he lured starnes to tallahassee to serve as the director of the department of transportation and ultimately become part of a team of young scouts recruited to write the suite of new planning laws the laws were designed to control the mega new resort communities retirement villages and poorly planned suburbs stressing out the state under the laws local county governments would need to devise comprehensive growth plans to ensure water supplies roads schools and other services weren t over burdened they would need to designate areas for growth to protect wetlands and other sensitive lands to escape political pressure from developers the scouts gave ultimate veto power to the new department of community affairs to ensure the plans endured there were some very heated times back then because people didn t really accept the idea of the regulation of growth that is now accepted in florida as a real thing said tschinkel it s so obvious that you need to plan i mean everybody plans so i think it was just absurd to think that planning was some kind of a mysterious thing starnes has been called one of the founding fathers of florida growth planning a field he helped broaden when he left politics in 1973 to take over uf s newly created department of urban planning for nearly 20 years he worked to wrestle back control of the post war land boom richard grosso was just starting his career as a public interest attorney for 1000 friends of florida when he met starnes who helped co found the nonprofit with three former governors later when grosso and 1000 friends sued to stop a medical research center from being built on the edge of the everglades and needed an expert witness to go against a sitting governor he turned to starnes to be his expert witness matias ocner miami herald starnes helped get the florida keys designated a protected area with strict growth rules to prevent over building along the string of coral rock islands you had advocates for environmental protection running away from that because it was jeb bush s pet project said grosso so it took guts for people to stand up to that one and earl starnes was one of those people with guts even in retirement after he moved to cedar key starnes continued to serve on the local planning and historic boards said heath davis mayor of the tiny panhandle fishing village often applicants appearing before the boards had no idea who they faced across the dais you d be sitting there in a meeting and you d have some hot hotshot planner that really thought they knew what they were doing davis said starnes would let them get pretty far out there on that limb before he d saw it off when she thinks about his legacy janet starnes said it s the land he helped save that means the most to her she remembers growing up in south miami and spending nearly every weekend fishing in biscayne bay or camping on elliott key it was just an innate kind of thing that we learned along the way she said that great appreciation for what florida was and is and could be if we would just do things carefully copyright 2021 wlrn 91 3 fm to see more visit wlrn 91 3 fm
jennifer pagliara special to nashville tennessean usa today network newsrooms in tennessee you ve heard the saying that bad things come in threes well get ready for the triple whammy that will be the 2021 holiday season you d be hard pressed to find a time when the global supply chain was such a topic of widespread conversation whether it s on social media or network news discussions about shortages are everywhere and they re only intensifying add to that the inescapable impacts of rising inflation and the worsening labor shortage and you have a triple threat that stands to demonstrably impact the holiday season the good news is with a little planning it s possible to lessen the impact these factors can have on your household finances but it requires a thorough and clear eyed examination of three key factors more are traveling while the numbers are still a little lower than they were before the pandemic both international and domestic flight searches are up dramatically over 2020 levels up to 212 higher in some cases according to online travel agency kayak while on the surface that would appear to be a sign of a return to normalcy in reality it s likely a portent of higher prices last minute delays and possible cancellations one key factor is the rising price of oil which recently closed at a seven year high of 80 a barrel that makes it hard for airlines to compensate without passing those higher prices on to consumers many travelers have already noticed stark increases over flight prices from just a few months ago and even if you re able to afford a ticket there s still the chance that a scheduled flight won t take place as planned in a dramatic shift for an industry that struggled with a labor surplus as little as a year ago due to pandemic related travel restrictions the airline industry is struggling with a severe labor shortage in october alone southwest canceled roughly 2 000 flights at an operational cost of 75 million august saw spirit airlines cancel 2 800 flights citing a lack of qualified workers and this was all before the holiday surge that said the airlines are hoping to mitigate the damage somewhat in a recent staff memo american airlines said it expects to gain 4 000 new employees this quarter while also recalling nearly 1 800 flight attendants from long term leave similarly southwest is targeting 5 000 new hires by year end food prices up we ve all experienced the occasional bare shelf at the grocery store lately which is the result of everything from truck driver shortages to supply chain issues and the goods that remain are steadily gaining in price in october the consumer price index for food rose nearly 1 from august to september 2021 and 5 4 from september 2020 that s a problem in a year when people are planning larger holiday gatherings to compensate for last year s smaller celebrations the cost of a whole turkey between 8 and 16 pounds has nearly doubled since 2019 according to a 2021 wells fargo report citing both increased demand and reduced production this drastic increase serves as a microcosm of what shoppers can expect to find at the supermarket as they lay out their holiday food plan and it merits some planning and shopping ahead if you re one of those who puts off getting all your holiday ingredients until a day or two before the meal you may want to rethink your strategy logistical problems getting product to stores will mean many items will run out sooner than expected shop soon if you haven t already ordered your christmas gifts this year you re essentially playing catch up a survey conducted in early october by morning consult found about 50 of u s shoppers got an early start to their 2021 holiday shopping even so many of them are still having trouble finding goods the survey showed that 51 of early shoppers reported that stores were out of at least one item they were looking for and 54 said a product they wanted was out of stock online and 49 are having to wait on back ordered or delayed delivery of an early purchase and mirroring the issue with supermarkets scarcity is only part of the problem u s consumer prices jumped 6 2 in october compared with a year ago as food gas and housing costs surged under the highest inflation rate in 30 years that spike in prices has been fueled in large part by robust consumer demand demand that s been increasingly hard to meet due to pandemic related shutdowns of overseas factories in a desperate bid to keep workers america s employers have also been raising wages and then passing those labor costs on in the form of higher prices and it s not limited to the big chains according to a new survey from business org 82 of small businesses raised their prices as a direct result of rising rate of inflation don t let holiday hiccups force you into bad decisions for all three factors listed above proper planning and effective budgeting are key if flying this holiday season use your airline s app to keep track of your flight status not only can it let you know everything from a gate change to a delay or cancellation it can also help with rescheduling if necessary also try to schedule morning flights if possible delays compound throughout the day so you have a better chance of being accommodated on a same day flight if you were originally scheduled to leave early and while it s not always possible it s always a good idea to have a plan b for example if your destination is drivable have a car at the ready when it comes to both food and gift planning the number one piece of advice for consumers would be to make a budget and stick with it while it might be tempting to lean more heavily on credit cards and debt to compensate for this year s higher prices it s never a good idea to spend more than you can readily afford set a strict spending limit for yourself that allows you cover regular expenses while staying within your means also research prices to get a better idea of where you need to allocate your dollars and finally don t be afraid to cut down on your gift giving list after all everyone s dealing with the same economic realities this year something as simple as some baked goodies or a homemade gift can be enough to remind people you care in tightening economic times sticking close to a budget becomes even more important the holidays are notorious for nudging otherwise responsible spenders into impulse purchases but keeping your eyes on the long term prize and avoiding adding to your debt this holiday season may be the best gift you can give yourself

meters and its tandem warhead can penetrate 550mm of armor that is behind reactive explosive panels armor at the time poland expressed some interest even though poland has been using the israeli spike lr for several years but corsar is cheaper than spike and uses laser guidance rather than the more expensive fire and forget system israeli missiles employ the spike lr along with the sealed storage launch canister weighs 13 kg 28 6 pounds the canister is mounted on a 13 kg fire control system 10 kg without the tripod for aiming and firing the missile in its canister has a shelf life of twenty years and a range of 4 000 meters the spike uses a fiber optic cable so that the operator can literally drive the missile to the target although the missile can also be used in fire and forget mode israel is apparently flexible on what they charge for the spike lr saying only that it s cheaper than the similar javelin ukraine found that the export market was more crowded and competitive than they expected the larger longer ranged and cheaper than spike lr skif may not have been the answer but if it does well in donbas that will be a powerful assist for sales efforts ukraine has a lot of other potential new weapons and has made some progress in finding customers before the cold war ended in 1991 many soviet weapons design and production operations were in ukraine these were inherited by the newly independent ukraine after 1991 but most of these organizations went out of business because there were no more soviet armed forces placing large orders each year most of the foreign sales disappeared as well ukraine salvaged some weapons and design capability by selling off its large cold war stocks of soviet weapons at low prices and developing a willingness to sell to anyone who could pay ukraine now has a lot of customers in africa and asia and noted a growing demand for atgms these weapons are popular not just for their ability to destroy or disable most tanks but as highly portable and accurate artillery against all sorts of targets corsar and skif are old technology but the ukrainians still know how to produce it cheaply and reliably enough to attract some customers yet when skif or corsar fail against russian t 90s equipped with an upgraded arena aps it s time to check out what the foreigners have to offer

a microscopic view of a lab sample containing the omicron variant of covid 19 credit public health image library here we go again at a media briefing monday to discuss the latest covid 19 news following the emergence of the new omicron variant gov kathy hochul was asked directly if she s concerned about covid fatigue as residents have endured nearly two years of pandemic news restrictions and precautions she didn t hesitate in her response i am very concerned about it she said that is the reality we live in especially in areas outside new york city just look at the numbers people have said we re over this as a new wave of cases begins to hit locally during an expected winter spike we can hope that this season won t be nearly as bad as last year before the vaccine was widely available but it seems we must rely on individuals to do the right thing to receive vaccinations and boosters to stay home when feeling sick to wear masks in indoor spaces and to follow the many precautions that have become all too familiar the governor indicated that sweeping orders coming from the state such as universal mask requirements or business closures seem unlikely last week ms hochul declared a state of emergency in response to the omicron variant the mutation that was first detected in south africa on nov 9 and by tuesday had spread to 17 countries including canada gov hochul on thursday announced the first confirmed cases of the recently identified covid 19 omicron variant in new york state including a suffolk county resident with a history of travel to south africa she said the suffolk resident who she later described as a 67 year old woman did not become symptomatic until after returning home from her most recent trip to the country the other four cases were detected in residents of new york city the emergency declaration allows the state health department to limit nonessential hospital care until mid january in facilities with limited capacity a move designed to keep beds open if a wave of new covid cases lands in new york those hospitals are all upstate the governor said there are not yet capacity issues in suffolk county nationally president biden shut down travel to all noncitizens from eight african countries and by week s end those restictions were being expanded since march 2020 covid 19 has done a world of damage on long island in the state nationwide and around the world particularly in places with low vaccination rates in america it has wreaked havoc on the economy destroyed countless businesses big and small disrupted education at all levels and claimed an astonishing 777 000 lives in less than two years there were approximately 750 000 deaths in the american civil war american deaths in world war ii totaled more than 400 000 over four years nearly half of what covid 19 has done in a far shorter time span news of a new variant we don t yet fully understand sent shock waves through financial markets and caused weary hospital staffers to worry if another wave is headed their way experts said not much is yet known about the variant we have asked so much of our medical crews battling this pandemic that another surge which hopefully doesn t happen seems insurmountable america can t seem to free itself from covid 19 the steps needed to bring it under control such as mask or vaccination mandates have been denounced by political groups who say such efforts violate their personal freedoms perhaps one definition of freedom is to not do anything that brings harm to someone else but that is not the debate that has raged in this country since the pandemic erupted many of those who have resisted vaccine mandates and even sought to punish entities like school districts for requiring them now say president biden has failed to bring the pandemic under control certainly that would be one definition of hypocrisy so a new variant has emerged in the southern hemisphere where vaccination rates are very low it s now obvious that covid mutates quickly in places with low rates and will hop around the globe with impunity this presents the picture that no country is safe until the entire world is vaccinated meanwhile here on long island and statewide we watch the news with trepidation to see if covid numbers will continue to climb we can only hope we have turned a corner and there will be no more disruptions in our lives and that this is the last we hear of this beast so we wait meanwhile state officials urge everyone to get vaccinated if you are get the booster and wear masks indoors
he also wrote plays and he painted it was as if the stage could not contain him the screen certainly couldn t sher s acting style was so volatile so expansive so technically adapted for the theatrical space that aside from his well remembered turn as howard kirk the voraciously heterosexual lecturer in malcolm bradbury s the history man 1981 his performances on film are a mere footnote to a towering theatre cv from the first he was always an actor apart and he was often at his most consistently thrilling when he was in the undisputed lead role in perhaps his deepest and quietest performance he brought primo levi to the stage in his own one man play of other real figures he portrayed he was a sexually tortured stanley spencer in pam gems s play stanley and a roaring edmund kean at the old vic he once told me the story of how he ended up as the lead role in i d 2003 the play he wrote for the almeida about the assassination of south africa s first prime minister the director nancy meckler suggested the writer sit mutely in a corner where for the first time in his professional life he would watch which i got to enjoy very much he said sounding surprised even delighted at the memory of ceding the floor to others and i was not going to be in the play we offered this to a shortlist of actors that we wanted to play that part and they couldn t do it i was rather sad the day we decided it s silly i might as well do it he ended up onstage for almost the entire duration of the play sher s last totemic performance for the rsc and the subject of his final book was in king lear in 2016 when he convincingly played a mighty potentate whose mind is horrifically fractured by the onset of dementia it was fascinating to watch him graduate to this crowning role more than 30 years earlier while at university i saw the young daniel day lewis interviewed in front of a roomful of students i don t remember the context in which this came up but i firmly recall him quoting michael gambon s advice to actors when playing lear make sure you aren t upstaged by your fool gambon had recently played lear for the rsc his capering sinuous red nosed fool was sher the sense that he wasn t always collegiate onstage became part of the sher s reputation and it irked him i once interviewed an actress who was appearing alongside him in a new play at the national he s probably quite a competitive actor she mused perhaps a little naively when this thought bubble got published there was all hell to pay in the rehearsal room i interviewed sher three times across a decade and found him a fascinating mix of diffident and forthcoming anointed a star when he played richard iii on crutches in the manner of a bottled arachnid spitting venom and rage he was first known for pyrotechnics which shielded deeper energies but these were unveiled as across the years he peeled away the layers of his identity in search of truth and authenticity antony sher was born in cape town in 1949 he was of lithuanian jewish stock from a family with not an artistic cell in its dna he first knew he was homosexual at four the same age he started painting in the shadow of table mountain those two preferences practically amounted to the same thing he later expressed a hint of envy at his birthplace s mutation into what he called the san francisco of africa it s so gay it s unbelievable he was a reticent child and was sent to elocution class nobody dared call it acting class to draw me out of myself i was so withdrawn everyone was starting to get worried that they had this peculiar person on their hands by the time he was 18 his parents were researching drama courses in london they found that central school was the top school at the time and naively they found digs for me at swiss cottage before we left and then we did the audition and it was all over in 10 minutes they had different grades of letters mine was the worst you could get because it said absolutely find another profession and then the problems began my parents found me somewhere else but then they had to go back and i wasn t in a drama school at the time and then it all became quite scary london is quite a frightening place if you don t know anybody i was very alone i went to the theatre a lot after six months he got into webber douglas then went on to manchester to do a postgraduate course where he made the curious decision to marry never mind about coming out publicly the very first stage is coming out to yourself and that was something i like most people i guess struggled with a lot and kept telling myself this is just a phase it doesn t take much expertise in cod psychology to see why sher has played so many outsiders starting you could argue with his west end debut as ringo in willy russell s play about the beatles my first false nose in adulthood it took him as much effort to own up to his nationality he purgatorily destroyed up his old south african passport as his sexuality his first act on entering drama school was to suppress his accent resulting in a faint nasal blockage that hinted at something underneath fighting to get out and he encouraged an obsession with losing himself inside his own virtuosity he had an extraordinarily malleable appearance the only constants were his height smallish and teeth babyish but he had no trouble looking young old tubby thin ordinary insane it felt like a form of madness the terrible feeling that would build up in the afternoon as the evening performance came nearer i began by just being very interested in disguise on stage that was a very important thing that i was kind of hidden i discovered i could be other people in a sense he was going about his father s business his father exported hides later he explained he grew more interested in what s inside these people i think it started happened with things that were personally very important to me with torch song trilogy merchant of venice you know richard iii is not personally important to me i always felt like a better actor when the roles related to me personally he told me another time because there was a personal investment but i m completely drawn to power mad and so called evil people i ve been to some dark places so i m fascinated by the darkness in people he was one of many actor knights called upon to play hitler in churchill the hollywood years sher was one of the first thespian grandees to come out he did so in 1989 at the same time as characters a book of his portraits and sketches that was the point where it was absurd to not be out because there were so many pictures in the book of jim the guy i lived with at the time people said if you come out publicly you don t get to go to hollywood and you say well then you don t it had been so uncomfortable beforehand you d have come to interview me for torch song trilogy and would have been told he doesn t talk about his private life he actually came out as he liked to put it as a gay jewish white south african later he owned up to suffering from cocaine addiction for the best part of 20 years before he decided to clean up for good as he explained in his memoir beside myself 2001 at his first meeting none of his fellow addicts had heard of him the books reviewers smacked their heads at the obviousness of it all and chorused aaah so that s why he was always such a jittery hyperactive performer completely inaccurate said sher i didn t use it much onstage i did one or two good paintings on coke because it made me very free it definitely didn t make me a good actor because it separates you from your feelings and creates a paranoid feeling in you you wondered whether people were noticing that you were now and then licking your gums if this was not such a surprise his later confession to suffering from stage fright was it felt like a form of madness he says the terrible feeling that would build up in the afternoon as the evening performance came nearer i d be on stage saying the lines and there d be another voice in my head saying any moment now you re going to f up there d be a second voice telling me to shut up for a time while playing iago for the rsc he thought of giving up acting altogether the eventual cure was to write and perform in a one man show in which he played not just any man but primo levi in an adaptation of if this is a man it took him and the national theatre two years to persuade the levi family to break their strict embargo on adapting the author s account of his experiences in auschwitz with permission finally secured he conceded that it was good to have that material because if i ever got frightened i could just say my fear is so unimportant compared to his fear of living in this nightmarish place it was one of those roles he found so vast and taxing that it spawned a book the most autobiographical of these was woza shakespeare 1996 the diary he kept with gregory doran about mounting titus andronicus in south africa then bringing it to england edited by andrew motion and with a cover illustration by sher it has a page turning inter continental plot but what made it stand out from the genre is the book s domestic intimacy doran and sher had lived together for 10 years by then but this was the first of their many professional collaborations director and star got along just fine but they hadn t worked out how to leave the job at the office one hilarious flying crockery scene narrated by doran segues into sher s account of contritely combing the lawn for shards of china if sher was disappointed by the lack of major screen roles he hid it well in shadey 1985 he played a man who performs a sex change operation on himself there was a small flurry in the second half of the 1990s in mrs brown 1997 he caught the eye as disraeli and the following year as dr moth in shakespeare in love he was a hammy sergeant cuff wilkie collins s prototype detective in a tv adaptation of the moonstone his bravest screen performance was in alive and kicking 1996 also known as indian summer a barely remembered film scripted by martin sherman about an aids counsellor who has an affair with a ballet dancer diagnosed as hiv positive it contained the frankest depiction of homosexual love making yet filmed with such an established actor opposite jason flemyng sher played the scene naked with his knees behind his ears it was incredibly brave of me he said i find that kind of stuff very difficult it s going beyond the normal call of actorly duty we were both very relieved when the day was over there was the odd award for these performances but he found attending awards ceremonies difficult in 1997 he was happy to be out of town when he won an olivier for stanley and again when he was nominated for a tony he also won an olivier jointly for richard iii and torch song trilogy in 1985 that there weren t more screen leads actually ceased to be an issue for me he said years later people have an idea that films are what everyone wants to do maybe i did think that as well a few years ago my agent said if you really want to do it you are going to have to stop doing these big theatre contracts let s take some time out read scripts go up for things and i ve never read so much rubbish in all my life i went up for some things it just doesn t work for me because what i can do as an actor i can t bring into a room to meet someone this is what a film director would be meeting and you d think he s not very interesting and i don t get the part but american film actors they are what you meet that s what they do and that s not me instead he committed to a lifelong exploration of the great writers and the great roles too numerous to list they included shylock cyrano falstaff pictured above with alex hassell arturo ui leontes tamburlaine macbeth and prospero in work by contemporary playwrights he shone in among others tom stoppard s travesties peter flannery s singer peter barnes s red noses arthur miller s death of a salesman and broken glass climactically in 2019 he and his compatriot the actor playwright john kani appeared in kani s two hander kunene and the king ostensibly about a black carer and his white terminal patient it also told of their shared history as south africans growing up under apartheid when sher was playing edmund kean in 2007 in a play adapted from alexandre dumas by jean paul sartre about what it takes to be a very great actor he came across one speech in particular delivered to an aspiring actress which puts in a nutshell everything he had been wanting to say about this strange and unique profession to which he had devoted his life you act to lie to lie to yourself to be what you cannot be and because you are disgusted with what you are you act so as not to know yourself and because you know yourself too well you act because you d go mad if you didn t it s hard to believe that someone who isn t an actor could have written that he said all those levels of self loathing and vanity and self display antony sher 14 june 1949 2 december 2021
