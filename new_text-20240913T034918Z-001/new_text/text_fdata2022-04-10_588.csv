photo mecum auctions photo mecum auctions photo mecum auctions photo mecum auctions photo mecum auctions photo mecum auctions born as a full size car in 1960 the dart became a midsize vehicle in 1962 before it was downsized again to a compact in 1963 while the short lived midsize version left a mark on the performance market thanks to the 413 cubic inch 6 8 liter wedge v8 good for 415 horsepower the compact that replaced it didn t have much to brag about at first in its four years on the market the third gen dart was offered with only one v8 in the form of a 273 cubic inch 4 5 liter unit initially rated at 180 horsepower it was upgraded to 235 horses in 1965 quite decent for a mid 1960s compact but far from what high performance intermediates were capable of at the time that changed when the fourth and final generation dart arrived in 1967 with the muscle car wars in full swing dodge gave the dart a sportier appearance and a full blown coupe version it also gradually added the bigger v8 engines available in the larger charger coronet and polara by 1970 the dart had arrived in dealerships not only with the 340 cubic inch 5 2 liter la and the 383 cubic inch 6 3 liter rb but also with the mighty 440 cubic inch 7 2 liter v8 which was good for 375 horsepower the 440 equipped dart was a big deal in terms of power to weight ratio while it was just as powerful as its midsize counterpart the dodge charger it was almost 400 pounds 181 kg lighter but before the dart became available with the 440 dodge made a surprising move and dropped the mighty 426 cubic inch 7 0 liter hemi v8 in the compact it all happened in february 1968 when dodge dealerships across the u s received promotional materials containing chrysler s intention to sell factory built dart dragsters equipped with the company s most powerful v8 it was assigned production code lo23 and it was built to meet class b super stock racing specifications yup it came with a no warranty disclaimer but while dodge s regular production hemi cars were put together at the company s plant the hemi darts had to go to hurst performance in madison heights michigan for the finishing touches in reality hurst did a lot more than that because the darts reached the company s conversion facility as partially assembled chassis in theory the hemi dart was based on the gts hardtop but it went through radical modifications to become an lo23 while the dart was already lighter than the charger and the coronet dodge took the opportunity and shaved even more pounds off the compact the regular steel fenders and hood were replaced with fiberglass panels while the acid dipped doors featured thinner glass and lacked window mechanisms they were strap operated like most factory built dragsters from the era the hemi dart was devoid of a rear bench but the regular front seats were also replaced with simpler and lighter units sourced from the dodge a100 van because no one needs lateral support while racing in a straight line of course dodge also removed all equipment deemed unnecessary at the drag strip the list included the center console heater sound deadening material side mirrors radio carpeting and armrests period literature says the hemi dart tipped the scales at around 3 000 pounds 1 361 kg around 500 pounds 227 kg lighter than a 440 equipped gts on top of that the hemi dart looked downright menacing thanks to the massive and impressively wide scoop on the hood it also featured four pins for full lift off removal because drag racing involves a lot of under the hood meddling at the strip finally hurst made modifications to the rear fenders to accommodate bigger rear wheels wrapped in slick tires power came from the 426 hemi v8 that chrysler had been using to terrorize the competition at the drag strip and on public roads since 1964 breathing was courtesy of 2x4 barrel holley carburetors a cross ram aluminum intake manifold and a compression ratio of 10 25 1 the race bred powerplant was advertised to deliver 425 horsepower and up to 490 pound feet 664 nm of torque granted it wasn t more powerful than the hemi offered in the charger or the coronet but these numbers were massive in the dart s lightweight setup but that was on paper as some claim it came with more than 500 horsepower on tap dodge offered both four speed manual and three speed transmissions for the hemi dart the manual gearboxes had their synchronizers removed to lower the chances of missing shifts and were paired to dana heavy duty rear axles with 4 88 gear ratios the automatic which was chrysler s then new 727 torqueflite came with 4 86 rear gears and a high speed torque converter the heavy duty rear shocks and radiator the high capacity oil pump solid lifter cam and the roller timing chain also helped the hemi dart score impressive runs over the quarter mile dodge claimed that the compact would cover the distance in less than 11 seconds at 130 mph 209 kph notably quicker than a hemi powered charger minor tweaks enabled racers to score low 10 second passes while drivers like dick landy managed to achieve nine second runs the hemi dart became the car to beat in no time and dominated class b super stock racing for years to come even when dodge rolled out a super stock version of the challenger in 1970 make no mistake though these cars were designed to meet street legal requirements however due to their extensive modifications and aggressive setups the hemi darts came with disclaimers that they were not for street use like most factory built dragsters the lo23 hemi option disappeared from dealer sheets as suddenly as it appeared the bundle was nowhere to be found by 1969 so the hemi dart remained a one year offering with only 80 cars built in 1968 the hemi dart is the rarest iteration of the compact and a hard to find classic nowadays a somewhat affordable racer back in the day the 1968 hemi dart is now an expensive collectible they rarely show up at auction and when they do they either fetch big bucks or remain with their respective owners due to high reserves a quick look at hemi dart auctions in recent years reveals that most of them failed to sell for prices between 170 000 to 200 000 however a low mileage example in excellent condition went under the hammer for a whopping 302 500 at a mecum auctions sale in january 2022 far from cheap but more affordable than more mundane mopars with hemi engines

harassment and to give users more control over how they share their opinions it added features that let users limit who could reply to their tweets created labels for misleading content and banned

on hateful speech and urging people who are harassed to have thicker skins pao then criticized twitter s decision to appoint musk to the company s board and called for government regulation of social media platforms to prevent rich people from controlling the media for starters we need consistent definitions of harassment and of content that violates personal privacy pao said of the prospective federal intervention plan most companies i suspect would welcome such regulations if platforms continue to push for growth at all costs without such regulations people will continue to be harmed the people harmed will disproportionately be those who have been harmed for centuries women and members of marginalized racial and ethnic groups the people who benefit from unrestricted amplification of their views will also be the same people who have benefited from that privilege for centuries following the piece s publishing friday morning many including musk were quick to question the credibility of pao s remark given the post s own ties to billionaire bezos why is it funny because jeff bezos owns the washington post one user wrote not sure why they would be worried by elonmusk buying a bit of

so what was the world s best performing currency of the past month you guessed it the russian ruble after plunging to 139 rubles to the dollar on march 7 the ruble staged a dramatic comeback to around 80 rubles to the dollar that s only slightly weaker than where it was for almost all of last year the recovery is equally impressive when compared with the euro at the end of february it took 89 rubles to buy a euro in early march that climbed to around 145 rubles now it is down to 87 32 on friday the joke among foreign exchange traders was that the russian central bank was going to have to cut interest rates to keep the ruble from getting too strong and making its exports too expensive that s unlikely but the point is important the sanctions on russia were intended to cripple its currency on the global market in order to weaken vladimir putin s economy the recovery indicates that the sanctions even as they have been strengthened both by official measures and private companies renouncing business ties with russia are not working as advertised the biggest reason for this of course is natural gas russia began to demand recently that europe pay for natural gas in rubles instead of euros so far only hungary has announced its intent to comply with this but it s far from clear that the rest of europe will be able to hold out that would create a demand for rubles especially from places where most of the saving is in euros so the euro will fall against the ruble since markets are anticipation engines that has already begun in advance of european capitulation on the currency issue why does russia want to be paid in rubles the answer to that is complex in the first place the sanctions and private sector actions have cut russia off from access to many of the things it could use euros or dollars for western countries froze russia s foreign reserve holdings we cut off russia s access to imports from much of the world going even further we made it incredibly difficult to obtain financing to make payments for russian energy in other words we squeezed russia s demand for euros and dollars by cutting off uses for dollars and squeezing the supply russia had little choice but to move to demand payment in its domestic currency russia is likely to demand ruble payments not only for natural gas sent to europe but also for oil and food commodities such as wheat and corn this will increase global demand for the ruble in fact it will strengthen both the hands of russian financial institutions and ultimately putin s government those buying commodities in rubles will have to turn to russian banks for financing as russian bank loans are the source of rubles and will seek to export more to russia to obtain rubles this will create an alternative to the eurodollar system for countries that either must be or decide to be closer to russia and away from what we re calling the west again that is likely to ultimately lead to strengthening demand for russian government bonds from russian banks and exporting countries china in particular may find this especially helpful it could even decide it wants to foster a ruble backed alternative global currency system as part of a long term strategy to supplant the united states certainly china might decide to hold russian bonds to diversify away from its u s treasury holdings this will not just be about financial flows this will change real flows of goods and commodities shifting natural gas and oil flows from west to east from europe to china will create competition for ships and likely drive up the price of shipping globally europe will be more reliant on oil from saudi arabia the u s has almost no mechanism to ship oil to our east coast ports for export to europe which will mean shipping through the suez canal as credit suisse s zoltan poszar recently pointed out the world is likely facing a severe shortage of vessels capable of moving oil cargo on long distances as a choke point egypt could raise canal fees or even demand to be paid in rubles so that it can buy russian wheat what we have described here is the destruction of globalization and the fragmentation of the global economy into competitive but somewhat isolated trading groups this will likely be uncomfortable for those who benefitted the most from the system that had been in place particularly western financial elites and corporations who became dependent on chinese manufacturing if china refocuses on either exports to russia or its internal market its demand for dollars and supply of goods to the u s will weaken jobs will have to be re shored domestic factory production restarted and domestic investment grown so this could turn out to be a great time for american workers much of this has been brewing beneath the surface of world events for some time the russian invasion of ukraine may turn out to be the catalyst that gets the engines of change running at higher gear

ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky reportedly said i need ammunition not a ride to this past week when foreign minister dmytro kuleba told nato leaders in brussels that he had a threefold agenda weapons weapons weapons but in the united states and europe the discussions over what types of weapons to send is far different than it was just six weeks ago this is a pivotal moment of the war and as the battlefield shifts the sorts of weapons ukrainian forces need are changing too there is no longer a fear that the ukrainian capital kyiv could fall within days russian forces are repositioning for a fight over eastern ukraine what many predict will be full scale confrontation on flat open rural terrain between infantry armor and artillery in the kind of engagements not seen in generations this next phase could be protracted measured in months or longer national security adviser jake sullivan warned at a white house briefing it could look like something from world war ii with two large armies facing off kuleba told nato foreign ministers on thursday to win such a war we need different help than what we have been receiving before said ukraine s defense minister oleksii reznikov in a video appeal released thursday we want to liberate the enemy occupied territories as soon as possible to do this we need other weapons in the early days of fighting nato countries worried that the weaponry they gave to ukraine might be quickly captured by superior russian forces or that ukrainian troops did not have the time to train to use new equipment effectively or that sending offensive weapons would escalate the conflict and enrage russian president vladimir putin who was rattling his nuclear sword weapons are easier to give than take back but as the war has gone on those concerns have begun to recede now some nato countries are preparing to supply ukraine with more lethal sophisticated long range and heavily armored weapons the question is whether those will come as fast as ukrainian officials want to stop russia s advance and push out russian troops ___ during the six weeks of the war western governments supplied ukraine with billions of dollars worth of weapons including thousands of easy to use shoulder fired missile systems which proved especially deadly in the hands of small ukrainian commando groups in slowing stopping and then reversing the russian assault on kyiv these shoot and scoot launchers were decisive according to military analysts we know that military assistance is having a critical impact on this conflict sullivan said monday highlighting the u s produced shoulder fired antiaircraft stingers and antitank javelins that have been shipped to ukraine now as the war pivots to the east the numbers and types of weapons supplied by the united states and europe will again prove critical for ukraine its forces need to quickly rebuild to replace equipment lost in six weeks of fighting and to supply the reserve units that the ukraine military is now trying to put into the field they also need to prepare for a new sort of war with the ultimate aim not of not only defending cities but turning out russian forces so antitank missiles alone are not going to cut it said michael kofman research program director in the russia studies program at the cna think tank based in washington kofman estimated that ukraine needed hundreds of armored combat vehicles including tanks and a tremendous amount of ammunition reznikov ticked off a longer list air defense systems and combat aircraft to protect citizens and ukrainian troops from missiles and airstrikes long range artillery to keep russian forces at a distance tanks and armored vehicles to break through russian defenses and liberate the occupied territories and anti ship missiles to beat back the russian naval siege and unblock ports on the black sea western governments have been reluctant to send such heavy weaponry but the czech republic has become the first nato country to contribute tanks a senior czech official confirmed to the washington post on saturday speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a transfer that hasn t been announced officially hopefully that will start a race to who can supply more said william alberque director of strategy technology and arms control at the international institute for strategic studies it s hard to be the first one to send tanks but when someone breaks the ice it s much easier said margiris abukevicius a lithuanian vice minister of defense who was in washington this week to discuss military cooperation with the united states ___ in the opening weeks of the war ukraine s backers were mostly focused on providing weapons that ukrainian forces already knew how to use or that could be deployed with minimal training a soldier could learn how to fire a javelin for instance by watching a short video and formerly communist countries in central and eastern europe could share their stockpiles of soviet and russian made equipment that integrate easily with ukraine s existing stock but european defense officials told the washington post that their thinking about the number and types of weapons they are willing to send has evolved as ukrainian forces have shown the ability to fight and have bought themselves time to train on more complicated western made equipment at the outset we were supplying weapons only if we knew the ukrainians were able to operate them from the first moment now we are seeing more advanced weapons and a willingness to invest some time to help them use it said abukevicius the lithuanian vice minister of defense at nato meetings in brussels this past week the focus was on getting ukrainian forces more advanced weapons systems as quickly as possible countries indicated they are willing to go further because we recognize that this is a new offensive that the russian forces are more concentrated and that more advanced weapons will be required according to a western official at the nato sessions british defense secretary ben wallace said friday his country will be providing ukraine with heavily armored troop carriers called mastiffs and that british troops will help train the ukrainians in its operation in a neighboring countries the latest package from the united states sullivan said includes laser guided rocket systems puma drones and armored high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles more arms shipments from the united states are coming soon sullivan said promising that the types of advanced weapons headed to ukraine will be extraordinary and unprecedented though he declined to offer specifics for tanks and air defense the focus remains on older systems ukrainian members of the azov battalion practice shooting live bullets at a training site in kyiv ukraine on march 24 2022 heidi levine for the washington post central europe holds warehouses of old soviet and post soviet tanks the t 72s and even earlier t 64s and alberque said ukrainian forces know how to drive and to fix those tanks in some cases the white house has agreed to send new equipment to central european countries if those countries hand down their old equipment to ukraine so a steady stream of their defense officials has passed through washington in recent weeks seeking assurances that the united states would backfill them with more modern equipment in short order president joe biden said in a statement friday that the united states would reposition a patriot missile system to slovakia after that country sent an s 300 air defense system to ukraine ___ the debate about weaponry has evolved along with the conflict although there remain divisions about the risks of nato involving itself too deeply in the fight the ukrainians say it no longer makes sense for western governments to debate whether arms sent to ukraine are defensive or offensive or might somehow escalate the war which has seen dense urban centers indiscriminately shelled by russia alongside charges that russian forces have committed war crimes by purposefully targeting civilians at the nato meeting in brussels this past week the distinction between offensive and defensive weapons did appear to be falling away this is about defending ukrainian territory therefore they need all the types of equipment that we are able to supply a nato official told the post speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss defense decisions i have urged allies to provide further support of many different types of systems both the light weapons but also heavier weapons nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said but there is still wariness among western allies russia has warned it will treat arms shipments to ukraine from nato countries as legitimate targets for military action potentially setting up more direct confrontations between russia and nato at the same time supplying ukraine with long range artillery for example includes the risk of the conflict spilling over borders germany which was chided for offering to send 5 000 protective helmets in january has embraced the need for lethal aid but has been reluctant to see larger more offensive weapons sent to ukraine nato countries too have so far agreed they will not send warplanes to the ukrainian air force but backers of arming ukraine more vigorously say that if kyiv doesn t win now the next battle will be with nato anyway in the beginning we were supplying weapons to sustain their fight now we are supplying weapons to advance and win abukevicius said ___ ben hodges who served as commander of u s army europe during the obama and trump administrations said there is a narrow window to arm ukrainian forces as the war enters a new phase the next three weeks are critical he said and will determine if ukraine can break the back of the russian forces or if this goes for months maybe years ukraine has expressed frustration with the speed of weapons delivery reznikov warned this past week procrastination with the provision of weapons leads to the death of our children to the depletion of our country ___ booth reported from london rauhala from brussels and birnbaum from washington david stern in mukachevo ukraine contributed to this report

two things happened on thursday that forced me to write on this topic first i bought a copy of time magazine featuring 100 most influential companies i will explain why for 20 years i have been challenging my wife to come up with an idea that would make us billionaires i regret to report at this point that she has not delivered i admit that my own ideas are a bit silly i once suggested we could invent a face mask fitted with a microphone so people could talk without pulling down the covering that would also help reduce the spread of covid the missus and my daughter laughed so hard that i felt like a comedian so buying the magazine was to help me get better billionaire ideas second later in the day forbes released its world s billionaires list for 2022 again i began to study the list to get inspired i discovered that the world s richest people are concentrated in technology finance and manufacturing there is also a long list of billionaires in fashion retail healthcare food beverage real estate energy and media entertainment the us has always dominated forbes top 10 this year there are nine american entrepreneurs within that bracket in 2021 there were eight americans same as in 2020 how does the us produce the highest number of billionaires why are the chinese in their hot pursuit is there any idea nigerians can steal from them on the latest forbes list alhaji aliko dangote president of dangote group maintained his status as africa s richest man with an estimated worth of 14 billion in his cement and sugar businesses dr mike adenuga jnr recorded a significant rise in his fortune and is now ranked africa s second richest man and no 345 globally he leapt over alhaji abdulsamad rabiu chairman of bua group who has dropped to africa s no 3 and no 350 globally with his cement and sugar wealth both dangote and rabiu are from kano a city historically reputed more for trade than manufacturing dangote and rabiu actually started out as traders so you could say they were both cut from the same cloth forbes measured the wealth of adenuga chairman of globacom and conoil based on only his telecoms and oil businesses he is apparently worth far more than the 7 3 billion attributed to him some of his companies are not publicly quoted and forbes uses stock market value and exchange rate even at that his wealth has grown from 6 1 billion in 2021 to 7 3 billion in 2022 he was africa s no 3 in 2020 dropped to no 5 in 2021 and is now no 2 this is a big leap for a mogul whose business affairs are well talked about but which only a few have insight nigerians know him more as the man who revolutionised the telecoms sector by introducing per second billing in 2003 advertisement while the families of dangote 65 and rabiu 61 were big on trade adenuga s father was a school teacher the kano duo were importing rice and sugar in their teething days while adenuga 68 started out by selling lace materials and distributing soft drinks he drove taxis to fund his studies at the northwestern oklahoma state university and pace university both in the us where he earned degrees in business administration but the millions he made from selling lace and soft drinks definitely paled into insignificance when his company consolidated oil struck oil in commercial quantity in the shallow waters of ondo state in 1991 it was a first for a wholly nigerian company however this article is not about dangote or adenuga i ve written quite a lot about their stories and adventures in the last 19 years rather i am interested in how we can write a new story about nigeria and produce more adenugas and dangotes the us has the world s largest economy and this has translated into prosperity not just for the entrepreneurs but also for the average american china whose incredible blend of communism and capitalism has produced state capitalism an oxymoron since capitalism is supposed to be private now has more billionaires per one million people compared to the us and the prosperity is well shared across its 1 4 billion citizens in nigeria we continue to brag about being africa s most populous country but what productive advantage does this bestow on us with 200 million citizens most of whom are ravaged by poverty and disease what are really the big benefits of being the most populous having a high population with low quality of life as defined by access to water sanitation power education and healthcare as well as gender equity is to my mind the principal reason we are hemmed in by terrorism kidnapping yahoo yahoo scams and money rituals instead of producing billionaires we are rolling out bandits and beggars so what s all the noise about being africa s most populous country advertisement having the continent s biggest economy should translate to dominating the african markets with made in nigeria products if we are strategic in our thinking chinese products are not all over the world out of accident or for the fun of it human beings sat down and came up with a policy to make the chinese economy export led and they implemented the plans with utmost commitment and a sense of patriotism that would overshadow the selfishness and shallowness that are always at work in nigeria government policies in nigeria are mostly selfishly conceived and not meant to last the distance even the well conceived ones would get frustrated by those who should make them work the purpose of this article is quite simple to discuss how nigeria can unchain its potential entrepreneurs multi millionaires and billionaires we need leaders who are able to understand that there is a link between governance and prosperity they must understand that shared prosperity can become the fodders for the much needed national peace and progress government or should i say policy makers should stop thinking that poverty eradication or job creation is something to be done by a minister a commissioner a special adviser a director or an agency politicians must know that distributing keke napep and wheelbarrows will not address the fundamental issues of poverty it is an obvious fact that most jobs are created not by politicians but by businesses big medium and small dangote adenuga and rabiu employ tens of thousands one branch of a bank employs dozens and there are thousands of branches nationwide imagine the millions of jobs in smes which form the engine of the economy if our politicians and policy makers can overcome their poor concepts of poverty eradication and job creation they will finally see that their primary role is to make the economic environment fertile and conducive to investment and to unleash the entrepreneurial potential of nigerians that is how to create jobs and tackle poverty and disease if the poor mindset can be dissolved the solutions to our problems are in plain sight i will list three fundamentals they are by no means exhaustive one let s become a country where the rule of law means something where the legal system is not a joke where there is respect for the sanctity of contracts and where government agencies do not behave like village tyrants and sadists any country where the rules mean nothing where the government can just wake up and do anything it likes and where individuals can easily procure dubious orders from court will only succeed in stifling entrepreneurship investment and innovation i don t think i need to overemphasise this fact advertisement two countries where entrepreneurship flourishes and where wealth is created and shared have something in common policy consistency entrepreneurs want to be sure of what they are signing up for you cannot pump billions into a business only to be told midway that the rules have changed many people in government cannot be bothered about the consequences of their actions and pronouncements it would appear they are more interested in milking businesses harassing entrepreneurs and investors and making life hell for them in the name of raising revenue it is all a result of selfishness and a poor understanding of the link between policy and prosperity a critical very critical factor in policy consistency is the macro economic environment the management of exchange rate inflation and all if indeed we are to inspire confidence in the economy i assume that a government would understand what it takes to stimulate the necessary investments that would unleash growth such a government should not need much persuasion on the monetary policy actions that have to be taken my biggest fear is adopting painful macroeconomic measures on the one hand and negating it with a horrible policy environment and a disregard for the sanctity of contract and the rule of law on the other we will just suffer for nothing three government must continue to invest in productive capacities particularly public infrastructure i stumbled on a social media debate the other day over if government should focus on infrastructure or job creation as if they are mutually exclusive building infrastructure is job creation thousands are engaged in the construction however with good policies and a conducive environment government will not be the only one building infrastructure much less taking loans to do it investors would complement government under ppp but no sane investors will try that in nigeria where the next government or even same government can dishonour a contract although i started this article by poking fun at my own business ideas and billionaire dreams the indisputable truth is that nigerians are exceptionally enterprising in spite of the absence of the necessary ingredients to flourish i bear nigerians witness that they toil through the chaos to create opportunities in some instances government is the biggest obstacle to entrepreneurship you can imagine how far nigerians can go if the basics are there we would be to africa what china is to the world nigerian products and services would be flooding the whole of africa you can imagine how many potential multi millionaires and billionaires have been caged by nigeria and may never bloom do you want to be a billionaire why not when i look at the number of billionaire entrepreneurs on the forbes list i ask myself why are some countries more conducive to actualising potential what do they have that we do not have can we learn from them on how to harness human material and natural resources and banish poverty and insecurity as we prepare to elect a new government these are the questions we should be raising and discussing with passion but we appear to be more interested in the dramas a group has bought nomination form for somebody some clowns are begging someone to run otherwise they will sue him or her to court we need to buy some sense and four other things cadillac arrest advertisement governor bello matawalle of poverty infested zamfara state has dished out 260 cars to traditional rulers across the state he gave the cadillac 2019 model to 17 emirs 13 senior district heads and 230 district heads in recognition of the traditional institution as the custodians of religion and culture and vehicle of cohesion and peace i don t know what amuses me more the senseless use of resources and misplacement of priority at a time of economic crunch or the deadened consciences of the custodians of religion and culture sadly the car gift bazaar to traditional rulers is commonplace across nigeria it is driving the people crazy the cup will be full someday inevitable this nin thing over 75 million phones were barred from making calls on wednesday as the government began enforcing its policy of linking the national id number nin to mobile lines the measure is for security reasons to be able to track down criminals obviously criminals are not out of options what kidnappers normally do is use the phones of their captives to call family members and associates to demand ransom terrorists meanwhile use satellite phones according to reports one thing for sure this nin thing will hurt the telecoms sector which has been the saving grace for the economy in recent years how can we make getting and integrating nin more seamless critical why kaduna pastor ea adeboye the general overseer of the redeemed christian church of god rccg was clearly in pains last week he spoke extensively on the state of the nation notably oil theft debt servicing and the 2023 polls he hardly talks like that but he said something that got me worried why always kaduna he asked that question is loaded some attribute the terrorist attacks to the fact that kaduna has a substantial christian population in truth it is not always kaduna predominantly muslim niger sokoto katsina and zamfara states have been under attack as well this is well reported but whoever is spinning the religious narrative is not doing badly selective in memoriam it was exactly seven years yesterday that my friend brother and mentor oronto natei douglas ond drew his last breath after a prolonged but brave battle with stomach cancer up till the point of death he was still taking walks around his residential area and using the rest room unaided before he answered the final call of his maker he was still calling me on the phone to find out how i was doing knowing full well that in a couple of days he would be gone forever memories of my last encounters with him torment me till this day oronto lived such a meaningful and impactful life that though he is gone he will never be forgotten he was a genuine human being fulfilled

simonkolawole by simon kolawole two things happened on thursday that forced me to write on this topic first i bought a copy of time magazine featuring 100 most influential companies i will explain why for 20 years i have been challenging my wife to come up with an idea that would make us billionaires i regret to report at this point that she has not delivered i admit that my own ideas are a bit silly i once suggested we could invent a face mask fitted with a microphone so people could talk without pulling down the covering that would also help reduce the spread of covid the missus and my daughter laughed so hard that i felt like a comedian so buying the magazine was to help me get better billionaire ideas second later in the day forbes released its world s billionaires list for 2022 again i began to study the list to get inspired i discovered that the world s richest people are concentrated in technology finance and manufacturing there is also a long list of billionaires in fashion retail healthcare food beverage real estate energy and media entertainment the us has always dominated forbes top 10 this year there are nine american entrepreneurs within that bracket in 2021 there were eight americans same as in 2020 how does the us produce the highest number of billionaires why are the chinese in their hot pursuit is there any idea nigerians can steal from them on the latest forbes list alhaji aliko dangote president of dangote group maintained his status as africa s richest man with an estimated worth of 14 billion in his cement and sugar businesses dr mike adenuga jnr recorded a significant rise in his fortune and is now ranked africa s second richest man and no 345 globally he leapt over alhaji abdulsamad rabiu chairman of bua group who has dropped to africa s no 3 and no 350 globally with his cement and sugar wealth both dangote and rabiu are from kano a city historically reputed more for trade than manufacturing dangote and rabiu actually started out as traders so you could say they were both cut from the same cloth forbes measured the wealth of adenuga chairman of globacom and conoil based on only his telecoms and oil businesses he is apparently worth far more than the 7 3 billion attributed to him some of his companies are not publicly quoted and forbes uses stock market value and exchange rate even at that his wealth has grown from 6 1 billion in 2021 to 7 3 billion in 2022 he was africa s no 3 in 2020 dropped to no 5 in 2021 and is now no 2 this is a big leap for a mogul whose business affairs are well talked about but which only a few have insight nigerians know him more as the man who revolutionised the telecoms sector by introducing per second billing in 2003 while the families of dangote 65 and rabiu 61 were big on trade adenuga s father was a school teacher the kano duo were importing rice and sugar in their teething days while adenuga 68 started out by selling lace materials and distributing soft drinks he drove taxis to fund his studies at the northwestern oklahoma state university and pace university both in the us where he earned degrees in business administration but the millions he made from selling lace and soft drinks definitely paled into insignificance when his company consolidated oil struck oil in commercial quantity in the shallow waters of ondo state in 1991 it was a first for a wholly nigerian company however this article is not about dangote or adenuga i ve written quite a lot about their stories and adventures in the last 19 years rather i am interested in how we can write a new story about nigeria and produce more adenugas and dangotes the us has the world s largest economy and this has translated into prosperity not just for the entrepreneurs but also for the average american china whose incredible blend of communism and capitalism has produced state capitalism an oxymoron since capitalism is supposed to be private now has more billionaires per one million people compared to the us and the prosperity is well shared across its 1 4 billion citizens in nigeria we continue to brag about being africa s most populous country but what productive advantage does this bestow on us with 200 million citizens most of whom are ravaged by poverty and disease what are really the big benefits of being the most populous having a high population with low quality of life as defined by access to water sanitation power education and healthcare as well as gender equity is to my mind the principal reason we are hemmed in by terrorism kidnapping yahoo yahoo scams and money rituals instead of producing billionaires we are rolling out bandits and beggars so what s all the noise about being africa s most populous country having the continent s biggest economy should translate to dominating the african markets with made in nigeria products if we are strategic in our thinking chinese products are not all over the world out of accident or for the fun of it human beings sat down and came up with a policy to make the chinese economy export led and they implemented the plans with utmost commitment and a sense of patriotism that would overshadow the selfishness and shallowness that are always at work in nigeria government policies in nigeria are mostly selfishly conceived and not meant to last the distance even the well conceived ones would get frustrated by those who should make them work the purpose of this article is quite simple to discuss how nigeria can unchain its potential entrepreneurs multi millionaires and billionaires we need leaders who are able to understand that there is a link between governance and prosperity they must understand that shared prosperity can become the fodders for the much needed national peace and progress government or should i say policy makers should stop thinking that poverty eradication or job creation is something to be done by a minister a commissioner a special adviser a director or an agency politicians must know that distributing keke napep and wheelbarrows will not address the fundamental issues of poverty it is an obvious fact that most jobs are created not by politicians but by businesses big medium and small dangote adenuga and rabiu employ tens of thousands one branch of a bank employs dozens and there are thousands of branches nationwide imagine the millions of jobs in smes which form the engine of the economy if our politicians and policy makers can overcome their poor concepts of poverty eradication and job creation they will finally see that their primary role is to make the economic environment fertile and conducive to investment and to unleash the entrepreneurial potential of nigerians that is how to create jobs and tackle poverty and disease if the poor mindset can be dissolved the solutions to our problems are in plain sight i will list three fundamentals they are by no means exhaustive one let s become a country where the rule of law means something where the legal system is not a joke where there is respect for the sanctity of contracts and where government agencies do not behave like village tyrants and sadists any country where the rules mean nothing where the government can just wake up and do anything it likes and where individuals can easily procure dubious orders from court will only succeed in stifling entrepreneurship investment and innovation i don t think i need to overemphasise this fact two countries where entrepreneurship flourishes and where wealth is created and shared have something in common policy consistency entrepreneurs want to be sure of what they are signing up for you cannot pump billions into a business only to be told midway that the rules have changed many people in government cannot be bothered about the consequences of their actions and pronouncements it would appear they are more interested in milking businesses harassing entrepreneurs and investors and making life hell for them in the name of raising revenue it is all a result of selfishness and a poor understanding of the link between policy and prosperity a critical very critical factor in policy consistency is the macro economic environment the management of exchange rate inflation and all if indeed we are to inspire confidence in the economy i assume that a government would understand what it takes to stimulate the necessary investments that would unleash growth such a government should not need much persuasion on the monetary policy actions that have to be taken my biggest fear is adopting painful macroeconomic measures on the one hand and negating it with a horrible policy environment and a disregard for the sanctity of contract and the rule of law on the other we will just suffer for nothing three government must continue to invest in productive capacities particularly public infrastructure i stumbled on a social media debate the other day over if government should focus on infrastructure or job creation as if they are mutually exclusive building infrastructure is job creation thousands are engaged in the construction however with good policies and a conducive environment government will not be the only one building infrastructure much less taking loans to do it investors would complement government under ppp but no sane investors will try that in nigeria where the next government or even same government can dishonour a contract although i started this article by poking fun at my own business ideas and billionaire dreams the indisputable truth is that nigerians are exceptionally enterprising in spite of the absence of the necessary ingredients to flourish i bear nigerians witness that they toil through the chaos to create opportunities in some instances government is the biggest obstacle to entrepreneurship you can imagine how far nigerians can go if the basics are there we would be to africa what china is to the world nigerian products and services would be flooding the whole of africa you can imagine how many potential multi millionaires and billionaires have been caged by nigeria and may never bloom do you want to be a billionaire why not when i look at the number of billionaire entrepreneurs on the forbes list i ask myself why are some countries more conducive to actualising potential what do they have that we do not have can we learn from them on how to harness human material and natural resources and banish poverty and insecurity as we prepare to elect a new government these are the questions we should be raising and discussing with passion but we appear to be more interested in the dramas a group has bought nomination form for somebody some clowns are begging someone to run otherwise they will sue him or her to court we need to buy some sense and four other things cadillac arrest governor bello matawalle of poverty infested zamfara state has dished out 260 cars to traditional rulers across the state he gave the cadillac 2019 model to 17 emirs 13 senior district heads and 230 district heads in recognition of the traditional institution as the custodians of religion and culture and vehicle of cohesion and peace i don t know what amuses me more the senseless use of resources and misplacement of priority at a time of economic crunch or the deadened consciences of the custodians of religion and culture sadly the car gift bazaar to traditional rulers is commonplace across nigeria it is driving the people crazy the cup will be full someday inevitable this nin thing over 75 million phones were barred from making calls on wednesday as the government began enforcing its policy of linking the national id number nin to mobile lines the measure is for security reasons to be able to track down criminals obviously criminals are not out of options what kidnappers normally do is use the phones of their captives to call family members and associates to demand ransom terrorists meanwhile use satellite phones according to reports one thing for sure this nin thing will hurt the telecoms sector which has been the saving grace for the economy in recent years how can we make getting and integrating nin more seamless critical why kaduna pastor ea adeboye the general overseer of the redeemed christian church of god rccg was clearly in pains last week he spoke extensively on the state of the nation notably oil theft debt servicing and the 2023 polls he hardly talks like that but he said something that got me worried why always kaduna he asked that question is loaded some attribute the terrorist attacks to the fact that kaduna has a substantial christian population in truth it is not always kaduna predominantly muslim niger sokoto katsina and zamfara states have been under attack as well this is well reported but whoever is spinning the religious narrative is not doing badly selective in memoriam it was exactly seven years yesterday that my friend brother and mentor oronto natei douglas ond drew his last breath after a prolonged but brave battle with stomach cancer up till the point of death he was still taking walks around his residential area and using the rest room unaided before he answered the final call of his maker he was still calling me on the phone to find out how i was doing knowing full well that in a couple of days he would be gone forever memories of my last encounters with him torment me till this day oronto lived such a meaningful and impactful life that though he is gone he will never be forgotten he was a genuine human being fulfilled

the search for havens from the worst inflation in four decades feels like it s about to get a lot more real the bad news is that the task isn t looking at all easy or straightforward at least for individual investors whose choices are confined to the standard asset classes and who rely on a traditional 60 40 portfolio mix of equities and bonds to weather the ups and downs of market cycles if u s policy makers follow through on their aggressive tightening rhetoric we could be in for some testing times the upsurge in u s consumer prices has long passed

ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy center right and britain s prime minister boris johnson center left walk during their meeting in downtown kyiv ukraine on saturday britain said it would provide 120 armored vehicles as well as new anti ship missile systems to the ukrainian military washington slovakia s decision to provide ukraine with a soviet era s 300 air defense unit a move made with the blessing of the united states represents a new phase in the war as allied countries look to help the ukrainian military hold off an expected offensive from a newly concentrated russian force and better prepare for a potentially long conflict in the early days of the invasion nato countries were quick to send short range defensive weapons to take out tanks and aircraft including javelin nlaw and stinger missiles which were light portable high tech and easy to use with little training but now the allied governments have shown a willingness to send heavier weaponry more suited to the coming battle in donbas including tanks and longer range defensive weapons such as the s 300s a russian made surface to air system used mainly to attack enemy aircraft advertisement our approach is evolving based on realities on the ground margiris abukevicius lithuania s vice minister of defense said this past week on a visit to washington for diplomatic talks on saturday britain said it would provide 120 armored vehicles as well as new anti ship missile systems to the ukrainian military the aid is in addition to 100 million pounds about 130 million worth of military equipment that prime minister boris johnson pledged to ukraine a day earlier western officials increasingly recognize that the war is likely to be a protracted conflict between two large armies as neither side shows signs of wanting to give up the fight that means that the kinds of arms ukraine needs are changing kyiv s commanders now need better air defense systems and longer range weapons than they currently have to defend the bulk of the ukrainian army in the country s east so far the biden administration has not been willing to provide weapons that would allow ukraine to strike deep into russia although some experts say that damaging russian military airfields would improve ukraine s chances of withstanding a renewed offensive the biden administration did say last week it will work with u s allies to transfer soviet made tanks to bolster ukrainian defenses in the donbas region president volodymyr zelenskyy of ukraine has pleaded with the united states and its allies to send tanks and warplanes ukrainian forces are best prepared to use russian designed systems of the kind that warsaw pact countries deployed in the cold war nato countries in the alliance s eastern flank still have stocks of those weapons and have said they are willing to give them to ukraine if they are provided with newer replacements the russian designed s 300s are a good example slovakia s prime minister said friday that his country had provided the system to the ukrainians and the united states announced it would provide patriot air defense systems to slovakia with other potential deployments to come it remains unclear whether the s 300s have been delivered to the front lines yet the ukrainians have the system in their inventory and already know how to use it the s 300 will allow the ukrainians to defend against several russian aircraft attacking at once this is additional capacity said retired lt gen ben hodges the former top army commander in europe it s a very accurate system another european diplomat speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss military planning said friday that nato nations had not made final decisions on what more weapons to provide ukraine allied war planners are working to assess the ukrainian requirements in the near term to hold off the coming russian offensive and over the longer term since the war is likely to grind on for months or years the question is complicated the most useful weapons are those that the ukrainian military already knows how to employ effectively the next best thing would be to find other weapons the diplomat said that the ukrainians can be quickly trained to use allied nations are ramping up training efforts in neighboring countries european officials said it could make sense to provide weapons that require a training period of weeks instead of days as long as those weapons would make a difference on the battlefield the next few weeks are likely to prove to be a critical time in the war european intelligence officials have said putin is likely to try to achieve battlefield gains by may 9 when he is set to give a victory day speech to the russian public this year commemorating the soviet victory in world war ii and the military operation in ukraine alexander vindman a retired army lieutenant colonel and an expert on ukraine said the ukrainians need more warplanes about 70 of the ukrainian air force is still operating but the military command in kyiv has been hesitant to use its hard to replace fighter planes for fear that they will be shot down in addition ukraine needs its ammunition stocks replenished and artillery systems to replace those destroyed by russian attacks he said small medium range armed drones could also prove critical such systems could be used to render russian runways inoperable that is a critical gap the ability to strike deeper targets said vindman who was the chief witness against president donald trump in his first impeachment proceedings the russians have the advantage of air power they have the advantage in long range artillery they have the advantage in short range ballistic missiles in order to level the playing field we need to transfer more this

it is exceedingly rare for a major congressional committee to hold hearings on corporate greed leading to corporate profiteering and surging prices on consumer goods on april 5 2022 senate budget chairman senator bernie sanders i vt chartered uncensored territory on corporate avarice with a lead witness former secretary of labor robert reich now a professor at the university of california berkeley although the hearing covered bread and butter issues the mainstream corporate media ignored it massive coverage of the war in ukraine does not offend advertisers while the corporate war on consumers directly involves corporate advertisers corporate greed takes hundreds of thousands of american lives every year think the opioid disaster the tobacco cancer business the toxins in the air and water not to mention injuries and illnesses stemming from corporations that put extra profit over concerns about public health and safety however at the senate hearing sanders chose to focus on the economic exploitation of consumers here is his introductory remark across every major industry prices continue to rise this includes a 38 percent increase in the price of gasoline a 44 percent increase in the price of heating oil a 41 percent increase in the price of a used car a 24 percent in the price of rental cars and a 17 percent increase in the price of furniture further tyson foods recently increased beef prices by 32 percent the price of chicken by 20 percent and the price of pork by 13 percent as prices increase corporate profits hit a record high of nearly 3 trillion in 2021 up 25 percent in a single year he might have added that the companies profiting from these price increases paid a record low amount in federal income taxes moreover the net worth of their richest shareholders soared in the midst of the pandemic sanders denounced 900 billion in stock buybacks last year alone a sign of excessive pricing power in 2020 he added the ceos of major us companies on average made nearly 350 times more than the median worker senator sanders could have noted that apple s ceo tim cook is making 50 000 an hour or about 850 a minute this year no those are not typos big corporations always have misleading but plausible excuses they are currently blaming the war in ukraine the covid 19 pandemic and the global supply chain pile up in our ports for high prices well who created the supply chain requiring us consumers to buy all kinds of products from countries thousands of miles away that could have been produced here in the usa it was big business ceos who pushed corporate managed free trade agreements through from washington to beijing their avaricious mantra was that their free trade pacts would lower prices for consumers really aside from clothing look at the sky high prices for your imported iphones your computers cars and drugs the corporate boosters of the global trade pacts pocketed the excess profits from the backs of serf labor abroad professor robert reich rebutted the corporate excuses for their higher prices by pointing out the detrimental impact on consumers of concentrated corporate power in such industries as gas and meat with profits at a 70 year high and the companies flush with cash why are they raising prices his answer because they can and they can because they don t face meaningful competition just the reverse is true these industries dominated by a few corporations have the power to raise prices because it makes it easy for them to informally coordinate price increases without risking the possibility of losing customers who have no other choice he testified if markets were competitive he continued companies would keep their prices down to prevent competitors from grabbing away customers the reason they re raising prices rather than absorbing increased costs is that they have pricing power in their locales as does proctor and gamble for diapers and toilet paper in addition to their soaring profits reich showed how corporations even make money off of inflation beyond their rising costs tyson foods cfo admitted this power senator lindsey graham r sc the malicious duplicitous ranking republican member of the budget committee had as his witness professor michael faulkender who worked for trump s treasury department faulkender blamed the federal reserve s monetary policy funded by banks and headed by a trump nominee and excessive demand fueled by washington s stimulus programs for price increases this is the usual gop routine of blaming the government for everything even a government under the thumb of the corporate lobby he neglected to mention that given soaring profits companies in a competitive industry would absorb rising costs to keep their customers instead these companies are passing on these costs plus adding profit fueling ever higher inflation under both republican and democratic administrations the government s abdication of antitrust enforcement shaped by corporatist lobbying allowed countless merger after merger in industry after industry to occur but faulkender did not dwell on this dimension of the corporate state or the relentless corporate urge to merge so they can buy their customers instead of earn them the biden white house has proposed stronger antitrust and consumer protection measures they want to tax billionaires and unproductive stock buybacks the latter being a long time desire of president biden but there is no energy by his party in congress compared to the energy by the gop to stop these measures besides both parties are dialing for the same corporate campaign cash a daily begging that dilutes the reformists ardor the media blackout on sanders s hearing is partly the senator s fault he knows how to hold a highly energetic public hearing you have witnesses who have worked in the trenches against corporate profiteering victims of these profiteers and subpoenaing corporate executives like tim cook of apple if they don t testify voluntarily there also needs to be proponents of strong corporate crime legislation if democrats can t organize a determined hearing that generates massive media coverage how do they expect to make these popular issues front and center in the coming november elections how do they expect to rebut the twistificating republicans from succeeding in blaming the democrats for these corporate bred inflationary pressures on voters the democrats haven t even formulated the slogans for such an offensive excerpted sanders hearing on corporate greed goes unnoticed by corporate media courtesy

offering college course website iim kozhikode iimk chief product officer programme visit indian school of business isb chief technology officer visit iim lucknow iiml chief operations officer programme visit indian school of business isb chief digital officer visit right now we are in the growth phase where valuations have expanded and now it is going to be the earnings growth which catches up we will probably see some forward valuation compression but as long as the growth comes through we are going to be in a longer growth phase for india says co head asian economics strategy commodity research i am going to give you a kind of a two pronged answer and be a two headed economist here there are really two important points to bring out number one is that if you look through financial history and tons of textbooks and studies one of the most significant determinants of future returns is the price you pay at the start of your investing period it is not surprising if you pay a high price it is harder to have higher returns over time it generally had a much better potential for return just purely from that if the starting point for india is paying over 20 times earnings then one should not expect as strong returns as we have enjoyed over five year investing intervals however this is a really strong caveat to that it looks like india would be able to deliver quite strong earnings growth because of the very favourable underlying fundamental dynamics on top of that we have written a detailed paper on this late last year we are very excited about the theme or what you might call the increasing digitalisation of indian equity markets there are over 60 unicorns in the private sector that have been formed and those will be coming into the market through listing as they come in the configuration of the indian index will start to shift and will take on more of this kind of digital economy structural growth components that is something which for example in china was a terrific 10 year investment theme and a lot of wealth was created we think a similar dynamic is taking place in india lastly i would like to mention the outlook for a lot of other parts of the region and here there is a lot of concern about china as for the high relative valuation for india i do not think it will come down to where it has been over the past 10 years so if you roll all this together yes returns will be somewhat lower than we have enjoyed but i still think they are going to be good in absolute terms and india will be a good place to be investing in the bottom line is if investors can see some sort of a price correction in india which will give a better entry point or we can wait for sometime to let the earnings catch up and let the multiples get naturally compressed then it will be a very good time to re engage in a more active manner in a positive indian investment thesis we have a similar way of kind of characterising the investment cycle and i would say right now the growth phase we have a lexicon which is despair which is the bear market and then hope which is you when the market rallies before the fundamentals change and we naturally get pe multiple expansion then we get the growth phase which is typically when multiples compress with the underlying earnings growth coming through and then the euphoria blowoff stage after that the whole cycle tends to repeat right now we are in the growth phase where valuations have expanded and now it is going to be the earnings growth which catches up we will probably see some forward valuation compression but as long as the growth comes through we are going to be in a longer growth phase for india this is a very important point and it is something for which credit goes to all the distributors who are the attendees in this conference it is really the life blood so to speak and the point here is what we call the financialisation of indian household savings the concept is that indian households save a lot they have got a very strong robust balance sheet but the majority of it is in property cash and gold not that much of it is in financial assets our view is based upon looking at how various other economies have developed over time there is going to be a development of financial market investment and there will be a structural shift in embracing of financial market investments by the indian households we think there is a long way to go in this because if you look at the current deployment we are still well below 10 of the household balance sheet being invested either directly in equity markets or through mutual funds or other similar intermediaries there is a very clear long term structural trend of increasing share of financial assets in the household balance sheet which itself is going to grow as india s economic growth increases and peoples wealth rises so we think this is a really strong fat long term trend which is quite positive and it underpins higher valuation for the indian equity market but the risk will be coming perhaps overly enthusiastic i think the other kind of additional factor which we can look forward to and which could be a turbo charging factor on top of that domestic demand for equities is the return of the foreign investors for example i am in new york right now i have just had 30 conversations with us investors and the general take on india is yes we like it but we had been overweight it looks a bit expensive and we pulled back but we are looking to re engage at some point so 20 billion of net foreign selling gives foreign investors the opportunity to reload later if they again become more enthusiastic a combination of secular structural deployment of the indian household balance sheet into the equity market could be complemented by a return of the foreign investors and that could give us some pretty handsome returns from indian equities at some point down the line this is true so there are a few points that are important that we need to unpack as you said this is super top of mind just to deal with the recession question first of course if the us goes into recession that is not good for anyone in relative terms india will stand out as one of the more attractive places fundamentally because india is still enjoying sort of tailwind of recovery from the covid induced setback we are still trying to get back to the growth trajectory and that is indeed where we think the economy can grow over 8 this year so there is obviously good potential trend growth but on top of that there s a bit of catch up which we still have to enjoy and so india and other parts of asia indeed standout in happy contrast to the risk of the us tipping back into recession because we have such a completely different kind of monetary and fiscal policy cycle as well as a growth dynamic which sets preference for parts of the world including india and away from the us but that being said if the us tips into recession typically the equity market would sell off to some degree and we have noted that in the last 30 years every time the us has gone down 10 or more asia will follow it may follow to a lesser degree but it is going to be a depressing effect it is true and that is something that domestic investors need to keep in mind but the inversion is happening in what it is colloquially called the two ten spread the difference between the two year yield and the 10 year yield and the reason why i mentioned this is that we need to be careful about what signal we are extracting from that inversion of the yield curve the reason i mentioned this is because the 10 year yield has not risen as much as the two year yield and which is why the curve is flat and then slightly inverted the reason why 10 years are not higher than they should be from a fundamental perspective is because given more inflation in the us from a global cross sectional perspective the us yields look pretty attractive because german bonds are currently yielding 60 bps japanese jgbs are yielding 25 bps and the bank of japan just came out and said they want to keep those there for what is called yield curve control my point here is that for the global pool of fixed income capital which is in trillions of dollars even if the us yield looks overvalued relative to elsewhere it looks great so what it is doing is that it is artificially suppressing demand supply reasons the 10 years or so where i am getting with this is that the signal is distorted by technical flow of funds issue and may not be giving us as clear an indication of actual economic recession risk as it typically does in other circumstances we have got various models that look at these circumstances economically i actually have a lot of sympathy for that view and this gets back to the kind of longer term the comments i was making before about the change within the indian stock market and economy the greater embracing of the digital economy and living and breathing it actually means a lot of positive potential the digitisation process and india s stack of aadhaar the biometric identification the capability of doing banking digital kyc capabilities and of course the universal payment interface upi which allows for cashless transactions the combination of all this releases great potential the analogy here is with the construction of the us highway system in the 1950s which had tremendous ripple effects it was sort of a common social good that was put in place but that connecting us by that highway system engendered a huge productivity and growth spur the analogy here is that a digital highway has been put in place it is a common good and it is enabling the rapid formation of companies on top of that it also includes the vast majority of the india population which previously was in the informal or the grey economy and the potential here is however strong india s growth could be that digital good and investment which has been made could boost india s growth rate even further we do not know what that is it could be one percentage point or more or less but it certainly is a positive and is that starts getting explored more significantly that could lead to a structurally higher growth and better earnings that could give us a much better longer term indian investment story we are onboard to that longer term picture but right now with the current entry price getting back to the previous question we are a little bit less enthusiastic we are still buyers on a pullback the longer term structural story should be positive and that is how we square the circle on that

innovation often leads to new products but new methods can be just as groundbreaking it was the chance to help develop those methods that drew chemical engineering doctoral student soumil joshi from his native mumbai india to virginia tech in 2019 it s a great school especially for the chemical engineering field and it is really reputed for research on polymers which i m thankful to be doing here joshi said and in march three years of work led to his name being listed as first author on a paper describing a new computational method for working with polymers that he and his advisor assistant professor sanket deshmukh hope will lead to significant biomedical advancements the paper titled coarse grained molecular dynamics integrated with convolutional neural network for comparing shapes of temperature sensitive bottlebrushes details a method developed by the deshmukh lab including co author and visiting scholar samrendra singh that uses artificial intelligence to analyze the shape of important complex soft materials and predict their behaviors it was published in npj computational materials an open access journal from nature and not only holds promise for enabling new discoveries in biomaterials but highlights the growing importance of big data artificial intelligence and computational science in chemical engineering these computer assisted innovations are critical to making progress in a range of fields deshmukh said there are long standing scientific problems that can t be solved by existing methods so solving problems and developing new methods go hand in hand the researchers developed their deep learning method to work with what are called soft materials in deep learning artificial intelligence systems are trained to recognize patterns work on problems and perform tasks with or without human supervision soft materials can include liquids polymers glycomaterials foams gels and most soft biological materials they are used in a wide range of products and applications from toothpaste lubricants and liquid crystal displays to drug delivery systems and tissue scaffolds but traditional computational methods of analyzing and predicting their behaviors especially polymers have limited utility hindering progress in their development to help break that logjam the researchers worked with a type of branched tree like polymers called bottlebrushes their inspiration came from biomolecules whose different shapes determine their functions synthesizing them in the lab could lead to new medical treatments and other industry applications deshmukh said but that can be difficult because the polymers change shape rapidly depending on temperature and other factors without an efficient and accurate way to analyze and predict those changes creating synthetic versions is difficult their new process uses a well known deep learning system called convolutional neural network or cnn to identify and predict similarities in shape and function in the polymers something that can t be done without computer assistance applying artificial intelligence to this polymer problem is groundbreaking because it shows the potential of deep learning methods in the field of soft materials deshmukh said so in principle if we understand how the shapes are changing then hopefully we can control them to prove their method would work joshi ran 100 unique cnn models teaching the system to identify bottlebrushes with similar shapes the project was challenging not just because it required painstaking work to teach the model what data and features to look for in the polymers but also because the researchers didn t immediately know what features were relevant they had to figure that out first developing the models took more than a year deshmukh said singh and joshi did a fantastic job in identifying the processing of the relevant data and then further refining it to make sure the cnn model gets the right information most of the initial brainstorming on what features to use was carried out by dr singh and dr deshmukh which helped eliminate plenty of unfavorable options joshi said this helped us zero in on our current methodology which i used to code and incorporate into our analysis algorithm the results have been very promising joshi said and the team hopes to expand use of the technique into the growing field of glycomaterials carbohydrate based soft materials produced by every living organism these soft materials contain chains of sugars called glycans that play critical roles in health and disease of the four building blocks of life glycans proteins lipids and nucleic acids glycans are the most complex and the most challenging to understand but cnn could spur progress in this area so just like we created these bottlebrush structures for synthetic polymers there are a lot of architectures that can be created using glycomaterials and polymers like these glycans deshmukh said work on this paper was supported by the 23 million glycomip project a multi university partnership led by virginia tech and funded by the national science foundation it was announced in 2020 to address scientific and technological bottlenecks in glycomaterials research we plan to help our collaborators design new types of glycomaterials that can be used for biomedical applications deshmukh said it s really exciting this research also points to the growing importance of data science and machine learning in chemical engineering department head steven wrenn said it s important that our graduates know how to work with data scientists and use computer modeling in their own work wrenn said this training will make our students much more attractive to employers and graduate programs in fact the department is working on a new computational and data science track of study which if approved will train undergraduates to apply computer science to chemical engineering deshmukh is involved in developing the study track training a chemical engineer who is going to work in a chemical plant in data science and artificial intelligence makes them a real asset deshmukh said because they are going to help solve problems in the chemical industry that can t really be solved using traditional methods

dear editor the following missive as per the above caption was addressed to the hon johnny briceno prime minister of belize and chair conference of heads of government of caricom prime minister further to our letter to prime minister mia mottley dated 27 march 2022 annex 1 we write to you about some ongoing and potential negative impacts on the coastlines of island nations in the caribbean being caused by the reckless expansion of oil production from deepwater fields offshore guyana the oil fields have been licensed by the government of guyana gog to a consortium of eepgl hess cnooc and operated by eepgl under a production sharing agreement psa for the stabroek tract dated 27 june 2016 exxonmobil xom is eepgl s parent company and is headquartered at irving texas we write to you as citizens of guyana and inhabitants of caricom at the outset we express how inspired we are by the example of belizeans and the successful campaign led by the belizean ngo oceana that resulted in the unanimous passing of petroleum operations offshore zone moratorium bill 2017 which placed an indefinite moratorium on offshore oil prospecting or production in belize s exclusive economic zone eez we have two interrelated requests for information firstly we kindly request information on the composition procedures and progress of the transboundary workgroup which esso exploration and production guyana limited eepgl committed to creating in 2017 environmental resources management 2017 we provide relevant information below in annex 2 to this letter environmental resources management erm has been eepgl s sole compiler of environmental impact assessments eias so far for the stabroek tract oil fields with the texts written as commitments made by the client eepgl secondly we also kindly request information on caricom s internal processes for dealing with the actions of a member state which have implications for transboundary harms we give three examples below 1 risk of massive uncontrolled oil spill from deep high pressure wells similar to the macondo well in the gulf of mexico in 2010 2 dumping of vast quantities of heated contaminated produced water and cooling water and 3 flaring of associated gas in these offshore oil fields we would appreciate receiving any public releases issued by caricom on these matters or please let us know whether caricom maintains an online repository we noted that guyana s combined annual oil revenues generated by the sale of its 12 5 share of produced oil and the 2 royalty received from exxonmobil is half a billion usd projected to rise to well above usd 1 billion year in a couple of years caricom should compare that sum with the value of beach based tourism in the caribbean islands at potential risk from oil spills in the guyanese eez jamaica s tourism alone is around usd 1 3 billion neither guyana nor xom is carrying insurance against the consequences of massive oil spills our first request for information relates to our concern at the lack of public information on transboundary engagements in respect of our common caribbean sea and the complete lack of transparency exhibited by the gog and xom in the sharing of information despite the numerous requests and outcries from the international community civic organizations and the public for such information eepgl s breakneck drilling of exploration and production wells is currently concentrated inside the northern edge of guyana s exclusive economic zone eez this puts the potential for transboundary harms closer to several caricom member states than to the guyana shoreline we request specific information on the steps being taken to honour the separate commitments by our countries to safeguard the global environment namely the precautionary 2 preventive 3 and the common concern of humankind principles erm s maps of models of oil spills are included in the eia volumes for each of the first four oil fields being developed in the stabroek tract confirming eepgl s trust in these simulations these four fields are liza 1 and liza 2 both in current production payara under development and yellowtail under exploration and planning and recently given a contested environmental permit on march 30 2022 the oil spill response plan has been criticized as weak by international specialist robert bea considering the problems which have arisen in in us oil fields dumping of produced water besides an oil spill very hot produced water contaminated with oil and numerous toxic elements and radioactivity is being dumped into our caribbean sea after partial treatment as stated several times in the eias for example section 2 5 3 3 produced water treatment the produced water treating system will be designed to collect produced water from the fpso processing facilities and treat the water for discharge overboard per standard industry practice eia for liza phase 1 volume i nominal page 34 actual page 86 498 2017 for the liza 1 field alone the volume of produced water is 100 000 barrels per day for 20 years the revised environmental operating permit for liza 1 issued on 17 january 2022 still allows a monthly average of 29 parts per million ppm of oil and grease in the produced water discharged from the floating production storage and offloading fpso vessel liza destiny and a daily maximum of 42 ppm section 4 7 while 29 to 42 barrels of pure oil will be dumped in every million barrels of dumped water a myriad of radioactive and toxic elements remain untreated based upon the eias projected discharge rates of 300 000 barrels per day bpd each and xom s publicly stating stated plan to have 10 fpsos operating by 2027 it is conservatively estimated that hundreds of thousands of barrels of pure oil would be dumped into the ocean over the life of the oil operations predicted to be at least 20 years and this does not consider the other many operators expected to start production in the near future4 when added to a potential oil spill this dumping will compound the caribbean region s worries about the resulting devastating impacts to our ecological systems and fishing and tourist industries the permit also allows the discharged water to heat the surrounding ocean by up to 3 degrees celsius above ambient water temperature at 100 metres from the fpso and 55oc at the fpso discharge point at least twice the temperature of the ambient ocean water section 4 12 yet with the rise in ocean surface temperature shown recently for the western atlantic cheng et al 2022 figure 4 the seawater was already critically close to the upper limit of tolerance for some commercial fish as acknowledged in the erm s eia for the yellowtail oil field these discharges are not consistent with application of the united nations precautionary principle when caribbean fish stocks are already facing critical temperature challenges flaring of produced gas the permits pellucidly dictate that routine flaring or venting is prohibited yet flaring has been allowed to continue from inception of operations in december 2019 resulting in a cumulative flared amount in excess of 15 billion standard cubic feet instead of cutting production by the tiny amount of about 3 to stop the flaring the gog in may 2021 changed the permits to 1 redefine routine flaring so as to legalize the flaring of unlimited quantities of gas as long as the operator pays a paltry fee while earning extra revenues of over 60 times that fee from not cutting production by that miniscule amount to stop flaring and 2 give xom 60 days of free flaring after startup overturning the decision of a gog team comprising canadian expert consultants and gog agencies including the environmental protection agency requiring only 2 days of flaring after startup and no flaring afterwards in accordance with the us regulations prime minister we wish to assure you that we are in full support of petroleum production in guyana but it must be done in a manner protective of the region s environment safety and health and economic wellbeing to this end we urge caricom to engage the gog to ensure that oil operations off shore guyana are carried out in a safe and environmentally sound manner failure to do so could devastate the region s economy and environment specifically we request that 1 caricom demands that the gog immediately take actions to enforce the legal requirements of the eias and environmental permits 2 caricom demands that the gog stop eepgl from dumping hot toxic and radioactively contaminated produced water into the caribbean sea 3 caricom demands that the gog reverse its decision to allow unlimited flaring for a small fine and return to the original regulation where routine flaring or venting is prohibited and 4 caricom engages the gog on ensuring its petroleum extraction laws and regulations are compatible with the 2016 paris agreement please note that our intention is to make this letter public as the issues we outline concern all the citizens of caricom we celebrate our distinct and shared identity that have withstood both external and internal stresses and strains lloyd searwar s insight still holds caricom s identity comes from its distinctive history which differentiates it from that of latin america the independence movements in the caricom states were led by the descendants of slaves and indentured laborers this identity has provided the region with the resilience to weather grave divisions and is seen as an ultimate security resource searwar 1995 p 19 we are heartened by the protections and safeguards accorded to caricom citizens including to environmental rights set out in caricom s charter of civil society 1997 we acknowledge caricom s firm expressions of support for guyana s territorial integrity in the face of long standing venezuelan aggressions most recently in 2018 stabroek news 2018 mr chair we look forward to your acknowledgement and reply to our requests we stand ready to engage with you on these issues sincerely vincent adams alfred bhulai janette bulkan darshanand khusial joe persaud mike persaud ganga ramdas charles sugrim

those giddy post apc victory days of 2015 in retrospect what el dorado did most nigerians home and abroad not think was at hand in their beloved country with the swearing in of president muhammadu buhari on may 29 2015 who could have blamed them for being so cocksure this was after all none other than the deified spartan soldier turned politician retired military general former military head of state who either in that office or as chairman petroleum trust fund had neither a single gas station nor an oil block and hadn t a single corruption charge anywhere hanging on his neck till today president muhammadu buhari remains a man of incandescent integrity indeed so jubilant were nigerians that before he took office his mere body language had wrought a considerable measure of orderliness in the country that many believed that finally the long awaited messiah had arrived who would leapfrog nigeria out of the dungeon into which pdp s 16 year stranglehold had sunk it that was the type of unrestrained optimism and jolitty that birthed the article you are about to read titled buhari bold agenda for the next four years a view from abroad it was published on these pages on sunday 24 may 2015 though no nigerian alive anywhere today on terra firma needs be told how egregiously misplaced the hopes and proposals expressed therein have turned i shall still towards the end of this article make a few comments of my own on how things have unfortunately panned out under president buhari happy but sober reading the columnist is currently on holidays in houston texas united states and yields the column this sunday to segun badipe a nuclear medical scientist who has been tortured to no end by pdp s torrid 16 years of utter cluelessness with the election over it is imperative that the president elect embarks on a bold and persistent agenda it has been sixteen long years since nigerians have waited to have true dividends of democracy with that in mind the president elect must move with deliberate speed to implement those political and economic promises that saw his party to victory in the just concluded elections as no one is certain which program will deliver the most in the shortest time his agenda must be properly interrogated by the party this article will touch on some major ones on the political front the president must go after all the treasury looters this is certain to enjoy tremendous political support from nigerians since they understand the connection between the excesses of the pdp and the political problems now confronting the nation it is unfortunate that the judiciary has been thoroughly bastardised concerning this one is easily reminded of the ibori case here was a governor exonerated by nigerian courts only to be convicted and jailed by a london court with both courts presented with the same set of facts the nigerian judiciary thus allowed an accused to go scot free with catastrophic financial consequences to his unlucky delta state people until a saner court in a saner jurisdiction gave them justice i mention this just to demonstrate the urgency of cleaning up the judiciary president buhari must use covert operations to flush out corrupt judges as it would otherwise be difficult to secure convictions against corrupt politicians who are crawling all over nigeria on the economic front there is a lot that can be done to give the people hope nigeria is about the only country i know where politicians don t feel any remorse for not delivering on their campaign promises there are of course no quick fixes to the power electricity problem on which the obasanjo government famously spent about 16b only to literally purchase darkness adding nil megawatts to the existing stock i would suggest that the buhari government proceeds immediately with rehabilitating all those moribund and comatose projects which can increase deliverables in the short run when completed that way government can increase available electricity to about 6000 megawatts that is double what is currently available in the country in regard to the plants which are suffering from irregular supply of natural gas due to sabotage plants could be built closer to gas sources also leveraging on extant laws the president must seriously go after all the merchants of darkness that cabal that profits from darkness and does everything to sabotage improvement in the generation and distribution of power that cabal must consciensciously be put out of business if we learnt any lessons from the revolution in the telecommunications sector it is that public services are more efficiently run when excessive bureaucracy is bye passed or completely removed our experience with big bureaucracy has been rather ugly nitel now a relic being a good example thanks to mobile telephony the buhari administration must bring the same revolutionary changes into the power sector this it can do by embarking on alternative energy sources to break the stranglehold of the cabal tax incentives could be offered to small and medium size businesses to purchase solar wind and even inverters for the purpose of operating their business for large manufacturing concerns government can very well experiment with clusters of businesses in specific industrial zones which will help lower overhead costs with tax incentives and subsidies about the greatest problem the country faces today is insecurity with boko haram having suzerainty over many local government areas in the northeast solving the boko haram problem will help to a great extent in laying the foundation for peace and meaningful progress in the country if the president fails to do this nothing else will matter because life is key and the primary purpose of government is to ensure the safety of life and property of her citizens not doing this means that a government qua government forfeits it s right to be in office some people have very naively suggested that government should negotiate with terrorists this is a no no terrorists by nature do not play the give and take game for them it is all or nothing therefore no responsible government should ever negotiate with terrorists rather government must do everything to put them completely out of circulation whatever it will take with enough men and resources our army will see off these irritants and return peace to nigeria finally the monster of it all corruption for which the president elect must device novel instruments to deal with using efcc or icpc is nothing more than asking the ruling class to prosecute itself which will guarantee only minimal success the government must therefore necessarily have to think out of the box it could for instance come up with an amnesty program whereby those who willingly confess to their acts of corruption could after making full restitution be allowed to keep some of the recovered loot strictly for purposes of basic sustenance this low cost technique of recovering public loot could be made available in the first 12 months of the new administration after which it will become unavailable the next step should be a whistle blower program it is also a low cost technique the essence of which is for persons who are intimately familiar with details of some corrupt acts to squeal on the perpetrators with a fraction of the recovered loot going to them as compensation all they need is a legal pathway of uncovering the corrupt act the whistle blower must help law enforcement recover the proceeds while such fraudsters are made to reap the full weight of their malfeasance the whistle blower must have immunity from prosecution and be protected from any conceivable reprisals corruption rarely happens with only one individual rather it is usually through a web of co conspirators bank officials contractors and corrupt civil servants all of who collude to plan and execute a fraud government only needs to offer incentives to that one disgruntled participant who is willing to flip and report everything it is time for this novel technique in our country it is particularly sickening watching generations of our youths growing up with little or nothing to hope for in life finally we all want the president elect to succeed and for this to happen he must neither be timid nor reckless he must be guided by the timeless values of justice fairness and hard work now more than ever before nigeria needs a statesman who is willing to work across ethnic and geographical divides and bring the best ideas to the table in order to build a great country we all can be proud of for purposes of space constraint let me now make some brief comments especially on the current state of the issues raised by the guest writer beginning by saying that no programme of president buhari seems to have been interrogated by his party the apc as a matter of fact he showed his hands early in this regard by surrounding himself almost exclusively with northerners except in statutory appointments the result today is that northerners are the chief executive officers of at least 70 per cent of all state agencies if not more and literally all of those in security related agencies even the federal character commission which is to ensure geo political equity in appointments into the public service has a northern executive secretary and chairman the net result is that inequality has been the bedrock of the buhari administration a fact which has completely worsened the zoning controversy currently bedevilling the two major political parties on corruption unlike what happened under president jonathan the efcc is now under a supervisor general in the person of the attorney general of the federation abubakar malami he it is and no longer the agency who determines who can or cannot be tried and which case even while already ongoing can any longer be heard no matter the offence as happened in the case of a n7 9b fraud charge against a former minister whose case was no longer featured on any of february 22 2021 and april 19 to which it was adjourned so much now for the anti corruption war and while at this the least said about the judiciary the better judges houses are now so routinely savaged by security agencies that at a special session of the supreme court for the 2021 2022 legal year in december 2021 the otherwise reticent chief judge his lordship ibrahim muhammad could no longer hold back from warning against what he called the oppression suppression and intimidation of judicial officers on the economy we only have to simply look at the naira apart from the galloping food prices ravaging the country in 2015 when the buhari government came into office the naira exchanged officially to the dollar at around n197 88 but today it is n580 at the parallel market and at around n416 at the official rate that should sum up the nigerian economy today one should have mentioned the huge investment in railway transportation infrastructure under the government but nigerians must now have to wait a little longer to know the true status of that gigantic undertaking without a scintilla of doubt the most agonising of all the issues touched is security as nobody in nigeria today apart from those in the presidency can claim to be safe indeed but for governor el rufai s take on the matter and the sermon of the apo villa mosque cleric i would have wagered that the war on nigeria long promised by the fulani nationality movement with neither police nor any other security agencies once questioning them was already afoot strategists that they are they would know that things will not be so easy come june 2023 so as confirmed by those lucky to come out alive in the bombed abuja train young 18 20 year olds from outside the country are now coming into nigeria at an alarming rate those so freighted to southern nigeria during the pandemic are of course already at work so according to a project of the council on foreign relations africa

what will happen to the bread basket of europe once the shooting in ukraine stops russia is the largest and ukraine is the fifth largest exporter of wheat together they account for 29 of the world s annual wheat sales the war has disrupted not only the harvests in ukraine but also the ability of russia to ship its wheat to other countries this will cause food crises through much of the world two of the most volatile regions the middle east and north africa are the most dependent on these two sources but food prices everywhere will be under pressure before russia invaded ukraine wheat prices were already 49 above their 2017 2021 average the economist reports they ve gone up another 30 since the war began the war will cut supply in several ways obviously it will reduce harvests in ukraine but even if russian wheat fields continue producing the conflict will make it harder to export its grain as noted above importantly it will affect harvests elsewhere because ukraine and russia are also major suppliers of farm fertilizers ukraine s supply is being pounded by war while russia s is getting frozen by economic sanctions advertisement but what about u s farmers the united states is the world s second largest wheat exporter couldn t american agriculture replace a shortfall in supply especially if higher prices for their crops spur our farmers to grow more it s apparently not that simple american farmers would certainly value higher prices for wheat the problem lies in the higher cost of producing it already paying record prices for fertilizers farms must also deal with the rising cost of the diesel fuel that runs their tractors and other machines high fertilizer prices are already affecting what farmers choose to grow americans for example usually plant more corn than soybeans this year however the balance has changed to favor soybeans the reason soybeans generally need a quarter of the fertilizer that corn does as for wheat it falls somewhere in the middle in fertilizer use aggravating matters wind and dry conditions have left america s winter wheat crop in its worst shape on record according to the department of agriculture this follows a poor harvest in 2021 that forced american wheat stocks down to their lowest level in 14 years in any case almost all the winter wheat was already planted when the war began and severe drought is being forecast for the western plains america s bread basket even if the violence against ukraine stops through a ceasefire or better a resolution that country will have a hard time restoring its agricultural might first off its farm infrastructure is being destroyed tractors and other farm machinery have been used to stop russian tanks and the russians have been bombing agricultural buildings full of tools and other farm equipment there are also questions of how much ordnance is now buried in ukrainian fields that would put farm workers in danger of setting off explosives much as happened in europe after world war ii ukrainians are already fearful of russians having booby trapped dead bodies on the streets with bombs they could do it on purpose in the fields but should ukraine get back on its feet will everyone then revert to the earlier world food order that seems unlikely this bizarre invasion has toppled many assumptions about where everyone s food comes from and if this horrible war goes on for years the international system for feeding the planet will certainly have to make permanent adjustments america the land of plenty will not starve our expectations that food will be cheap as well as plenty may not hold but we have much to be thankful for froma harrop is a syndicated columnist follow her on twitter fromaharrop she can be emailed at fharrop gmail com send questions comments to the editors previous next

record home energy prices this year have laid bare maine s ongoing vulnerability and dependence on fossil fuels to stay warm and move around tip guide offers roadmap for home energy savings fully weatherizing a home and upgrading its heating systems can be unaffordable for some mainers but a new tip guide from efficiency maine can help identify ways to reduce energy use and save money including low cost and do it yourself measures for example it recommends changing out incandescent light bulbs for leds to save more than 80 percent on lighting look for heavily marked down prices at participating stores common now is a four pack of 60 watt equivalent leds for 2 for reducing drafts it advises placing foam gaskets behind electric outlet and switch boxes weatherstripping and adding bottom sweeps to interior doors that face unheated spaces such as garages attics and basements caulk or foam insulate the gaps around pipe and wire penetrations from unheated spaces set water heaters no higher than 120 degrees and replace faucets and shower heads with models that have a flow rate of less than 2 gallons per minute the guide recommends the tip guide can be downloaded from efficiency maine s website and a printed copy can be obtained by emailing info efficiencymaine com no one knows exactly how russia s war in ukraine and other factors will affect global energy markets in the months ahead but an urgent question is looming today in many maine households shocked by the surge in heating fuel electricity and gasoline prices what cost effective things can i do between now and next winter to reduce my dependence on energy sources subject to price volatility state energy efficiency program administrator efficiency maine has three high priority answers insulate and air seal your home install high efficiency heat pumps to supplement or replace oil and propane systems and drive an electric or plug in hybrid vehicle but those looking to implement any of the recommended steps could face a long delay the quasi government agency is trying to accelerate the pace at which mainers make these transitions it s offering more incentives such as income dependent rebates of up to 9 600 for insulation work perhaps an even stronger incentive for some is the high price of heating oil which averaged 5 a gallon statewide last week and gasoline which has averaged above 4 a gallon in maine for several weeks efficiency maine s recommendations dovetail with some of the state s climate change action goals in the coming years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions the state wants the number of weatherized homes it supports through rebates to roughly double annually bringing them from 1 800 to 3 500 this year it wants to install at least 100 000 additional heat pumps up from 88 000 today and put 41 000 evs and plug in hybrids on the road up from fewer than 6 000 now but many mainers will be hard pressed to take such steps this year demand for such products and services is so high that one common piece of advice has emerged for any household planning to make energy upgrades in 2022 don t wait advertisement labor and supply issues insulation contractors in maine are struggling to find the crews needed to keep up with customer demand we ve got a list five pages long of customers to call back this year said tom atwood owner of northern energy services in lisbon if someone called in march i can probably get to them in late fall heat pump installers also are searching for new workers with offers to train them for jobs that can pay an experienced pro 40 an hour we try to do 50 homes a week said matt scott co owner of dave s world in windham one of the state s top installers that s our capacity now demand also is high for the country s growing selection of new electric and plug in hybrid vehicles but global supply chain issues have triggered waiting lists for some popular new models some dealers are asking thousands of dollars over the sticker price for them prompting some automakers to threaten to reduce future shipments to those dealers advertisement trying to track down a used plug in or hybrid vehicle isn t any easier the state s first dealership that sells only used electric and hybrid vehicles also has a waiting list demand is at record levels for electric cars said tony giambro owner of paris autobarn in south paris we have a hard time keeping them in stock there s also great interest in renewable energy alternatives such as solar electric panels but this sought after option too is constrained by not enough workers to perform installations for people who get in touch with us today we are scheduling home solar consultations into august said phil coupe co founder of the state s largest rooftop solar installer revision energy and it is possible we will close out our 2022 installation capacity by june a typical 8 kilowatt solar array tied to the electric grid costs 19 000 or so coupe said after an available 26 percent federal tax credit the investment could pay for itself in less than 10 years adding battery storage a growing trend starts at around 15 000 despite the upfront costs revision is experiencing unprecedented demand for both as well as for heat pumps fossil fuel dependency advertisement nearly a half century has passed since the middle east oil embargo forced mainers to face the consequences of america s reliance on petroleum but according to the maine climate council six in 10 maine households still use oil as their primary heat source the largest share in the country many of those homes are hemorrhaging heat between half and two thirds of the state s 550 000 homes were built before 1960 long before modern energy efficiency standards were established maine is a rural state and residents are especially dependent on cars and trucks for transportation the average maine vehicle travels 12 000 miles a year with 65 percent of those miles driven on rural roads transportation also is responsible for more than half the state s greenhouse gas emissions a prime motivator behind the push to get people out of gasoline powered cars and trucks in southern maine there s also a regional effort to expand mass transit in the long run state officials envision an electric grid powered by renewable energy sources even now an impressive 75 percent of the electricity generated in maine comes from renewable sources notably hydropower biomass and wind but maine is part of a regional electric grid and much of its power is exported in new england s competitive electricity supply market rates are tied to the wholesale cost of natural gas because gas fuels half the region s generating capacity and since gas is a global commodity that s shipped overseas world events have sent prices soaring high prices have triggered a range of responses from state lawmakers everything from gas tax holiday proposals to relief checks and electric bill credits but this kind of assistance is limited and transitory finding enduring solutions to finally break maine s dependence on fossil fuels hinges on thousands of private personal decisions about how and when to weatherize homes switch out heating systems and get from one place to another advertisement this old drafty house jonathan and trudie morrell faced some of those decisions four years ago after they bought an 1806 cape style house in bridgton like so many of maine s vintage homes this one was an energy nightmare an expensive to run electric heater in a basement area was needed all winter just to keep the pipes from freezing that changed after an insulation crew air sealed all the cracks in the basement and attic and among other measures blew 16 inches of cellulose in the cap they spent a huge effort sealing cracks it took days jonathan morrell said in an 1806 house there were a lot of cracks and drafts we have no drafts anymore the work cost around 12 000 after rebates and the couple financed 10 000 with a 1 9 percent interest loan from efficiency maine the morrells also replaced electric baseboard heaters with ductless heat pumps one warms the kitchen and great room a larger unit handles three other areas in the summer they provide low cost air conditioning advertisement the couple kept an old monitor kerosene heater installed to take the edge off the coldest nights it ran eight times last winter we find the heat pumps do the job even when it s quite a bit below zero morrell said but last january was the coldest since 2014 and it tested many maine heating systems morrell counted seven nights at minus 20 degrees so he wasn t surprised when january s electric bill hit 430 it was an outlier he said for bills that typically are fairly stable and within the couple s budget there aren t many of us similar energy efficiency improvements will need to kick into overdrive all across the state to buffer households from the sort of sticker shock witnessed this winter the challenge with weatherization is that it s hard to scale up quickly said michael stoddard efficiency maine s executive director we don t have the marketplace to deliver all that advertisement the coronavirus pandemic hit the weatherization workforce hard people didn t want strangers in their homes workers left the industry as calls for weatherization fell off the pace of insulating has been improving in recent months stoddard said but the head of a leading company says the industry is still struggling to staff up and is having trouble finding and training workers willing to crawl into basements and attics for 20 to 25 an hour roughly 15 companies with a total of 60 or so employees are performing 80 percent of the weatherization work in the state according to an estimate from richard burbank founder of evergreen home performance in portland that s the headline burbank said there aren t many of us evergreen which insulated the morrells home now has a record 30 employees an optimal weatherization team has a truck and four people including the crew leader all we need is 40 to 60 people to double the pace in the whole state burbank said that s how bad off we are right now advertisement bridging the weatherization gap is essential experts say because tightening up should be the first step in improving household energy efficiency it doesn t make financial sense they say to change heating systems in a drafty poorly insulated house i turn down clients who call me for heat pumps if they can t keep the heat in the structure said atwood of lisbon based northern energy services you have to keep the heat in before you get another heat source government estimates vary but between 20 and 40 percent of a home s energy bill can be wasted through air leakage and inadequate insulation a basic 850 air sealing job which can drop to 350 after a 500 efficiency maine rebate would pay back its investment in two years a 5 600 insulation job that saves 479 a year would pay for itself in six years after rebates according to efficiency maine more generous rebates for low and moderate income residents could slash the payback time to 16 months heat pump use rising once a home is weatherized high efficiency heat pumps can supplement or replace more costly heating systems next to wood and pellet stoves and geothermal heat pumps air source mini split heat pumps are the least expensive way to warm a building according to efficiency maine s online heat source calculator advertisement many mainers are embracing heat pumps installations doubled from 12 758 in 2020 to 27 326 last year four out of 10 new homes have at least one heat pump efficiency maine has found it s a hopeful sign stoddard said we re in a significant transformation to a new way of heating our homes and businesses this transformation isn t without controversy last december new england heating oil dealers warned the region s governors that the move to heat pumps could leave residents vulnerable to electricity price spikes and no heat during potential winter blackouts they suggested that states instead encourage the industry s evolving conversion to renewable liquid biofuels the industry including the maine energy marketers association also questions whether heat pumps can do the job in extreme cold efficiency maine has sought to counter this criticism heat pumps work by extracting warmth from the air not by generating it today s high efficiency models work well even in below zero temperatures according to efficiency maine s evaluations they should be set and left on throughout the heating season rather than turned up and down it s going to be a lengthy learning curve to get everyone in maine familiar with how they work and how they work well stoddard said advertisement but labor and equipment shortages are the biggest obstacles now dave s world has 72 people installing heat pumps after hiring 27 last year it still needs more workers the company was busy throughout the winter which is typically a slow time customers who call by june can likely schedule an installation in around three weeks according to scott but wait until august and it could be two months dave s world has shops in dover foxcroft ellsworth windham and scarborough and is planning two more volume gives the company buying power but supply problems have cost it some business we probably missed out on 100 or so jobs because of limited inventory scott said wood heating an option advertisement the rush to install heat pumps sometimes obscures the potential for wood heat maine is 90 percent wooded one in 10 homes is heated primarily with wood according to federal figures ranking maine only behind vermont the state also has four pellet manufacturing plants that help support the state s forest economy modern wood heat has multiple appeals now it s among the cheapest forms of heat stoves manufactured since 2020 are designed to produce lower emissions and a recent federal tax credit can cut the price of an environmental protection agency certified stove or central heating system by 26 percent this year and 22 percent next year we ve been very busy all year and last fall said gary asselin owner of fireside stove shop in auburn sizes installation costs and heating capacities vary but a typical wood stove runs between 3 000 and 5 000 a pellet stove which feeds fuel automatically can cost between 4 000 and 6 000 asselin said but as with so many products wood stoves are suffering from production and shipping delays asselin is warning customers not to procrastinate people looking for alternative heating need to shop early he said later this fall there won t be much available advertisement electric vehicles limited since the middle east oil embargo in 1973 interest in fuel efficient vehicles has always spiked when gasoline becomes expensive what s different in 2022 is the growing variety of plug in and hybrid vehicles on the market or coming soon even at today s power rates in maine electric cars can travel the same distance as a comparable gasoline car for less than half the cost and that doesn t include the lower cost of maintaining a battery powered car but finding an ev or plug in hybrid can be a challenge at paris autobarn only four vehicles were listed online for sale in late march one was a 2017 toyota prius prime with 63 000 miles it s a plug in hybrid that can travel around 23 miles on its battery before switching to its gas engine which returns more than 50 miles per gallon but the asking price was 27 990 not far from the cost when the car was new and used plug ins don t qualify for a 7 500 federal tax credit it s a direct result of supply and demand said giambro the company s owner america s best selling ev brand tesla gets a lot of media buzz but most mainers can t afford a new car that starts at 47 000 and tesla vehicles no longer qualify for the federal tax credit the most popular models at paris autobarn are the nissan leaf and chevy bolt advertisement but now i can t get them giambro said i can t replace the ones i ve sold the current market conditions are frustrating to stoddard his agency offers rebates that cut 2 000 off the price for a fully electric vehicle and 1 000 for a plug in hybrid even more money is available to low income residents buying a car is a big decision for most mainers stoddard suggests using this time while manufacturers are replenishing their stock to research models and consider how and where to recharge the vehicle when you re ready make the jump he said don t lock in another decade in a fossil fuel car more may ditch cars high gasoline prices and work from home options expanded during the pandemic could also prompt some mainers to consider whether they need a car at all or whether a family needs more than one mass transit officials in southern maine want to make that calculus easier advertisement bus ridership fell sharply during the pandemic at greater portland metro from a peak of over 1 9 million in 2018 to just over 1 million in 2020 but it s starting to rebound now as covid 19 restrictions ease and gasoline prices rise average daily ridership climbed from 3 647 in late january to 4 636 in mid march aided by 7 million of federal pandemic relief funds metro is increasing service on key routes and temporarily reducing fares by half at least through the end of the year to attract riders and encourage residents to develop new habits it will be experimenting with gps technology that turns traffic lights green when buses approach intersections on washington and forest avenues in portland metro also is working with transit agencies in southern maine including bus lines from york county to windham and brunswick plus the amtrak downeaster train and casco bay lines ferries to better coordinate routes and services if they re offered better mass transit more mainers could be convinced that they don t need to get in a car to go somewhere according to greg jordan metro s executive director we just need to do a better job in making transit easier jordan said it takes a lot of work it takes funding and partnerships send

more states are enacting the flat tax a single rate income tax means everyone pays at the same rate critics say it lets the rich of the hook again with president joe biden proposing to force billionaires to shoulder higher income tax burdens more states have been employing a handy old idea to head in the opposite direction they have embraced the flat tax or flat rate tax as a single tier system is known it is hailed by many gop governors and legislatures as a way to promote what they perceive as greater fairness for all taxpayers and to attract business to their states at the same time the flat tax hasn t lost any of its controversy the system still prompts an outcry from critics who deride it as a regressive scheme that flies in the face of trying to narrow the income gap

kansas city kan robert wood is used to the disrespect that can come from living in northeast wyandotte county when he purchased his home there in 1995 he said even the insurance agent marveled at its quality if this was anyplace else in the country i d insure it for 150 000 wood recalled being told but when asked why he opted for a far lower valuation the agent simply said it was due to the area things have improved in recent years wood said but a proposed congressional redistricting plan to divide the area being challenged in wyandotte county district court this week reminded him and others of the past slights and discrimination more redistricting trial focuses on how hotly contested congressional maps affect lawrence nek indeed those challenging the maps have focused many of their arguments on how the new lines would impact voters here particularly minority and democratic individuals who heavily populate the northern portion of the county which would move to congressional district 2 about 53 of county residents are african american or hispanic or latino according to the 2020 census the move to split up one of the state s most diverse counties could have a financial impact also as well as present logistical and governance challenges and plaintiffs argued in court it was consistent with past systemic discrimination in the area we live in a gerrymandered and redlined county wood said pointing to the experience of his neighbors and community members in accessing everything from political power to a line of credit supporters of the new lines have argued the decision to break wyandotte county into two portions along interstate 70 and the kansas river was born out of necessity with the kansas city area having too many individuals for one sole district as is currently the case in congressional district 3 but wood and others say the move will have effects that are all too real we rely heavily on our representative to understand the needs of an urban community as diverse as wyandotte county mildred edwards chief of staff to kansas city kan mayor tyrone gardner said in testimony during the trial tuesday more legislators stop effort to oust ethics panel director kansas chamber confirms subpoena historical discrimination sets stage for redistricting impact in order to understand redistricting however experts say it is important to first go to history class in the 1930s a new deal era program was established to help provide low interest mortgages and loans to homeowners the federal home owners loan corporation was established to both provide the loans and evaluate the creditworthiness of a given neighborhood in kansas city kan most neighborhoods scored poorly at the time in large part due to its relatively high population of african american residents something with impacts felt to this day subsequent decades of disinvestment in c and d rated neighborhoods resulted in large swaths of poor housing stock where communities of color remain concentrated today a 2016 report authored by a group of ohio state university researchers said many of those neighborhoods were also bisected by interstate 70 when it was constructed or run just north of the kansas river meaning they were among those moved from the 3rd congressional district to the 2nd district patrick miller an associate professor of political science at the university of kansas said such context was important for approaching the redistricting battle more kansas legislator apologizes after tomahawk joke toward native american colleague discrimination in public schools was explicitly allowed in wyandotte county in the 19th century and a report miller provided in the redistricting trial cited research on lynchings in kansas 20 of which occurred in wyandotte county race is critical and it is important and it has been so since the territorial days of kansas miller said in testimony even after statehood we have a long history in our state of racial discrimination much of it state sanctioned and much of it targeted at wyandotte county over 70 of the northern portion in the kansas city kan moved into the 2nd district are voters of color miller found while the reverse is true for the southern part remaining in the 3rd district which is 70 white and voters in two of the heavily minority neighborhoods divided by the lines armourdale and argentine would find themselves cut off from other heavily african american and hispanic communities in the northern part tony rupp a private practice attorney representing the state argued that democrats still have a viable chance of victory in the 3rd district it would be really easy to split up districts into four republican dominant districts he said in his opening arguments that s the goal of gerrymandering to crack and pack so as to block any chance of minority candidates getting elected that is not what happened here but miller said the 3rd district now the least diverse of the state s four districts whitewashes the voice of voters the 2nd district meanwhile relegated minority voters to electoral irrelevance loren collingwood a professor of political science at the university of new mexico presented data showing the move of minority voters into the 2nd district does not give them a corresponding increase in their power to elect candidates of their choice generally democrats instead he said the problem got worse minority voters have been excised out of that district collingwood said it is among the highest in my work i ve ever seen more kansas department of corrections and inmates at odds over crash en route to russell stover changes could impact federal support for wyandotte county the division of wyandotte county also will have a notable impact on its government structure edwards the mayor s top aide said in her testimony wyandotte county and kansas city kan have a unified city county government a unique feature in kansas and one of the few municipalities in the country with such a system now the unified government will have two elected officials in congress to petition to help meet its needs on infrastructure social services and other issues a reality that would put the county in a devastating position edwards said she said the government had worked with u s rep sharice davids d kan the current representative of the 3rd district to secure 15 5 million in federal funds for infrastructure and community development the area would lose 9 million of that if it had to restart negotiations with a new member of congress with much of the money targeted at the northern part of the county i think it would be almost impossible to secure federal funding she said the maps proponents have argued the decision to divide wyandotte county was not one taken lightly and grew out of the simple problem of arithmetic following the 2020 census both johnson and wyandotte counties had more people combined than the 734 470 allowed into a single congressional district legislators made the decision early on to preserve johnson county as the core of the district a move which dictated every other decision they made rupp said more lawmakers debated late before leaving with unresolved issues here s where each stands he added that the courts should not second guess that move this district is a little more republican than it once was rupp said it can t be the law that one district cannot be a little more republican than it once was every act moving a county to another district moves another county wyandotte county has never been separated from johnson county in the redistricting process and wood the northern wyandotte county resident said such a move would damage his community progress has occurred in helping to improve the standard of living for wyandotte county residents are quick to argue efforts are underway to develop central kansas city kan and the tentacles of the university of kansas medical center housed in the city s rosedale neighborhood have grown even more in recent years throughout the area helping to provide an economic lift but exiting court with his wife wood issued a warning to those taking a keen interest in the redistricting case it is getting better he said of his community after watching arguments in court tuesday morning but if they change it again the democrats and republicans it ll really make the situation worse andrew bahl is a senior statehouse reporter for the topeka capital journal he can be reached at abahl gannett com or by phone at 443 979 6100
washington nytimes slovakia s decision to provide ukraine with a soviet era s 300 air defence unit a move made with the blessing of the united states represents a new phase in the war as allied countries look to help the ukrainian military hold off an expected offensive from a newly concentrated russian force and better prepare for a potentially long conflict in the early days of the invasion nato countries were quick to send short range defensive weapons to take out tanks and aircraft including javelin nlaw and stinger missiles which were light portable high tech and easy to use with little training but now the allied governments have shown a willingness to send heavier weaponry more suited to the coming battle in donbas including tanks and longer range defensive weapons such as the s 300s a russian made surface to air system used mainly to attack enemy aircraft our approach is evolving based on realities on the ground lithuania s vice minister of defence margiris abukevicius said this past week on a visit to washington for diplomatic talks on saturday april 9 britain said it would provide 120 armoured vehicles as well as new anti ship missile systems to the ukrainian military the aid is in addition to 100 million s 178 million worth of military equipment that prime minister boris johnson pledged to ukraine a day earlier western officials increasingly recognise that the war is likely to be a protracted conflict between two large armies as neither side shows signs of wanting to give up the fight that means that the kinds of arms ukraine needs are changing kyiv s commanders now need better air defence systems and longer range weapons than they currently have to defend the bulk of the ukrainian army in the country s east so far the biden administration has not been willing to provide weapons that would allow ukraine to strike deep into russia although some experts say that damaging russian military airfields would improve ukraine s chances of withstanding a renewed offensive the biden administration did say last week it will work with us allies to transfer soviet made tanks to bolster ukrainian defences in the donbas region president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine has pleaded with the united states and its allies to send tanks and warplanes ukrainian forces are best prepared to use russian designed systems of the kind that warsaw pact countries deployed in the cold war north atlantic treaty organisation countries in the alliance s eastern flank still have stocks of those weapons and have said they are willing to give them to ukraine if they are provided with newer replacements the russian designed s 300s are a good example slovakia s prime minister said on friday that his country had provided the system to the ukrainians and the united states announced it would provide patriot air defence systems to slovakia with other potential deployments to come it remains unclear whether the s 300s have been delivered to the front lines yet the ukrainians have the system in their inventory and already know how to use it the s 300 will allow the ukrainians to defend against several russian aircraft attacking at once this is additional capacity said retired lieutenant general ben hodges the former top army commander in europe it s a very accurate system another european diplomat speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss military planning said on friday that nato nations had not made final decisions on what more weapons to provide ukraine allied war planners are working to assess the ukrainian requirements in the near term to hold off the coming russian offensive and over the longer term since the war is likely to grind on for months or years the question is complicated the most useful weapons are those that the ukrainian military already knows how to employ effectively the next best thing would be to find other weapons the diplomat said that the ukrainians can be quickly trained to use
