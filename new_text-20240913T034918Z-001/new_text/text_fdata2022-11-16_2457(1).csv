washington prices at the wholesale level rose 8 in october from a year ago the fourth straight decline and the latest sign that inflation pressures in the united states are easing from painfully high levels the annual figure is down from 8 4 in september on a monthly basis the government said tuesday that its producer price index which measures costs before they reach consumers rose 0 2 in october from september that was same as in the previous month which was revised down from an initial reading of 0 4 the figures came in lower than economists expected and make it more likely that the federal reserve will increase its benchmark interest rate in smaller increments it has hiked its short term rate by three quarters of a point for four meetings in a row but economists now increasingly foresee an increase of a half point at its december meeting the improvement in the october inflation data if it persists supports the fed s expectation of a step down in the pace of increases going forward said rubeela farooqi chief u s economist at high frequency economics a forecasting firm most of the monthly increase reflected higher gas prices at the wholesale level which rose 5 7 just in october the cost of new cars fell 1 5 last month which could lead to lower prices at the retail level as well excluding the volatile food and energy categories core producer prices were unchanged in october from september the lowest reading in nearly two years core prices increased 6 7 last month from a year ago down from a 7 1 annual rate in september advertisement the cost of services such as hotels air travel and health care slipped 0 1 in october from september the first drop since november 2020 the report follows last week s better known consumer price index which showed that year over year inflation cooled to a slower than expected 7 7 in october down from 8 2 in september and excluding volatile food and energy costs that report also said that core prices rose just 0 3 in october from the previous month half the increase of the previous two months those consumer inflation figures sent stock markets soaring because they suggested that the devastating price spikes of the past 18 months might finally be moderating the cost of used cars clothing and furniture fell a sign that goods prices are reversing their big price leaps of last year when supply chain blockages sent inflation soaring in recent months delays at major ports have been cleared the price of ocean shipping has tumbled and more stores are building larger stockpiles all those trends suggest that goods prices could continue to decline send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

this article is part of the insights uncharted brain series there are many competing theories about what causes alzheimer s disease here ruth itzhaki reflects on a career dedicated to one of the more controversial lines of research when i was about seven or eight i asserted that i wanted to be a scientist or so my parents told me years later even though i would have had little idea of what that word meant in my mind i was perhaps associating it with making momentous discoveries that were immediately recognised and applauded by the whole world soon after i avidly read madame curie the book by eve curie about her mother marie and how she overcame poverty and the many challenges faced by women in the late 19th and early 20th century to become a nobel prize winning scientist marie curie became my lodestar for the future and thanks to my parents support and self sacrifice i did eventually become a scientist marie curie won two nobel prizes in 1903 for physics and in 1911 for chemistry shutterstock everett collection many years later i found myself confronting what seemed like insuperable odds just as curie did though in very different circumstances i have been an independent researcher since the age of 26 when i completed my phd my subsequent research in a cambridge university department on chromatin a complex of dna and proteins went well then after eight years my husband and i moved to manchester where the head of the institute where i worked for 12 years decided to end my contract leaving me jobless and lab less in the decades that followed my research into viruses as a possible cause of alzheimer s disease was greeted with much hostility and almost all my funding applications were refused a hostility that has continued for 25 years and which has only recently abated thanks to mounting evidence this story is part of conversation insights the insights team generates long form journalism and is working with academics from different backgrounds who have been engaged in projects to tackle societal and scientific challenges i along with my tiny research group survived only through the award of a few small grants from more open minded charities and companies interested in new approaches once i even managed to swap a business class ticket to the us that was provided for me to speak at a conference for economy class so i could use the several thousand dollar surplus for my lab instead but after years of struggle there is finally hope for this line of research an anti viral trial for alzheimer s the first ever is now taking place at columbia university this study is building on the years of work done by my team meanwhile our latest research is looking into the way infectious illnesses increase the risk of alzheimer s career and academic challenges can always be balanced with the help of a support network a family i was always lucky with mine during many of these years my husband shaul itzhaki a retired academic who had worked on nucleic acid biochemistry supported my struggles and never once suggested that i change to a safer more conventional and non contentious topic he was always touchingly happy with any successes i had and i will always remember our celebratory days when i was awarded a beit memorial fellowship for medical research and later a newnham college fellowship during our years in cambridge read more alzheimer s disease mounting evidence that herpes virus is a cause sadly he died in april 2022 after suffering for about ten years from vascular dementia a dementia distinct from alzheimer s disease but with many similar symptoms and latterly from a fractured femur that disabled him the last four or so years were particularly hard to endure as he became increasingly aware of his failing memory the term brain fog is often used in this context but to me it seemed more like a mist through which he could very dimly see or perceive what he was struggling to recall the frustration desperation perhaps that he felt at his inability to grasp hold then voice these elusive thoughts was pitiful the author in her laboratory author provided i often took him to talks on topics such as the climate migration history and ageing hoping to keep his mind occupied he seemed to understand many of them but afterwards he was quite unable to discuss them as his memory and ability to speak were declining inexorably communication of any type between us was slowly becoming impossible although he was the person with whom i had once shared my thoughts and hopes just as he had done with me and it became particularly sad and unsettling as we had had so many interests in common eventually came the realisation that i had lost him it was a bereavement the loss of him as a person loss of a mind not the death of a body he was existing but not really living another common feature of dementia sudden changes of mood affected him during these years he had been a generally gentle courteous person but when at times the illness overcame his natural traits he became violently angry often for no obvious reason part of the problem was that his sense of location had faltered and often during the evenings he became convinced that we were about to leave and go home to manchester a place we had left in 2013 he would ask repeatedly and anxiously when we had to leave to catch the train to get there television programmes even those on historical events which would have been of particular interest to him had to be vetted as he lost himself within them so that after watching one that dealt with say the horrors of war he thought that he was actually living in that frightening world of course there are so many families going through what my family went through and there will be many more that fact has provided one of the main motives for my pursuing my research despite all the difficulties that have come with it this article is accompanied by a podcast series called uncharted brain decoding dementia which examines new research unlocking clues to the ongoing mystery of how dementia works in the brain listen to the full series via the anthill podcast during the last five years studies supporting the idea of a viral role in alzheimer s disease have greatly increased despite this there is still much opposition to the concept while many in the field still ignore it i am often asked why there has been such hostility a charitable explanation is that the possible role of a virus in dementia is difficult for others to assess because it straddles two very different topics virology and alzheimer s disease also many cannot grasp the concept that people can be infected but not affected asymptomatic when the virus resides in the brain without causing symptoms so they dismiss the data either way i have always stressed that many possible factors lead to alzheimer s disease a viral role is just one of them my interest in this particular area began rather unpromisingly in 1978 when the aforementioned head of institute ended my work contract the reason he cited was that my research on chromatin and on the effects of carcinogens on chromatin was rather individualistic i thought this was an extraordinarily inept criticism as i had generally been acknowledged as being an innovative researcher and innovation is surely the key to good research the funding body offered me a post in glasgow but that would have meant leaving my husband and children in manchester luckily i was immediately given a home in the lab of a medical virologist friend richard sutton sutton was an eccentric and pioneering man he was dogged and wiley in an endearing way it was sutton who first suggested to me the possibility of viral involvement in alzheimer s disease negatively stained transmission electron micrograph tem of numerous herpes simplex virions scott camazine alamy stock photo the argument for the role of the cold sore virus herpes simplex type 1 hsv1 in alzheimer s disease was first suggested by american neuropathologist melvyn ball in 1984 but he did not pursue the idea in any practical way sutton and i carried out what was probably the first convincing experiment seeking the dna of hsv1 in the human brain we had predicted that it might be detectable in the brain of immunosuppressed patients because in the absence of an adequate immune system to keep it under control the virus would be able to multiply we did indeed find it and published our results in 1986 hsv1 is mainly transmitted by oral to oral contact causing oral herpes cold sores globally an estimated 3 7 billion people under age 50 67 have hsv1 infection most infections are asymptomatic over the years the supportive data we gathered for the key role of hsv1 in alzheimer s led me to propose a central concept that hsv1 is a major cause of alzheimer s disease that in many people the virus travels to the brain probably in middle age and remains present there in latent dormant form but is frequently activated by episodes of stress head injury immuno suppression and infections these reactivations lead to productive hsv1 infection and inflammation and consequent damage to the brain over the years the accumulated damage leads eventually to the development of the disease the possible role of hsv1 specifically was proposed for three main reasons the locations of the damage the virus causes in the brain during the rare but extremely serious acute disease herpes simplex encephalitis hse caused by hsv1 are precisely the main sites of damage found in the brains of patients with alzheimer s disease the other reasons for implicating hsv1 were that it is very common affecting at least 80 of the population in earlier decades more probably 90 and its ability to remain dormant in the body for years these features meet two main characteristics of alzheimer s disease that it is all too common and that it almost always waits until old age to strike its victims certain other infectious agents are probably involved too perhaps individually or in combination but so far these have been less well studied than hsv1 i was offered a more long term prospect for my research in a department of the university of manchester s institute of science and technology the head of the department john cronley dillon was a larger than life character a bon viveur and art lover full of novel ideas and wild enthusiasm he encouraged me to build up a research group minuscule though it was and eventually we started the research on hsv1 and alzheimer s it was known that when a person is infected with hsv1 the virus resides lifelong in the peripheral nervous system pns the part of the nervous system that doesn t include the brain and the spinal cord in a latent state it is dormant until it is activated by events such as stress in 1989 we decided to look for hsv1 in the brain using the technique of polymerase chain reaction or pcr we used pcr to examine dna extracted from autopsy specimens of alzheimer s disease patients this was the first time pcr then a new technique had been used for this purpose the principle of pcr is to detect a specific sequence in the target dna by chemically amplifying it thereby making it vastly more sensitive than the methods used in the previous few studies seeking hsv1 dna in the brain however this method was prone to contamination and could produce spurious data this meant that my poor phd student gordon jamieson spent many frustrating months trying to get it to work satisfactorily so we were overjoyed when we detected unambiguously the dna of the virus in the brain in 1991 this was the first microbe to be detected in the human brain in controls in the absence of a disease we were puzzled though as to why the virus was present in a high proportion of brains both control brain specimens people who had not been diagnosed with alzheimer s as well as the brains of patients who had died with the disease this near equality of prevalence does not undermine the role of hsv1 in alzheimer s as some in the field have asserted many of the control brains were in fact infected with hsv1 but were asymptomatic so people can be infected but be asymptomatic indicating that infection alone is not sufficient to cause disease a very relevant example is that of cold sores which afflict only a proportion ranging from 20 40 of those infected with hsv1 the other 60 80 are asymptomatic clearly another factor determines the degree of damage caused by the virus that was something we identified in 1997 when we discovered that the virus confers a high risk of alzheimer s disease when in the brains of people who carry a specific genetic factor we were extremely excited by this finding but also apprehensive about adverse reactions of some in the field as had occurred before when we discovered hsv1 dna in elderly brains so we were even more excited when after i d suggested examining cold sore sufferers via a small blood sample to find what variant of the specific genetic factor they carried we discovered that it was the same variant as for alzheimer s in other words the same variant of the genetic factor conferred a risk of damage in the peripheral nervous system as well as the central nervous system of course the question arose as to what it is doing if anything in the brain is it residing there merely as a passenger doing little or nothing or does it cause damage we investigated this by examining cerebrospinal fluid the liquid that bathes the brain looking for antibodies to the virus we detected these antibodies in most samples of cerebrospinal fluid again consistently in both alzheimer s patients and those in the age matched control groups this showed that indeed the virus was not just a passive fellow traveller we then decided to find if there were direct links between the effects of hsv1 infection and alzheimer s very hesitantly like explorers in a new continent we infected human brain cells with hsv1 then stained the cells with antibodies to the specific abnormal proteins seen in alzheimer s brains amyloid and tau to our surprise and delight we saw accumulations of both types of protein also we found amyloid deposition in the brains of infected mice however getting the results published was a sisyphean task and journal reviewers comments were often incredulous we subsequently used a very complex technique in situ pcr which revealed that in tissue sections of brain most of the viral dna was located very specifically within amyloid plaques this suggested that amyloid might act to cage the virus thereby inactivating it all this work provided strong support for a major role of hsv1 in alzheimer s and much has since been extended by other labs we also discovered that anti herpes treatment was protective because it substantially reduced the damage level in the cell cultures we were testing this further supported a role for the virus in the disease and pointed to a potential treatment but a viral role in the development of alzheimer s was still seen as heretical by many researchers so our papers continued to be rejected by one journal after another for academics having research published in top journals is often central to keeping your job and career progression because of the perceived value to universities related to university league table rankings supposed research quality and performance management similarly almost all of our grant applications over that 25 years were refused too which was even more serious as without funding the people in my lab couldn t be paid nor materials bought i was very fortunate in having three successive post doctoral researchers woan ru lin curtis dobson and especially matthew wozniak who were so dedicated that they were willing to continue to work even when on repeated short term contracts sometimes for less than 12 months so most of my time was taken up in writing research proposals and filling in application forms interspersed with writing and submitting articles to journals and when rejected trying another i had to face derision and hostile rants unaccompanied by any meaningful scientific criticism from reviewers a typical example was this grant essentially centres on a question of belief are viruses important in alzheimer s disease in my view they are not each rejection seemed like the end of the world it was a heart stopping moment when opening the envelope or email from the funding body and scanning the lines in the hope of finding the words i m pleased to tell you though all too often i found the words i regret to tell you i hid weeping tears of despair while a part of my brain questioned whether the work really was nonsensical and whether the ideas were just wild fantasies at conferences i was often shunned by prominent people in the field my poster presentations were too posters were the poor man s alternative to giving a talk a privilege i was rarely given although hearteningly i found that younger people were interested and excited by the research later i benefited from the generosity of a colleague janusz kulikowski kulikowski was another eccentric who lived an upside down life working at night and either sleeping during the day or else amusing himself by lobbing provocative remarks at colleagues he was really interested in our research despite working in the totally different field of vision research i do realise of course that many others have suffered refusals of grant applications and i understand how especially heartbreaking it is for those at the start of their career as it usually means the end of all their hopes and dreams of becoming a scientist i realise too that i had been exceptionally lucky in being able to do such utterly engrossing work a continuous totally fascinating puzzle and challenge and in having a loving family but after each rejection my fear that the work would end was overwhelming when i did get a grant any grant i was elated the world sparkled i was so happy and exuberant not just with the funding but with the fact that some people in the field were supportive of or at least willing to consider a possible role for hsv1 i felt so encouraged vindicated and ready to face any challenge in my work or from fellow scientists and brimming over with ideas for new approaches quite often in the later years some strongly supported our central concept but there was a huge divide between them and its opponents and the hostility continues to this day in 2019 an application by a colleague to a us funding body for a clinical trial of an antiviral for alzheimer s was refused i was involved as an adviser because it was based on my lab s research though i was not an applicant one reviewer said this application is peripherally related to the idea that human herpes virus hhv infection could play a role in alzheimer s disease pathogenesis the evidence is weak the supporting data are weak the second reviewer proclaimed the novelty of this approach appears to be quite lacking the suggestion of latent microbe based activation by unknown factors coincident with a deteriorating immune system as the cause for alzheimer s seems like hand waving poetic perhaps but hardly a brilliant display of scientific disputation in fact no adverse comments had ever been supported by any scientific argument despite a public assertion once by a senior government official that the hsv1 alzheimer s work had been refuted though when challenged he was unable to cite any such article most researchers acknowledge that new surprising and challenging ideas should be viewed with caution but ideas should not be dismissed without any deliberation perhaps another major reason for the hostility is that many people in the field have been working for several decades on amyloid as a cause and so are understandably distressed on learning that it might not be a direct cause except in rare familial cases this occurs despite our repeatedly stressing that numerous factors contribute to alzheimer s and amyloid is clearly an important feature but as the columbia university study shows attitudes to the topic of alzheimer s and hsv1 are slowly but steadily improving of course i am very happy about this for the sake of patients and their carers and i have to admit that recognition of the work on hsv1 is personally gratifying as like most people i am heartened to know that my work has achieved something i am pleased that the research that i and others are carrying out is now moving forwards in even more exciting directions including the use of a 3d bioengineered human brain model which when infected with hsv1 displays many alzheimer s like characteristics we are now investigating the effects of infectious diseases and a possible role for vaccinations this follows an explanation i published with my then senior post doctoral associate curtis dobson to account for the finding that certain vaccines decreased the risk of alzheimer s disease we suggested that infections might reactivate latent hsv1 in the brain and that vaccines might decrease the consequent risk of alzheimer s disease by reducing the occurrence of such infectious diseases for example in the case of shingles which is caused by another type of herpes virus varicella zoster virus vzv a recent study i carried out with manchester university epidemiologists showed that vaccination against the disease may protect against the development of alzheimer s two subsequent studies showed the same result however much further work needs to be done to elucidate the findings that certain types of vaccine appear to reduce the risk of alzheimer s scraping of a skin lesion showing characteristic giant cells in a patient with chicken pox varicella zoster virus a type of herpes shutterstock david a litman i along with researchers at tufts university then decided to find out if vzv which also causes chickenpox plays a role similar to hsv1 in causing brain damage leading to the development of alzheimer s our results showed that vzv infection of the cells does not lead to the formation of the main characteristic alzheimer s features in the brain however vzv infection does result in certain other alzheimer s like features including increased inflammation and importantly vzv was seen to reactivate the latent hsv1 infection in the brain model with the consequent occurrence of alzheimer s like characteristics this is consistent with our suggestion that infections reactivate latent hsv1 in the brain the recent evidence that another herpes virus epstein barr is a cause of another brain disease multiple sclerosis strengthens the likelihood of viral involvement in certain other such diseases we now plan to find out if other infections cause hsv1 reactivation from latency if they do the obvious corollary would be to try to limit infections by vaccination and by improving standards of hygiene and living conditions a particular need in developing countries to reduce microbial transmission in addition we now have some exciting preliminary findings suggesting that percussive brain injury for example concussion can cause hsv1 reactivation this is a very different type of injury from infection and the results suggest that the virus might be pivotal in the brain s response to diverse types of damage this is an exciting field of study and i hope bright young scientists will enter it nobody said being a scientist was easy but with the

vice president of the ohio poultry association says it s unlikely to affect the thanksgiving holiday chakeres says farmers plan for turkey availability year round and that frozen turkeys in particular were processed months ago cold stocks for whole hens the birds typically served for holiday dinners were up 12 2 from 2021 according to the usda while production has been well below typical levels this year due to the virus storage data suggests that producers have prioritized building up supplies of whole hens in time for the holidays just continue to enjoy the holidays with your family if you normally want a 24 pound turkey this year you might need to buy two 12 pound turkeys but the turkey is going to taste great chakeres said chakeres advises families to shop early especially if they are seeking a particular type of turkey or a certain weight although suppliers say there will be plenty of turkeys available this year he says it doesn t hurt to make arrangements now more when does deer hunting season begin here s a look at ohio s 2022 23 rules and dates will inflation impact turkey prices according to usa today september s inflation report showed a 21 annual increase in all foods the prices of many thanksgiving staples have risen at the highest pace to date turkeys were up 20 6 in the september producer price index that s on top of a 25 annual increase in september 2021 according to cnbc the price per pound of an 8 to 16 pound turkey right now is 1 99 up from 1 15 last year chakeres says the price of turkeys in ohio will rise but this is due to multiple factors including higher gasoline freight labor and feed costs we were already seeing higher prices because of the normal issues that all farms are experiencing today supply chain issues lack of packaging the labor market the challenge now is that it s a supply and demand market so if more birds become infected that decreases the potential supply and that affects the pricing structure chakeres told the enquirer in june how will this impact local farmers and retailers turkey production this year is slated to drop 6 from 2021 to 5 2 billion pounds according to the usda minnesota based hormel foods corp owner of the jennie o turkey store brand said it expects avian flu to reduce its turkey production through march 2023 according to a press release the brand s production volume was down 20 after the third quarter farmers across the country who face high costs for feed and labor were already cutting production before the outbreak due to declining profits but how have local farmers been affected chakeres says anytime there is a disease that results in the loss of birth local farms and farmers suffer but they are used to dealing with these situations and will continue to do what is required of them he explained bill tonne manager of gorman heritage farm in evendale says the avian flu will not affect the farm s turkey production this holiday season tonne noted that the farm has approximately 130 turkeys this year a record high flock for the farm he thinks this is due in part to the fact gorman heritage farm is a non profit that aims to educate greater cincinnatians about agriculture nutrition sustainability and the environment because turkey production is not its sole focus the farm can raise smaller flocks and implement more safety and security measures that help mitigate the spread of disease holiday season why aren t the charlie brown holiday specials on tv this year here s a look how can we help stop the spread of avian flu chakeres says farmers have increased biosecurity measures in response to the avian flu as they look to ward off potential exposure avian flu is not just a concern for commercial flocks but small backyard flocks and family farms as well chakeres gives the following recommendations to all individuals who may own chickens turkeys and other birds or who may come within close proximity to avian creatures step one bring those birds inside if possible bring those birds inside if possible step two if you re outside around wild birds change your shoes and clothing before coming inside if you re outside around wild birds change your shoes and clothing before coming inside step three don t share equipment with other farms don t share equipment with other farms step four if you think your birds are sick contact your local veterinarian or the ohio state department of agriculture can humans get avian flu although the risk to the general public is low the centers for disease control and prevention explains that humans can contract the avian flu the first case of the avian influenza virus in a person in the u s was reported on april 28 2022 only four human infections resulting in mild to moderate illnesses have been identified in the united states right now the bird flu situation is primarily an animal health issue however the cdc is watching this situation closely and taking routine preparedness and prevention measures in case this virus becomes a more significant human health risk people who may have job related or recreational exposures to birds are at a higher risk of infection and should take appropriate precautions to protect against bird flu

sign up for the daily jwr update it s free just click here traditional financial advice typically tells savers to put retirement first even before homeownership that s because over the long term the stock market tends to outpace real estate and there are tax advantages to putting money in a retirement account but retired homeowners are in a much better financial position than their peers who have rented so it might make more sense to encourage younger savers to prioritize buying a home despite the very real challenges of high home prices and interest rates millennials have higher average 401 k balances than generation x did when they were the same age but they re not any better off financially says craig copeland director of wealth benefits research at the employee benefit research institute a lot of that has to do with being less likely to own a home that doesn t bode well for later on the benefits of homeownership can t be overstated in retirement says copeland for older homeowners and older renters with similar incomes there s a significant gap in net wealth a big portion of that is due to home equity but homeowners also have more non housing wealth too homeowners age 65 and over in the highest income quartile had a net wealth of close to 1 3 million compared to 334 150 for renters according to harvard university s joint center for housing studies and this was based on 2016 data before the big run up in home prices for the majority of americans who haven t put enough money aside for retirement a home has often been their saving grace the elderly poverty rate is around 10 but would be much higher without the robust rate of homeownership among older americans says chris mayer a real estate professor at columbia university s business school a home gives you a roof over your head and you can always sell it if you really need cash then there s the budgeting stress that can come with renting studies show that housing accounts for a much bigger chunk of total expenditures for older renters than for owners this is even more apparent for low and middle income households in turn older renters tend to have more credit card and health care related debt and less cash savings than homeowners plus the unpredictability of rent increases can wreak havoc when retirees are on a fixed income sure homeowners may have to deal with property taxes and maintenance but those seem relatively minor considering the double digit jump in rents during the past year some cities such as new york offer rent stabilized apartments but that isn t the norm in much of the country even before the pandemic about 55 of rental households headed by someone age 65 and over were cost burdened meaning more than 30 of their income went to housing costs data from harvard s housing center shows no wonder retirees who rent report lower levels of retirement satisfaction given the importance of homeownership to a secure retirement it s especially worrisome that the homeownership rate among older people has been declining and even more precipitously among people of color in 2004 81 7 of households headed by 50 64 year olds in the us owned a home that number was just 75 as of last year setting this group up to enter retirement age with lower homeownership rates than those of the previous generation at the same age according to senate testimony by harvard s jennifer molinsky still there are some caveats you need to save at least some money for retirement even while you re prioritizing a down payment if your employer offers a 401 k match make sure you contribute at least enough to take advantage of that free money it s also important to remember that the benefits of homeownership in retirement are greatest for those who have paid off their loans homeowners who enter retirement still paying off a mortgage something more retirees are doing than in previous years tend to spend more each month on housing costs than renters at least it s a fixed expense provided it s a traditional mortgage so trying to pay off your mortgage before retiring should still be the goal but that s all the more reason to focus on saving that down payment the typical age of a first time homebuyer is now 36 the oldest on record according to the national association of realtors the older you are when you buy the more years you re missing out on those home equity gains for many prospective buyers rising mortgage rates and high home prices are delaying homeownership given how crucial a home can be to a secure retirement let s hope today s sidelined buyers don t give up on it completely maybe that means buying a smaller home or even borrowing from your 401 k but it ll be worth it comment below alexis leondis is a bloomberg opinion columnist covering personal finance
posting on twitter has changed since elon musk finalized his 44 billion takeover of the micro blogging platform one of musk s first orders as ceo adding opt in paid verification to the social networking platform s twitter blue program previously account verification was used to credibly identify people or organizations of public interest and did not require payment musk s changes allowed anyone on twitter to get a blue check on their account for a monthly fee musk claimed the change would support twitter s revenue however the opposite appears to have taken place within weeks of musk s takeover verified users from luxury fashion house balenciaga to whoopi goldberg stephen fry and showrunner shonda rhimes announced their departures meanwhile several major brands have paused advertising on the platform their reasoning concerns around musk permitting a cesspool of hate speech to proliferate on the platform shortly after musk introduced the new blue check program a tweet purporting to be from american pharmaceutical giant eli lilly announced that insulin would be free several users rejoiced in the comments excited for the promise of accessible health care but the tweet was never sent out by eli lilly whose official account is lillypad instead the tweet came from an account that registered with twitter blue s paid verification program though the fake eli lilly account was removed the pharmaceutical company lost billions in value and the company s stock fell 4 37 per cent within days musk s companies tesla and spacex were also parodied with numerous tweets directly mocking musk banana producer chiquita american girl lockheed martin and other corporations also found themselves satirized by twitter blue accounts in response to the impersonations musk paused the paid verification program musk has also been inconsistent about the new gray official check verification the new check was also brought in to deal with the impersonations but musk soon tweeted that he d killed it after the announcement instigated more trolling the gray check has since returned to some verified accounts these playful impersonations aren t coincidental they are a dissent against musk s leadership in response to musk becoming ceo users used the platform to challenge dominant ideas about capitalism and power the fake verified accounts are forms of shitposting or crass provocative digital communication styles relying on parody and mocking shitposting attempts to disturb and derail typical ways of posting on social media platforms shitposting traces its roots to early 2000s internet cultures it s often associated with trolling and other forms of hate speech circulating on message board platforms like 8chan however shitposting can also be a form of digital protest communication scholar josh gunn explains that shittexts are rhetorical practices that use irony and detraction to catalyze conversations about power and capitalism similarly shitposts can help us blow off steam about political events we have little control over likened to the dadaist art movement shitposts also use play absurdity and irony to challenge grand narratives about art and economic life distributed blackness african american cybercultures by andré brock jr nyu press since its launch in 2006 twitter has been a digital public square for its 330 million monthly users users build community in different enclaves groups organized around shared identities or common interests in his groundbreaking work on black twitter media scholar andré brock jr explains how the platform s longevity is sustained by ordinary users whose playful use of twitter gives them power and agency in ways offline spaces can t twitter host to digital movements like cripthevote amplifies important conversations that don t always get attention in mainstream media many dramatic changes accompanied musk s arrival the self proclaimed chief twit dismissed nearly half of twitter s employees content moderation and harassment issues quickly rose threatening safety and security for marginalized users but twitter users are not always concerned with reproducing offline hierarchies of power even public facing personas regularly interact with everyday users the limited character count of a tweet means all users rely on creative strategies to communicate their messages for instance on a pre musk twitter verified users had the option to edit their display names the name section is a playful space used to creatively conceal an identity or temporarily partake in a viral platform trend like spooky halloween names in response to musk s verification changes many users including cartoonist jeph jacques and comedian kathy griffin changed their display names to elon musk tweeting out provocative and offensive statements impersonating the ceo many other users joined them jacques and griffin s accounts have both been suspended after assuming leadership musk a self proclaimed free speech absolutist publicly announced that comedy is now legal on twitter but his desire for the platform to be a space for free speech was short lived on nov 6 musk who previously warned users against parodying his likeness announced verified users would lose their blue checks if they attempted to change their display name verified users are now unable to change their display names singer doja cat whose name was stuck as christmas publicly tweeted at musk for assistance when he permitted the change doja cat changed her display name to fart and thanked musk the platform s future remains uncertain some claim musk is driving twitter into the ground while others fear it will become yet another space for white supremacist hate things aren t just chaotic online musk s warning about twitter s looming bankruptcy complicates the flows of impersonation and hate speech that followed his takeover is shitposting the most pragmatic way to engage in public dissent probably not however through small acts of play satire and parody twitter shitposters demonstrate the platform s unique potential to spark cultural conversations about power with a twist of provocation

by julie appleby and jazmin orozco rodriguez dresslerville nev smoke began billowing into the skies of northwestern nevada in september clouding the mountains dimming the sun and quashing residents hopes that they would be spared from wildfires and the awful air quality the blazes produce the lung irritating particles were blowing in from burning forests in california and settling in douglas county nevada home to nearly 50 000 people prompting warnings that air quality had reached hazardous levels those levels meant the air was very unhealthy bad enough to raise alarms about people s immediate health care needs and questions about whether worsening pollution could result in long term health issues people could increasingly face such risks as climate change makes wildfires drought dust storms and floods more frequent across the u s and the world some people simply feel powerless there s not much we could do about it said serrell smokey chairman of the washoe tribe of nevada and california the tribe s land straddles the border between california and nevada near lake tahoe and extends into douglas county about 60 miles south of reno tribe members and other area residents are among millions of people nationwide who this year will experience poor air quality because of wildfires in september as smoke settled over nevada fire related air quality alerts were dispatched in six other states california idaho montana oregon washington and wyoming don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free yet by one measure people who live in douglas county are better off than those in some other hard hit areas douglas county residents must drive 30 minutes on average for medical care from lung specialists called pulmonologists in other parts of the west and upper midwest however patients must drive an hour or more according to data analyzed by goodrx a website that tracks prescription drug prices and conducts research specifically the research found that about 5 5 million americans live in the 488 counties where drive times to pulmonologists are an hour or more much of nevada and large parts of montana fall into those gaps between specialists places that have recently grappled with wildfires that fill the air with smoke and ash which can cause lung problems or exacerbate existing ones allergies asthma and similar issues are often handled by primary care physicians but patients are sent to pulmonologists when problems escalate think severe asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or copd or emphysema data from the association of american medical colleges shows the number of pulmonary disease specialists in the u s dropped nearly 11 from 2014 to 2019 the group which is based in washington d c and represents the academic medicine community noted that the decline might not be as high as it appears because some physicians are opting to practice pulmonary critical care rather than just pulmonology many of those types of pulmonologists work in hospital intensive care units about 15 000 pulmonologists are practicing in the u s according to the goodrx report yet vast swaths of the country have few or none new mexico has one pulmonologist for the entire southeastern part of state not counting las cruces which is closer to el paso said dr victor test a pulmonologist at texas tech physicians test one of 13 pulmonologists in the lubbock texas region said that his patients from within texas sometimes drive four hours for an appointment and that other people travel from new mexico oklahoma even far western kansas increases in wildfires and their intensity will likely expand the need for pulmonologists climate change is going to affect lung disease said dr nicholas kenyon a professor of pulmonary critical care and sleep medicine at the university of california davis school of medicine in california where he and several other researchers are tracking the effects of wildfires at his sacramento practice kenyon said he sees patients from far northern parts of california including eureka a five hour drive from the state capital the short term effects of breathing smoke are pretty well known people show up in emergency rooms with asthma attacks exacerbation of copd bronchitis and even pneumonia kenyon said some have chest pain or other cardiac concerns but we have very little understanding of what happens over the longer term he said if people get two or three weeks of wildfire exposure for two or three years does that lead to worsening of asthma or copd we just don t know fires release multiple pollutants including carbon dioxide carbon monoxide and chemicals like benzene all fires send particles into the air health researchers and air quality experts are most concerned about tiny pieces referred to as particulate matter 2 5 far smaller than a human hair the particles can lodge deep in the lungs and have been linked to heart and lung conditions increases in those tiny particles are associated with a greater risk of death from all causes excluding accidents homicides and other non accidental causes for up to four days after a population is exposed according to a 2020 new england journal of medicine overview the concentration of fine particulate matter is one of five gauges used to calculate the air quality index a numerical and color coded index used to let the public know about local air pollution levels green denotes good air quality and is given if the total index is 50 or less when the measurement exceeds 100 the air quality gets an orange label and may be bad for certain groups levels over 200 get a red label and are considered unhealthy for everyone don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free government agencies track those levels as do people who use apps or websites to determine whether it s safe to go outside when the aqi rises above 150 dr farah madhani lovely a pulmonologist said renown regional medical center in reno shuts its outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation clinic because it doesn t want to encourage patients to drive in some patients from douglas county opt for care near home about an hour away we don t want these patients exposed outside because just one minute of exposure to the smoke can trigger an exacerbation of their chronic disease madhani lovely said smokey said connecting with pulmonologists can be difficult for washoe tribe members particularly those who live on the california side of the reservation we cannot find providers for them he said we end up referring them out and sending them hundreds of miles out of their way just to get care that we should be able to provide here recruiting specialists to rural areas or smaller cities has long been difficult for one thing a specialist might be the only one for miles around so there s a tremendous burden in terms of coverage and days off test said another concern is that physicians tend to train in larger cities and often want to practice in similar places even recruiting pulmonary physicians to lubbock a city of 260 000 in west texas is a challenge test said i love lubbock he said but i tell people who have never been here i say it s really flat they don t understand flat until they get here in nevada on days when the air quality is bad washoe tribal members try to protect themselves with makeshift air purifiers created from fans duct tape and air filters smokey said longer term smokey and other tribal leaders are pushing the indian health service to establish a specialty care hospital in northern nevada the closest specialty care hospital for washoe tribal members is more than 700 miles away in phoenix it s difficult because there s a need we should be

washington ap prices at the wholesale level rose 8 in october from a year ago the fourth straight decline and the latest sign that inflation pressures in the united states are easing from painfully high levels the annual figure is down from 8 4 in september on a monthly basis the government said tuesday that its producer price index which measures costs before they reach consumers rose 0 2 in october from september that was same as in the previous month which was revised down from an initial reading of 0 4 the figures came in lower than economists expected and make it more likely that the federal reserve will increase its benchmark interest rate in smaller increments it has hiked its short term rate by three quarters of a point for four meetings in a row but economists now increasingly foresee an increase of a half point at its december meeting the improvement in the october inflation data if it persists supports the fed s expectation of a step down in the pace of increases going forward said rubeela farooqi chief u s economist at high frequency economics a forecasting firm most of the monthly increase reflected higher gas prices at the wholesale level which rose 5 7 just in october the cost of new cars fell 1 5 last month which could lead to lower prices at the retail level as well excluding the volatile food and energy categories core producer prices were unchanged in october from september the lowest reading in nearly two years core prices increased 6 7 last month from a year ago down from a 7 1 annual rate in september the cost of services such as hotels air travel and health care slipped 0 1 in october from september the first drop since november 2020 the report follows last week s better known consumer price index which showed that year over year inflation cooled to a slower than expected 7 7 in october down from 8 2 in september and excluding volatile food and energy costs that report also said that core prices rose just 0 3 in october from the previous month half the increase of the previous two months those consumer inflation figures sent stock markets soaring because they suggested that the devastating price spikes of the past 18 months might finally be moderating the cost of used cars clothing and furniture fell a sign that goods prices are reversing their big price leaps of last year when supply chain blockages sent inflation soaring in recent months delays at major ports have been cleared the price of ocean shipping has tumbled and more stores are building larger stockpiles all those trends suggest that goods prices could continue to decline

recovery just as japan was adjusting to life with looser coronavirus restrictions analysts had predicted a modest expansion after japan s economy had jumped 4 6 revised up from an initial reading of 2 2 in the previous three month period returning it to its pre pandemic size but the results were weighed down by import prices that have surged as the yen has plummeted to its lowest levels against the dollar since 1990 a result of japan s decision to keep interest rates ultralow even as the united states raises them to combat inflation tuesday s reading also showed the headwinds that japan still faces from a global economy that is slowing even more than forecast because of russia s war in ukraine as well as from domestic inflation that is the highest in decades by some measures an omicron fueled surge in infections over the summer also dampened an acceleration in japan s consumer spending that began earlier in the year still the negative results may be short lived shinichiro kobayashi a principal economist at mitsubishi ufj research consulting said that the surprise reading was largely related to a rapid increase in prices for imported services among them advertising and that japan s economy was likely to return to growth in the next quarter for saisuke sakai the chief economist at mizuho research technologies there were also some positive signs in the data even as coronavirus infections spiked to record highs in august domestic spending had held up better than during previous waves a sign that the country was adapting to life with the virus he said but while covid 19 s domestic impact has shrunk other economic challenges have grown after decades without significant price increases japanese companies and households are having to reckon with inflation caused by the breakdown of global supply chains and rising food and energy costs caused by the ukraine war the price rises which were around 3 year over year in september are low compared with those in many other countries but they have come as a shock to japan which has long been accustomed to price stability adding to the pressure the yen like other asian currencies has fallen dramatically against the dollar over the past year compelling japanese authorities to intervene in currency markets in an effort to shore up its value economists say the fall can be attributed to the bank of japan s decision to keep interest rates low the difference in rates that has opened as the united states has repeatedly raised its own experts say has driven a sell off of the yen as investors pile into the dollar in search of higher returns the cheap yen has had some benefits for japanese exporters whose products are less expensive for customers abroad as well as for other japanese companies with large overseas earnings and investments but the pluses seem to have been outweighed by the stress put on domestic markets as businesses and consumers alike have had to pay more for imports whether raw materials or finished goods the yen s weakness has created record trade deficits for japan the value of imports surged nearly 45 in the first half of the fiscal year between april and september as the price of fuel skyrocketed exports by contrast rose just under 20 still stefan angrick a senior economist at moody s analytics described the trade side of tuesday s result as counterintuitively good news writing in a report that the pickup in imports in the third quarter reflects the fact that japan s belated covid 19 recovery is gaining traction as businesses and households return to spend the nikkei 225 index japan s benchmark for stocks was trading 0 2 higher in tokyo as of 1 p m looking ahead the picture is mixed despite the weak yen demand from abroad could well weaken in the face of china s continuing zero covid policies and a global economic slowdown exacerbated by interest rate increases by central banks trying to keep up with the federal reserve on the other hand japan s ongoing adjustment to pandemic life its reopening in october to tourism and a large government stimulus package meant to offset the effects of inflation are all likely to contribute to a modest continued recovery in domestic consumption which remains well below pre pandemic levels kobayashi said business investment also looks set to continue growing as japan pushes forward efforts to digitize its economy all told kobayashi said that means that despite the unexpected setback this quarter it s already certain that we will return to positive growth during the next three month period this article originally

subscription here amazon plans to lay off approximately 10 000 people in corporate and technology jobs starting as soon as this week people with knowledge of the matter said in what would be the largest job cuts in the company s history the cuts will focus on amazon s devices organization including the voice assistant alexa as well as at its retail division and in human resources said the people who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly the number of layoffs remains fluid and is likely to roll out team by team rather than all at once as each business finishes plans one person said but if it stays around 10 000 it would represent roughly 3 of amazon s corporate employees and less than 1 of its global workforce of more than 1 5 million which is primarily composed of hourly workers amazon s planned retrenchment during the critical holiday shopping season when the company typically has valued stability shows how quickly the souring global economy has put pressure on it to trim businesses that have been overstaffed or underdelivering for years amazon would also become the latest technology company to lay off workers which only recently it had been fighting to retain the e commerce giant more than doubled the cap on cash compensation for its tech workers this year citing a particularly competitive labor market changing business models and the precarious economy have set off layoffs across the tech industry elon musk halved twitter s head count this month after buying the company and last week meta the parent company of facebook and instagram announced it was laying off 11 000 employees about 13 of its workforce lyft stripe snap and other tech firms have also laid off workers in recent months brad glasser an amazon spokesperson declined to comment the pandemic produced amazon s most profitable era on record as consumers flocked to online shopping and companies to its cloud computing services amazon doubled its workforce in two years and funneled its winnings into expansion and experimentation to find the next big things but earlier this year amazon s growth slowed to the lowest rate in two decades as the bullwhip of the pandemic snapped the company faced high costs from decisions to overinvest and rapidly expand while changes in shopping habits and high inflation dented sales amazon experienced a slight rebound in its latest quarter but it has cautioned investors that growth could weaken again possibly falling to its lowest pace since 2001 the company has told wall street that it has tightened its belt in the past and can do so again amazon cut 1 500 jobs including hourly workers in 2001 during the dot com crash which amounted to 15 of its staff at the time it also laid off a few hundred corporate employees in early 2018 after another period of rapid expansion last week amazon executives met with institutional investors according to three people just as its stock sank to its lowest level since the early days of the pandemic erasing 1 trillion in value since andy jassy took over as ceo last year jassy who previously ran amazon s lucrative cloud computing business has been closely scrutinizing businesses to trim costs quickly he initially pulled back on a warehouse expansion that was supercharged during the pandemic then moved to other parts of the company in recent months amazon has also closed or pared back a smattering of initiatives including amazon care its service providing primary and urgent health care that failed to find enough customers scout the cooler size home delivery robot that employed 400 people according to bloomberg and fabric com a subsidiary that sold sewing supplies for three decades from april through september it reduced head count by almost 80 000 people primarily shrinking its hourly staff through high attrition amazon froze hiring in several smaller teams in september in october it stopped filling more than 10 000 open roles in its core retail business two weeks ago it froze corporate hiring across the company including its cloud computing division for the next few months that news came so suddenly that recruiters did not receive talking points for job candidates until almost a week later according to a copy of the talking points seen by the new york times john blackledge an analyst at cowen co who has covered amazon for a decade said his calculations showed amazon s core e commerce business had been losing billions this year they need to review everything he said this is just not sustainable devices and alexa have long been seen internally as at risk for cuts alexa and related devices rocketed to a top company priority as amazon raced to create the leading voice assistant which leaders thought could succeed mobile phones as the next essential consumer interface from 2017 to 2018 amazon doubled staff on alexa and echo devices to 10 000 engineers at one point any engineer getting a job offer for other amazon roles was supposed to also get an offer from alexa the company has sold hundreds of millions of alexa enabled devices but amazon has said the products are often low margin and other potential revenue sources such as voice shopping have not caught on in 2018 echo and alexa lost about 5 billion said a person with knowledge of the finances when amazon introduced new devices this fall in an annual event it was notably more restrained than past years when it had featured zany products such as a sticky note printer and 1 000 home robot amazon s retail business which covers its physical and online retail business and its logistics operations has been under strain after the surge of demand and breakneck expansion during the pandemic the company has said it pulled back expansion plans and has told investors it sees uncertainty with consumers we re realistic that there s various factors weighing on people s wallets brian olsavsky the finance chief told investors last month he said the company was unsure where spending was heading but we re ready for a variety of outcomes this article originally appeared in the new york times

hippos poached for their skin and teeth sharks targeted by the fin trade and a tiny frog with translucent skin are among the hundreds of species that could get greater protection at a united nations wildlife conference opening monday the 184 nation convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora or cites meeting over the next two weeks in panama will consider tightening trade regulations on around 600 plants and animals potentially at risk of extinction nine other species are recommended for less restrictive international trade regulations cites goal is to ensure that these wild species can survive in the wild for future generations secretary general ivonne higuero told the associated press the concern is that if we don t regulate that trade too much will be used too much will be traded and enter into commerce because it s highly valuable the international wildlife trade treaty which was adopted 49 years ago in washington d c has been praised for helping stem the illegal and unsustainable trade in ivory and rhino horns as well as in whales and sea turtles get san diego local news weather forecasts sports and lifestyle stories to your inbox sign up for nbc san diego newsletters the u s fish and wildlife service says it can not locate a trace of 23 species that were previously endangered including the ivory billed woodpecker and other pacific birds and bats 8 species of river mussels and some plants but it has come under fire for its limitations including its reliance on cash strapped developing countries to combat illegal trade that s become a lucrative 10 billion a year business millions of species are not listed under cites including according to one study more than a third of the online reptile trade domestic markets are beyond the reach of the treaty and some experts have complained cites listings often come after a species is too far gone the internet is fueling the illegal trade a wildlife conservation society investigation this month found that jaguar parts trade commercially banned under cites were widely available online still conservationists said cites remains the only available tool to ensure trade in plants and animals is done sustainably governments will list species that require permits bringing some level of transparency to the trade or if trade is putting a plant or animal at risk a listing will limit or outright ban it cites is working but it s only as good as its implementation by exporting countries transit countries importing countries said susan lieberman the vice president of international policy at wcs the treaty is excellent it s the only tool we have in the midst of a biodiversity crisis she continued we don t need to weaken it we need to strengthen cites and maybe even cover more species we also need to ensure whether through multilateral donors foundations whatever that there s more resources going to help countries who are challenged implementing cites fans of hippos found in more than three dozen african countries and regulars in nature documentaries are counting on the convention to ban commercial trade ten african countries have proposed banning trade in hippos hunted for their ivory teeth and more recently for their skin used in belts handbags and clothing the united states and france were the biggest importers of nearly 78 000 hippo parts between 2009 and 2018 according to the cites trade database with a majority coming from tanzania another 79 000 pounds 36 000 kilograms of hippo ivory went to hong kong and china for hunting trophies figurines and knife handles the concern is that hippos already suffering due to climate driven droughts and development cannot survive extensive poaching it s great when countries do things domestically try to take matters into their own hands to protect their own populations said tanya sanerib the international legal director at the center for biological diversity which in march joined with the humane society international in requesting that the u s fish and wildlife service list the hippos under the endangers species act but unless we have that sort of international collaboration which is what cites is designed to foster you have mixed signals being sent about what really is happening and whether a product is legal or illegal sanerib said so getting this commercial trade ban would be significant in terms of sending that signal loud and clear that ivory is off the table the proposal to ban the hippo trade is opposed by the european union some african countries and several conservation groups who argue many countries have healthy hippo populations and that trade isn t a factor in their decline sharks too are poised for increased protection global shark populations are declining with annual deaths due to fisheries reaching about 100 million the sharks are sought mostly for their fins which are used in shark fin soup a popular delicacy in china and elsewhere in asia conservation groups argue proposals at cites to list about 90 species including the family of requiem sharks would significantly limit the trade if approved the proposals would increase the portion of shark species in the fin trade covered by cites from around 25 to about 90 according to the wcs what is driving down shark populations is overfishing they have been slyly labeled bycatch when in reality they are targeted said philip chou senior director of global policy for the conservation group oceana there is a huge active trade and money to be made from the trade of shark meat and there has always been for their fins opposition is likely to come from japan and other east asian countries the hub of the global fin trade they argue the trade should be regulated by fisheries bodies turtles snakes glass frogs and lizards increasingly targeted by the pet and collector trade would get increased protection as would several timber species including african mahogany that have been decimated by illegal logging the united states association of reptile keepers which advocates for responsible private ownership and trade in reptiles and amphibians said in a statement that addressing reductions in wild populations by limiting captive breeding and legal trade is counterproductive there also are controversial proposals to ease the ban on the elephant ivory trade zimbabwe which has threatened to leave cites has pushed to allow sale of its ivory stocks and elephant skin and to use the money to manage its growing elephant population but conservation groups and the u s oppose easing the ivory ban enacted in 1989 most countries have domestic bans on elephant ivory markets and the fact that there are existing stockpiles out there of ivory is very troubling said the u s department of the interior s matthew strickler who will head the american delegation at cites you certainly don t want to see that product get on the market and kind of rekindle demand for more ivory which we all know leads to more and more poaching secretary general higuero said there is no appetite for opening the market for ivory sales but that the debate at cites could spark a larger conversation on how to help poor countries fund conservation efforts many of these countries she said are struggling to manage their elephant populations amid worsening drought and expanding ranges that are increasing elephant human conflict we all benefit from the existence of these animals she said therefore it s a global responsibility to ensure that these developing countries can meet their

investing in the stock market is one of the best ways to build wealth over the long term generally speaking stocks have outperformed other asset classes like bonds and real estate over the long term and equities have proven to be much less volatile than cryptocurrencies that makes the stock market one of the best tools you can use to build your wealth and diversified index funds are a particularly attractive option for many investors of course buying individual growth stocks can be far more rewarding but that strategy is also much more risky a broadly diversified index fund reduces your risk by spreading your investment dollars across a large number of companies in multiple different industries that said index funds can still generate big gains over time and even with steady investments grow into a million dollar portfolio which index fund is the best index funds come in all shapes and sizes but warren buffett has long been an advocate of low cost s p 500 index funds in his 2013 letter to berkshire hathaway shareholders buffett explained his logic the goal of the non professional should not be to pick winners neither he nor his helpers can do that but should rather be to own a cross section of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well a low cost s p 500 index fund will achieve this goal the s p 500 index tracks 500 of the largest public u s companies as such it includes a mix of value stocks and growth stocks and serves as a good barometer for the broader u s stock market and buffett we should note has advised investors to never bet against america the vanguard s p 500 etf voo 0 18 is one of many good options for investors looking to buy the index it has an expense ratio of just 0 03 so investors will pay just 3 per year in fees for every 10 000 worth of the etf they own how much money should you save experts often recommend that people save 15 of their income for retirement the median weekly income among full time workers was 1 070 in the third quarter according to the bureau of labor statistics that means the median worker should be saving 160 50 per week that s more than enough to build a million dollar portfolio provided you follow two important rules rule 1 make regular contributions to your s p 500 index fund pay no attention to the market s ups and downs buying shares whether the s p 500 is rising or falling helps balance out the impacts of market volatility and ensures that you pay an average price for your shares rule 2 plan to leave that money invested for decades generally speaking you should only sell these shares to meet important financial goals like purchasing a house or providing the funds you need to cover retirement expenses never try to time the stock market how long will it take to become a millionaire over the last three decades the s p 500 produced a total return of 1 620 or 9 93 on an annualized basis at that rate investing 150 each week would give a person a portfolio worth 1 million after just 28 years at that point the power of compound growth which would have contributed significantly already to your returns would become even more evident assuming the same rate of return your portfolio would be worth 2 million in 35 years and 3 million after 39 years of course the goal of saving 150 a week may be out of reach for some people that s ok you can build a million dollar portfolio by regularly investing smaller sums but it will take a little longer for instance 50 invested on a weekly basis would grow into 1 million in 39 years assuming an annual return of 9 93

hippos poached for their skin and teeth sharks targeted by the fin trade and a tiny frog with translucent skin are among the hundreds of species that could get greater protection at a united nations wildlife conference opening monday the 184 nation convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora or cites meeting over the next two weeks in panama will consider tightening trade regulations on around 600 plants and animals potentially at risk of extinction nine other species are recommended for less restrictive international trade regulations cites goal is to ensure that these wild species can survive in the wild for future generations secretary general ivonne higuero told the associated press the concern is that if we don t regulate that trade too much will be used too much will be traded and enter into commerce because it s highly valuable the international wildlife trade treaty which was adopted 49 years ago in washington d c has been praised for helping stem the illegal and unsustainable trade in ivory and rhino horns as well as in whales and sea turtles get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters the u s fish and wildlife service says it can not locate a trace of 23 species that were previously endangered including the ivory billed woodpecker and other pacific birds and bats 8 species of river mussels and some plants but it has come under fire for its limitations including its reliance on cash strapped developing countries to combat illegal trade that s become a lucrative 10 billion a year business millions of species are not listed under cites including according to one study more than a third of the online reptile trade domestic markets are beyond the reach of the treaty and some experts have complained cites listings often come after a species is too far gone the internet is fueling the illegal trade a wildlife conservation society investigation this month found that jaguar parts trade commercially banned under cites were widely available online still conservationists said cites remains the only available tool to ensure trade in plants and animals is done sustainably governments will list species that require permits bringing some level of transparency to the trade or if trade is putting a plant or animal at risk a listing will limit or outright ban it cites is working but it s only as good as its implementation by exporting countries transit countries importing countries said susan lieberman the vice president of international policy at wcs the treaty is excellent it s the only tool we have in the midst of a biodiversity crisis she continued we don t need to weaken it we need to strengthen cites and maybe even cover more species we also need to ensure whether through multilateral donors foundations whatever that there s more resources going to help countries who are challenged implementing cites fans of hippos found in more than three dozen african countries and regulars in nature documentaries are counting on the convention to ban commercial trade ten african countries have proposed banning trade in hippos hunted for their ivory teeth and more recently for their skin used in belts handbags and clothing the united states and france were the biggest importers of nearly 78 000 hippo parts between 2009 and 2018 according to the cites trade database with a majority coming from tanzania another 79 000 pounds 36 000 kilograms of hippo ivory went to hong kong and china for hunting trophies figurines and knife handles the concern is that hippos already suffering due to climate driven droughts and development cannot survive extensive poaching it s great when countries do things domestically try to take matters into their own hands to protect their own populations said tanya sanerib the international legal director at the center for biological diversity which in march joined with the humane society international in requesting that the u s fish and wildlife service list the hippos under the endangers species act but unless we have that sort of international collaboration which is what cites is designed to foster you have mixed signals being sent about what really is happening and whether a product is legal or illegal sanerib said so getting this commercial trade ban would be significant in terms of sending that signal loud and clear that ivory is off the table the proposal to ban the hippo trade is opposed by the european union some african countries and several conservation groups who argue many countries have healthy hippo populations and that trade isn t a factor in their decline sharks too are poised for increased protection global shark populations are declining with annual deaths due to fisheries reaching about 100 million the sharks are sought mostly for their fins which are used in shark fin soup a popular delicacy in china and elsewhere in asia conservation groups argue proposals at cites to list about 90 species including the family of requiem sharks would significantly limit the trade if approved the proposals would increase the portion of shark species in the fin trade covered by cites from around 25 to about 90 according to the wcs what is driving down shark populations is overfishing they have been slyly labeled bycatch when in reality they are targeted said philip chou senior director of global policy for the conservation group oceana there is a huge active trade and money to be made from the trade of shark meat and there has always been for their fins opposition is likely to come from japan and other east asian countries the hub of the global fin trade they argue the trade should be regulated by fisheries bodies turtles snakes glass frogs and lizards increasingly targeted by the pet and collector trade would get increased protection as would several timber species including african mahogany that have been decimated by illegal logging the united states association of reptile keepers which advocates for responsible private ownership and trade in reptiles and amphibians said in a statement that addressing reductions in wild populations by limiting captive breeding and legal trade is counterproductive there also are controversial proposals to ease the ban on the elephant ivory trade zimbabwe which has threatened to leave cites has pushed to allow sale of its ivory stocks and elephant skin and to use the money to manage its growing elephant population but conservation groups and the u s oppose easing the ivory ban enacted in 1989 most countries have domestic bans on elephant ivory markets and the fact that there are existing stockpiles out there of ivory is very troubling said the u s department of the interior s matthew strickler who will head the american delegation at cites you certainly don t want to see that product get on the market and kind of rekindle demand for more ivory which we all know leads to more and more poaching secretary general higuero said there is no appetite for opening the market for ivory sales but that the debate at cites could spark a larger conversation on how to help poor countries fund conservation efforts many of these countries she said are struggling to manage their elephant populations amid worsening drought and expanding ranges that are increasing elephant human conflict we all benefit from the existence of these animals she said therefore it s a global responsibility to ensure that these developing countries can meet their conservation costs ___ associated

health canada arranged to import doses from the united states and australia to address shortfall health canada officials say more doses of children s painkillers and fever medication will be available soon but they won t say how many or where exactly they ll be sent deputy minister stephen lucas and several other senior health canada officials with responsibility for pharmaceutical policy were summoned to the house of commons health committee tuesday to explain why canadian hospitals and nervous parents with sick kids at home are finding empty shelves where children s tylenol and advil are supposed to be the shortage began last spring but was exacerbated in the summer when an early appearance of influenza and rsv coincided with the ongoing covid 19 pandemic parents worried the medicines wouldn t be available when their kids needed them flocked to stores to stock up demand quadrupled chief medical adviser dr supriya sharma said manufacturers initially told the government in the spring they could address a tightening in supply by increasing production but by august they let health canada know that plan was failing after nearly two months of discussions between governments and manufacturers health canada arranged to import doses from the united states and australia the first u s shipment is already on the ground but frustration overflowed when ndp mp don davies asked at the committee meeting how many additional doses are coming in and where they are going linsey hollett the director of health product compliance for health canada said that s confidential unfortunately i m not able to share the exact quantities she said she said distribution is being prioritized for hospitals but wouldn t say which ones only that information provided by children s hospitals is being used to determine the need later on in the meeting hollett clarified that health canada was trying to convince the manufacturers to make the information public and hoped that would happen soon davies was incensed and conservative mp stephen ellis called the secrecy unconscionable to little avail mps and officials meandered for an hour around questions about when the shortage began who is to blame and why it happened lucas repeatedly told mps that drug shortages are not unusual are often dealt with before anyone in the public realizes there is a problem and are not unique to canada bloc québécois mp jean denis garon asked him to name even one other country where politicians have had to demand health officials come to committee to explain why kids can t get medicine to bring down their fever lucas said it s true that this particular shortage is worst in canada but he said there are acetaminophen shortages elsewhere including in france germany and ireland at the end of october france limited the purchase of acetaminophen known in france more commonly as paracetamol to two boxes per customer amid a shortage both ireland and germany are warning there are hundreds of drugs in short supply including kids fever medications the german pharmacists association said in mid september that china s ongoing covid 19 lockdowns were affecting port exports and that the heavy reliance on china and other asian countries to make the active ingredients in drugs such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen meant that global supply chain issues were having an impact lucas acknowledged that supply chain woes are contributing to drug shortages hollett said there are currently shortages of as many as 800 drugs in canada but she said most are not critical shortages there are 23 drugs on the government s tier 3 list of critical shortages that pose significant risk to patients and the health care system the designation requires the government to assemble a committee to investigate the problem and potential solutions neither acetaminophen nor ibuprofen are on the list which is published on the government s website mia rabson the canadian press
financial advisors and broker dealers saw record fines from securities and exchange commission investigations in the 2022 fiscal year the sec reported on nov 15 that its investigations resulted in orders to pay nearly 6 5 billion the most in the agency s history in fiscal year 2022 which ran from oct 1 2021 to sept 30 this year those orders arose from 760 enforcement actions a number up by 9 from the previous fiscal year but the total penalties increased more than 50 the sec s investigations targeted everything from large institutions such as goldman sachs morgan stanley and bank of america to individual advisors and broker dealers in one case cited by the sec investment advisor scott adam brander of the little silver new jersey based firm buckman advisory group agreed on sept 13 to a settlement of nearly 1 2 million for an alleged cherry picking scheme that saw gains from profitable trades steered into brander s own accounts rather than his clients the sec alleged that brander obtained more than 800 000 in ill gotten gains in part by disproportionately allocating losses from his securities trades to clients while keeping the profits for himself buckman advisory group agreed to a settlement of 400 000 in the same case and brander s former supervisor henry buckman agreed to a settlement of 75 000 a representative of buckman advisory group declined to comment another case cited by the sec involves the first charges the agency has brought against a broker dealer for violations of regulation best interest adopted on june 30 2020 the rule generally requires brokers to act in the best interests of clients but stops short of barring all conflicts of interest a case brought by the sec in june charged pasadena california based western international securities and five of its registered representatives with violating regulation best interest for recommending and selling 13 3 million worth of unrated security known as l bonds to retirees and other retail investors among other things the sec charged that western international recommended the bonds to seven investors without having reason to believe the securities were in those clients best interests western international securities couldn t immediately be reached for comment in yet another case ubs financial services agreed to pay roughly 25 million to settle charges for failing to provide adequate training and oversight to 600 domestic advisors who sold a complex so called yield enhancement strategy to clients from february 2016 to february 2017 as a result the sec alleged neither the advisors nor the clients fully understood the risks of the strategy which involves using stock options to give returns a boost at times when the market is stable ubs is pleased to have amicably resolved this matter related to training provided between february 2016 and february 2017 for an options overlay strategy ubs said in a statement ubs appreciates the sec s acknowledgment that in early 2017 ubs voluntarily remediated the issue by enhancing its risk control framework and strengthening its training program for the strategy securities attorney bill singer a former regulator who writes the broke and broker blog said the sec s results would be more impressive if they resulted more from disputes brought to court rather than a string of settlements as it is singer only counts 15 cases in which the sec pressed its charges at trial singer added that settlements are too often cynically viewed by wall street firms and other institutions as a cost of doing business that s especially true since most deals reached with the sec don t require the defendant to admit or deny anything and the monetary penalty the sec imposes are coming from the shareholders and not coming out of the pockets of the people in the c suites who are doing all the fraud singer said the sec has proposed a rule that would allow companies to claw back bonuses paid to executives if the money was found to be paid as a result of an accounting error many times executives are able to receive bonuses only if their companies hit certain performance goals the sec s proposal which is still under review would require executives to pay back the money when accounting misstatements made it appear as though performance goals had been reached when they in fact had not singer said such a rule will be good but is long overdue besides actions against advisors and brokers the sec s report called attention to its record auditing firm fine of 100 million against ernst young for auditing professionals cheating on ethic examinations crackdowns on boeing company and other firms for misleading financial disclosures work to prevent abuses by lenders of cryptocurrency and awards to whistleblowers who helped it discover wrongdoing the sec s orders of 6 5 billion worth of penalties against companies in fiscal year 2022 was up from 3 85 billion in the previous fiscal year the 2022 total was made up partly of 4 2 billion worth of civil penalties and 2 2 billion of disgorgement payments or the return of ill gotten gains the sec s 760 enforcement actions consisted of 462 new actions 129 actions against issuers alleged to be delinquent in making required filing and 169 follow on proceedings coming in response to criminal convictions civil injunctions or other orders gurbir grewal director of the sec s division of enforcement said in a statement that the numbers show the sec feels a sense of urgency with its duty to to protect investors hold wrongdoers accountable and deter future misconduct in our financial markets a centerpiece of those efforts he added is ensuring that we are using every tool in our toolkit including penalties that have a deterrent effect and are viewed as more than the cost of doing business
this issue scares me i don t view it as a totally phony issue like abortion and it actually works for the demopoops but the thing that makes the issue difficult is not complicated it s the law that disallows bankruptcy proceedings to abolish student loan debt in all cases here is the law we need after a person has paid as much as the principle of such a loan in constant dollars it should be legal to eliminate the rest of the loan via bankruptcy in other words we outlawed slavery in 1865 it is way past time that bankers got

wilmington del the head of tesla s board of directors testified tuesday in a shareholder lawsuit challenging a 2018 compensation plan for ceo elon musk potentially worth more than 55 billion that she was less concerned about how much time musk would commit to the company than in the results he could bring we didn t talk about time robyn denholm said when asked about her discussions with musk about the compensation plan which didn t include any requirement on how much time he would devote to the company as opposed to his other business ventures he was focused on achieving results not on any quantum of time he would need to spend denholm said she adding that she doesn t know how many hours musk who last month took over twitter after paying 44 billion for the social media platform devotes to tesla i m not concerned about time added denholm who was a member of the compensation committee at the electric car and solar panel maker that developed the plan i know periods of time where he is sleeping on the factory floor the lawsuit alleges that the performance based stock option grant was negotiated by the compensation committee and approved by tesla board members who had conflicts interest due to personal and professional ties to musk including investments in his companies it also alleges the shareholder vote approving the compensation plan was based on a misleading proxy statement the lawsuit alleges that the proxy wrongly described members of the compensation committee as independent and characterized all of the milestones that triggered vesting in the stock options as stretch goals meant to be difficult to achieve even though internal projections indicated that three operational milestones were likely to be achieved within 18 months of the stockholder vote attorneys for the defendants have noted that two institutional proxy advising firms that urged shareholders to reject the plan nevertheless noted that it would require significant and perhaps historic achievements and require growth that appear stretching by any benchmark i thought they at the time were quite audacious denholm said of the milestones the plan called for musk to reap billions if tesla hit certain market capitalization and operational milestones for each incidence of simultaneously meeting a market cap milestone and an operational milestone musk who owned about 22 of tesla when the plan was approved would get stock equal to 1 of outstanding shares at the time of the grant his interest in the company would grow to about 28 if the company s market capitalization grew by 600 billion each milestone in the plan includes growing tesla s market capitalization by 50 billion and meeting aggressive revenue and pretax profit growth targets musk would receive the full benefit of the pay plan 55 8 billion only if tesla hit a market capitalization of 650 billion and unprecedented revenue and earnings within a decade to date tesla has achieved all 12 of the market capitalization milestones and 11 operational milestones resulting in the vesting of 11 of the grant s 12 tranches and providing musk over 52 4 billion in stock option gains according to the lawsuit since the grant was awarded tesla s market capitalization has increased from 59 billion to more than 613 billion now having briefly hit 1 trillion early this year musk has sold tesla stock to finance the twitter purchase adding downward pressure on the shares shares of tesla and other automakers have been battered this year but the austin texas company earned 5 5 billion in 2021 blowing away the previous year s profit of 721 million it also produced a record 936 000 vehicles nearly double vehicle production in 2020 attorneys for the plaintiff have suggested that incentivizing musk to remain at tesla s helm by offering a huge compensation package was unnecessary because he s never suggested that he might leave they ve also suggested that musk s true motive in negotiating the package was to fund his dream to colonize mars denholm said the primary issue was not how musk might spend the proceeds of his option grants but ensuring that he was motivated and committed to tesla s success quite honestly i don t know how much it costs to do any interplanetary travel she said in a november 2017 email to former tesla general counsel todd maron musk expressed optimism that the compensation package would be seen in a favorable light given that this will all go to causes that at least aspirationally maximize the probability of a good future for humanity plus all tesla shareholders will be super happy i think this will be received well he wrote adding that it should come across as an ultra bullish view of the future

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of

s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please carefully review the methodologies employed in the vanguard whitepaper to receive a copy of the whitepaper please contact compliance smartasset com the value of professional investment advice is only

million for the three months ended september 30 2021 q3 2021 the result of a 10 3 million year over year decrease in tattooed chef branded products private label and other revenues increased 27 4 or 6 4 million year over year driven by revenue contributions from our acquisitions of bci acquisition and various new mexico entities and assets the decline in branded product sales was driven by a 15 0 million decline in a tier 1 club and retail account and a 6 2 million increase in trade or contra revenue related expenses trade revenue included a 1 2 million increase in slotting fees as we focused on expanding tattooed chef branded products into additional retail stores across the country partially offsetting the impacts of this tier 1 account and step up in slotting fees branded product sales

2021 this increase was driven primarily by continued inflationary pressures pushing labor and freight to 34 1 of net revenue from 24 9 of net revenue in q3 2021 these cost impacts were compounded by

was 3 9 million or 7 2 as compared to gross profit of 5 0 million or 8 6 in q3 2021 the declines in gross profit and gross margin were due to lower revenues and the above referenced increase in costs of goods sold notably labor and freight operating expenses increased to 31 6 million from 12 8 million in q3 2021 the increase is primarily due to a 7 0 million increase in stock based compensation driven by shares issued under the company s equity incentive plan a 4 6 million increase marketing and advertising expenses a 2 5 million increase in outside services expense a 2 0 million increase in payroll related expenses and a 0 7 million increase in facility expenses net loss was 38 5 million or 0 46 per share compared to a net loss of 8 2 million or 0 10 per share in q3 2021 adjusted ebitda

states gaap however management believes that certain non gaap financial measures provide users of our financial information with additional useful information in evaluating our performance we believe that adjusted ebitda is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies and that this supplemental measure facilitates comparisons between companies this non gaap financial measure may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies our non gaap financial measure should not be considered in isolation from or as substitutes for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs adjusted ebitda does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity based compensation adjusted ebitda does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us adjusted ebitda does not reflect certain non routine items that may represent a reduction in cash available to us and other companies including companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure we compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to the most comparable gaap measure we encourage investors and others to review our business results of operations and financial information in their entirety not to rely on any single financial measure and to view this non gaap measure in conjunction with the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for more information on these non gaap financial measure please see the

montreal nov 15 2022 globe newswire osisko development corporation osisko development or the company is pleased to announce drilling results from the 2022 exploration and category conversion drill campaign at its 100 owned cariboo gold project cariboo located in central british columbia activities summary 6 500 meters of total infill drilling conducted in 2022 at the lowhee zone within cariboo 27 holes drilled at the lowhee zone at closely spaced 12 5 meter intervals within the area proposed for the cariboo bulk sample the bulk sample and other nearby high priority areas refer to figures 1 to 3 and other nearby high priority areas refer to figures 1 to 3 10 000 tonnes of mineralized material available and targeted for the bulk sample which is fully permitted and benefits from a fully constructed portal figure 4 which was excavated with the company s roadheader the objective of the bulk sample would be to demonstrate the effectiveness of the company s newly constructed facility for sorting mineralized material ore sorting facility which has been designed to seek to meaningfully increase head grade by pre concentrating material and separating barren from mineralized material which if proven could significantly reduce processing costs energy costs and the overall environmental impact footprint figure 5 assay highlights final assay results of the drill campaign include holes bm 22 001 to bm 22 027 detailed interval drill results and a drill hole location plan map are presented in table 1 and 2 respectively at the end of this news release selected assay highlights

facility update the bulk sample which is fully permitted for 2 200 meters of development is planned to be conducted at the lowhee zone within cariboo the lowhee deposit hosts indicated mineral resources totaling 188 000 ounces of gold oz au 1 60 million tonnes grading 3 6 g t au and inferred mineral resources totaling 59 000 oz au 0 52 million tonnes grading 3 5 g t au for further information please see the company s news release dated may 24 2022 and the cariboo technical report as defined herein the cariboo technical report includes statements in relation to mineral resources mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability it is intended that 10 000 tonnes of mineralized material will be extracted for the bulk sample from the lowhee zone using a completed portal allowing mining access the company then intends to process the mineralized material through its ore sorting facility which is designed to separate the sandstone unmineralized waste from the gold associated pyrite quartz veins based on density figure 5 is an infographic illustrating the ore sorting process and click below for a video on the ore sorter also on the company website the ore sorting facility employs low cost durable and energy efficient technology that has been used for decades in numerous industrial applications including in recycling and food waste sectors the company has already conducted testing on more than 5 tonnes of material including from the lowhee zone which has demonstrated that the mineralogy at the cariboo gold project is well suited to this sorting technology the testing conducted to date has resulted in recoveries of gold averaging an estimated 93 9 and a separation of 57 4 of the waste material in simple terms the technology could if proven be expected to significantly increase the grade of the material to the mill and substantially reduce the volume of material processed to simultaneously increase grade while reducing costs sean roosen ceo of osisko development commented it is sometimes difficult to communicate to the market the effectiveness of the ore sorting technology being implemented at the cariboo gold project based on the results to date which we hope to further validate by our bulk sample once conducted we could potentially remove over 50 of our waste material at minimal cost to focus our processing efforts on the mineralized material in the high grade veins the reason why cariboo is so conducive to this technology is because the resource is comprised of two very different types of rock sandstone which does not contain gold is low density whereas our gold is contained uniquely within pyrite hosted in quartz veins which is very high density the simplest analogy i ve been able to come up with so far is that our rock is like a chocolate chip cookie and all we want are the chocolate chips once we crumble the cookies the ore sorter takes care of separating the chocolate chips from the crumbled cookie a visual video representation of the ore sorter technology may be viewed here or by accessing the following link vein corridors vein corridors of the cariboo gold project mineral resource are defined as a high density network of mineralized quartz veins hosted within unmineralized sandstone individual mineralized veins within these corridors have widths varying from centimeters to several meters and strike lengths from a few meters to over 50 meters these corridors have been defined from surface to a vertical depth averaging 300 meters and remain open for expansion at depth and along strike gold grades are intimately associated with quartz vein hosted pyrite as well as pyritic intensely silicified wall rock haloes in close proximity to the veins figure

hippos poached for their skin and teeth sharks targeted by the fin trade and a tiny frog with translucent skin are among the hundreds of species that could get greater protection at a united nations wildlife conference opening monday the 184 nation convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora or cites meeting over the next two weeks in panama will consider tightening trade regulations on around 600 plants and animals potentially at risk of extinction nine other species are recommended for less restrictive international trade regulations cites goal is to ensure that these wild species can survive in the wild for future generations secretary general ivonne higuero told the associated press the concern is that if we don t regulate that trade too much will be used too much will be traded and enter into commerce because it s highly valuable the international wildlife trade treaty which was adopted 49 years ago in washington d c has been praised for helping stem the illegal and unsustainable trade in ivory and rhino horns as well as in whales and sea turtles feeling out of the loop we ll catch you up on the chicago news you need to know sign up for the weekly chicago catch up newsletter here the u s fish and wildlife service says it can not locate a trace of 23 species that were previously endangered including the ivory billed woodpecker and other pacific birds and bats 8 species of river mussels and some plants but it has come under fire for its limitations including its reliance on cash strapped developing countries to combat illegal trade that s become a lucrative 10 billion a year business millions of species are not listed under cites including according to one study more than a third of the online reptile trade domestic markets are beyond the reach of the treaty and some experts have complained cites listings often come after a species is too far gone the internet is fueling the illegal trade a wildlife conservation society investigation this month found that jaguar parts trade commercially banned under cites were widely available online still conservationists said cites remains the only available tool to ensure trade in plants and animals is done sustainably governments will list species that require permits bringing some level of transparency to the trade or if trade is putting a plant or animal at risk a listing will limit or outright ban it cites is working but it s only as good as its implementation by exporting countries transit countries importing countries said susan lieberman the vice president of international policy at wcs the treaty is excellent it s the only tool we have in the midst of a biodiversity crisis she continued we don t need to weaken it we need to strengthen cites and maybe even cover more species we also need to ensure whether through multilateral donors foundations whatever that there s more resources going to help countries who are challenged implementing cites fans of hippos found in more than three dozen african countries and regulars in nature documentaries are counting on the convention to ban commercial trade ten african countries have proposed banning trade in hippos hunted for their ivory teeth and more recently for their skin used in belts handbags and clothing the united states and france were the biggest importers of nearly 78 000 hippo parts between 2009 and 2018 according to the cites trade database with a majority coming from tanzania another 79 000 pounds 36 000 kilograms of hippo ivory went to hong kong and china for hunting trophies figurines and knife handles the concern is that hippos already suffering due to climate driven droughts and development cannot survive extensive poaching it s great when countries do things domestically try to take matters into their own hands to protect their own populations said tanya sanerib the international legal director at the center for biological diversity which in march joined with the humane society international in requesting that the u s fish and wildlife service list the hippos under the endangers species act but unless we have that sort of international collaboration which is what cites is designed to foster you have mixed signals being sent about what really is happening and whether a product is legal or illegal sanerib said so getting this commercial trade ban would be significant in terms of sending that signal loud and clear that ivory is off the table the proposal to ban the hippo trade is opposed by the european union some african countries and several conservation groups who argue many countries have healthy hippo populations and that trade isn t a factor in their decline sharks too are poised for increased protection global shark populations are declining with annual deaths due to fisheries reaching about 100 million the sharks are sought mostly for their fins which are used in shark fin soup a popular delicacy in china and elsewhere in asia conservation groups argue proposals at cites to list about 90 species including the family of requiem sharks would significantly limit the trade if approved the proposals would increase the portion of shark species in the fin trade covered by cites from around 25 to about 90 according to the wcs what is driving down shark populations is overfishing they have been slyly labeled bycatch when in reality they are targeted said philip chou senior director of global policy for the conservation group oceana there is a huge active trade and money to be made from the trade of shark meat and there has always been for their fins opposition is likely to come from japan and other east asian countries the hub of the global fin trade they argue the trade should be regulated by fisheries bodies turtles snakes glass frogs and lizards increasingly targeted by the pet and collector trade would get increased protection as would several timber species including african mahogany that have been decimated by illegal logging the united states association of reptile keepers which advocates for responsible private ownership and trade in reptiles and amphibians said in a statement that addressing reductions in wild populations by limiting captive breeding and legal trade is counterproductive there also are controversial proposals to ease the ban on the elephant ivory trade zimbabwe which has threatened to leave cites has pushed to allow sale of its ivory stocks and elephant skin and to use the money to manage its growing elephant population but conservation groups and the u s oppose easing the ivory ban enacted in 1989 most countries have domestic bans on elephant ivory markets and the fact that there are existing stockpiles out there of ivory is very troubling said the u s department of the interior s matthew strickler who will head the american delegation at cites you certainly don t want to see that product get on the market and kind of rekindle demand for more ivory which we all know leads to more and more poaching secretary general higuero said there is no appetite for opening the market for ivory sales but that the debate at cites could spark a larger conversation on how to help poor countries fund conservation efforts many of these countries she said are struggling to manage their elephant populations amid worsening drought and expanding ranges that are increasing elephant human conflict we all benefit from the existence of these animals she said therefore it s a global responsibility to ensure that these developing countries can meet their

management founder ken fisher believes the federal reserve s actions will not help control inflation but also stressed that the u s economy is unlikely to plunge into recession given that loan growth is robust he told fox business on november 3 i don t believe what the fed is doing right now actually kills inflation i don t believe as i have said before that the fed can kneecap the economy by raising rates the way it is because right now the banks loan base cost them almost nothing when the fed raises short rates it increases the incentive for banks to make short term loans because the spread gets bigger ken fisher recently pointed out some positive fundamentals that investors might be missing due to the uncertainty and short term headwinds blanketing the stock market currently in

about meta platforms inc nasdaq meta in its q3 2022 investor letter meta platforms inc nasdaq meta one of two overweights among the mega cap stocks underperformed in the third quarter 15 9 and is the strategy s largest detractor year to date meta has also trailed mega cap advertising peer alphabet which we don t own as revenue growth has slowed due to tough comparables to a strong e commerce environment in early 2021 negative impacts from apple s privacy changes and rising expenses while we have trimmed our position close to 20 we remain invested as we do not think the stocks valuation at about 13x consensus 2023 earnings appropriately reflects its long term earnings and free cash flow generation potential despite current revenue headwinds we believe meta is well positioned to navigate industry wide changes to advertising targeting and its transition to the reels short form video format will monetize in the coming years helping to re accelerate revenue growth we also welcome meta s implementation of cost cutting measures which should help uncover the company s high underlying profitability lastly we see meta s investments in augmented reality as a call option for long duration

growth driven by a combination of factors including pull forward of enterprise digitization demand during covid 19 some operational missteps and lengthening sales cycles we believe the company still
