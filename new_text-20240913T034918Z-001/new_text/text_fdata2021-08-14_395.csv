we are pleased to have closed the south america agriculture business sale enabling us to significantly lower our outstanding debt levels reduce our working capital requirements and increase our liquidity with renewed balance sheet flexibility we remain focused on fully leveraging our advantaged asset base and expanding our essential minerals business to maximize shareholder value last month we announced that we have identified an approximately 2 4 million metric ton sustainable lithium resource and are evaluating multiple paths forward for this exciting resource second quarter 2021 consolidated revenue grew 14 compared to the prior year period driven primarily by an increase in highway deicing sales volumes of 19 and an 11 improvement in consumer and industrial sales volumes operating earnings for second quarter 2021 decreased 8 8 million while adjusted ebitda was lower by 8 9 million both compared to the prior year period and primarily due to higher salt segment shipping and handling expense as well as higher unit costs in the company s plant nutrition segment attributable to sop feedstock inconsistencies the company continues to believe these sop feedstock quality challenges are short term and has implemented proactive measures to address the situation salt segment summary second quarter 2021 salt segment revenue grew 17 to 142 6 million compared to the same period a year ago driven by a 19 increase in sales volumes in both u s and u k highway deicing products the company experienced more typical customer demand for its non deicing products with higher consumer and industrial c i sales volumes as compared to the prior year period when sales were impacted by the covid 19 pandemic salt segment average selling prices benefited from a 5 increase in c i average sales prices compared to the same period in the prior year due to broad based price increases across all product categories this was offset by a 1 decline in year over year highway deicing

36 8 million salt segment operating margin was 13 in the second quarter of 2021 down from 18 in the prior year and ebitda margin decreased to 26 from 33 primarily due to higher inflation related per unit shipping and handling costs as well as higher per unit costs for c i products these c i product cost pressures are continuously monitored and the company plans to dynamically adjust its pricing as necessary bid season update approximately 80 of the company s north american highway deicing bidding process for the 2021 2022 winter season has been completed given bid results awarded to date the

period results sales volumes remained relatively unchanged compared to the prior year period and average selling prices increased approximately 6 compared to second quarter 2020 results second quarter operating earnings declined 5 6 million from the second quarter of 2020 to 0 7 million primarily due to higher per unit operating costs while ebitda totaled 9 8 million compared to 15 9 million in the prior year period second quarter 2021 operating margin was 1 compared to 12 in the prior year and ebitda margins were 18 compared to 31 in the prior year both driven primarily by the previously

exchange of 4 4 million in the prior year quarter interest expense decreased 0 4 million from second quarter 2020 levels to 15 0 million due to lower weighted average interest rates and lower debt levels subsequent to the end of second quarter 2021 the company reduced its outstanding borrowings by approximately 400 million including from discontinued operations which is expected to result in lower interest expense going forward tax expense for the quarter increased 4 4 million from the prior year as the company s change in fiscal year end compresses the tax provision calculation period

s other sec filings the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements made in this press release to reflect future events or developments except as required by law because it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors this list cannot be considered a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties the company has completed an initial assessment to define the lithium resource at compass minerals existing operations in accordance with applicable sec regulations including subpart 1300 pursuant to subpart 1300 mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability the company s mineral resource estimates including estimates of the lithium resource are based on many factors including assumptions regarding extraction rates and duration of mining operations and the quality of in place resources for example the process technology for commercial extraction of lithium from brines with low lithium and high impurity primarily magnesium is still developing accordingly there is no certainty that all or any part of the lithium mineral resource identified by the company s initial assessment will be converted into an economically extractable mineral reserve non gaap measures in addition to using u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial measures management uses a variety of non gaap financial measures described below to evaluate the company s and its operating segments performance while the consolidated financial statements provide an understanding of the company s overall results of operations financial condition and cash flows management analyzes components of the consolidated financial statements to identify certain trends and evaluate specific performance areas management uses ebitda ebitda adjusted for items which management believes are not indicative of the company s ongoing operating performance adjusted ebitda and ebitda margin to evaluate the operating performance of the company s core business operations because its resource allocation financing methods and cost of capital and income tax positions are managed at a corporate level apart from the activities of the operating segments and the operating facilities are located in different taxing jurisdictions which can cause considerable variation in net earnings the company also uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda to assess its overall and operating segment operating performance and return on capital against other companies and to evaluate potential acquisitions or other capital projects ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not calculated under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings operating earnings cash flows or other financial data prepared in accordance with gaap or as a measure of overall profitability or liquidity ebitda and adjusted ebitda exclude interest expense income taxes and depreciation and amortization each of which are an essential element of the company s cost structure and cannot be eliminated in addition adjusted ebitda excludes stock based compensation consequently any measure that excludes these elements has material limitations while ebitda and adjusted ebitda are frequently used as measures of operating performance these terms are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation the calculation of ebitda adjusted ebitda and ebitda margin as used by management is set forth in the following tables all

publishers have long offered books for crafters at all levels from absolute beginners to professionals looking to hone their skills increasingly though craft books have begun to embrace other types of diversity among practitioners too with authors models and patterns that reflect people of different sizes ethnicities and abilities taken together the array of titles planned for the next several months send a message all are welcome crafting as community printmaker and textile artist jen hewett is the author of 2018 s print pattern sew an alluring how to guide per pw she s also among the crafters of color who in early 2019 took to social media to share experiences of feeling either ignored or unseen by the larger crafting community or willfully excluded from the narratives of who participates in craft she says a blog post by a prominent white owner of a knitting company had sparked the outpouring but the conversation was not a new one i knew from my own experience that we engage in these crafts at the same levels as our white peers and statistics support this hewett says even if the public faces of the crafting community typically white women do not beyond participating in the conversation on instagram i wanted to write a book that shared the stories of a relatively broad swath of people of color who are actively engaged in fiber arts and crafts hewett notes i sent out a survey interviewed people and commissioned a few essays her efforts manifest in this long thread roost nov which profiles a selection of the nearly 300 women and nonbinary people of color who responded to her survey and includes interviews with and essays by a variety of crafters the fiber arts and crafts community is that much richer when there is space for our voices hewett writes in the introduction not as window dressing but as an important and integral part of this community the auntie sewing squad guide to mask making radical care and racial justice univ of california nov also highlights community connections documenting the efforts of a mutual aid group made up largely of women of color who came together on social media at the start of the pandemic to make cloth masks for people in vulnerable populations as performance artist kristina wong who founded the group writes in the preface every vendor in the country ran out of elastic and fabric and factory made masks were out of stock for weeks i was like robinson crusoe and my desert island was my home in koreatown los angeles waving down every hobbyist seamstress on facebook for leads on where to find elastic among the aunties who range in age from eight to 93 and who to date have sewed and distributed hundreds of thousands of masks are university professors mai linh k hong chrissy yee lau and preeti sharma we originally teamed up to put together an academic panel on the auntie sewing squad at the association for asian american studies conference they wrote in a joint email to pw then wong approached them to edit the book and they set about gathering essays illustrations photos patterns and recipes from squad members across the country the trio wanted the project to be auntie driven centering aunties voices stories and creativity they explained auntie sewing squad has taught us so much about how the traditions of mutual aid and care pair up with crafting the idea of banding together based on a shared experience or common goal drives the sewing guide to cancer or other very annoying long term illnesses which craft publisher lucky spool will release in october heather grant manager of education programs at bernina of america a sewing and quilting machine manufacturer compiled projects from some two dozen contributors for useful gifts for those getting intensive medical treatment such as an infusion bag or seatbelt cover when you re undergoing a major illness your community comes together to support you says grant who was diagnosed with cancer in 2013 and had a recurrence in 2018 she and lucky spool founder susanne woods who received her first cancer diagnosis in 2016 discussed creating a craft book based on their experiences woods died in 2020 and grant saw the project to fruition the things we faced were applicable to people with crohn s ms fibromyalgia and other long term diseases grant says explaining that in samarra khaja s illustrations for the book you can t always tell the sex or the gender or the race or even what treatment of what they re going through we did that so it would be more inclusive sewing is for every body part of making a project or community inclusive is making the invitation to join explicit it s easy for people with a lot of privilege to say we were never excluding them says lydia rogue publicity manager and editorial associate at microcosm i think we re moving from not actively excluding you and into no this is for you too one example rogue says is kate weiss s radical sewing pubbing in october and intended for sewists of any gender level of experience and body type weiss a pattern maker and sewing instructor walks newbie sewists through techniques aimed at making their clothing work for them adding pockets taking in seams and letting them out sewing darts and more she also rogue notes includes a section on clothing modifications for wheelchair users an atypical topic for a sewing book in the act of sewing which roost published this past spring sonya philip one of the crafters that hewett interviews in this long thread offers four basic patterns trousers a skirt and two tops in sizes xs to 5x and explains how to make alterations and modifications add embellishments and combine the patterns to create for instance a dress or jumpsuit several photos show the author who favors strong colors and bold patterns modeling her designs making clothes philip explains in the book means that we get to create what we want instead of relying on the ever changing tastes of fashion designers retailers and trendsetters philip s goal is to help readers take back control says emily coughlin associate editor at shambhala who saw the book to print after jenn brown acquired it every body is created differently and grows or shrinks in different ways harriet butt senior commissioning editor at quadrille has noticed a push for body positive books as opposed to titles that say you shouldn t wear this color or you shouldn t wear a v neck in ahead of the curve coming in october from quadrille jenny rushmore offers patterns for two dresses two tops and pants and teaches sewists to adjust the patterns to their particular measurements we wanted this book to give you confidence and to make you feel empowered and to celebrate your body butt says rushmore

as requirements for vaccinations or negative covid tests begin to pop up so do fake vaccination cards much like underage teenagers who might score a fake id to get into their local college bar for a drink there are unvaccinated people who are looking to get fake vaccination cards as you would expect with the demand for fake vaccination cards some folks are looking to capitalize on the opportunity to supply them a father and son recently made headlines after they were arrested for attempting to use a fake covid 19 card to travel many states are forming covid 19 task forces to monitor for similar violations and warning the public of the consequences that can come with using or creative fake vaccination cards so far new orleans is the only city requiring vaccination cards or recent negative tests for entry into bars restaurants and other indoor venues in the city the new requirement begins on monday and officials believe it will only increase the temptation for those against the vaccine to seek out fake cards louisiana residents can use the la wallet app to verify their vaccination status outside of that there are no other databases that currently track vaccinations so it pretty much boils down to having the card this means that anyone with decent photoshop skills and the right card stock could craft a vaccination card without much fuss there have been numerous reports of people already charging between 25 to 200 for fake vaccination cards while it may be easy to make or purchase a fake card the risks are nowhere close to the reward especially since legit cards are technically free legal analysts have appeared on multiple news outlets to let people know that fake vaccine cards can constitute a federal crime and land you in prison for up to five years you may be thinking look i m not gonna make the card i m just buying it off the internet i m gonna use it so my kid can go to school i can go back to work i can get into a restaurant or some other public place because the law punishes the person who makes the card who sells the card but also anyone who takes that card knowing it s false knowing it s a fake and uses it for almost any other purpose page pate also says that federal statutes in 18 u s code 1017 make it a crime to use official u s government logos on any certificate instrument commission document or paper with wrongful or fraudulent intent if somebody makes a card like that and uses one of those symbols it can be the department of health and human services the cdc if they put those symbols on a card without proper authorization then they have committed a federal crime and it carries up to five years in prison and that would just be the beginning of your legal headache things like felony forgery could also land you into the type of federal hot waters that would have you dealing with the fbi earlier today someone got popped trying to ship thousands of cards to new orleans in the wake of the news that vaccination cards would be required starting next week in addition to looking out for those manufacturing or using fake cards authorities are asking people to report fake vaccination cards to their local police the 1 800 hhs tips or www oig hhs gov or the internet crime complaint center www ic3 gov

arizona s governor doug ducey is calling for the resignation of president joe biden s border chief one day after border officials admitted they allowed a record 117 000 migrants to enter the united states in august ducey said in a friday statement it is time for secretary mayorkas to resign and for him to be replaced with someone who will tell the american people the truth publicly stand up to the radical activists inside the biden harris administration and once and for all end the crisis at the southern border the safety of arizona and our entire nation depends on it ducey s press statement referred to leaked august 12 comments from alejandro mayorkas biden s pro migration secretary at the department of homeland security ducey s press statement began governor doug ducey today called for the resignation of secretary of homeland security alejandro mayorkas following explosive leaked comments in which mayorkas called the border crisis unsustainable said these numbers cannot continue and said if our borders are the first line of defense we re going to lose mayorkas also said he was very well aware that portions of the border came close to breaking recently according to news reports we can t continue like this our people in the field can t continue and our system isn t built for it mayorkas reportedly said the fox news report only provided fragments of mayorkas s august 12 comments to border officers however mayorkas has repeatedly argued in public that he is trying to control the border crush by legalizing even more migration even though that policy will allow u s employers to hire more low wage migrants instead of americans and will allow landlords to rent more housing to groups of migrants at inflated prices at his august 12 press conference for example mayorkas said in the coming days our department will announce that we are making changes and improvements to how we process asylum claims we continue to rebuild our immigration system to ensure fairness and promote equity the reference by the cuban born mayorkas to fairness and equity refers to his pr0gressive policy of putting migrants interests ahead of americans concerns so far mayorkas has shown no concern for the many millions of americans who are worried about their jobs and wages their rents and schools their children s future and their increasingly threatened political status in their own country ducey s statement continued today we are seeing the truth of what s playing out behind closed doors what the federal government isn t telling the american people chaos dysfunction and a defeatist attitude has infiltrated the highest level of the u s department of homeland security this administration has completely lost control of the border and with his comments secretary mayorkas demonstrated that he fully understands the catastrophe playing out at the border and yet he lacks the skill ability and will to address it adequately the buck must stop somewhere a defeatist is not what we need when it comes to fighting for border security it is time for secretary mayorkas to resign and for him to be replaced with someone who will tell the american people the truth publicly stand up to the radical activists inside the biden harris administration and once and for all end the crisis at the southern border the safety of arizona and our entire nation depends on it ducey s statement also included a record of his efforts to curb migration into his state governor ducey in april declared a state of emergency and deployed the arizona national guard to the state s southern border the governor also convened the state emergency council to immediately fund the mission with 2 5 million as well as 200 000 for county sheriffs in june governor ducey and texas governor abbott requested all u s governors send available law enforcement resources to the border governor ducey joined 19 fellow governors in may calling on president biden and vice president harris to reverse their destructive border policies overall investors and business coalitions want to import more migrants even impoverished ill aging or criminal migrants because the migrants spike consumer sales boost rental rates cut wages minimize management hassles and so raise profits and stock values the migrants also serve as clients for democrat run welfare agencies and eventually as voters for democratic candidates but migration damages ordinary americans career opportunities cuts their wages raises their rents curbs their productivity contradicts their political preferences and fractures their open minded equality promoting civic culture migration also widens the growing economic gap between interior states and coastal states for many years a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young u s graduates this opposition is multiracial cross sex non racist class based bipartisan rational persistent and recognizes the solidarity americans owe to each other the voter opposition to elite backed economic migration coexists with support for legal immigrants and some sympathy for illegal migrants but only a minority of americans mostly leftists embrace the many skewed polls and articles pushing the 1950 s corporate nation of immigrants claim

by martin armstrong the cdc has clearly and deliberately manipulated the covid number in florida obviously for political reasons they combined several days of numbers to make headlines that flordia has more covid cases in a single day than anyone else secondly i went to take a look and i have not seen hospitals overwhelmed a friend went to the hospital with chest pains yesterday and was turned around within 4 hours with x rays and an ekg one friend whose grandson works in a hospital said many nurses have walked out refusing to be vaccinated they have argued that we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the cdc is totally untrustworthy as is the fda and the nih when fauci is appearing in a video for klaus schwab s world economic forum saying the 1 problem is not covid but inequality there is just nobody to trust anymore in healthcare in dc i have warned from the outset viruses mutate they will evolve to defeat a vaccine the delta variant is less lethal but spreads easier now there is the latest lambda mutation which is running around south america which is vaccine resistant this entire narrative that once every last person in the world is vaccinated covid will be defeated and we can return to normal this is such outrageous false information that should be shut down by youtube and facebook but they are in bed with this very conspiracy against humanity covid has already infected pets and it is in wildlife lions have tested positive in zoos basis health class 101 shows that viruses that can infect animals will never be eradicated what will happen to the financial markets when they wake up and realize omg there will never be a return to normal because covid cannot be defeated by these vaccines i believe it was not china nor the us military that unleashed covid it was set free only by the people benefiting from this insanity the sooner we have a real investigation the sooner the world will wake up forget trying to prove the election was rigged find the lab person who was paid to release this virus in wuhan
jeffrey trageser who s the director of clinical services with lifesharing said san diego families helped make this milestone possible san diego county calif lifesharing a nonprofit group that coordinates organ and tissue donation in san diego and imperial counties saved 19 lives in a 48 hour timespan the organization said this is believed to be a record for the region from august 5 7 the lifesharing team managed six organ donor cases simultaneously to put that into perspective they usually do about that many organ donors and transplants over the course of a couple of weeks jeffrey trageser who s the director of clinical services with lifesharing said san diego families helped make this milestone possible it starts with the families when you lose someone it s so tragic and so sad but a small percentage of people who pass away can go on to be organ donors only 1 of us can be organ donors so it s so important when families do that to help other people so really the credit goes to the families who recognize that their loved one could save other people s lives he said jeffrey said it takes a lot of manpower and the team coming together is what really made the accomplishment special organ donation is very rare and there are a lot of people waiting for their transplants and it takes a long time and a lot of people to do that in a short amount of time we were able to give a lot of people their second chance at life which was quite an endeavor he said how does the screening process work for organ donations lifesharing works closely with hospitals and donor families to give hope to the more than 100 000 people on the transplant waiting list the team members guide families through the donation process helping them create legacies for their loved ones the united network for organ sharing helps them find recipients lifesharing nurses found matching recipients for 19 organs including hearts kidneys lungs and livers jeffrey said the organization doesn t have any say who gets the organ they just work with the families to honor that gift that they want to give we don t pick those recipients they re matched in a computer and it s based on their size their blood type their age and lots of different health characteristics factor in so that the sickest person at the top of the list whether it s kidney liver heart lungs who s the best match is going to be able to get that organ and have their life saved he said jeff said the dmv also plays a major role in how the organization receives donors that s a way you can say to your friends and loved ones hey when my time is up and i can t use my organs anymore i would like someone else to be able to use my organs he said the organization said there s no medical reason for the high number of cases and that the only reason why they were able to save 19 lives was because six families said yes to organ donation if you want to become a donor you don t have to wait until you need to renew your license you can go online at donatelifecalifornia org and sign up it s also connected to the dmv

amid one of the craziest bull runs in stock markets in all of our history calling out a bubble can be quite scary for many investors but not for jeremy grantham in a frenetic era of meme stocks cryptocurrencies and bidding wars most people tend to overlook the risks and focus on the promise of future gains however there is an imminent and growing danger that this unprecedented mania might end up triggering the greatest stock market crash ever recorded that s what the chairman of the board of famed asset managers gmo has been warning stressing that we re in the middle of the greatest financial bubble ever seen grantham an experienced investor who spent decades analyzing how bubbles are formed has lived through and called numerous modern booms and bursts including the dot com crash in 2000 the market peak in 2008 and the market collapse of 2009 now he says that we re headed to a similar fate to identify a bubble it doesn t take much he argues you can see something is terminally wrong in the market when it makes the front pages instead of the financial pages when the news is full of stories of people getting cheated when new coins are being created every month the scale of these things is so much bigger than in 1929 or 2000 he stresses the current stock market bubble has been fueled by artificial government policies that led many investors to believe overvalued assets could be justified by a booming economy but as grantham highlights the economy isn t actually booming because there was no real growth in production and very soon investors will have to confront that reality and when they do things will start to rapidly change in the market leading this bubble to an epic burst grantham believes that the next stock market crash will cause an enormous negative wealth effect bigger than it has ever been compared to any other previous bubble burst it s the first time we have bubbled in so many different areas interest rates stocks housing non energy commodities on the way up it gave us all a positive wealth effect and on the way down it will retract painfully he warns this bubble is the real thing and everyone can see it it s as obvious as the nose on your face today it is clear to me that this is the most dangerous package of overpriced assets we have ever seen in the us says jim grant describing that we have the most overpriced fixed income market in the history of the world at this point bubbles are emerging everywhere housing equity bonds stocks crypto if they simultaneously crash as most economists predict they will this will undoubtedly be the sharpest collective loss of wealth ever recorded that s why grantham is sounding the alarm to the greatest bubble in financial history warning investors that history is about to repeat itself and this time the stage is set for an apocalyptic financial meltdown sharing a similarly dire forecast finance and economic expert alasdair macleod affirms that one of the biggest catalysts to the coming inflationary collapse were government policies that recklessly expanded our money supply downgraded our living standards our currency and left americans struggling with runaway inflation in that process the expert emphasizes that this has gotten to a point where we can t go any further we are at the top of the bubble what happens when this market tops out the dollar goes down with it macleod adds to the predictions that the everything bubble burst is fast approaching look at the fundamentals in the economy they are talking about economic recovery but look at all the shops that are closed and never to be reopened this is not a healthy economy this is a very bad economy the reason why prices are rising is you ve got all this money being put into the consumers hands this is the middle class here and they are spending this money and where is the production to satisfy the spending it s not there it s closed down there is no solution we are getting to the point that there is actually no exit from this mess he warned a financial disaster of unprecedented proportions seems just a matter of time with so much debt and so little resilience our over leveraged financial system is doomed to face a reckoning and everyone that have seen this happening before is telling us right now that conditions in the markets are increasingly unsustainable those who have chosen to ignore the dark clouds that rising on the horizon will soon find themselves amidst the most devastating financial catastrophe of our lifetime we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us

contentious issues sometimes die in washington not with clamorous showdown votes but a gradual realization that hey people simply aren t talking about this any more former president donald trump s frequent promises for highway and other infrastructure projects and former president barack obama s efforts to close the u s military prison for detained terrorism suspects at guantanamo in cuba both just ebbed away the senate s policing talks are aimed at writing compromise legislation curbing law enforcement agencies use of force and making them more accountable for abuses for months bargainers have been stymied over democrats demands to make individual police officers accused of abuses liable for civil penalties it s currently difficult to pursue such actions in all but the most egregious cases republicans and law enforcement groups like the fraternal order of police have resisted easing those limitations negotiators are also divided over whether to ease the standards for bringing criminal cases against officers for excessive use of force i had hoped that we d be done by now but we are still trading paper and making incremental progress south carolina sen tim scott the chief republican negotiator told reporters this week scott who in may set a june or bust goal that never materialized declined to say whether an agreement would be reached this year he said ongoing violence like this month s slaying of a chicago police officer has made this a more important process in my opinion and a longer process scott s democratic counterpart new jersey sen cory booker would say little i m just putting my head down and getting the work done as quickly as we can he told reporters recently as the senate began a brief break in june bargainers announced they d reached a bipartisan framework for an agreement they provided no detail and never produced evidence that their outline whatever it was was meaningful the democratic controlled house approved a sweeping measure in march that s stalled in the evenly divided senate last year democrats derailed a senate gop bill they said was too timid police in the u s fatally shoot nearly 1 000 people annually including a disproportionately high number of black people according to a database compiled by the washington post some slayings like floyd s have sparked nationwide protests even as many communities have revamped police procedures the issue played prominently in congressional campaigns last fall with democrats appealing to voters who want restraints on police practices while republicans focused on fear of rising crime booker was involved in a brief senate flareup this week that illustrated the issue s ample political potency sen tommy tuberville r ala offered an amendment to budget legislation suggesting cuts in federal aid to municipalities that vote to defund the police a loosely defined term from which all but the most progressive democrats have distanced themselves hoping some democrats would vote against his measure tuberville said opponents would be turning their backs on the men and women in blue but the measure passed 99 0 after booker delivered an impassioned sarcastic speech saying he wanted to hug my colleague for giving democrats a vote showing they opposed police defunding both parties have voiced suspicions that their opponents are less interested in reaching a policing deal than they are in preserving the issue for next year s political campaigns the talks have been complicated by some outside groups refusing to give ground on key issues that s led some organizations like the bipartisan justice action network which backs criminal justice reforms to push for an initial less ambitious deal addressing areas of agreement like some increased police reporting of data on use of force the longer this drags on the more concerned we are getting said inimai chettiar the network s federal affairs director to intensify pressure on bargainers crump said advocates should heed the example of progressive rep cori bush d mo her all night vigils outside the capitol helped pressure biden recently to temporarily extend a federal moratorium against evicting renters during the pandemic you do any and everything possible to make them pay attention said crump asked if biden should be more engaged to prompt a deal crump said hopefully all of us can do more tezlyn figaro senior adviser to the george floyd foundation founded by the floyd family cited democrats control of the white house and congress and expressed disappointment with bargainers failure to meet biden s may 25 deadline for action it hasn t been done she said definitely not encouraging

as the socialist equality candidate for governor in california i demand an immediate end to the reopening of schools for in person instruction while the pandemic rages the reopening of schools carried out under the direction of the newsom administration and implemented by democratic and republican controlled cities and counties throughout the state will lead to a massive surge of the pandemic and the infection illness and death of countless children already major districts like oakland have reopened while the rest are set to resume by the end of the month los angeles which like oakland is controlled by the democratic party is scheduled to reopen this monday august 16 this policy must be stopped and it must be stopped now the reopening of schools is taking place even as california like the rest of the country is seeing a surge in cases from the delta variant hospitalizations from covid 19 have increased by 27 percent over the past week and are 12 times higher than at the beginning of june there is also more and more evidence of the extreme danger to children from the delta variant nationwide pediatric covid 19 cases have reached record levels dr heather haq of the baylor college of medicine stated on august 9 more us children are hospitalized with covid than at any other time point in the pandemic and this number will continue to grow as the delta variant spreads even if children recover studies are showing that contracting covid 19 can have long term health consequences including significant impacts on mental development for children infection is associated with cognitive impacts comparable to lead poisoning or worse the catastrophe that is unfolding reveals the bankruptcy of the entire social and economic system with both parties responsible for a policy that has killed nearly 650 000 people in the united states including nearly 65 000 or one tenth in california the republicans have organized this recall as part of an effort to remove even the most modest public health measures the leading republican candidate larry elder has said that it is long overdue for california to return to normalcy with no mask or vaccine mandates and no further lockdowns he is joined however on all these points by the leading democratic candidate the right wing youtube personality kevin paffrath whatever their tactical differences both big business parties insist that public health be subordinated to corporate profits reopening schools to in person education is central to ruling class efforts to keep workers on the job pumping out profits which is essential in keeping the stock market booming even amid the mass death over the past year and a half the fortunes of the capitalist oligarchs have increased to new records with the wealth of billionaires like elon musk mark zuckerberg and larry ellison doubling or more during the pandemic while the republicans attack the democrats from the right the fact is that the latest surge is the direct product of the policies of the biden administration biden came to office pledging that he would follow the science on the pandemic but his administration is demanding the reopening of schools in the face of warnings from scientists and epidemiologists of the catastrophic consequences the biden and newsom administrations have cynically called the current surge a pandemic of the unvaccinated and both have insisted that schools must reopen in person the stark fact is that the majority of unvaccinated people in california are younger than 18 in large part because there are no vaccinations at all for children under the age of 12 newsom is requiring that all school staff be vaccinated or submit to regular testing to ensure that they are not infected but this is wholly inadequate with the delta variant vaccinated people remain vectors for the disease and children who cannot be vaccinated will transmit it to their classmates teachers and family members a recently published report out of north carolina state university predicts that even with masks and testing more than 20 percent of students would be infected within their first three months of school instead of protecting teachers and students union officials have worked overtime to implement biden s dangerous policy with the american federation of teachers president randi weingarten declaring the number one priority is to get kids to be back in school no the number one priority must be saving lives my campaign calls on teachers and other workers throughout the state to immediately form rank and file committees to organize opposition to the reopening of schools and prepare strike action to enforce the necessary public health measures and stop the pandemic absolutely no confidence can be placed in the trade unions which have demonstrated that they are nothing more than the bought and paid for representatives of the ruling class the sep demands the immediate closure of all schools to in person education that have been reopened and a halt to all plans to reopen other districts a massive allocation of resources to ensure high quality remote education and child care for all children affected the provision of full income to all workers affected by school closures and the shutdown of other businesses necessary to stop the spread of the virus the recall of newsom is driven by right wing forces thoroughly hostile to the working class for this reason the sep calls for a no vote on the recall however the entire situation in california and nationally demonstrates that the democratic party is a party of wall street stopping the pandemic requires the intervention of the working class through mass struggle and an independent political movement directed at the entire capitalist system i urge everyone who agrees with this perspective to contact my campaign and take up this fight among the working class in california throughout the united states and around the world support the campaign of david moore for governor

second quarter of 2021 i hope you and your family are healthy official data indicates that the economy grew around 20 in the first half of 2021 and came close to hitting pre pandemic levels it is noteworthy that the construction sector grew 15 with respect to the first half of 2019 in addition the statistical rebound recovery in the past few months has been boosted by a favorable external environment where copper prices remained high and our main trading partners have resumed role regarding the sanitary situation mortality rates has fallen considerably after reaching a peak at the beginning of the second quarter this improvement has been driven by a noteworthy uptick in the vaccination rate in june and july currently around 37 of the adult population have received at least the first dose although this rate lags behind that registered by some peers in the region the government s goal is that all adults and children from 12 to 18 years will be vaccinated by year end all in all we are still expect that peru gdp to rebound around 9 in 2021 due to a strong commodity prices and expansive monetary policy and fiscal policies political uncertainty in peru has generated a negative impact on financial indicators the exchange rate has depreciated more than 12 year to date and the dollar has reached a record high despite the central bank s move to sell almost 6 billion year to date in 2021 and active intervention in fx market via multiple instruments furthermore sovereign rates in domestic currency as you can see at the table has also climbed to levels above the peak registered in 2020 despite the pandemic and political shocks peru continues to outperform peers in the region in terms of macroeconomic indicators our net international reserves currently represents 35 of gdp our annual inflation rate stands at 3 8 and our public debt which represents 37 of gdp is among the lowest in the region additionally our banking system maintained high liquidity current political instability is rooted in decisions taken by the new government beginning with the move to appoint a highly controversial cabinet with limited technical chops questions regarding the duration that monetary policy will take as well as who will lead the sector continues to loom announcements have been made indicated that higher levels of the state intervention are on the horizon via new public credit facilities fee regulations increased regulation for private health insurance and the structural changes in the private pension system the executive ability to implement this radical agenda might meet with significant obstacles and persistence first peru libre has only 37 seats of 100 in congress and its allies can contribute only 5 more votes second it is worth noting that in the first round of elections pedro castillo secured only 19 of valid votes which represents 10 of registered voters and in the second round won by an extremely narrow margin of 44 000 votes less than 0 2 additionally we think a recent survey conducted between the 2nd and the 4th of this month indicates that castillo s approval rating is 39 one week into his term one of the lowest initial ratings registered by a latin american president in recent history in the same survey only 5 of those polled indicated that the constitutional assembly should be the government s top priority in fact the assembly is around sixth among seven priorities on the list where the reactivation of the economy improvements in the health system and improvements in the quality of education were on for second and third respectively going into credicorp s results let me highlight our quarter over quarter evolution the loan portfolio grew 4 4 in the quarter end balances driven primarily by an uptick in a structural loans in the wholesale banking and sme business segments net interest income grew 8 7 driven by an increase in the structural loans a drop in funding expenses and the fact that a one off expense was reported last quarter for our liability management operation in this context nim resumed growth and stood at 4 01 provision expenses fell after client behavior registered positive performance across sectors which led the cost of risk and the structural cost of risk to situate at 1 02 and 1 23 respectively this quarter core non financial income which is composed fees and fx transactions grew 8 4 due to a construction considerable uptick in transactions this evolution was offset by a contraction in non core non financial income driven mainly by bcp which sold long term bonds at a loss to reduce the interest rates sensitivity for the available for sale portfolio insurance underwriting results continue to be impacted by covid 19 related claims and in q but not reported provisions in the life business from april onwards however the trend has improved the efficiency ratio improved 30 basis points boosted by income recovery net income at credicorp totaled pen699 million in the second quarter of 2021 which represents an increase of 5 9 quarter over quarter our return on equity continued its upward trend and situated at 11 3 at quarter end in the first half of the year roe stood at 10 9 within our guidance range our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity and adequate capital ratios i will briefly describe the results of the lines of business provide further detail in the section of consolidated performance universal banking drives our recovery bcp stand alone contributed pen726 million in earning registering a return on equity of 18 1 core income registered notable growth at 8 quarter over quarter which was mainly driven by an uptick in structural loans a contraction in the funding cost and growth in transactions bcp sold available for sale long term bonds at a loss to reduce interest rate sensibility and partially offset the negative impact to our us dollar loan position this strategic results partially offset core non financial income growth the main driver of an uptick in profitability this quarter was the 83 quarter over quarter contraction in provision expenses which reflected an improvement in client payment levels efficiency deteriorated 10 basis point quarter over quarter mainly driven by higher digital marketing and mileage stability program expenses in line with growth in digital sales and debit and credit card usage bcp bolivia s roe stood at 8 2 which reflects a decrease in the appetite for risk and relative stability in the loan portfolio in a context marked by large scale government mandated loan reprogram results were impacted by the provision reversals due to the inclusion of guarantees in the consumer portfolio which was partially offset by new provisions to cover delinquency the provisions level were equivalent to 4 72 of the total loan portfolio mibanco registered a clear recovery this quarter net interest income grew due to an uptick in origination of lower risk structural loans a drop in the funding costs and a reverse of interest income provisions made previously for reprogram portfolios these positive evolution in mi was partially offset by regulatory restriction on fees loan provisioning normalized in the context of an improvement in payment performance and growth in transactions however we are closely monitoring the 12 of this structural portfolio that still within grace periods or past due colombia s results improved due to an uptick in disbursement although origination volume has is low due to social tensions the focus is currently on maintaining adequate risk management workforce productivity and efficiency at the commercial level regarding insurance and pensions this quarter pacifico s contribution continue to be impacted by higher covid 19 related and ibnr provisions in the life business losses in this business have negatively affected the return to profitability at the group level it is important to note that at quarter end claims and ibnr provisions began to fall in line with the drop in covid 19 mortality in property and casualty growth in net premiums was offset by an increase in claims after mobility restrictions were lifted and activity levels rose the corporate health insurance and medical services were affected by higher claims quarter over quarter due to an increasing healthcare demand as the economy reopens at prima assets under management contracted 2 2 quarter over quarter which reflects fund withdrawals for a total of pen1 8 billion as of june under government mandated facility in may these represent 15 of total fund that are available for withdrawal we expect assets under management to continue to contract in the short term given that asb withdrawals can be made through the year despite these fee costs remained stable due to growth in contribution from our fee in investment banking on wealth management the quarterly evolution indicates assets under management contracted minus 4 5 which was primarily attributable to peruvian based fund outflows from the asset management business due to political uncertainty in wealth management assets under management remained basically stable after local funds migrated aboard and to an off shore platforms the contraction in asset management was accumulated by a devaluation in local currency income contribution expanded 15 8 driven primarily by positive results in capital markets and wealth management the gains at peak was fueled mainly by growth in the sales of securities and upfront fees from entering third party plants to international platforms it is worth noting that the investment banking and wealth management lines of business continues to consolidate its regional presents and 76 of its assets under management are held outside peru the recent migration of funds to off shore platforms represents an opportunity to broader investment option for clients now i will discuss credicorp s consolidated performance quarter over quarter loan portfolio growth was 4 4 in ending balances and 2 2 in average daily balances this evolution was driven primarily by an uptick in the structural loan origination at wholesale banking to campaigns in the fishing and agricultural sectors the expansion was albeit to a lesser extent by growth in sme business mortgage and consumer loans and by the evolution of the exchange rate the mix of interest earning assets improved marked by 7 8 quarter over quarter construction in the investment portfolio after bcp sold sovereign bonds and reduced its exposure to the long term interest rate risk the deposit mix improved and reflected an uptick in low cost demand and saving deposits in foreign currency that was partially offset by withdrawals of time and severance indemnity deposits additionally the funding mix in foreign currency grew to low interest borrowing and for execution of the remaining make whole redemption from the liability management operation the consequent funding structure coupled with lower interest rates led the funding cost to fall and stand at 1 18 both the payment behavior and the structural portfolio performed more favorable this quarter in retail banking on time payments on loans due has stood at 95 in june driven by an uptick in the sme pyme segment quarter over quarter the high uncertainty portfolio which is composed of reprogram loans that are still within grace period and our new loans increased slightly and represented 10 of structural loans it is important to note that this increase was driven by loans that were less than 15 days delinquent which are considered the most recoverable at mibanco on time payments improved in the context of lower expirations and growing transactions and due to economic reactivation the high uncertainty portfolio contracted from 19 to 12 this quarter due to the positive evolution of payments the government program loans or government which are primarily under reactiva peru began to spike in june 2021 by the end of the month the balance was 7 lower than the record high in the fourth quarter of last year the retail banking government program portfolio represents 65 of the total government program portfolio by the end of june 54 of the retail portfolio was still within grace period 30 have made the first payment 14 have been reprogrammed and 2 has become overdue in the chart on the right hand side you can see the profile of wholesale banking and for mibanco it is important to note that we new government reprogramming facilities expire next year so the real deterioration levels will not be fully evident until 2022 it is important to note that the government guarantees back a substantial percentage of these portfolios the npl ratio for structural loans in the wholesale banking registered no variation after a deterioration of the small number of middle market clients plus offset by an increase in loan volumes in retail banking the ratio evolved positively in the individual segment but was slightly attenuated by an increasing overdue sme loans at mibanco positive payment behavior on higher write offs drove an improvement in npl as a result credicorp s structural npl dropped from 6 05 to 5 38 the downward trend in the structural cost of risk was worth noting this improvement was driven by bcp stand alone where the ratio dropped 46 basis points situating at 1 11 in a context marked by an increase in the probability of default in this scenario credicorp s structural cost of risk contracted 69 basis points from 1 92 to 1 23 in year to date figures the structural cost of risk stood at 1 51 at the end of june the provision to stock was equivalent to 7 7 of credicorp s structural loan portfolio credicorp s structural nim increased 14 basis points quarter over quarter to stand at 4 32 recovery was attributable to a more profitable asset mix which was generated by growth in a structural loan origination and improvement in the funding mix and a decrease in interest expenses the positive evolution was mainly driven by the bcp risk adjusted nim increased 64 basis points this quarter and reached 3 38 this metric is recovering faster than nim in line with the normalization of provisions of loan losses core income which is composed of net interest income fees and fx transaction was situated close to pre pandemic levels the increase in net interest in was primarily attributable to growth in structural loans and a decrease in the funding cost fee income grew alongside an uptick in transaction on foreign accounts at bcp and brokerage fees at credicorp capital fx transactions also increased in a context of high demand for dollars non core non financial income this quarter results reflect a management decision to reduce interest rates sensitivity in the investment portfolio at bcp as indicated here additionally we executed an active derivative trading strategy at bcp and credicorp capital both of which rendering positive results insurance underwriting results continue to be severely impacted this quarter which was mainly due to an increase in covid 19 claims in the life business and to a lesser extent to higher claims in the property and casualty business after mobility restrictions were lifted on a quarter over quarter basis regarding net earning premiums there was a slight contraction in life business associated with a decrease in sales of and seasonal effect of renewals in insurance for hybrids occupations in property and casualty there was an uptick to renewals in the medical assisting line and an increasing cars due to new sales and renewals in the life business covid 19 claims reached a peak in april before beginning to march downward accompanied by ongoing decline in ibnr provisions in a context of declining mortality during the quarter if this situation continues to improve we expect this trend to continue it is important to note that on a year to date basis net earning premiums grew in the life business through sisco v which expanded their premium base for fees and contemplated a more favorable fee structure this is pension fund related business the risk of a third wave appears imminent nonetheless vaccination rates and government masking mandates may mitigate impact this time around in the first half of 2021 credicorp s efficiency ratio improved 250 basis points year over year improvements were driven mainly by the positive evolution of income in the microfinance and insurance and pension lines of business mibanco s interest income was up due to growth in structural loans and a decrease in the cost of funding while expenses remained under control pacifico s income was boosted in the first half of this year due to pricing and the fact that it s on a higher proportion of the sisco v tender shows operating leverage of 6 percentile points in a context and control growing expenses year over year rolling operating expenses during the first half this year reflects our commitment to digitalization and was generated primarily by cyber security and it regarding distribution footprint resizing it is worth noting that bcp stand alone and mibanco reduced a number of total branches by 9 and 2 respectively year over year in terms of liquidity even after controlled outflows of foreign currency bcp stand alone and mibanco half maintain high levels of liquidity well above regulatory and internal limits regarding capital each of our subsidiaries maintains adequate capital levels which ensures solvency the slight increase in the core equity tier 1 of bcp stand alone and mibanco was attributable to an uptick in retained earnings which was driven by recovery of both subsidiaries this quarter aa bcp we continue to work on key digital initiatives to achieve our objectives for experience and efficiency and ensure our competitiveness in the long term alongside initiatives to accelerate digital investments we seek to improve time to market and operating stability without losing sight of cyber risks the number of new software releases more than doubled year over year this semester and the downtime for key channels fell 54 in the same period our aim for year end is to fully comply with all this payments of the ffiec cybersecurity assessment tool at the baseline evolving an intermediate limit and fulfill 90 of all this payments at the advanced level to date we have fulfilled 82 of this client satisfaction was negatively impacted by an uptick in the demand for services which coincided with a reduction in onsite service capacity due to pandemic we move swiftly to replenish our service capacity by leveraging digital services and improve the client journey sequentially we have recovered satisfaction levels and are now shooting to exceed expectations the effectiveness of our efforts to execute digital initiatives is reflected in the evolution of the pool of digital clients which represented 55 of the total client base this quarter and continues to see the growth exponential growth in digital transactions coupled with an increase in digital sales in recent years led us to rethink and resize our distribution model consequently we reduced our branch network by 9 in the last 12 months at credicorp level we are developing different fintech initiatives and ecosystems to boost the group s potential later this year we will be able to give you a much more favorable view right now i would like to comment on our progress with three specific initiatives yape group reached the 6 6 million user mark by june 21 and have added 1 million new clients to the banking system since 2020 transactions grew fivefold with regard to the few we reported for the same period last year recent integration with niubiz and izipay opens ecosystem to payments to points of sale which will propel an additional increase in transactions indicators such as frequency of use cost of acquisition npas continues to improve and we expect that this will be the case moving forward in the second half of this year yape will provide an interesting monetization pipeline we will share more information on this point as new features are released yape is now better prepared to operate independently at bcp and the decision making shows culture and operating level nonetheless we have no intention of divesting this business in the foreseeable future tenpo is the only fintech with a digital wallet solution in chile within a year of its launch tenpo hit the second largest solution in terms of number of users with a client base of 537 000 of users with an incremental growth level for processed transactions that is stand of 30 high volumes and a strong nps performance indicator of 68 we expect positive trends to continue this represents an opportunity to continue growing our customer base as we consolidate in this market finally tyba a digital initiatives that began in colombia that offer low ticket investments have reached the 293 000 users mark this quarter with 89 million in assets under management tyba still has significant room to grow in colombia additionally tyba was launched this quarter in peru where we expect it to grow faster as we leverage our lending position in the market and extensive knowledge base now let me talk about sustainability journey we have stated that honing our social focus is the core objective of our sustainability program our efforts has speeded up and in the first half of 2021 we progressed toward several milestones on the environmental front we are pushing the group to mitigate and reduce carbon emissions to three fronts carbon neutrality environmental policy and environmental management plan it is worth nothing that bcp was recognized by the ministry of environment for reducing its carbon footprint and was the first bank in peru to awards with the support of industry experts we have made progress in assessing our esg risk management framework additionally we have launched an eco factoring line with a sustainable on the social front yape and mibanco and our financial inclusion efforts and 1 million citizens and 35 000 smes were brought into the bank financial education program at bcp and pacifico suppose to reach millions of people we implemented a program where female board members meet and exchange views with female senior executive with strengthening networks increasing the visibility of female colleague and addressing gender equity challenges we have also established directional goals to improve our gender balance and now including a gender perspective in our succession plans for senior executives on the goal front we have included sustainability goals in corporate level incentive program and have made further improvements on the compliance front by year end we expect to report progress on relevant esg initiatives and adhere to international reporting standards we expect our whole roe of 2021 to remain within guidance given the favorable results in the banking businesses are expected to offset the less than favorable scenario in the each of our business peruvian real gdp growth is deceleration and our estimate for the end of the year is within range loan portfolio growth is expected to decelerate given that the uptick in the second half of 2020 was generated by reactiva disbursements covid uncertainty may impact low year end net interest margin achieved an inflection point that recovery will be gradual as such we nim in 2021 to situate at the lower end of the guidance the cost of risk however has improved faster than expected given the positive evolution on client payments in this context we expect to release that our cost of risk below our guidance range this year regarding efficiency the 43 9 ratio posted in the first half of 2021 is slightly below our guidance nonetheless we expect the levels to increase albeit with an expected range higher year end expenses are recorded the outlook we are sharing today is for 2021 although uncertainties remain on an extended horizon after evaluating different scenarios we reaffirm our long term business strategy we are carefully monitoring the evolution of specific variables and are poised to make tactical changes to adapt to challenging situations we will continue accelerating value generation to the digital strategy in each of our businesses which coupled with our sustainable journey will ensure that we sustain growth efficiently with these comments i would like to start the q a session questions and answers operator thank you sir our first question comes from ernesto gabilondo with bank of america please go ahead ernesto gabilondo bank of america analyst hi good morning gianfranco cesar and good morning everybody thanks for the opportunity my first question is related to the insurance business we saw better operating trends in general that interest income growth for the first time in three quarters an important recovery in fees and significantly lower provision charges however we saw this wider loss in the insurance results so considering that the region is going to a third wave of covid 19 and that the delta is affecting younger people not vaccinated how do you see the outlook for pacifico insurance business in the next quarters walter bayly chief executive officer thank you ernesto this is walter bayly i will let alvaro correa answer that question alvaro please alvaro correa deputy chief executive officer and head of insurance pension funds hello ernesto this is alvaro well there are few things that are happening after this trend that we saw in the second quarter of the year which at the end was i mean for the second wave it was like a 15 or so higher impact on results than the first wave so the question that you re raising is what is going to happen in this potential third wave there are few elements that we have to take into consideration one is that the vaccination process is getting better and since the government has started vaccinating people from older to younger that coincide somehow with the population that it s insured so basically what we re expecting is that the impact for the country would not be as high as high as the second wave and the impact on the insurance business won t be as high as in the second wave as well right so that s very that s something that we are expecting really but again this is something that we do not have specific guidelines so far ernesto gabilondo bank of america analyst perfect thank you and then my second question is on the political outlook how do you see the possibility of velarde accepting another period of stay on the central bank and if you think is positioned to previous volatility in the sector and also related to the political outlook do you think that the proposal to change the private pension system is it still on the table or do you see a more moderate done from the new administration walter bayly chief executive officer sure i would answer those questions ernesto i think the basic scenario here regardless of whether julio who is a very well respected central banker the question is whether we will have an orthodox central bank or not our expectation at this stage is that yes we will continue to have a central bank that will act accordingly to more orthodox policies and once those are confirmed of course volatility should be reduced regarding the pension system it has been on the table for quite a while to redo the pension private pension fund system and the public system as well that is a necessary thing to do the private pension fund system has been i think severely damaged the amount of withdrawals that have happened and the fact that the current legislation allows people from 60 year the amount at which you can start withdrawing funds has been reduced and that is of course countered to what has happened all over the world were due to the low returns of the portfolio is because of low interest rates the asia in which individuals can achieve their pension has been increased we have gone counter that cycle so at this stage the private pension system does not have enough money to provide for adequate pensions so a reform is urgently needed it is a difficult task for any government and any congress it is on the table but we do not have expectations that this is something that is going to happen very quickly or very easily i don t know if you answered both your questions ernesto ernesto gabilondo bank of america analyst you answered perfect thank you very much and then just a last question related to your digital transformation we re starting to see in each countries of the region the creation of digital banks so given all your fintech initiatives such as yape tenpo tyba all the digital transformation inside bcp do you see a possibility at some point to consolidate all of these initiatives in a digital bank in the future walter bayly chief executive officer i will pass this question on to gianfranco gianfranco would you care to take it and i can complement afterwards gianfranco ferrari deputy chief executive officer and head of universal banking sure good morning ernesto yes the answer is yes we are considering the possibility of launching a digital bank as we ve talked in earlier conference calls the vision we have is that we have to make a few different bets in order to be successful some of the bets we probably made are being successful in some other we failed however going specifically to your question we may pursue i would say i dual strategy one is with vision of launching a retail bank build on what we already have while at the same time keep the current initiatives our ventures growing and growing and ones that are successful expanding them to other countries ernesto gabilondo bank of america analyst excellent thank you so much operator the next question is from yuri fernandes with j p morgan please go ahead yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst hi all good morning i will limit myself to one question regarding loan growth i guess you provided this guidance likely converging to the lower end of the guidance for this year looking ahead what should we expect because my concern here is that about 70 of your loans are business related loans right when you add to the smes the wholesale about 70 of your loans in peru they are business related and the concern here is that this is political uncertainty may drive maybe you decreasing your risk appetite right and also your clients like lower demand from them so how should we think about loan growth not only for this year but for 2022 for 2023 given like these higher should loan growth in peru be below like nominal gdp like what should we expect now and if you can provide some data in june or july that may begin i don t know show some trend of deceleration that would be helpful as well because in the second q i guess that was a good quarter right for growth the question mark is what s going to happen in the second half and 2022 thank you walter bayly chief executive officer thank you yuri i will give a brief answer and maybe cesar you can complement yes you are right to the extent that the private sector is not aggressively investing growing and spending obviously loan growth will be subdued the long term trend in peru is that loan should grow at 1 5 times nominal gdp i think that to the extent that this political uncertainty continues to be a cloud above us we will be of course on the lower end of that long term trend so that is reality and that is what we are preparing ourselves for having said this cesar would you care to comment a little bit more on loan growth cesar rios chief financial officer yes walter thank you yuri yes only to complement i will think in terms of individuals there is still demand for consumer and mortgages in line with private spending that s probably is going to be fuel temporarily with a number of government imports initiatives and in the wholesale segment being said that there s going to be probably less investment there s going to be also some substitution effect from less initial in international markets and probably a little bit less appetite risk appetite from international bank so at least in the short term we think that we can have these sources of growth yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst thank you very much operator the next question is from tito labarta with goldman sachs please go ahead tito labarta goldman sachs analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my questions maybe first a follow up on the just political environment any update or what you re hearing on the cap on interest rate regulation on fees and any force lending any color you can provide there walter bayly chief executive officer good morning tito no further news the three issues that you mentioned are the ones that of course pose certain amount of difficulty or risk for the financial sector you have mentioned we do have a law that sets cap on interest rate and that is reviewed every six months by the central bank so at this stage there have been no comments to make any changes on that there has been a little bit noise on fees but nothing we do have a rather stringent regulation on fees already so in the short term we don t anticipate anything further and no mentioning about force lending though we have heard there has been a lot of noise on from the government and to the extent that banco de credito should be an active participant particularly ems and smes that of course is could create distortions in the short term in the long term we have in the past competed with public sector banks and in the long run they usually are not the toughest competitors they tend to have difficulty attracting talent or usually not very good on the commercial front and usually technology is not the strength of government owned financial institutions particularly in peru but in the long term it is no concern though in the short term because of price considerations it can create some amount of distortions in the market we all remember what happened in the brazilian banking system during the lula administration when during the lula administration when the series of government owned financial institutions under mandate a political mandate started aggressively lending in several sectors of the banking industry and that of course in the short term creates distortions so we are not concerned in the medium term or long term but in the short term there could be distortions nevertheless banco la nacion is not prepared today from a risk management perspective from a commercial perspective to go and aggressively be an active participant it is important to keep in mind that in peru about 45 of all the lending done into the sme and micro lending is done by public sector financial institutions basically the cajas municipales so we are watching this closely but at this stage we do not have a lot of serious considerations did i answer your question tito tito labarta goldman sachs analyst yes walter that was very helpful thank you i got a separate question then on cost of risk fairly low this quarter i know you provisioned quite a bit last year how do we think about that for the rest of the year walter bayly chief executive officer sure i ll pass that question along to reynaldo and or cesar can you start reynaldo reynaldo llosa chief risk officer high quality performance on our portfolio a lot better than we expected and we see these trends continuing during the second half of the year and broadly during 2022 having said that there is still some small portion of the portfolio which is still benefiting from rate periods so that might have a smaller impact on the performance of the portfolio but we are feeling very positive up to date with the performance of both wholesale and retail portfolios as well as the trends we re watching at mibanco bolivia is benefiting from regulatory rules that give the clients the opportunity of having very long rate periods so that i would say that would be probably the most challenging things for credit card in 2022 tito labarta goldman sachs analyst thank you reynaldo walter bayly chief executive officer thank you reynaldo cesar is there something you would like to ask cesar rios chief financial officer only something very slightly that in line with reynaldo we expect that positive behavior in probability of the tools and cost of risk but probably a little bit uptick in deteriorated portfolio as the deterioration that was expected they started to materialize but materially was already provisioned as the recruitment portfolio is starting to come due tito labarta goldman sachs analyst thank you operator the next question is from jason mollin with scotiabank please go ahead jason mollin scotiabank analyst hello everyone walter gianfranco alvaro reynaldo llosa and team the presentation was excellent all my questions you addressed all of them actually as well as in the other previous questions but i can ask one on given the consumer demand that you talked about from government support and perhaps companies that are not in the best position perhaps could need some liquidity here how are you managing the risk here and how do you see that impacting your market share going forward do you think that credicorp s businesses will actually be looking in this environment to give up the weaker credits or weaker clients and will retrench and that would result in lower market share walter bayly chief executive officer thank you jason thank you for your kind words no at this stage we do not anticipate of course as it was mentioned by cesar during the presentation we have made a thorough review of our long term strategic positioning and we do not think that at this stage there is anything that merits any long term changes in our long term strategy or view of what we want to become and where we want to play nevertheless under such a change in environment tactical responses are something that one has to be ready to tackle and of course we are watching the development of each of our different market segments product market segments but at this stage we have no intention of not continuing active participation that we have in all the product and segments in which we are currently present so the answer in short the answer is no we do not have any objective of reducing any portion of our portfolio or market share going forward and as cesar mentioned maybe a what could provide a somewhat of a growth opportunity is the fact that the domestic capital markets because of the lack of liquidity in the pension funds and in the lack of international capital markets maybe there could be some more lending for top corporates available in the corporate sector i don t know if gianfranco would like to add something gianfranco ferrari deputy chief executive officer and head of universal banking good morning jason as always there s a fine balancing act between risk and business opportunities on top of what walter has said we still have a long term strategy leveraging on technology in order to reach new segments on both the population and smes at bcp i m talking so we even though maybe the macro environment might not be so positive we are still positive on the opportunities in getting more businesses and in starting new segments of businesses jason mollin scotiabank analyst maybe i could just ask i mean you guys have mentioned that some of the competitors i think in the micro lending some of your competitors have had tough time with funding and that is a segment that there are a lot of question marks about the addressable market and how that will evolve could it actually result could you guys see some gain in market share in that segment in the near term if competitors are not going after the clients or not able to or any color on that segment gianfranco ferrari deputy chief executive officer and head of universal banking sorry walter bayly chief executive officer yeah go ahead gianfranco gianfranco ferrari deputy chief executive officer and head of universal banking yeah so maybe the answer is two fold jason i mean if we talk about it before the micro business the micro finance business is a high cost business at mibanco we re at this stage we re developing the hybrid model in which we leveraged even though it s still a high touch business based on our end we re leveraging on technology and tech tools in order to be much more efficient as a matter of fact we do measure the cost to assets ratio that mibanco is way off way under its competitors so we do see an opportunity there then i switch to bcp in the past we haven t been successful to top those low ticket clients in the sme business basically because of the distribution costs again we already have a distribution channel full digital distribution channel which we re piloting today and we do see opportunities to top that market through that channel in this thing so the answer in the long run is i do see opportunities to gain market share in the sme business in the low ticket clients jason mollin scotiabank analyst thank you very much walter bayly chief executive officer thank you gianfranco jason let me add to that particularly on the smes and micro finance side as you well know last year we did a very aggressive provisioning and we did a capital increase to allow the bank to continue to operate under capital standards that we feel comfortable under pressure from the other participants in the microfinance particularly the cajas the government set up a program that allowed injection of capital so far that program is still not active and we have not seen the level of provisioning or a statistical evidence that the clean up in the portfolios of some of the cajas has happened and we are all operating in the same market with the same customers so that leads us to believe based on that data that the day of reckoning has yet to be acknowledged in those portfolios and when that happens is probably when those opportunities that you mentioned will probably start to appear and allow us to become even further more of a leader in that market did we answer your question jason mollin scotiabank analyst yes thank you very much walter bayly chief executive officer thank you jason operator the next question is from alonso garcia with credit suisse please go ahead alonso garcia credit suisse analyst hi good morning everyone thank you for taking my question my question is regarding the interest rate cap i mean back in april central bank set the rate cap at 80 for the may to october period so now three months later i wanted to hear how you adopted to the new regulation if you had to do some adjustments to your strategy for certain segments of the portfolio or if not really and moreover how did you see your competitors adapting to new regulation and if you think probably your competitive positioning against them changed in some way following the implementation of these regulations thank you walter bayly chief executive officer sure thank you alonso i will answer regarding mibanco and gianfranco can after i finish tackle the issue of bcp in the consumer side on the mibanco side yes we have had to withdraw from a certain portion of the customers that because of distribution costs and cost of risk did not were not profitable with the interest rate cap it was not the most profitable segment but that is reality so we have abandoned that market we are not aggressively pursuing there those loans it was as i mentioned not the most profitable segment it was even probably just breakeven segment but it was very core to our purpose of including financial inclusion so it is a shame that we are unable to be more aggressive there but having said that i don t think it will have an impact on the p l so that is the answer from the microfinance side and gianfranco would you tackle from the consumer side gianfranco ferrari deputy chief executive officer and head of universal banking sure just a quick comment on what walter just mentioned we have said it before from the client perspective the most expensive loan is the one you need and you cannot get and in a country where we re still lacking financial inclusion it s a theory that our legislation that one you mentioned has been installed regarding the consumer business yes we ve adopted the heat more than anything the type of interest rate it becomes from the delinquency fee the whole consumer business has been hit and the strategy is quite similar to what walter mentioned for mibanco so we are pulling off of some of the low segments in the consumer finance specifically in credit cards which is a business which for us wasn t as relevant as our competitors both in terms of market share and in terms of profitability alonso garcia credit suisse analyst thank you and if i may a second question on the opex side i mean for the first half of the year expenses are up 3 9 slightly ahead of inflation but for the second quarter alone expenses increased strongly both quarter on quarter and year over year so which you attributed to digital marketing campaigns so i just wanted to check what drove this uptick in marketing campaigns i mean was it driven by pressure from competition maybe from other banks or many fintech companies and based on these what should we expect for opex growth for the full year thank you walter bayly chief executive officer thank you for your question cesar could you tackle this one please cesar rios chief financial officer yes alonso thank you for the question in addition to the factors that you already mentioned that i m going to detail a little bit is also the seasonality as you remember at bcp particularly we have a low level of expenses in the first quarter and a higher one in the fourth so when you compare the second with the first quarter you are capturing the seasonality effect another two factors were i would say the normalization of the variable compensation given the fact that now we are close to i would say normal levels of profitability and rates thus the pool of a variable compensation and finally we have a jump start and have improved a lot the digital marketing initiatives in yape and other bcp product and we re starting to gain awareness to expanding awareness that also in actual client engagement and this is a perfect correlation with the level of sales of digital products and it s part of the integral strategy alonso garcia credit suisse analyst perfect thank you very much operator the next question is from carlos gomez with hsbc please go ahead carlos gomez lopez hsbc analyst thank you for taking the question i wanted to ask you about the relationship with the new economic authorities and i mean i remember in the previous conference calls you make a judgment that we were going to have any administration that s what happened would you say that the current economic team is going to last for the duration of this administration or should we expect further changes and would you say that you have already engaged in dialog with them thank you walter bayly chief executive officer thank you carlos for your question it s you re asking for a very speculative answer obviously we have absolutely no clue as to whether this current administration or administration at the ministry of finance will be there for the next five years that s a tough call so we don t know we have not engaged yet in conversations with the ministry of finance there have been a couple of meetings with some with and some of the other groups not individual meetings i think the scenario that we are seeing at this stage is one that was described to me but having a growth level of macroeconomic orthodoxy both at the central bank and at the ministry of finance meaning that we would have a central bank that will be watching monetary policy with a good eye on keeping inflation under control and at the ministry of finance we will have a team that will make sure that the deficit and we run a relatively balanced situation so we would have a macroeconomic orthodoxy from a monitoring fiscal point of view and a lot of initiatives from the micro point of view that are quite unorthodox that is the scenario that at this stage we are seeing and but of course these are just speculative ideas on my side we have no further evidence there is still a lot of uncertainty going around did i answer your question carlos carlos gomez lopez hsbc analyst i think you answered the question as best as can be answered at this point if i can follow a little bit in probably a different area you mentioned that was very clear that there was a decline in the level of service to your clients that you addressed with more resources at the same time you have reduced a number of branches by 9 isn t that a contradiction in reducing your retail network when perhaps there is more demand for your services thank you walter bayly chief executive officer i understood the comment you made regarding the fact that we re reducing the branches yes that is reality that is happening both at mibanco and at bcp and that is of course because customers are utilizing more actively digital channels to interact with either institutions but i did not understand the first part of your question we are reducing the level of services i didn t carlos gomez lopez hsbc analyst at some point during the presentation you mentioned that the satisfaction of your clients has dipped a little bit and you had to put more resources to restore it walter bayly chief executive officer yes okay got you yes we are constantly measuring the level of customer satisfaction and yes that results in a whole series of initiatives to how do you counter that but less and less the quality of the service provider is related to amount of branches we measure which are all the different pain points in which our customers and points of contact that our customers have and as i reiterate that less than less that has relevance to do with the actual branch it has to do with some of the digital channels the phone maybe even the way our bank statements are sent via email it s a whole bunch of different points of interaction and pain points our customers have that are not related with the branches so we think there is no contradiction at all with the fact that we are gradually reducing our physical footprint with the fact that we want to continue improving our customer satisfaction carlos gomez lopez hsbc analyst thank you very much walter bayly chief executive officer you re welcome operator the next question is from andres soto with santander please go ahead andres soto santander analyst hi good morning everybody and thank you for the opportunity to ask questions my first question is regarding the potential new regulation that will potentially come under castillo administration when i look at his proposals in terms of more active role of a government owned bank setting caps differentiated by sectors in the economy etc this looks a lot to me like what you guys have experienced in bolivia so i would like to hear your thoughts given that you have experience in this market if you see a parallel between the bolivia right now and what peru is moving to and given that the roe that you got in bolivia back in 2019 pre pandemic is 8 can we assume that this 8 could be a reference for credicorp roe and the more radical version of our castillo administration walter bayly chief executive officer that s a strange question okay let me tackle this we do not think that the scenario that we are looking as the most likely scenario is anything related to what you have just described i have already mentioned that all made a lot of comments regarding the a more active participation of government entities in the lending arena and i will make those comments again what has been mentioned is that banco la nacion will take a more active role in lending to the small smes and micro companies that is of course is a possibility that in the short term could create distortions but in the medium term it is of no concern competing against public sector entities has in the past proven to be not the most difficult task but in the short term it could create distortions to the extent that you have an institution that lends rates that do not reflect cost of risk or return on equity having said that implementing that strategy as distortive as it can be in the short run is not easy for banco la nacion banco la nacion is an institution that is struggling with some of those changes in its core applications and its systems does not have lending experience nor does it have a commercial muscle to go ahead and aggressively compete with about 20 or 30 different financial institutions that are out there aggressively competing in the market so yes it s a possibility it s a long shot it does not keep me awake at night interest rate caps again we have already commented on that the responsibility to regulate that has been given to the central bank which will review this on a six month period the regulation that we have today is one that has tried to comply has complied adequately with the law while trying to minimize the impact on financial inclusion to the extent that we have a central bank that continues to have that view and we believe that will be the case we think that further damages to financial inclusion if happened could be marginal more than dramatic we have not had any discussions nor there has been any noise in creating buckets of lending forced lending and the scenario that you pointed out that peru becomes bolivia is not our basic scenario and i would give it a 15 probability and if that 15 probability happens our return on equity would come down yes at what level i have absolutely no idea i don t know if i answered your question andres andres soto santander analyst no that s clear walter and talking about another country where you guys have experience which is colombia and when you look at castillo s proposal all of them are fiscal expansionary and will increase deficit and will require additional taxes are you guys concerned about the possibility of increased taxation over the medium term on potentially specifically targeted toward the banks walter bayly chief executive officer yes i think this is something that is going to happen all over the world during the health crisis that we have are still living the tail hopefully the tail end all the governments in the world has embarked rightly so on very aggressive fiscal spending and all the countries in the world need to get back on a more sustainable fiscal path that will require additional taxes which will further which are further compounded with a movement all over the world let s call it to tax the rich be that the rich individuals or the rich companies so yes we think that there is a very likely scenario in all over the world including peru that taxes will increase yes that is a very likely scenario andres soto santander analyst perfect walter and moving to a totally different topic when you described the outlook and the uncertainties and the potential lower growth for difficult household this year and even next year i look at your capital and you obviously have an excess capital position i would like to hear your thoughts regarding these what is your current assessment or your capital level in the past you spoke about 850 million if i m not wrong and if the investors can expect these money to be returned to them either as a buyback or extraordinary dividends walter bayly chief executive officer the short answer is yes the scenarios that we see going forward and which we have are discussing in this call probably call for less growth less growth in the country less growth in the lending needs and less growth in risk weighted assets while we continue to generate decent returns on equity thus the scenario is that we will be generating excess cash which will clearly be distributed to our shareholders we are going in the next board meeting to take a proposal which has to be reviewed approved and discussed at the board level what to do with the current excess capital that we have and we will communicate as soon as that is of course decided upon but in summary yes we do think that we will be able to generate profits that will exceed the funding requirements the capital requirements of our subsidiaries thus we will be able to retake or resume a growth path in our dividends as we had prior to the crisis starting andres soto santander analyst that s very helpful thank you walter for your answers walter bayly chief executive officer you re welcome andres operator the next question is from thiago batista with ubs please go ahead thiago batista ubs analyst yeah hi guys thanks for the opportunity i have two more questions the first one is about the funding if because of other uncertainties in peru if the bank has seen already a migration of deposits to u s dollar and if this is true how we conciliated it with the material reduction probably close to the all time low level of cost of funding for local currency so if you are seeing this shift to u s dollar deposits and how this conciliated with the very low level of funding costs the second one is about the yape you mentioned that the digital wallet achieved already about 7 million clients or close to it do you have a sense if there s a big overlap between credicorp s clients and yape clients and how do you believe will be the monetization process of yape walter bayly chief executive officer okay thank you those are good questions thiago i will pass the i will let cesar answer the first part the first question regarding funding dollarization and then gianfranco you can tackle the question about yape and yape customers and monetization so i ll pass onto you cesar cesar rios chief financial officer thank you walter and thiago talking about funding what we have seen is significant increase in low cost funding particularly at bcp level and in general terms you have seen the increase of these low cost funding in terms of saving and non interest bearing deposits for the wholesale business as a result of the liquidity provided by the government but also the government mandated release of funds from the pension funds and we have maintained during all this period very high levels of liquidity that has maintained almost including more than we were expected previously and we have seen some migration from soles to dollars but not for a very significant degree from the current strong populations to now it has been strong immigration funds from peru to outside but aggregate level of deposits in the system has been maintained and in the case of bcp we have even gained market share trying to reconcile this with the cost of funds this composition explains the reduction of cost of funds because most of our funding confirm this very low cost sources and when you blend with the proportion of long term funding in average we reduce our cost of funds in the short term as a result of the increase in the reference rate of the central bank announced last night this is a net positive for us because the cost of fund in the short term are starting to continue to be at very similar level for a significant part of our restructure while at the same time we are going to be able to reprice in this proportion this 25 basis points through the rest of the year the high the very liquid parts of our investor portfolio and the short term part of our loan portfolio so we are still seeing a low cost of funding and with this small increase of reference rates in the central bank and increasing our margins in the short term by the way this side note from the central bank is very positive because at the same time they maintained monthly liquidity and support for the financial system they are giving a clear sign that they are watching over the inflation and setting expectations thiago batista ubs analyst thank you cesar cesar rios chief financial officer i don t know if this answer helps to you thiago batista ubs analyst no clear very clear gianfranco ferrari deputy chief executive officer and head of universal banking let me go on the yape question out of the 7 million clients yape has i would say 20 to 25 are related to credit card the remaining clients are client from our institutions you have to bear in mind that already six or seven financial institutions are part of yape so their clients can if there are clients they can download yape but more important we already have over 2 million users that are not necessarily related to any financial institution through yape card which is our virtual debit card but more important than that is that the overlap in terms of usage we ve talked about it for several years now we have our vision of war on cash and the more alternatives we provide our clients the more the less usage of cash we will see from our clients what we so the amount transacted through yape in june was like five or six times than what s been transacted a year ago at the same time the amount transacted in debit cards and credit cards grew over 20 as compared to 2019 so i would argue that there is basically no cannibalization or marginal cannibalization among those cards and when you compare the amount that tickets the average ticket transacted through yape compared to the ticket transacted through mobile banking is like mobile banking is like 10 times larger so the vision there is that yape is definitely a very strong complement to the payment methods we have in the past on top of that yape has already reached 1 million qr codes distributed among micro businesses so yape if you may recall yape started as p2p application now it s obviously a p2p also p2b through these qr codes feature like qr codes but in addition to what cesar mentioned yape qr code is already exposed through point of sale of those easy pay attributes which basically represent i would say 99 of the amount transacted through point of sale regarding your question on monetization obviously that s one line of monetization and we get through the qr codes through new lease and easy pay and for this quarter we re launching top ups and we re launching micro loans top ups obviously we get a fee from the telephone companies but the vision is more than vision of monetization is a vision of how to further increase the usage of yape the number of transactions per client and in terms of micro loans we are already lending providing micro loans based on the yape information but not through yape not through the yape app so the ux is not good today however their response rate is quite interesting we really expect that their response rate should increase dramatically when it s through the app so we are very positive on these new two features that should be launched this quarter thiago batista ubs analyst very clear thanks for the answer operator the next question is from ingo lupatelli with autonomous research please go ahead ingo lupatelli autonomous research analyst hi on the increase in expenses coming from marketing and it how should we think about it moving forward in the second half and also in 2022 so how much is transitory versus should we expect an increase or this level to continue thank you walter bayly chief executive officer thank you ingo cesar could you help me with this one cesar rios chief financial officer yes if we focus on the specific lines ingo probably they are going to increase but what we are striving to do is to transform the cost structure of the bank particular at bcp and the same in mibanco so you are going to see the increases of certain lines related to it while at the same time for example as reflected in the reduction of the traditional footprint we are going to control costs in other parts and jointly strive for improvement on the efficiency ratio of the on the organization of bcp so i think we are striving to improve efficiency ratio by changing the composition with specific lines aligned with the digital transformation ingo lupatelli autonomous research analyst perfect and on the marketing expenses how should we expect this to move to continue walter bayly chief executive officer in this particular line it s in the same line gianfranco mentioned efforts to launch new products new facilities in yape this entails to be much more active in the market probably at the beginning spending more in third parties and when we have more flow internal flow we re going probably to change using internal traffic to gain awareness but this part of the same strategy to launch for the clients improve engagement when you have more traffic is starting to expose your projects using a gradually unless third party or most costly alternatives ingo lupatelli autonomous research analyst perfect thank you for the answers operator and now i would like to turn the conference back to mr walter bayly chief executive officer for closing remarks walter bayly chief executive officer thank you the results of this first half of 2021 are very much in line with what we had been anticipating to the market namely the 2021 is the year in which we rebuild our margins our volumes and our profitability this of course after a very difficult 2020 in which the focus was to adequately generate the required credit provisions to reflect the damage in our loan portfolios from the biggest drop in gdp in peruvian modern history even though this first half results which show an annualized return of 11 3 higher as mentioned before well in line with anticipated results there are differences within the different business units of credicorp i will briefly comment on the three main subsidiaries clearly pacifico is the unit whose results are way under what we had disappointing the second wave of covid infections and mortality greatly exceeded our expectations than those of the first wave as you know pacifico is the clear market leader in life insurance which includes credit life and life insurance associated customers of the private pension system our life insurance business has been and once normalized will continue to be our driver of growth and profitability thus short term results do not change our long term view going forward we anticipate our life insurance business to return to profitability in this third quarter as the impact of the second wave of infection has already decreased in a very relevant way as cesar mentioned of course the possibility of a third wave is real but vaccination efforts have recently accelerated and already reached 35 of the most vulnerable population with at least one dose thus a potential third wave should result in lower mortality bcp stand alone results are for the second quarter in a row very positive achieving returns of equity above 18 structural loans have started to grow though at a subdued rate nims have started to recover while cost of risk is coming down we continue to be extremely focused on all different digital initiatives which continue to advance very successful as anticipated we have accelerated the pace at which we invest and spend in these initiatives mibanco s results are also encouraging and recovering very well as we are already exceeding our anticipated return on equity estimated at high single digits by year end and we already have 10 3 as of june volumes have started to grow while cost of risk is coming down productivity is climbing ahead of our plans as one third of the number of monthly disbursements are have already been done we saw the intervention of the loan officer finally the evolution of nims is also positive we are very encouraged by yesterday s timely decision of the central bank to very modestly increase our local currency reference rate this modest increase gives a message that our central bank is watching closely the evolution of inflation while still maintaining an extensive monetary policy this move is also a message to the fx market to conclude all variables under management control are evolving favorably and believe we are well positioned to exceed our expected results this year we are faced with an unstable political scenario but it is good to remember that unfortunately political stability has not been the norm in peru our macro fundamentals in the fiscal monitoring financial system continue to be strong and while our democratic system of checks and balances is and will be tested and challenged we are cautiously optimistic on the final outcome the coming year will be full of challenges and not without volatility on the political front we will nevertheless as we have in the past weather this political volatility and continue to be focused on our mission and purpose with this i finalize our conference call and again we thank you all for your continued interest and for joining us in this call thank you very much operator duration 91 minutes call participants cesar rios

the world has gone through a series of watershed moments in the last few years clearly reshaping contemporary politics among nations the new war theatre between states is the global financial markets and unlike traditional warfare tactics and strategies nations applying the proxies of commercial contracts to create their monopoly over other competitors the global pandemic has compelled the state to intervene in what is traditionally no more its domain to stave off the worst effects of covid 19 and unconventional security threats are the new concern for the world the shift from geopolitics to geo economics is relatively a new phenomenon that urges us to deliberate beyond the classical geopolitical conception of global power politics the structural changes in favour of this shift from geopolitics to geo economics have left no country unaffected and pakistan is no exception historically speaking the concept of promoting and safeguarding national interests through economic interdependence and alliance building with like minded states near and far is not a new thing for pakistan the founding father s vision of pakistan encompassed the idea of interdependence and peaceful coexistence in his message to the nation on the occasion of the inauguration of the pakistan broadcasting service on august 15 1947 m a jinnah stated our objective should be peace within and peace without it indicates that jinnah envisioned peace as the ultimate solution to all the problems of a newly independent country he further stated we have no aggressive designs against anyone we stand by the united nations charter and will gladly make our contribution to the peace and prosperity of the world to materialise his vision jinnah even proposed a joint defence to the arch rival india to shun conflict and animosity between the two neighbours the constitution of pakistan in its article 40 advances jinnah s vision of peaceful pakistan that could preserve and strengthen fraternal relations among muslim countries based on islamic unity support the common interests of the peoples of asia africa and latin america promote international peace and security foster goodwill and friendly relations among all nations and encourage the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means the first few years of independent pakistan were full of turbulence and digression from jinnah s vision as the sole focus of the leadership was to project the country as a geostrategically ally of the west to fulfil its major economic and defence needs pakistan joined seato and baghdad pact later cento in a bid to protect its territorial integrity and strengthen its defence against india however joining those alliances opened new avenues of economic cooperation and infrastructure development for pakistan the structural dictates of bipolar order during the cold war could not break the resolve of pakistan to connect the world through the common market and cultural bonds the formation of regional cooperation for development rcd in 1964 exhibited pakistan s idea of development and socio economic interdependence among iran pakistan and turkey rcd provided a platform to forward many infrastructure building projects of road and rail connectivity rcd became stagnant because of the domestic political and economic turmoil in member states but the expansion of rcd in 1991 enabled broader regional cooperation under the new name economic cooperation organisation eco pakistan welcomed the initiative of saarc by south asian countries leadership to promote and facilitate better connectivity and strengthen trade ties in the region unfortunately saarc couldn t deliver as per expectations because of india pakistan rivalries over kashmir dispute pakistan never stopped protecting and projecting its geopolitical interests in the region throughout the 1980s and 1990s the unipolar world order along with internal political and economic difficulties set a geopolitical imperative for pakistan the first decade of the 21st century didn t change the situation much as being the coalition partner and front line state in the global war on terror islamabad had to continue applying the same security parameters to design its foreign policy vis ˆ vis near and far neighbours the rise of china has changed the situation in favour of countries willing to quit the conventional security paradigm and want to reshape their narrative of security growth and development china s bri initiative of reviving the historic silk road route has provided a new hope of inclusive growth and development for all china pakistan economic corridor cpec is a pilot project of bri and through this project pakistan would be able to avail new opportunities of economic prosperity the reflection of the new narrative of inclusive growth and development can be seen in pakistani civil and military leadership s initiatives toward seemingly undeclared zero problem neighbourhood policy normalisation of ties with india is one major step towards realising the shift from geopolitics to geo economics general bajwa s call for burying the hatchet with india to make peace reflect the realisation on the part of the strongest stakeholders in security and geopolitics that it s the time to re examine the causes of pakistan s economic miseries the normalisation of relations with india can open india s 1 3 billion strong market for pakistan s struggling economy imagine a south asia where india and pakistan stop spending the big chunk of their budgets on defence and start spending the big share on peoples welfare and prosperity prime minister imran khan has also been very keen to promote the changed narrative by taking initiative to facilitate foreign direct investment fdi and convincing the businesses of their new geo economic vision for the country ik s recent visit to uzbekistan was also part of the new policy to promote trade and cultural ties with central asian republics uzbekistan and pakistan agreed to finalise a preferential trade agreement to increase the bilateral trade and to establish and upgrade the transportation setup like rail links via afghanistan pakistan could be a major transit trade destination for landlocked central asia but it is only possible if islamabad keeps its focus on facilitating connectivity and improving security conditions at home and with neighbouring countries the importance of a peaceful afghanistan in this regard is manifold since peace and prosperity in pakistan is conditioned with peace and prosperity in afghanistan and that is the real hard task ahead the us forces departure from kabul without any permanent solution has created an uncertain situation in the region the ghani government in kabul is unable to stop the taliban s advances pakistan needs to be extra vigilant on the afghanistan front as repeating any past mistake could be fatal for newly defined national interests the world bank doing business 2020 report placed pakistan at 108 which means pakistan is lagging behind its south asian neighbours even nepal is better ranked in the report major reforms in bureaucracy taxation to mainstream the informal businesses sustainable infrastructure development and the energy sector are essential to create an investment friendly environment for domestic and foreign investors government should get the pakistani diaspora onboard and encourage their involvement in the economy realising the geo economics paradigm also depends on the continuity and transparency of political institutions and strict practice of the separation of powers extremist tendencies should be mitigated through a chain of reforms in society overall a progressive tolerant and civilised societal behaviour can lead the country

fifty years ago on the evening of sunday august 15 1971 president richard nixon went on national television to announce that henceforth the us would no longer honour the agreement it had made at the bretton woods new hampshire conference of july 1944 to redeem us dollars for gold at the rate of 35 per ounce the decision to close the gold window shattered the international monetary system which together with the marshall plan of 1948 and the general agreement on tariffs and trade of 1950 had been a key foundation of the postwar capitalist boom capitalism emerged from the second world war discredited on every front its economy driven by the profit motive had created untold misery for hundreds of millions of people in the great depression of the 1930s two imperialist world wars fought for colonies and resources had produced unspeakable barbarism such as the holocaust the second world war concluded with the dropping of two atomic bombs on japan by the us the ruling classes of europe had ripped off the mask of democracy as they collaborated with the fascist regime of nazi germany when the heads of the soon to be victorious powers gathered at bretton woods as the war drew to a close largely as a result of the heroic sacrifices of the armies of the soviet union they were acutely aware that any return to prewar economic conditions would spark social revolution not only in europe but potentially in the us as well at the end of the war the economies of the combatants lay in ruins except for the united states which had undergone a rapid expansion it now turned out more than 50 percent of the world s industrial production and held more than 75 percent of the world s gold stocks the basis of the bretton woods monetary system under which the dollar became the global currency backed by gold was that the economic strength of us capitalism would provide the foundation for the reconstruction of postwar capitalism but none of these plans could be put into effect without the restoration of the bourgeois political order under conditions of developing revolutionary ferment the mouthpiece of british imperialism the economist noted at the end of 1945 that the defeat of the nazi regime and the end of its new order had imparted a great revolutionary momentum to europe it had stimulated all the vague and confused but nevertheless radical and socialist impulses of the masses significantly every program with which the various resistance groups throughout europe emerged from the underground contained demands for nationalisation of the banks and large scale industries and these programs bore the signatures of christian democrats as well as socialists and communists such had been the integration of the european bourgeoisie into the structure of the nazi new order that it had become completely discredited prompting the economist to note that whereas the maxim of french socialism during the 19th century had been property is theft it was now property is collaboration in revolutionary conditions time is always of the essence the decisive factor in providing the bourgeoisie with the time first to contain the postwar revolutionary momentum and then derail it was the role played by the stalinist communist parties with the assistance of social democracy at the wartime conferences of the big three the us britain and the soviet union at tehran yalta and potsdam the moscow stalinists agreed to the suppression of revolution in the west in return for imperialist recognition of soviet spheres of influence in eastern europe carrying out this agreement the stalinist parties blocked the revolutionary upsurge of the working class above all in italy and france where they entered capitalist governments with the stabilisation of bourgeois political rule the postwar economic arrangements created the framework for the longest boom in the history of global capitalism generated by an upturn in the rate of profit resulting from the extension of the more productive methods of american capitalism to the other advanced capitalist countries but contrary to the illusions so assiduously promoted during this period that somehow capitalism could now be regulated through keynesian demand management and other forms of state intervention its contradictions had not been overcome but only temporarily suppressed moreover the very development of the boom was to bring them to the surface once again even as the bretton woods monetary system was becoming fully operational at the end of the 1950s when full currency convertibility was restored the contradictions within it started to emerge and were pointed out in an analysis published by the belgian american economist robert triffin what became known as the triffin paradox was the following the functioning of the world economy its need for international liquidity depended on a continuous outflow of dollars from the us and the greater the expansion of the world economy the greater this dollar pool had to be but this growth so necessary for the expansion of trade and investment meant that the ability of the us to redeem these dollars for gold at the rate of 35 per ounce was undermined to some extent this divergence could be managed so long as the us maintained a large balance of trade surplus but that too was being undermined by the very development of the postwar boom the economic revival of the advanced economies particularly germany and japan which the us had promoted in order to provide an outlet for its own industrial production undermined the position of us capitalism within the global market this was reflected in a sharp decline in the us balance of trade surplus it fell from 6 8 billion in 1964 to just 600 million in 1968 before moving to a deficit of 2 71 billion in 1971 gold and foreign reserves fell and by 1971 they were 13 91 billion compared to us liabilities of 67 81 billion in the preceding years attempts had been made to maintain the system but they proved to be of no avail and after a top level weekend meeting at camp david nixon announced the cutting of the gordian knot the ending of dollar gold convertibility meant that paper currency no longer had a foundation in real value consequently inflation rapidly ensued in the 1970s as the value of the dollar in international currency markets declined there was another process at work in the final analysis the boom had been sustained not by the measures of capitalist governments but by an upswing in the 1950s and 1960s in the rate of profit but from the middle to late 1960s it began to decline in line with the analysis made by marx of this lawful tendency the capitalist class responded with a stepped up offensive against the working class to increase the rate of exploitation but this produced only a growing upsurge of the working class whose strength and militancy had increased as a result of the postwar boom nixon s decision on the dollar was accompanied by the declaration of a wage limit of 5 5 percent it failed inflation fueled the development of militant wages struggles in the us and around the world in 1974 the british miners strike brought down the heath tory government in australia 1974 saw the biggest strike wave since 1919 and the largest wage rises in history this period was one of intense political turmoil the resignation of nixon in 1974 as a result of watergate the downfall of the greek junta in 1974 and the end of the salazar regime in portugal which had come to power in the 1930s to name but some examples the upsurge of the working class in the us was not quelled by the recession of 1974 75 to that point the deepest since the 1930s nor even by the subsequent stagflation the combination of high unemployment and rising prices in 1977 78 us miners defied the anti strike taft hartley act invoked by the carter government and in 1979 the british working class was embroiled in a winter of discontent against the callaghan labour government by the end of the 1970s it had become clear to ruling circles in the us that it was impossible to overcome falling profit rates and counter the militancy of the working class within the industrial and political framework of the postwar period and nothing less than a complete restructuring of the us economy and class relations was necessary this was the significance of the appointment of paul volcker as the head of the federal reserve in 1979 by democratic president jimmy carter volcker s essential mandate was to carry out a purge of the american economy coupled with an offensive against the working class the vehicle for this was the raising of us interest rates to historically unprecedented levels they reached 20 percent at one point in the early 1980s this program resulting in the destruction of whole swaths of us industry was conducted under the banner of a war against inflation that war was above all directed against the working class as volcker himself acknowledged when he said that the mass sacking of the air traffic controllers by reagan in august 1981 and the smashing of their union patco was of crucial assistance in the fight against inflation the smashing of the air traffic controllers union the starting point of an offensive that was to continue relentlessly over the next decade was made possible only by the collaboration of the trade union bureaucracy in the crucial patco struggle the leadership of the afl cio told reagan it would not raise a finger in opposition a position it maintained in every conflict that followed the restructuring of the american economy involved two main components in the first place it drove forward the reconstruction of american industry on a global basis forcing the development of new technologies and management methods to take advantage of the cheaper sources of labour available internationally initially in places such as mexico and east asia and then extending further a second aspect was the increasingly prominent role of finance capital in the american economy as a source of profit accumulation this involved to an ever increasing degree the accumulation of profit through so called financial engineering that is the use of parasitic financial methods rather than the previous road of profit accumulation via investment in the underlying economy beginning under the reagan administration this rising mode of profit accumulation reached a crucial turning point in the stock market crash of october 1987 when the dow recorded its largest one day fall in history of more than 22 percent the intervention of the federal reserve into the crisis signaled the alignment of the central financial arm of the capitalist state with the new mode of profit accumulation responding to the stock market collapse newly installed fed chair alan greenspan issued the following statement the federal reserve consistent with its responsibilities as the nation s central bank affirmed today its readiness to support the economic and financial system it was brief but its implications were far reaching previously the policy of the fed had been in the words of its longtime postwar chair william mcchesney martin jr to take away the punchbowl as the party was getting underway now it was to pour in more vodka the new orientation was elaborated by greenspan in the years that followed he insisted that the task of the fed was not to prevent the formation of financial bubbles but to clean up the mess when they burst through the supply of ultra cheap money to allow the speculation to expand still further the period since 1987 has seen a series of financial crises each one more serious than the last followed by further injections of money by the central bank from the mexican bond crisis of 1992 to the dot com crash of 2000 2001 the global financial crisis of 2008 and the market freeze of march 2020 at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic which went to the very foundation of the american and global financial system the 21 trillion us treasury market in the latter crisis the fed expanded its asset holdings from 4 trillion to 8 trillion virtually overnight and at one point was pumping in money at the rate of a million dollars a second it became the backstop for every area of the financial system these measures have now created a mountain of financial assets that is fictitious capital the term fictitious means that these assets do not embody value in and of themselves rather in the final analysis they are a claim on both the present and future surplus value to be extracted from the working class in course of capitalist production herein lies the objective origin and driving force of the homicidal drive to reopen the economy by every capitalist government even as the covid 19 pandemic continues to spread death any measures that would impede the vampire like demands of finance capital meaningful measures to halt the pandemic such as a lockdown of nonessential production with full compensation to those affected combined with the closure of schools are ruled out the entire society and its fundamental needs are subordinated to the demands of the financial oligarchy let the bodies pile high as british prime minister boris johnson declared so that the flow of surplus value is sustained and the stock market can continue its rise the question that arises at the end of this historical review is where does this now leave us the past is but prologue what are the implications of the crisis at the very centre of the global financial system 50 years after the ending of the bretton woods system the answer is to be found only by considering the fundamental issues rooted in the very dna of the commodity capitalist economy the necessity for a material base of the monetary system in the form of gold arises from the very nature of commodity production money is not a technical device that was invented at some point in time to overcome the difficulties encountered in barter and which can be constantly reinvented as circumstances change it is rooted in the commodity the cell form of capitalism the value of each commodity is determined by the amount of homogeneous abstract human labour it contains but this abstract social labour is not perceptible to the senses twist and turn a commodity as much as one likes not an atom of value can be discerned the commodity reveals the value embodied in it only when it stands in relation to another commodity the equation x commodity a y commodity b is the germ of the money form in which the value of commodity a is represented by the bodily material form of commodity b the development of the commodity exchange system proceeds until one commodity historically gold becomes the universal representative of the value of the world of commodities when nixon confronted the crisis of the bretton woods system the only way he could have retained the existing monetary order was to crash the economy winding back the growth that had taken place over the preceding quarter century fearing the economic and revolutionary consequences of such a move he sought to dodge the law of value and initiated the fiat currency system paper dollars not backed by gold which has been in place for the past 50 years this has led many including some who consider themselves marxists to conclude that marx s analysis of the centrality of gold to the value system has been refuted by events that it may have applied in the 19th century or even up to 1971 but no longer because of the massive expansion of credit but closer consideration reveals that the law of value that nixon attempted to push aside 50 years ago is reasserting itself marx did not discount the role of credit in the money system he explained that the expansion of credit was the way capitalist production constantly strives to overcome this metallic barrier which is both a material and imaginary barrier to wealth and its movement while time and again breaking its head on it credit he wrote constantly usurps the role of gold as the basis of the value system and enlightened economics looks down on gold and silver with the utmost disdain that is until confidence in the credit system is shaken as inevitably takes place gold performs a vital function as the ultimate measure and store of value this role cannot perpetually be replaced by credit and paper money enormous amounts of fiat money can be created by the press of a computer button but the capitalist state the central bank cannot conjure up value out of thin air it can be created only by the labour of the working class it is acknowledged even by bourgeois economists who maintain that marx s analysis has no relevance to the present day that there are limits to the expansion of fiat money that if it is expanded too greatly it will no longer be socially acceptable as a measure and store of value but this very acknowledgement indicates that lurking in the background there is a question of what the ultimate store of value is thrown out the front door the value question comes back in through the windows meanwhile the continued expansion of fiat currency results in the development of the most fantastic expedients as the attempt is made to turn money into more money by means of speculation the stock market continues to rise to record highs amid death and social devastation while new forms of speculation are developed in the form of bitcoin dogecoin and a myriad of other cryptocurrencies then there are non fungible tokens nfts images that are stored with a supposed valuation sometimes running into millions of dollars there are meme stocks generally based on companies whose business model has reached a dead end but whose market valuation is boosted through the number of likes they receive on social media platforms and earlier this year there was the case of the new jersey restaurant hometown international which had a market capitalisation of 100 million with sales of just over 37 000 in two years as one comment put it the pastrami must be wonderful this craziness in which the monetary worth of so called assets with no intrinsic value can leap into the stratosphere recalls nothing so much as the saying those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad bourgeois analysis gets itself into all kinds of tangles when it confronts the crucial question of value in a comment published in the new york times during the march 2020 crisis the economic historian adam tooze wrote as panic has swept through financial markets in the past two weeks investors have begun seeking safety in cash above all in dollars the american economy itself may look weak but the dollar is still the most universally accepted means of payment and a store of value this is in essence a circular argument the dollar is sought out as a means of payment because it is a store of value and it is a store of value because it is the universally accepted means of payment fifty years on from the demise of the bretton wood system we are approaching another decisive turning point in the death agony of capitalism and the crisis of value that erupted in 1971 there are two major developments that terrify the central banks as they pump out ever greater quantities of fiat money in order to sustain the mass of fictitious capital that their actions have created the first is the fear that inflation will rise and this will produce major struggles by the working class that can rapidly assume ever more powerful forms including a direct clash with the state itself sparking a crisis of confidence throughout the entire financial system this is not a matter of speculation but of the most recent historical record the eruption of wildcat strikes and walkouts by workers in march 2020 and the fear that this would extend was a significant factor in the market meltdown that month more than 160 years ago amid a speculative orgy in france that preceded the 1848 revolution marx noted that any serious development of the class struggle calls into question the confidence based on a belief in the supposed permanence of the capitalist system on which the entire credit system rests this is the real concern of those like former treasury secretary lawrence summers who have warned that the stimulus packages of the biden administration combined with the actions of the fed can have dire inflationary consequences that is inflation can propel an eruption of class struggle under conditions where the entire financial system has time and again revealed its extreme fragility going back to 1971 the second fear is that the price of gold the only stable store of value within the capitalist economy will rapidly rise leading to a collapse of confidence in the us dollar and setting off another crisis over the past year and more the price of every asset has been rising as a result of the expansion of fiat money with the sole exception of gold this points to intervention in the gold market from the highest levels aimed at keeping its price down lest a significant rise set off a dollar crisis the fed and other central banks keep their operations in the gold market behind closed doors but as long ago as july 1998 in testimony before congress fed chair alan greenspan admitted that central banks stand ready to lease gold in increasing quantities should the price rise leased gold forms the basis of futures contracts based on sell orders that depress the market in august 2020 the price of gold rose to a record high of 2 067 since then its price has been kept to a range around 1 800 but the more the fed pumps out fiat money the more the value question arises even drawing the attention of financial journalists financial times editorial board member rana foroohar noted that the policies of the biden administration depend on low interest rates and the power of the dollar to enable us borrowing but she continued should the current paradigm break quickly and unexpectedly both the dollar and any dollar based assets could be rapidly devalued another ft columnist gillian tett noted in a recent comment that the crisis to which nixon responded 50 years ago raised a bigger question that always stalks finance what is the basis on which money commands value and trust since 1971 global debt has inexorably expanded and is now three times the size of the global economy this will not be repaid by growth she wrote but sooner or later will probably cause a direct or indirect restructuring or a social or financial implosion or to put it another way as marx did the law of value asserts itself in the same way as the law of gravity does when a house collapses around our ears no one has a crystal ball that can predict exactly when and in what form this will take place but two things are certain first that it is inevitable because the crisis of value is rooted in the very cell form of capitalism the commodity and second that it will bring an historic eruption of the class struggle in which the contradictions of the capitalist mode of production are always fought out there is already a growing resurgence of the working class after decades of suppression by the trade union bureaucracy under conditions of a deepening economic crisis for which the bourgeoisie is making its preparations that is why in the us and around the world it is making frantic efforts to totally integrate the trade unions into the apparatus of a corporate state to better serve as the policeman for the suppression of the working class while at the same the bourgeoisie seeks to organise a fascist movement the working class must now organise its struggle through the development of its own organisations rank and file committees to develop the struggle for its independent interests against the trade union bureaucracy and its backer the capitalist state above all the crucial task is the building of the revolutionary party to lead the working class in the struggles now developing to take political power into its own hands this must be done to ensure that the crisis of capitalism already seen in the social murder policy pursued in response to the pandemic is resolved through the establishment of socialism a society in which the productive forces developed by the labour of billions of workers are utilised to meet human need not profit

the covid 19 pandemic is deconstructed and documented one phenomenon that dominated headlines in the early days may or may not make the textbooks supermarket aisles stripped bare of toilet paper hand sanitizers and other everyday items across the globe one year on the world is learning to co exist with the virus panic buying is history shelves are once again abundant with toilet paper and protective equipment and yet there is a shortage of everything according to research by accenture 94 of fortune 1000 companies witnessed supply chain disruptions from covid 19 75 of companies had a negative or strongly negative impact on business and 55 plan to downgrade their growth outlooks not only do these disruptions impact the economy businesses and workers they also have direct implications for financial markets prolonged supply chain disruptions can severely impact market sentiment by instigating fear about persistent inflation and apprehension about supply chain resilience and sustainability what is likely to be immortalised in history then is this covid 19 exposed a structural vulnerability in modern global supply chains that threatened to dismantle the very architecture that has sustained them over the previous half century this architecture relies on what is known as just in time manufacturing pioneered by japanese automaker toyota in a post war attempt to compete with the batch manufacturing model that characterized american car companies success most industries across the world have since embraced lean manufacturing as the standard and not without reason eliminating excess inventory has allowed companies to maximise production efficiency greatly reduce warehousing and other costs incentivize product innovation and diversification adapt to ever evolving demand and enhance shareholder gain through buybacks however experts have been sounding alarms for decades about a critical fragility in the system the inevitability of supply chain disruptions where they have transpired the impact has largely been local and temporary until now the just in time model hinges on a harmonious dance between production shipping and stable average demand but when the music stops a cascading domino effect of supply chain chaos takes its place this is what happened when covid 19 grinded manufacturing to a halt in key export markets and lockdown induced impacts doubled shipping times and caused acute labour shortages add to the mix a skyrocketing of demand for consumer products as economies began to recover ironically the car industry is shouldering the fiercest impacts of global shortages estimated to lose 60 billion in sales this year as shutdowns plague many of the world s largest auto factories forced by an acute scarcity of a critical manufacturing component computer chips the only company that s escaped the wrath of lean inventories toyota itself that s because in the aftermath of the devastating 2011 earthquake in japan toyota realised that the supply chains of each of the 1 800 parts and 30 000 components that make up a car had unique vulnerabilities and while some were quick to recover others like computer chips took months to catch up it tweaked its own model to incorporate long term strategic planning for building resilience into vulnerable supply chains and its policy to stockpile two to six months worth of semiconductors has allowed it to remain largely unscathed in a crisis where its competitors are now flailing what companies have chosen to ignore and what experts have consistently warned about is that the root cause of such shortages is a ruthless pursuit of short term profit over longer term sustainability and natural disasters or pandemics are merely triggers that set off the bomb somewhere along the way companies have normalised sacrificing resilience at the altar of efficiency but toyota has demonstrated that it does not have to be such a drastic trade off it has demonstrated that the most efficient manifestation of its own model exists at the intersection of lean manufacturing and a diversified resilient supply chain that is able to overcome disruptions till markets recover the shockwaves have rippled globally and india is no exception before the pandemic hit an aggressive us china trade war and other concerns were facilitating a global supply chain shift away from china and towards other asian countries vietnam emerged as the top contender but favourable investor sentiment and shored up domestic manufacturing placed india in the running as well with nearly one third of respondents in a global survey of 700 firms naming india as a leading sourcing destination across multiple sectors this is now in jeopardy covid 19 threatens to undo large swathes of progress that india has made over the last few decades across sectors including its manufacturing capabilities and msmes a prolonged disruption weakened economy and waning trust in india s capabilities can well arrest any progress it has made in capitalising on supply chain shifts from china where the impact has not been so drastic and which continues to be the world s most trusted sourcing partner there are several domestic concerns too india s logistics and supply chain costs add up to a whopping 400 billion or 14 of gdp far less competitive than the global average and consequently with far more potential for damage in the face of supply chain disruptions in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic in 2020 financial markets remained extremely volatile and bearish leading to crashes and massive wealth erosion while markets have been fairly resilient through the second wave uncertainty surrounding recovery and inflation fears stemming from prolonged disruptions could lead them into further bouts of volatility one pre pandemic study on supply chain disruptions found that on average indian companies lose 2 88 of shareholder wealth over an 11 day period covering a disruptive event significantly higher than us companies all in all while a lot is contingent on how further covid 19 outbreaks are tamed it would bode well for india s private sector to learn from the first two waves to build resilient supply chains if it is to emerge as a key manufacturing and sourcing hub it has to cultivate relationships of trust with international companies as well as domestic markets and demonstrate that it is capable of withstanding even prolonged crisis induced disruptions or recovering quickly from them like the one covid 19 is currently fuelling the buck doesn t stop here the virus may only be a precursor for what s to come in a world increasingly threatened by hostile trade wars retreating globalisation and aggressive protectionism and unprecedented disruptions from climate change building supply chain resilience is arguably the most potent survival strategy for any industry business or country the writer is a policy consultant and advisor to india s former

wayne davidson has been taking atmospheric readings from the arctic weather station at resolute bay on cornwallis island nunavut for 40 years the climate of the high arctic he believes is a guide in many respects to our past and is also the place from which our climate future can be previewed as this week s ipcc climate change report laid out in stark terms davidson s job in nunavut is to observe and record temperature pressure wind and humidity through the atmosphere via twice daily readings from weather balloons sunsets and sunrises ice formation and the movement of animals are in a sense secondary but in the arctic environment also critical to understand the changes taking place with respect to climate science i m at the frontier of observation davidson told the guardian never has that job been so important the ipcc report declared the climate crisis causing havoc around the globe is unequivocally caused by human activities and is battering every corner of the planet produced by hundreds of the world s top scientists and signed off by the world s governments it concludes things could get far worse if the small chance remaining to avert heating above 1 5c is not taken when davidson first took his position relocating for nine months of the year from montreal it was in a sense an ordinary job making sea ice observations and so on the arctic he says was a love at first sight and the job more fun than working in a high rise tower studying the weather with satellite pictures in 2005 davidson technically a meteorological observer told a visiting reporter that the arctic could experience florida summers in 20 years the prediction then seemed both sickening and far fetched now it s sickening still but much less far fetched air temperatures in the arctic have indeed touched at times floridian equivalence headline events are equally shocking tundra aflame dramatic ice cap melts loss of seasonal and year round sea ice walrus with no ice floes to calve and drowning polar bears for davidson watching all thus unfold the climate report came as little surprise i have tried to assimilate myself to the atmosphere into this invisible world one that we don t understand without any distractions davidson says enrapturing as it is he adds the arctic remains a place we barely understand we are starting to understand it better but by the time we do it will be gone i am really not happy about it in some ways the changes that davidson and inuit hunters are witnessing are more unnerving than stock images of collapsing glaciers and hungry animals hunters say they have noticed for years that the dark arctic night is becoming lighter as a warmer layer of air over the arctic acts as a conduit for light from the south the light too is different taking on shades of blue green and red sunsets in the high arctic davidson says were once pure white and prolonged viewing painful to the naked eye that s no longer the case sunsets are no longer white but orange or red a function both of particulates but more importantly atmospheric temperature differentials caused by the loss of sea ice view image in fullscreen the sunset on 20 march 2009 photograph wayne davidson davidson says the arctic has not quite reached the heat of a florida summer but we re getting there sea ice he says is thin but is saved for now by clouds that form as a result of evaporation from contact between the ice and warming air they re the only thing that s preventing it from disappearing every summer he said for now 2012 holds the record for the lowest level of september minimum sea ice each year since that record low is approached last winter davidson says sea ice was amazingly thin in resolute bay warm air from pacific cyclones is warming the region even in darkness instead of temperatures of minus 40 for weeks on end it s minus 25 the winters used to be bitter cold and amazingly brutal now they are brutal at times he said the life of an arctic atmospheric scientist living with and among the inuit comes with strange customs davidson carries a sword to work an accessory to fend off wolverines and more so polar bears though he has little faith in this line of protection i ve been lucky he said i think i d lose the fight relations between inuit communities and the modern world are less intrusive and more cooperative davidson says he points out that erebus and terror the two british exploratory warships lost in 1848 under the command of john franklin would probably never have been found without local knowledge and cooperation the core of that tragedy of course was the failure to understand the local people franklin regarded his culture as superior and that s what killed him davidson said but disputes endure earlier this year protests erupted in pond inlet over plans to expand the mary river iron ore mine representatives for the inuit community said an expansion would damage caribou seal and narwhal more than 1 000 miles east in greenland the government aligned with mining interests lost national elections to the inuit ataqatigiit party which opposed the expansion of rare earth mineral mining davidson says the biggest natural world story is the encroachment of killer whales that are coming up to hunt beluga and narwhal this too may be a result of thin ice the whales are usually averse to bumping their large dorsal fins for now their prey are relatively protected from being trapped in the inlets and fjords by pack ice clogging the channels if that ice disappears the beluga and narwhal may find themselves more exposed in all these things davidson says the arctic is now a transitional not permanent world it s an illusion of sorts the pack ice is either going to go on or go out completely but there s no chance it s going back to cold everything is warming of course this is not something that affects the far north alone less temperature contrast between the tropics and arctic creates a weaker and less persistent jet stream which creates stagnant weather systems consequently heatwaves and rains become more intense floods and fires are the result as we have seen this summer from oregon to greece to germany to russia these outcomes davidson says are nothing short of tragedy as the rest of the world catches up with what northerners have been feeling for years we were used to a certain climate world and now we re going to have to get used to something else the world down south is trying to manage its own disasters while the world in the north has been getting the rough end of it the two may now be converging
where are italian greyhounds from the italian greyhound is best known for its origins in italy where owning one was considered a symbol of wealth and prestige during the renaissance however various artistic works and archeological findings suggest that the breed truly originated over 1 000 years prior in present day turkey and greece nonetheless the miniature greyhounds gained popularity in the 1600s as a royal pet owned by the likes of frederick the great catherine the great and anne of denmark it was nearly 300 years later when the breed was recognized by the american kennel club and popularized in north america standardization efforts were most successful in the united states and after world war ii europe began importing stock from america today the breed is as equally regarded as an affectionate family pet as it is a champion show dog with numerous lure coursing and best in show titles awarded in recent years
a woman who sustained leg injuries after she was run over by a forklift july 27 on beaver island was flown to munson medical center for treatment officials said trace tisdole was injured while a forklift was transporting items from the beaver island ferry to power s hardware store on main street according to charlevoix county sheriff s office reports the incident occurred in front of the boat dock near the beaver island community center located at 26210 main st in st james township one man who saw the incident told authorities he was parked in front of the community center and witnessed the victim attempting to cross the street and said she appeared to be watching for someone when she was struck by the forklift according to sheriff s reports the forklift operator involved in the accident blair stoehrmann told authorities there were several items stacked on the lift s front pallet and his view had been obstructed according to reports he looked both ways prior to leaving the boat dock because there were a number of vehicles parked alongside the road but did not see the pedestrian crossing the street ages and hometowns for the individuals involved in the incident were not available from the sheriff s office as of press time from existing reports it is unclear specifically how the collision occurred however a family member of the victim who rode in the ambulance on the way to the airport said the victim stated she had looked both ways before crossing the street and that she was hit twice by the forklift power s hardware store regularly gets deliveries from the mainland via the ferry large stocks of goods are delivered via ferry to island residents and businesses each year 10 000 tons of freight was carried in 2020 according to beaver island boat co general manager tim mcqueer the accident is unusual said mcqueer who noted he has been in charge of operations at the beaver island ferry company for almost two decades and has never seen a similar incident however the accident did not occur on ferry company property normally upon the ferry s arrival contractors on the island pick up their shipments at the loading station once the ferry is docked it is their responsibility to load and transport the materials from there said mcqueer although the ferry owns loading equipment the forklift involved in the accident was the property of the hardware store said mcqueer forklifts vary significantly in size however a smaller electric motor rider truck has a 3 000 4 000 pound carrying capacity operators are required by state and federal regulation to obtain a forklift certification also called a license it is the employer s responsibility to ensure staff has a forklift certification according to several companies that provide the online course needed for the license balance scenarios and maneuvering the vehicle on various surfaces are some of the subjects that are covered during the certification process and possible hazards are also identified with recommendations for ways to avoid them according to the course s training literature the victim s injuries were severe enough to warrant being transported by beaver island ems via air ambulance to the traverse city hospital for treatment attempts to obtain details on her condition were unsuccessful power s hardware store declined to make a comment regarding the issue there are no pending charges regarding the incident charlevoix county prosecuting attorney allen telgenhof said he was made aware of the situation but has not been given the police report the courier reached out to the michigan occupational health and safety administration to see if is pursuing an investigation of the matter but no response had been received as of press time beaver island does not have a hospital the decision is made on the scene if hospitalization is required the air ambulance is normally called in life and death situations but also can be used if the patient is able to voice their desire to receive hospital treatment for their injury according to the beaver island ems director cody randall the island s ems team consisting of about 20 employees with three on call at all times responds to about 100 emergency calls a year according to randall last year 30 of those calls required the use of the air ambulance the island has two ambulances available for land transportation the average ambulance response time is relatively short on the island as compared to some rural areas on the mainland the station is located in st james township in the most populated area of the island in a best case scenario after calling 911 a person could receive medical care on site in just a few minutes however if the call comes from the opposite less peopled areas of the island it could take 20 minutes or more said randall if the weather is good and the island s dedicated ambulance plane is available from the time 911 is called to the time a patient reaches a hospital could be approximately one hour that s if everything goes well said randall if the island plane and the two available backup planes are not available or usable the u s coast guard is called to help the coast guard s helicopters can fly through weather the airplanes cannot medical situations tend to occur three or four times a year under such conditions and it can be hours before a patient arrives at the hospital according to randall beaver island ems is one of eight operating stations in michigan licensed to operate an air vac mackinac island does not have a dedicated island based aircraft for medical emergencies but a small medical center is available on the island

leah covered this development this morning the biden white house isn t looking to enact a nationwide covid vaccine mandate but will probably implement measures that pretty much make it impossible for anyone to do anything without getting the shot there is no mandate but there is one seems to be the playbook here the new action item is to mandate vaccination for interstate travel all of this while covid infected illegals are shipped all over the country but whatever right the associated press said that they re not going to push it since it would be too polarizing for the moment so is this
it s been a long two years but the camping world nhra drag racing tour is finally headed back to middle america for this weekend s menards nhra nationals presented by petarmor the event marks the first time nhra pros have visited heartland motorsports park since the 2019 season due to the covid 19 pandemic a lot has changed in two years but there s also a lot that has remained the same such as steve torrence s continued domination of the top fuel class torrence won the last time we raced in topeka and he s the favorite again this weekend along with robert hight in funny car and greg anderson in pro stock top fuel funny car pro stock steve torrence capco contractors the current points leader didn t sweep the western swing but he did go two for three to extend his advantage over the rest of the field now the tour returns to topeka where he is technically the defending event champion as well as the 2017 runner up torrence has lost just four times this year in 32 rounds that easily makes him the biggest favorite in the field odds even antron brown matco tools as we just noted leader steve torrence has lost just four rounds this season but guess who is the only driver to beat him twice yep it s his old buddy antron who is also having a pretty decent season of his own brown went to back to back finals in topeka in 2016 17 with a win at the latter event he s more than capable of doing that again odds 4 1 billy torrence capco contractors the capco captain took a breather from the camping world tour but still managed to win a race in his super comp dragster so he s going to be far from rusty it s also worth noting that one of his most recent appearances came in epping where he ran the table by qualifying no 1 and winning the event odds 5 1 leah pruett mopar pennzoil okay we ll call it this time the mopar team is back in business and they ve gotten a big bump from tipster following their successful western swing that included a runner up in sonoma and a much needed win in pomona the fact that they went to back to back finals is one thing but they did it with a solid performance in both qualifying and eliminations if they didn t have the best car in the field it was darn close odds 7 1 mike salinas scrappers racing maybe a bit of a stretch here but tipster has the feeling that the scrappers team is overdue for a big showing that s more than just a hunch since they qualified third fifth and third in the three swing events and finished with a pair of semifinals they ve also moved from no 11 to no 6 in the points since epping odds 8 1 brittany force monster energy flavor pak first the good news the monster team swept qualifying at all three swing races with a 3 69 in sonoma and a pair of 3 71s in denver and pomona now the tough part sunday netted three straight quarterfinal losses obviously this car can deliver amazing performances at any time so the wins will come it s just a matter of when odds 9 1 doug kalitta mac tools something has got to give here and soon because this is the most un kalitta like year of his career ten races in we ve come to expect more than two runner up finishes but the good news is that there is still some time to right the ship before the start of the countdown he s got two wins in topeka and this track has historically been good to the kalitta team so this would be the perfect place to turn things around odds 10 1 justin ashley strutmasters com the strutmasters team got a lot of credit for skipping the pomona final when they had a driver who was clearly not healthy enough to race and rightfully so now they ve got a perfect chance to make up for it with another solid outing here it s likely to be hot again on race day but they ll undoubtedly be better prepared for it odds 12 1 funny car robert hight auto club chevy the auto club team has won in topeka three times including the most recent event in 2019 on top of that they ve got a pair of runner up finishes there isn t much separation at the top of the funny car field especially among the best six cars but in this case we re going to give the newlywed a slight edge odds 4 1 ron capps napa dodge two semifinals and a big win in pomona and just like that the napa dodge team has climbed from fifth to first place in the camping world funny car standings now the big question is can they stay there of course they can and with four topeka wins to fall back on there is every chance they could extend their lead this weekend odds 5 1 alexis dejoria rokit bandero premium tequila toyota a 6 3 record on the swing was probably not exactly what the bandero team was looking for but they ve been steadily building up to something good this season and it wouldn t surprise anyone if they had a monster second half we really like their results in qualifying where they are no 6 or better in nine of ten events so far this season that tends to make life easier on race day odds 6 1 matt hagan mopar pennzoil dodge the western swing started with so much promise with a win in denver and a runner up in sonoma but it ended with a giant thud following a rare round one loss in pomona honestly that should be little more than a speedbump for a team that generally contends for wins on a weekly basis he s also got a history in topeka with a win in 2016 and a runner up in 2017 odds 7 1 bob tasca iii motorcraft quick lane ford for the first time since las vegas in march the motorcraft team is not leading the points following a tough weekend in pomona the big question now is how will they respond the good news is they only need to make up five points on current leader capps and that can be done in one round of qualifying expect to see a very quick rebound here odds 8 1 j r todd dhl toyota nobody likes losing a final but even a runner up in pomona had to feel good for the dhl crew after a tough start to the western swing conditions in topeka likely won t be too much different than what we had in pomona so it s reasonable to expect a couple more win lights here for all their troubles they do have a win in three final rounds in the first ten events of 2021 odds 9 1 john force blue def chevy heartland motorsports park is another track that has historically been good to the 16 time champ with nine wins in 15 final rounds since the inaugural event here in 1989 he s also coming off a solid race in pomona where he came from the no 12 qualifying spot to ambush matt hagan in round one and then stop old rival cruz pedregon in the quarterfinals odds 10 1 tim wilkerson levi ray shoup ford a two time finalist in topeka he s comping off a tough race in pomona but lately the lrs team has done well particularly in qualifying they ve been to four semifinals this season and it doesn t take a lot of imagination to see them going to a final in the near future all they need is a break or two odds 12 1 pro stock greg anderson hendrickcars com camaro we re going to leave him at no 1 for now because he continues to dominate in qualifying and he is the current points leader and he s still winning rounds that being said he s lost to aaron stanfield in three of his last four events and there is no doubt that the tide is turning in the pro stock class odds 3 1 aaron stanfield janac bros camaro when he jumped into pro stock a few years ago we all knew this kid would be good and now he s fulfilling those expectations with wins in three of the last four events much like his dad he never seems to get rattled and somehow finds a way to get the job done odds 4 1 erica enders melling elite camaro remember the last time we ran pro stock in topeka it was 2018 and the four time champ narrowly avoided a disaster during pro mod eliminations and came back to post a runner up in pro stock against deric kramer hopefully there won t be nearly that much drama this year odds 5 1 matt hartford total seal camaro we ll stick with the total seal team for the no 4 spot this week because well they are ranked no 4 in the camping world standings and can legitimately claim to have a top four car in a class that is often separated by thousandths lately their results have been solid with two quarterfinals and a semifinal in norwalk that s decent but they can do better odds 6 1 kyle koretsky lucas oil nitrofish camaro so far he s got 17 races under his belt in a pro stock car and has a runner up and four semifinals which isn t too shabby considering the level of competition he s facing obviously the next step is a victory and we re betting he gets one or more before the end of the season honestly there is no reason why it couldn t happen right here odds 7 1 dallas glenn rad torque systems camaro driving a pro stock car is hard winning in a pro stock car is even more difficult but he s made it look relatively easy this season that being said there have been a few rough spots including the last race in pomona where he struggled in qualifying and paid the price for it in round one with a tough loss to kyle koretsky those things happen from time to time no reason to panic here odds 8 1 troy coughlin jr jegs com camaro it s pretty easy to get frustrated in this class because even the best teams struggle from time to time but we ve all seen flashes of brilliance from this kid and it s just a matter of time before the planets align for his first pro win it might be taking a bit longer than he d wanted but it s coming odds 10 1 mason mcgaha harlow sammons camaro the harlow sammons team gets a boost this weekend with the return of their leader lester that figures to provide both a spark and an emotional lift following a tough stretch ironically mason s career statistics match fellow young gun kyle koretsky s with a win and four semifinals in 17 career pro stock events odds 12 1

photo credit shutterstock royalty free stock photo id 143103844 senate s inaction rallies equine advocates to lobby against passage of infrastructure package if taken up by the house we are disappointed the senate continues to treat the ongoing slaughter of tens of thousands of horses as anything but an urgent matter marty irby executive director at animal wellness action washington dc united states august 10 2021 einpresswire com today the u s senate passed a trillion dollar infrastructure bill without any provision to ban the export of live horses to canada and mexico for slaughter for human consumption putting in jeopardy the anti slaughter provision comfortably adopted more than a month ago in the house by a voice vote the senate assembled anew its infrastructure bill taking the house bill and number h r 3684 the invest act but little else the senate effectively stripped an amendment led by u s reps troy carter d la brian fitzpatrick r pa john katko r n y dina titus d nev and steve cohen d tenn and conceived by animal wellness action to h r 3684 that would have banned the transport of equines across state and federal lines for the purposes of slaughter for human consumption u s senator bob menendez d n j made an attempt to keep the anti slaughter transport language in play by filing his own amendment 2296 but that effort gained no momentum with few senators treating the anti slaughter provision in a serious minded way even though the house took the issue up and the subject has been the subject of action and discussion during the formulation of the annual senate agriculture spending bill â we are disappointed the senate continues to treat the ongoing slaughter of tens of thousands of horses as anything but an urgent matter â said marty irby executive director at animal wellness action who was recently honored by her majesty queen elizabeth ii for his work to protect horses â here was an opportunity to solve a major animal welfare problem that the american public overwhelmingly supports and thatâ s been circulating in the senate for a quarter century house members should vote against the senate passed infrastructure bill or amend the measure to restore the anti slaughter language â â weâ ve watched tens of thousands of horses endure a horrible passage to canada and mexico every year and then get slaughtered at foreign abattoirs for a small segment of consumers in asia and europe â said wayne pacelle president of the center for a humane economy â americans want to see this ruthless and predatory industry stop gathering up and victimizing american horses and burros failing to take up this issue was a terrible missed opportunity for the senate â the measure was been endorsed by more than 229 animal and equine protection and advocacy groups organizations rescues and businesses in the u s including the jockey club the breedersâ cup new york racing association which operates the belmont stakes pimlico racetrack which operates the preakness stakes the thoroughbred aftercare alliance the national thoroughbred welfare organization u s harness racing alumni association claiborne farm stone farm where three kentucky derby winners were raised crawford farms west point thoroughbreds nick zito pin oak stud the texas state horse council winterstone pictures the horses for life foundation the animal wellness foundation and center for a humane economy to name a few the house passed provision was also led by reps jan schakowsky d ill and vern buchanan the lead authors of the save americaâ s forgotten equines safe act the stand alone anti horse slaughter bill reps paul tonko d n y and andy barr r ky co chairs of the congressional horse caucus and reps buddy carter r ga donald payne d n j guy reschenthaler r pa and jerry nadler d n y background horses and other equines are revered and cherished in the united states and 80 percent of americans oppose their slaughter for human consumption as public awareness has grown of the inherent cruelty involved in the horse slaughter industry calls for a federal response have grown louder especially as the federal bureau of land management blm has been implicated in a suspect adoption plan that is allowing â adoptersâ to rake in profits by selling unprecedented numbers of federal protected wild horses and burros to slaughter transport of horses for slaughter is unsafe and has caused multiple serious accidents on american highways the list is long of serious accidents on american highways involving trucks loaded with horses bound for slaughter most of these involve horrific injuries to and deaths of horses on the trucks as recently as october 2020 14 horses were killed and 11 badly injured when a truck driving the animals to slaughter flipped on a highway in franklin county missouri similar accidents have happened over the years and in most motorists had to avoid the accident and in some cases encountered terrified and injured horses running loose in the lanes of traffic similarly in 2017 a truck belonging to the infamous kill buyers who own one of the nationâ s largest horse slaughter holding facilities in bastrop louisiana was involved in a terrible crash that led to the deaths of 19 horses while horse slaughter does not currently occur on u s soil due to a de facto ban achieved through the congressional appropriations process tens of thousands of domestic and wild horses are shipped to mexico and canada each year to be slaughtered for human consumption in those countries europe asia and other parts of the world stand alone legislation that would permanently ban both the transportation of slaughter bound horses and slaughter itself â the safe act â was recently introduced but despite the passage of a similar bill fifteen years ago and the majority of house members cosponsoring the measure in the 116th congress enactment of the legislation continues to be an uphill battle due to industrial agriculture interests and pro slaughter members of congress animal wellness action action is a washington d c based 501 c 4 organization with a mission of helping animals by promoting legal standards forbidding cruelty we champion causes that alleviate the suffering of companion animals farm animals and wildlife we advocate for policies to stop dogfighting and cockfighting and other forms of malicious cruelty and to confront factory farming and other systemic forms of animal exploitation to prevent cruelty we promote enacting good public policies and we work to enforce those policies to enact good laws we must elect good lawmakers and thatâ s why we remind voters which candidates care about our issues and which ones donâ t we believe helping animals helps us all the center for a humane economy â the centerâ is a non profit organization that focuses on influencing the conduct of corporations to forge a humane economic order the first organization of its kind in the animal protection movement the center encourages businesses to honor their social responsibilities in a culture where consumers investors and other key stakeholders abhor cruelty and the degradation of the

caregiver we are advocates for getting veterinarians to the front lines of the animal welfare movement promoting responsible pet ownership and vaccinating animals against infectious diseases such as

leah covered this development this morning the biden white house isn t looking to enact a nationwide covid vaccine mandate but will probably implement measures that pretty much make it impossible for anyone to do anything without getting the shot there is no mandate but there is one seems to be the playbook here the new action item is to mandate vaccination for interstate travel all of this while covid infected illegals are shipped all over the country but whatever right the associated press said that they re not going to push it since it would be too polarizing for the moment so is this

series the track hosted two races a year for the next two decades frank craig s father worked security for those races and craig said he attended almost all of them â i used to sit back there where the fence line was and watch them come in â he said â we would get here early probably 6 or 7 o clock in the morning when we got here nascar would fix breakfast for everybody that worked here so i got to meet all the drivers and the officials â the track contributed to the careers of many of nascar s future stars the names of junior johnson lee and richard petty david pearson fireball roberts and ralph earnhardt can all be found on the track s winner board craig met the man who would become the king when he was just starting out â he cleaned his hands walked over to the truck got a picture of his 62 plymouth and asked me what my name was â he said â back then everyone called me frankie so he signed it frankie richard petty â that led to an exchange that became humorous in hindsight when craig showed the autographed picture to his father â he said well i ll tell you one thing he won t be no lee petty â craig recalled laughing despite nascar s growing popularity the neighbors increasingly complained about the large crowds and the noise after one last race in 1968 which petty won after a battle with pearson the league walked away and the track fell silent for good fortunately not all tracks shared the same fate wake county speedway opened as a dirt track in 1962 was paved in 1987 and last year was designated a home track by nascar track managers said among other things that means help obtaining tires for the drivers unlike what you see in the nascar cup series vuncannon said each driver receives two fresh tires per event those tires must last him through qualifying and any races he enters in a night on july 9 showers and storms popped up throughout the triangle all afternoon one briefly passed over wake county speedway forcing a rain delay vuncannon and several other drivers took their cars slowly around the track using the heat from their low mounted engines to help dry the pavement after a shortened qualifying period the track was back in business despite the high speed action on the track vuncannon said the best races happen when drivers let things settle in for a few laps before they start making their moves â when people start to give it all they got to start with people wind up tearing stuff up and that ain t a lot of fun â he said vuncannon ended up getting in much more racing than he expected although he had planned to only run in the 60 lap late model race at the end of the evening he stepped in at the last minute in place of another driver in the track s mod 4 class similar to the late models but using four cylinder engines instead of v 8s vuncannon said such arrangements are not uncommon when the green flag at last dropped on vuncannon s late model race he was on the front row the eight cars in the field weren t the most he had faced but he said they were enough to put on a good show vuncannon stayed near the front for the entire race finishing second â we got a little bit to work on to catch that 7 car â he said in the pits afterward â but we ll find it we ll figure it out â vuncannon the other drivers on the track and the fans are all part of a multi billion dollar industry a 2003 study by unc charlotte the only comprehensive study done to date found the motorsports industry s direct and indirect impacts added just over 5 billion to north carolina s economy more than 24 000 people were employed in some way by the motorsports industry the total value added came to just over 1 of the gross state product for vuncannon though the importance of stock car racing goes beyond its economic impact â there s not much like it it s good people good family fun good fellowship and good entertainment â he said

keith roysdon special to the star press if buying a home is stressful anytime what s it like buying a home in 2021 it s crazy ashley donnelly said with a laugh the market is all over the place it s wild just wild homebuyers like donnelly a ball state university professor and published author and home sellers and professionals in the real estate industry all agree they ve never seen such a bizarre time to buy and sell a home homes are in short supply in markets from richmond to muncie to lafayette and across indiana the experts say that if you can find a house in your desired area and for your desired price point be ready to buy it and be ready to pay more than the asking price sometimes thousands of dollars more and be ready to snap up that home quickly you have to be pre approved with a lender and ready to jump on something that pops up said donna penticuff a muncie real estate broker i know the minute i list a house the same day the same day i have five showings and receive an offer in the first hour said donna spears a richmond realtor i ve had houses sell before they were listed spears added there is no inventory it s zero most housing markets are almost as house poor available houses are almost non existent many sell immediately and sell for well above the asking price it s bizarre to see bidding wars for homes in delaware county said muncie realtor steve slavin you think that happens in fishers or carmel but it s happening here we ve not had this kind of market before said lafayette realtor cheryl butcher houses are a hot commodity the way new vehicles are hard to find now and toilet paper and lysol were hard to find in the early days of the pandemic incredible shrinking housing supply a shortage of new cars and trucks can be tracked back to hard to find chips for onboard computers the chip shortage and almost everything else we ve heard about this summer the labor shortage fresh food shortage fast food shortage can be blamed on a shortfall of workers not enough people are producing shipping selling and serving up the products we demand running on empty supply chain problems high demand mean sparse car selection but what about the weird housing market not surprisingly it goes back to supply and demand and it s a problem years in the making the collapse of the housing market in the late 2000s during the great recession drove many homebuilders out of business some communities have seen relatively few new housing units built in recent years particularly to replace housing stock dating to the mid 20th century the federal reserve cut interest rates not long after the covid 19 pandemic began said lavone whitmer a veteran financial professional at the same time she said the federal government began buying mortgage backed securities stay informed and support local journalism subscribe today using the link at the top of this page mortgage loan rates have been cheap she added which meant that more people started buying homes which meant that the number of available homes dropped a few years ago it was common for delaware county to have 600 homes on the market said slavin in busier times i would have had over 1 100 a few years ago it was 600 last year it dropped to 300 then 200 the first of the year it was down to 75 we now have a whopping 133 homes in the entire county on the market slavin said faced with being sequestered in their homes almost non stop in spring 2020 working in their homes studying in their homes schooling their kids in their homes people wanted to either fix up their homes or move but there was a pause while people wondered if the companies they worked for would survive the pandemic slavin said and then the market jumped as people decided to sell or buy a home the demand kicked home prices higher home prices follow demand in lafayette butcher said the average home price was about 120 000 as of 10 years ago then 220 000 a year ago and stands at 276 781 now butcher said it s not that home prices have gone up that much without any other influence it s that houses are selling we don t have the foreclosure market lower interest rates mean that we re seeing 500 000 homes sell much faster than we would have in the past in lafayette she said some homebuilding is under way which could help alleviate some pressure on the market but what used to take three months a builder is probably looking out a year they are overwhelmed as well in the muncie area slavin said the average sale price was around 135 000 but the feeding frenzy is between 80 000 and 200 000 spears the richmond realtor who serves as one of nine real estate commissioners for indiana said a national association of realtors economist predicted a housing shortage three years ago you could see a few of the signs she said normal human being pricing donnelly a professor in the telecommunications department at ball state knew that her family would be moving and kept an eye on the market we got our pre approval in april and the second we got it we started looking we re in the normal human being range of pricing she said right now you can have a lovely crack house or a 600 000 house we were looking for four bedrooms in the 200 000 market donnelly said they were surprised how quickly slavin found a home for them the process took from april to august nevertheless her family missed out on three houses because people were coming in with cash which we couldn t do we were a normal loan donnelly said they ultimately paid 1 000 over the asking price hicks what is quality of place real estate professionals say that the area the nation really is a seller s market right now nick irving and his family had a new home lined up to purchase from a relative when they decided to put their home in the country village addition north of muncie on the market our country village house went on the market on a friday we had a few showings and by saturday morning we had an offer for it irving said the offer made on their home topped the asking price by 10 000 i knew it would move quickly but irving said it s a crazy competitive market right now it would be a great time to have a few extra houses return to normal when does the real estate market get back to normal or will it ever whitmer the financial professional noted the federal eviction moratorium which was recently extended by two months is currently scheduled to end in october that means some houses will go back on the market quickly but that also means that some of the people who are evicted will be looking elsewhere when that goes away the people not making payments a significant number of people living in their houses for as long as possible will decide it ll be less costly for them to not try to catch up on their past payments and let their house go and then look for another house she said nobody wants to work why are businesses struggling to find workers i believe it s going to be slow but we ll see an uptick spears said if anyone is thinking about next year they ll accelerate their schedule slavin said that the housing market will continue like it is through the second quarter of next year we ll continue to see low supply strong demand prices continue to rise and rates continue to be great he said the downside now is if they can t find what they re looking for now where will they go interstate 69 exit 210 fishers fortville i just don t think our inventory problem will solve itself anytime soon
