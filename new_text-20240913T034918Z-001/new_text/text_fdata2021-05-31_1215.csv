u s financial authorities are preparing to take a more active role in regulating 1 5 billion cryptocurrency market the lack of proper supervision with growing concern risks damaging savers and investors the new effort reflects a break with the trump administration which in some cases encouraged the use of cryptocurrencies in the financial system but it may take time for us regulators to struggle to find out who has the legal authority to oversee the unstable market in an interview with the financial times michael hsu who was installed as a currency controller this month said he hoped u s officials would work together to establish a regulatory perimeter for cryptocurrencies it s really about inter agency coordination said hsu head of the finance department which oversees national banks when i talk to some of my classmates there s an interest in coordinating these things a lot more cryptocurrencies have been rolling down the roller coaster this year in february the price of bitcoin rose tesla founder elon musk he said the company pledged 1 5 billion in the cryptocurrency and set a record high of 60 000 in april but the price went down after chinese regulators expressed opposition to the use of digital coins musk reversed the move to allow bitcoin payments for tesla cars citing environmental concerns other cryptocurrencies have had similar volatility a sign of the new u s approach came this month with the first meeting of an inter agency crypto sprint group attended by officials from three major federal regulatory banks the hsu currency controller s office the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corporation hsu said the group s goal was not to do politics but to put some ideas in front of the agency to consider while trying to regain growth cryptocurrencys it s small and it s old hsu said of the team the idea is that time is of the essence and if it s too big it gets complicated the securities and exchange commission and the futures commodity trading committee have discussed how to protect investors in the cryptocurrency market recommended gary gensler president of the sec told a house committee last week that there are gaps in our system pointing out the potential need for legislation to determine whether legislation should oversee cryptographic exchanges gensler said his goal is to bring similar protections to exchanges where you trade cryptocurrencies as you would expect on the new york stock exchange or the nasdaq gensler said the treasury department has relied on protection against money laundering and illegal activity in the crypto market finance secretary janet yellen said the fear is that bitcoin is often used for illegal financing by installing hsu occ yellen also noted a change in approach to crypto hsu in his words is a career civil servant and bank supervisor at my base among the predecessors of donald trump s subordinate occ brian brooks former head of cryptocurrency law at coinbase is now ceo of binance usa rival crypto exchange hsu was one of the first acts of the occ to ask employees to review trump s decision at the time to issue letters of confidence to companies that offer cryptocurrency surveillance services although hsu believes there is no turning back from innovations such as blockchain technology used in cryptocurrencies this month s congressional testimony said the current enthusiasm for banking innovation reminded him of the years before the financial crisis the risk is that new and improved techniques will create a large and less regulated shadow banking system he said today that fintech and technology platforms are inventing payment processing tools but also risks it s hard for me not to feel some déjà vu hsu told lawmakers
both tech veterans offer reasons to buy but one is the superior investment right now cisco systems csco 1 60 and international business machines ibm 1 73 faced challenges in recent times despite a storied history as tech icons there s the coronavirus pandemic of course but other factors such as the technology industry s shift to cloud computing forced cisco and ibm to evolve in significant ways both took different paths in this evolution experiencing success along the way compelling reasons exist to invest in each but is there a clear winner between the two let s evaluate these tech titans to understand why one emerges as the better investment at this time cisco s path forward as part of its evolution in the era of cloud computing cisco built up a suite of software products to reduce reliance on its computer networking hardware business this proved a prescient move in light of the coronavirus pandemic last year cisco contended with supply chain challenges created by the pandemic this constraint caused year over year revenue to drop by 5 in its 2020 fiscal year which ended july 25 the pandemic could have hurt revenue further if not for cisco s software business its cybersecurity offerings saw fiscal 2020 revenue grow 12 year over year cisco also invested in technology to support a slew of new growth opportunities these include capabilities for 5g networks the internet of things and 400g which involves next gen technology to address bandwidth demands and other technical challenges related to cloud computing these investments are paying off particularly as the pandemic s end draws closer in the united states revenue returned to an upward trajectory in cisco s fiscal third quarter ended may 1 increasing 7 year over year to 12 8 billion that s just the start of its success cisco experienced 10 growth in third quarter product orders this was the strongest demand cisco has seen since the 2012 fiscal year cisco is not only relying on the latest technology trends to power revenue growth the company moved its software products to a software as a service subscription model which gives cisco a reliable recurring revenue stream cisco has successfully navigated this transition its q3 subscription revenue comprised 81 of software sales up from 76 the previous quarter the company is also bundling its products this is a smart move any client purchasing networking hardware will also need cisco s security solutions to protect from criminals hacking that network security is essential in the it industry so it s no surprise cisco saw q3 revenue for its security products increase 13 year over year as the pandemic s impact recedes cisco sees its business returning to revenue growth the company expects fourth quarter revenue to rise at least 6 year over year ibm s evolution ibm is navigating its own challenges aside from the coronavirus pandemic big blue is in the midst of a multi year transformation its business suffered years of revenue declines as clients moved away from its on premises technology offerings to cloud computing ibm has existed for over a century so it s well versed in adapting to the technology industry s changes the company shifted its focus to cloud computing in recent years and these efforts have proven successful ibm grew cloud based income from just 4 of total revenue in 2013 to 34 in 2020 ibm s cloud efforts led to total cloud revenue of 6 5 billion in the first quarter of this year a 21 year over year increase yet some of its legacy businesses weighed on ibm s cloud success the company s global technology services segment which helps clients implement ibm s solutions saw year over year revenue drop 1 5 this division represents more than a third of ibm s total revenue bringing in 6 4 billion of q1 s 17 7 billion as part of ibm s strategy to focus on its cloud computing and artificial intelligence strengths it plans to spin off a portion of the operations under its global technology services division into a new company called kyndryl kyndryl will help clients modernize it infrastructures serving as a partner to ibm s offerings the spinoff will happen by the end of this year the verdict ibm s cloud success is appealing and once it separates out kyndryl big blue s cloud business will benefit without kyndryl s drag on earnings but the value of owning shares in kyndryl is murky that s why i think it s best to wait on ibm shares until the kyndryl spinoff that way you can effectively evaluate whether you want to own a piece of this new company meanwhile cisco remains a market leader in its core networking business its q3 results show the company is on an upward trajectory as the pandemic s impact starts to fade its investments in up and coming trends such as 5g provide years of revenue growth opportunity these factors make cisco the better investment right now
the combination of stability and innovation makes these giants safe bets for long term returns despite the stories of newly minted crypto millionaires building wealth through investing typically takes time one way to find companies that will create wealth in the future is by looking at those that have generated it in the past that means asking which companies adapted to all kinds of economic conditions and industry changes over decades pfizer pfe 1 72 and johnson johnson jnj 1 37 are two companies that bolster their strong resumes with clear strategies for the future investors looking for the recipe to becoming a millionaire might find all the ingredients they need in two of the most well known companies in the healthcare industry 1 pfizer the 153 year old pharmaceutical giant has undergone a transformation in recent years it needed to after returning nearly 4 000 between 1980 and 2000 the stock climbed a mere 20 over the next 20 years first it created a joint venture of its consumer health business with glaxosmithkline s in 2019 next it spun off upjohn its off patent and generics business with the assets of mylan that formed viatris vtrs 0 93 ceo albert bourla hoped the remains would be an organization with a singular focus on scientific discovery it didn t take long to see signs of the vision coming true the company expanded its partnership with biontech and helped create comirnaty the first vaccine using messenger rna mrna to ever be authorized by this past march pfizer and biontech had shipped 430 million doses to 91 countries many see the need for the vaccine lasting beyond the pandemic much like a flu vaccine pfizer is prepared with plans to produce up to three billion doses in 2022 bourla expects more breakthroughs like comirnaty in the future the company already has many blockbusters it s best sellers prevnar and eliquis drugs to prevent blood clots and pneumonia respectively along with breast cancer treatment ibrance generated more than 16 billion in revenue last year however bourla is focused on the future the company s pipeline contains 99 new therapies or potential new applications for an existing drug management has also said to expect acquisitions of drug candidates in phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials both the pipeline and deals are designed to be revenue producing in the back half of the decade that would provide long term visibility to a business expected to generate 72 billion in revenue this year the company has also signaled its intent to become a leader in using mrna technology to develop treatments it even upped its projected spending on research and development to account for the move pfizer might be a worthwhile investment based solely on the legacy business the 46 million in expected non covid revenue this year and 4 dividend yield would attract a lot of buyers combining that with the mega blockbuster covid vaccine and a robust pipeline make it even more attractive the top line grew 8 in the most recent quarter not counting comirnaty if management s moves can sustain that level of growth an investment in pfizer should beat the market over time 2 johnson johnson johnson johnson is one of the best known brands in healthcare it s also been a fixture on fortune s most admired companies list for 19 straight years the last eight were as the most admired pharmaceutical company that ranking may be built on a storied past rather than recent performance for one the stock has consistently underperformed the broader s p 500 index over the last decade like pfizer the period from 40 to 20 years ago was stellar period s p 500 total return j j total return 1 year 41 20 3 years 63 51 5 years 120 71 10 years 287 237 20 years 389 488 30 years 1 920 2 770 40 years 2 260 5 270 one drag has been the prevalence of litigation since 2013 the company has either settled lost judgement or is in the midst of litigation for flawed hip implants asbestos in its talc baby powder illegally marketing its antipsychotic drug and its creation of a super poppy that may have contributed to the u s opioid crisis despite the legal issues the business itself has been the model of consistency since 2015 revenue has grown between 2 3 and 3 3 every year while the gross margin has held steady between 66 and 70 the stability can be attributed to diversification its consumer health pharmaceuticals and medical devices segments account for 17 55 and 28 of last year s 82 7 billion in revenue respectively it s also diversified geographically with more than half of sales coming from outside the united states geography percent of 2020 revenue united states 52 western hemisphere ex u s 6 europe 23 asia pacific 18 the tide of underperformance may be turning revenue grew 5 5 in the recently reported first quarter thanks to 12 2 growth outside the united states the company upped its guidance for the full year anticipating between 8 7 and 9 9 revenue growth beyond the recovery in 2021 johnson johnson is investing to remain a leader in each of its segments like pfizer it has a robust drug pipeline johnson johnson believes it could have 10 new filings in 2021 with 13 in 2022 and 26 in 2023 its cancer drugs are a particular bright spot the company s oncology drugs produced 2 billion in sales a decade ago in the most recent quarter alone they delivered 3 6 billion and grew 15 year over year it is also innovating in hardware among the medical devices it plans to launch this year is the velys robotic system for knee replacements it is a first of its kind table mounted device that blends data and digitization to provide insight before during and after the surgery johnson johnson is the epitome of stability and diversification in the healthcare industry despite a strong reputation the stock has underperformed for a generation and shareholders have had to stomach embarrassing litigation however with 59 consecutive years of dividend raises the stock now yields 2 5 and innovative products to drive future growth the stock is one of the safest ways to build wealth an investor can find the company s shares belong in the portfolio of anyone that fears a loss of capital but still wants the growth associated with owning stocks
these two pot companies with smart growth strategies are heading for a fruitful future while the world still fights the coronavirus the pandemic induced marijuana boom is taking the industry to great heights cannabis was deemed an essential item in the u s during the lockdown which spiked sales the momentum continues even this year which is helping u s cannabis companies generate more revenue and profits among them massachusetts based curaleaf holdings curlf 2 79 and florida based trulieve cannabis tcnnf 2 97 have the potential to be top contenders in the cannabis space these two are smart with their growth strategies and have established themselves well in the u s cannabis market their recent first quarter 2021 results are proof of that trulieve also grabbed a lot of attention in may after it announced its acquisition of arizona based cannabis company harvest health recreation hrvsf for a deal valued at 2 1 billion let s take a look at how 2021 is looking for these two pot companies and why i believe they have the potential to be millionaire makers curaleaf s smart growth strategies are paving its road to success smart and timely acquisitions have been a driving factor in curaleaf s outstanding revenue growth in its first quarter of 2021 ended march 31 revenue came in at 260 million up 170 year over year the company saw a surge in both retail and wholesale revenue but a 231 boost in retail revenue to 188 million was particularly impressive and can be attributed to organic growth across all its existing stores and contributions from six new stores across florida maine and pennsylvania the company had a total of 102 stores at the end of the first quarter and even recorded some retail revenue in arizona where recreational marijuana became legal in january the company s select brand a line of cannabis oil that it acquired from cura partners in february for 948 8 million was mostly responsible for a 254 jump in wholesale revenue to 72 million from the year ago period higher revenue brought in another quarter of positive earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda of 63 million a 213 year over year increase curaleaf is not profitable yet but many of the acquisitions it completed in 2020 including cannabis manufacturers and dispensaries across the nation such as curaleaf nj arrow meot remedy blue kudu and alternative therapies group are yet to show their full potential these will help bolster revenue growth and bring in profits trulieve cannabis is on its way to becoming a powerhouse trulieve cannabis grabbed a lot of attention with its decision to acquire harvest health which will give the company a stronghold over a thriving marijuana market in the northeast southeast and southwest regions this deal subject to shareholder approval in the third quarter will add key markets like arizona pennsylvania and maryland to trulieve s national footprint the company expects to generate close to 1 2 billion in revenue and 461 million in adjusted ebitda in 2021 with the help of this acquisition which is giving it access to 126 dispensaries in 11 states trulieve has already shown a rocking start to 2021 recording revenue growth of 102 year over year to 194 million in its q1 ended march 31 its grip on the medical cannabis segment in its home state of florida where it has a total of 78 dispensaries drove the growth florida currently only allows medical cannabis for q1 adjusted ebitda also came in at 91 million up 87 from the year ago period despite an increase in operating expenses to 57 million from 29 million in q1 2020 management s continued expansion plans led to a rise in operating expenses but its positive ebitda demonstrates it s been able to grow revenue while managing its costs meanwhile net profits the company s earnings after all the deductions came in at 30 million a 27 increase from the year ago period for the full year of 2021 trulieve expects to see revenue in the range of 815 million to 850 million and adjusted ebitda in the range of 355 million to 375 million keep in mind that these figures exclude the impact of the harvest acquisition make way for the two millionaire makers a company s ability to thrive in an evolving industry can be determined by the way it uses its capital resources in employing smart growth strategies while keeping the balance sheet stable both curaleaf and trulieve have managed this curaleaf ended its q1 with cash of 315 million though it also has 340 million of outstanding debt net of unamortized debt discounts these debt bond discounts are the difference between the face value of a bond and the amount paid for it by investors meanwhile trulieve ended its q1 with cash and cash equivalents of 162 million and total outstanding debt of 86 million curaleaf has a lot of debt on its hands but we can already see the growth it is deriving from its strategic acquisitions in 2020 which should help drive revenue and profits this year and beyond trulieve s acquisition of harvest which i believe to be a very smart move will also help it capture a wide chunk of the u s cannabis market bringing in more earnings these factors will allow both companies to clear off their outstanding debts state legalization is ramping up with the probability of federal legalization also rising stellar revenue growth profits smart growth strategies stable balance sheets and an expanding national footprint make a strong case for these two cannabis stocks to become millionaire makers over the long term
it wasn t exactly a dirt cheap purchase after all 2 1 billion is hardly pocket change but ambitious florida marijuana company trulieve cannabis tcnnf 2 97 is ponying up such a pile of its stock anyway to buy west coast peer harvest health recreation hrvsf as he reveals in this segment from motley fool live veteran fool contributor eric volkman thinks this is money well technically company stock well spent he explains his reasons why with healthcare and cannabis bureau chief corinne cardina this video was recorded on may 21 here s the marijuana stock you ve been waiting for a little known canadian company just unlocked what some experts think could be the key to profiting off the coming marijuana boom and make no mistake it is coming cannabis legalization is sweeping over north america 15 states plus washington d c have all legalized recreational marijuana over the last few years and full legalization came to canada in october 2018 and one under the radar canadian company is poised to explode from this coming marijuana revolution because a game changing deal just went down between the ontario government and this powerhouse company and you need to hear this story today if you have even considered investing in pot stocks simply click here to get the full story now learn more corinne cardina would you say that trulieve looks like a buy based on acquisition eric volkman yeah it s not a cheap stock and it s not a cheap stock because trulieve until now it s following harvest has been one of the very rare and very special profitable multi state operators msos they are barely multi state outside of florida until harvest again they had only small operations in these places like pennsylvania but yeah they were profitable not always and because they were one of the few profitable msos investors really latched onto them they re not cheap but what i like about trulieve is they are very good at maintaining and even expanding their market share in florida they know their market very well and i think their strategy up until now has been sensible to places that they ventured places like pennsylvania that are limited licensed states where you have only a small number of licenses and therefore theoretically low competition i think trulieve is pricey but if any marijuana stock is worth their pricing it s trulieve that profitability is going to be on the hook with harvest because harvest like a lot of its other peers is consistently unprofitable in their last reported quarter q1 they lost almost 23 million it s not the end of the world but with the combined company it s going to affect the results having said that they are growing in terms of the top line in their quarter they made almost 89 million and that was on a quarter by quarter basis 27 higher which is admirable for the most recent set of results it s higher and it was slightly more than double year on year i think trulieve is getting one of the better assets and again i like the geographical complimentary nature of it
these stocks are in a great position to grow regardless of what happens with federal cannabis reform there was a sense of euphoria among many cannabis investors after democrats regained effective control of the u s senate as well as the white house the countdown seemed to be on until major cannabis reforms were passed at the federal level however there haven t been any truly meaningful wins at the legislative level so far that doesn t mean that cannabis companies haven t made significant progress over the last few months though some of them are arguably even more attractive than they were after election day here are three top marijuana stocks to buy right now trulieve cannabis it wasn t all that long ago that trulieve cannabis tcnnf 2 97 was essentially a one state cannabis operator granted the company absolutely dominated the medical cannabis market in that one state florida and sure trulieve had taken steps to expand into other markets however there were some valid reasons to be skeptical about the company s ability to replicate its success beyond florida that s no longer the case earlier this month trulieve announced plans to acquire harvest health recreation hrvsf in an all stock transaction valued at 2 1 billion this deal will add operations in five additional states for trulieve including the fast growing markets in arizona and nevada the acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021 assuming there are no roadblocks trulieve should soon boost its estimated total addressable market by more than 50 the combined company will also be the most profitable u s multistate operator based on adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda in the meantime trulieve continues to deliver sizzling growth all on its own the company s sales more than doubled year over year in the first quarter thanks mainly to expansion in florida trulieve also posted strong earnings growth the addition of harvest will make this winning marijuana stock even more attractive jushi holdings although there hasn t been tangible progress in recent months at the federal level in improving the outlook for the u s cannabis industry it s a different story at the state level for example virginia s legislature voted to legalize adult use recreational marijuana that should present a great opportunity for jushi holdings jushf 3 45 virginia isn t exactly in a hurry the state s adult use market won t open until 2024 however that actually could work to jushi s advantage the company already owns a medical cannabis license in northern virginia home to almost 30 of the state s population look for jushi to build up its brand in the medical cannabis market over the next couple of years that could give it a strong competitive position for the recreational market that s on the way jushi s growth prospects aren t dependent just on virginia though the company has operations in california illinois nevada and pennsylvania with acquisitions pending in massachusetts and ohio scotts miracle gro investors who might be a little skittish about buying shares of a pure play pot stock have several appealing alternatives i think that scotts miracle gro smg 4 98 ranks as one of the best you re probably at least somewhat familiar with scotts line of consumer lawn and garden products that business remains the company s biggest source of revenue generating roughly three quarters of total sales in the latest quarter however scotts main growth driver now is its hawthorne segment hawthorne is a leading supplier of hydroponics and gardening products to the cannabis industry its revenue soared 66 year over year in scotts fiscal second quarter ceo jim hagedorn said in the company s q2 conference call whether we see federal reform with this administration or not clearly the momentum at the state level is not slowing down we ll see more markets open and create more opportunities for growth i think he s right
many retail analysts and pundits fear that the q1 sales recovery wasn t sustainable but the evidence suggests that sales trends will strengthen further over the next few quarters earlier this month macy s m 2 54 reported that sales beat the high end of its guidance range by about 10 in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 this helped drive a huge earnings beat excluding asset sale gains adjusted earnings per share actually surpassed the company s q1 2019 performance despite these surprisingly strong results many analysts and retail pundits continue to take a dim view of macy s however recent commentary by executives at macerich mac 3 78 one of the biggest mall owners in the u s suggests that macy s post pandemic recovery is just beginning skepticism abounds macy s stock has quadrupled since bottoming out last spring and now trades for a little more than its pre pandemic price many wall street analysts view this as an overreaction the average wall street price target is barely higher than macy s current stock price and bears far outnumber bulls within the analyst community retail pundits hold similar views most of the experts who contributed to a recent retailwire discussion about macy s first quarter results doubt that the company can sustain its recent success several noted that while macy s sales surged 56 year over year last quarter total sales still fell 14 5 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 other experts suggested that pent up demand could boost revenue in the near term but would eventually subside still others pointed to the risk that demand will fade as stimulus programs wind down promising data points from a big mall owner while q1 sales exceeded management s expectations the quarter started off slowly foot traffic and in store sales improved dramatically starting in march if sales trends remain in line with march april levels that alone would imply sequential acceleration compared to the first quarter which was weighed down by lower sales in february sure enough second quarter guidance calls for sales to decline about 10 to 12 from 2019 levels better than last quarter s 14 5 decrease furthermore store traffic isn t returning uniformly across the country macerich which owns nearly four dozen u s malls many anchored by macy s recently noted that portfoliowide tenant sales excluding food and beverage tenants exceeded 2019 levels by 2 in the first quarter however tenant sales jumped 11 5 on that basis in arizona which had fewer retail restrictions than many of macerich s other markets even as other states began loosening retail restrictions in march arizona s outperformance continued for macerich with tenant sales soaring 18 over march 2019 levels for the month again excluding food and beverage concepts in short pent up demand has driven a surge in retail traffic and sales in sun belt states like arizona in recent months similar levels of pent up demand likely exist in other regions but they haven t been fully unleashed yet this is particularly significant because like macerich this business is heavily concentrated in the northeast and along the west coast with states in those regions now reopening macy s and macerich could both benefit from a big acceleration of retail foot traffic in those markets more tailwinds on the way a rebound in store traffic in key states like california and new york should help macy s get closer to its 2019 sales volume economic reopening will also help the top department store chain in a second way as offices reopen demand for work attire which has remained low so far should bounce back that s a key market segment for macy s finally macy s usually gets 3 to 4 of its annual sales from international tourists travel restrictions have virtually eliminated that source of revenue however international tourism to the u s may start to recover later this year adding to the company s momentum heading into 2022 first quarter sales rebound surprised management analysts and most investors but considering all the factors that were still weighing on its sales last quarter the sales recovery is likely to strengthen further as 2021 progresses with further upside next year rather than petering out as the skeptics expect
these tech stocks are leading in their respective cloud markets here s why investors would be wise to pay attention cloud computing is one of the most important technology trends right now and it will

best tap into cloud computing s growth by buying shares of great tech stocks that are leaders in the cloud market to help you track down a few of those we asked three motley fool contributors for

looked back opening at 245 and closing at 255 up 113 on its first day of trading making it the biggest software ipo ever while excitement around the data warehouse and business analytics provider has

alphabet s nasdaq googl nasdaq goog google cloud among others for its 2022 fiscal first quarter ended april 30 2021 snowflake s product revenue of 214 million grew 110 year over year continuing the triple digit growth it generated last year even more impressive is the company s forecast for the current year as snowflake is guiding for fiscal 2022 product revenue growth of more than 85 at the midpoint of its guidance while the company continues to lose money it expects adjusted free cash flow to improve to breakeven this fiscal year which should assuage concerns about its lack of profits snowflake s remaining performance obligation which consists of future revenue that is under contract but has not yet been recognized surged to 1 4 billion up 206 year over year not a typo this helps to illustrate the strength of the company s ongoing subscription revenue snowflake s customer metrics are equally impressive total customers of 4 532 grew 67 year over year while growth of those spending 1 million or more over the trailing 12 month period clocked in at 117 not only is the company attracting new high paying clients but existing customers are spending more as well as evidenced by the company s net revenue retention rate of 168 if you need further proof that its customers are delighted with its services consider this snowflake boasts a net promoter score of 71 when anything above 70 is considered world class some investors will no doubt balk at snowflake s valuation as the company is priced at 59 times forward sales it s worth remembering however that the company s

emerge from this transition stronger than ever investors would do well to get on board today with a few shares of this unstoppable cloud stock the king of the cloud chris neiger amazon amazon is best known for its e commerce business but it s the company s amazon web services aws cloud computing segment that actually makes amazon the most money in the most recent quarter aws brought in 13 5 billion in sales for amazon and 4 2 billion in operating income that makes aws the most lucrative business that amazon has by far for context the company s north american e commerce sales were a staggering 64 4 billion in the same quarter but with just 3 5 billion in operating income if you re still not impressed with amazon s cloud business consider that aws is just 15 years old and it s already the largest cloud infrastructure company with 32 of the market and an annual revenue run rate of 54 billion and aws isn t finished growing the company mentioned recently that the media and entertainment industry continues to move to aws at a rapid pace and said that disney is tapping aws to expand its disney video streaming service investors may be concerned that they ve missed out on amazon s share price gains and that it s too late to invest in the company but amazon s aws is still growing and the cloud computing market still has a lot of room to expand in the coming years and with amazon s online shopping platform leading the e commerce boom in the u s the company is firing on all cylinders in nearly every business it runs all of which means that investors who are looking for one of the best long term investments in the cloud computing market need to look no further than amazon

by chen aizhu singapore reuters this year china s government has been gradually ramping up scrutiny of its sprawling oil industry reinforcing its authority with new taxes on refined products while investigating crude imports by state energy giants and independent refiners last tuesday the country s top economic planning agency gave five state owned companies just two days to report on their historic use of imported oil part of a broader effort by the world s largest oil importer to control inbound shipments as domestic supplies swell how important is china in global oil markets china is the world s largest importer and the no 2 consumer after the united states china s crude imports surged 7 3 in 2020 the only major market where oil demand grew during the covid 19 pandemic strong economic growth new refining capacity and changes in fuel taxes could spur crude imports 7 2 or 775 000 barrels per day higher this year said seng yick tee sia energy analyst but the country s refining sector is saddled with overcapacity and excess fuel supplies which beijing is keen to tackle authorities also aim to clamp down on tax evasion as well as the blending and sale of fuels that do not meet emission standards guangdong province china s top oil consuming region led the probe into illicit trades of blending fuels in february and detained several people in connection with the investigation what is the crude import investigation about beijing is looking into whether sinopec nyse group china national offshore oil corp cnooc nyse sinochem group chemchina and china north industries group which together make up more than 60 of china s total imports have resold oil to other companies in the country also under examination is whether their imports have been processed at refineries under a tolling scheme that reduces the companies tax burden the information request is part of a broader probe the beijing began early this year into a growing domestic fuel surplus and lost tax revenues partly because of unchecked flows of imported crude oil to refiners that are outside the country s official quota system it follows a separate inspection by china s national development and reform commission ndrc in april of independent refiners in the eastern province of shandong that had pledged to close ageing inefficient facilities in return for winning import quotas that inspection also covered usage of import quotas several independent plants in shandong were found to have sold quotas to other refiners who not qualified to process imported crude what is the quota system china has since late 2015 allowed more than 40 independent refiners to process imported crude under a quota system but smaller plants have been found by the government to be sourcing additional crude oil and other feedstocks such as diluted bitumen beyond quota limits leading to a domestic fuel glut beijing to start levy hefty taxes on imports of light cycle oil lco mixed aromatics and diluted bitumen from june 12 a move that is expected to curb fuel imports and improve local refiners domestic sales and profits how will these probes impact oil markets china is expected to release a second batch of crude import quotas in the coming months and these probes may prompt beijing to reduce allocated volumes to independent companies while this could curb independent buyers appetite for more supplies the state run firms which are not subject to quota management are expected to lead the purchases in december last year china issued the first batch of crude import quotas for non state companies at 122 59 million tonnes in 2021 up 18 from the first round for 2020

introduction liver cancer 1 2 including hepatocellular carcinoma hcc cholangiocarcinoma and other hepatic malignancies is the sixth most common malignant tumor among primary liver cancers hcc is one of the most common according to cancer statistics updated in 2019 the estimated number of new hcc case ranks at 14th while the estimated number of deaths from hcc ranked 5th among cancer related deaths currently hepatic resection is the main treatment for patients with early stage hcc while transarterial chemoembolization tace is preferred for patients with middle and advanced stage tumors 3 however most traditional hepatic artery embolization agents have disadvantages including low embolic selectivity incomplete embolization and insufficient embolization time among others 4 5 phytantriol pyt 6 7 is an amphiphilic molecule with both hydrophilic hydroxyl groups and hydrophobic carbon chains when pyt is dispersed in a small amount of water a very low viscosity magnetic isotropic solution is formed referred to as a precursor solution which has the advantages of good mobility and easy injection however when pyt is dispersed in sufficient water and other organic solvents it can form a high viscosity rigid liquid crystal gel which is non toxic and biocompatible hence the pyt precursor solution has the potential for use in tace and has been the subject of several reports 8 11 as the most commonly used uracil anti metabolite drug 5 fluorouracil 5 fu 12 14 has a broad spectrum of anti tumor effects further 5 fu is the most widely used drug for treatment of hcc and has clear therapeutic effects making it the first choice for treatment of advanced hcc however minimal bioavailability low selectivity obvious side effects and drug resistance limit its clinical application thus there is an urgent need to explore alternative therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes sinomenine sn 15 is the main active alkaloid extracted from sinomenium acutum it has anti inflammatory analgesic immunosuppressive antihypertensive and antiarrhythmic effects and is primarily used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis chronic gastritis morphine addiction and other diseases recently sn has been demonstrated to have strong and extensive anti tumor effects 16 17 and when used in combination with 5 fu achieves superior efficacy further some studies have demonstrated that sn has potential as a 5 fu based chemotherapy sensitizer 18 20 however the effects of sn combined with 5 fu on liver cancer cells have not previously been reported our previous studies have shown that liquid crystal gels based on pyt can be used in the articular cavity 21 skin 22 and periodontitis 23 however no systematic evaluation of the biocompatibility of pyt has been conducted the primary objective of the present study was to construct a liquid embolic agent based on pyt using sn and 5 fu as model drugs and investigate its biocompatibility anticancer activity and drug release to assess its feasibility for use in tace as a new therapeutic modality for patients with liver cancer materials and methods materials ethanol was provided by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd hefei china pyt gc 95 was purchased from tokyo chemical industry co ltd tokyo japan sn was supplied by chengdu must biotechnology co ltd chengdu china 5 fu was produced by shanghai ika biotechnology co ltd shanghai china sterilized water for injection was purchased from shanghai xinyi jinzhu pharmaceutical co ltd shanghai china methanol chromatographic grade was purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china urethane purity 99 6 was purchased from shanghai targetmol biotechnology co ltd boston usa the hepg2 cell line was purchased from jennie o biological technology co ltd guangzhou china all animals were purchased from the experimental animal center of anhui medical university hefei china and all procedures were approved by the committee on ethics of animal experiments of anhui university of chinese medicine and conducted in compliance with the national institutes of health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals preparation of precursor formulations according to the literature8 11 and previous research 21 three solutions with ratios of pyt ethanol water w w of 64 16 20 p 1 48 32 20 p 2 and 16 64 20 p 3 were selected for use in development of a tace carrier briefly pyt and ethanol were mixed in a water bath at 37 c 0 5 c and the designated amounts of water simultaneously preheated melted pyt and ethanol were vortexed to generate a uniform oily phase which was then vortex mixed with the prescribed amount of water mixtures were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the precursor liquids drug loaded preparations drug loaded p1 drug loaded p2 and drug loaded p3 were formulated by first dissolving the drugs in water and then performing the operations described above all samples were equilibrated at room temperature for at least one week and filtered through a sterile filter 0 22 μm prior to use in experiments hemolysis test preparation of red blood cell suspensions in vitro hemolysis assays were conducted using red blood cells rbcs the hemolytic activity of samples was analyzed by quantification of the released hemoglobin by spectrophotometric measurement briefly one new zealand rabbit male 2 2 kg was used in this study we collected 18 ml blood by heart puncture and placed it into a pre prepared centrifuge tube containing 2 ml 3 8 sodium citrate to prepare fresh anticoagulated blood blood was slowly stirred using a glass rod to remove fibrin then diluted in physiological saline ps at a 1 1 volume ratio and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was removed the remaining sample diluted 1 10 in ps and then purified and washed by centrifugation 3000 rpm 10 min 5 times to collect the rbcs finally precipitated rbcs were diluted with ps to prepare a 2 rbc suspension 24 experimental design before the experiment fluid extracted from the precursor solution25 was prepared by adding approximately 0 5 g of drug free precursor solution in 5 ml ps incubating at 37 c for 72 h then filtering through a sterile filter 0 22 μm to control for the effects of other components in the precursor solution pyt 64 ethanol 32 ethanol and 16 ethanol were treated in the same manner as described above groups used for the experimental design of the hemolysis experiment are shown in table 1 briefly 1 5 ml of extracts were added to tubes labeled a g with 1 5 ml ps in test tube h as a negative control and 1 5 ml distilled water in test tube i as the positive control group then 2 rbcs suspension was added into each tube the mixtures gently vortexed and incubated for 4 h at 37 c all samples were analyzed in triplicate table 1 hemolysis experiment group design determination of hemolysis rate first the presence or absence of hemolysis in each group of tubes was observed by visual inspection of rbc fragmentation and sedimentation if rbcs sank tubes were gently shaken to determine whether they could be resuspended and assess whether agglutination had occurred next tubes were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min 150 μl aliquots of supernatant form each sample transferred to a 96 well plate and absorbance recorded using a microplate reader biotek elx800 usa the maximum absorption wavelength λ max was determined by uv vis spectroscopy as follows supernatants from the positive control group were placed in quartz cuvettes with a 1 cm path in a total volume of 2 0 ml then uv vis spectra 200 800 nm were recorded to determine the λ max value to express the in vitro hemolytic properties of our samples the percentage of hemolysis was calculated as follows 26 hemolysis s absorbance h absorbance i absorbance h absorbance 100 where s absorbance h absorbance and i absorbance refer to the absorbance values of the sample negative control group and positive control group which were the mean values of measured absorbance from test tubes a g h and i respectively observation of red blood cell morphology the sediment collected in the tubes by centrifugation as described above was resuspended in ps a drop placed on a glass coverslip and another coverslip placed over it the coverslips were then gently pulled apart horizontally and allowed to air dry this technique provides uniform smear thickness and staining smears were then flooded with wright s stain for 2 min followed by flooding with water for 4 min drying mounting on a glass slide and examination by light microscopy in vivo injectability and histocompatibility subcutaneous injection in sprague dawley rats is routinely used to characterize foreign body reactions to polymeric biomaterials the size of the animals allows for clinically relevant injection volumes 500 1000 μl to be tested 27 hence the foreign body response to the precursor formulations created using varying concentrations of pyt ethanol h 2 o was assessed using a subcutaneous pouch model in sprague dawley rats male 200 20 g the precursor formulations were sterilized before injection as liquid embolic agents rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium solution 30 mg kg there were four experimental groups p1 p2 and p3 which were injected with 500 μl of the indicated solutions and ps which was injected with 500 μl ps as a negative control the subcutaneous tissue surrounding the hydrogel was evaluated by histochemical staining in brief rats were sacrificed at the indicated time points and 0 5 g subcutaneous tissue samples from close to the hydrogel cut into fragments and fixed in paraformaldehyde solution at 4 c for further analysis tissue samples were subjected to hematoxylin eosin he staining to determine the degree of the inflammatory response all images were acquired using a general optical microscope in vitro cytotoxicity the in vitro cytotoxicity of samples was determined by mtt assay the principle of this assay is based on the fact that succinate dehydrogenase in the mitochondria of living cells can reduce exogenous mtt to water insoluble blue purple crystalline formazan which is deposited in cells while dead cells cannot perform this function dimethyl sulfoxide dmso can dissolve the formazan in the cells and its light absorption value is then measured using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay at a wavelength of 540 nm with the results indirectly reflecting the number of living cells cell culture the human hepatoma cell line hepg2 was used for in vitro cytotoxicity experiments the cell line was grown in dulbecco s modified eagle medium dmem supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum 100 μg ml penicillin and 100 μg ml streptomycin cells were incubated in a saturated humidity incubator 37 c 5 co 2 washed with phosphate buffered saline pbs and digested using 0 25 trypsin to form a single cell suspension cells in logarithmic growth phase were tested preparation of sample extracts with reference to the relevant standards gb t 16886 5 2017 and iso 10993 5 2009 1 g of the blank preparation p1 p2 p3 and pyt were injected into 5 ml of dmem and leached at 37 c for 48 h then samples were filtered through 0 22 μm sterile membranes and the filtrates used as stock solutions next the stock solutions were diluted in different proportions 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 1 32 1 64 1 128 v v of dmem culture medium as test solutions in vitro cytotoxicity assay briefly 100 μl of dmem was added to the peripheral wells of a 96 well tissue culture microtiter plate and 100 μl of hepg2 cell suspension 1 104 cells ml added to the remaining wells after incubating for 24 h the medium was removed and 100 μl of the different concentrations of stock solutions diluted with fresh medium added to each well with 100 dmem as a negative control n 3 after incubation for 72 h 20 μl mtt solution 5 mg m l was added to each well and the cells incubated at 37 c for an additional 4 h subsequently the mtt solution was removed replaced with 100 μl dmso and the mixture shaken at a low speed for 10 min on a shaker to fully dissolve the crystalline formazan the optical density od at 540 nm of each well was measured using a microplate reader to express the in vitro hemolytic properties of our samples cell viability was calculated using the following formula cell viability od 570s od 570n 100 where od 570s represents the average optical density of each tested sample group and the od 570n represents the average optical density of the negative control group according to the iso standard gb t 16886 5 2017 iso 10993 5 2009 cell viability was then classified according to percentage of viable cells to reflect the degree of toxicity of the material as follows 0 100 1 80 100 2 50 80 3 30 50 4 0 30 in vitro anticancer activity to test the in vitro anticancer effects of sn and or 5 fu solutions according to the literature12 20 and preliminary experimental results the stock solution concentration of 5 fu was 640 μg ml while that of sn was 1280 μg ml and the stock combination solution containing was 640 μg ml 5 fu 1280 μg ml sn four groups were included in the experiment as follows negative control group only dmem culture medium added 5 fu monotherapy group sn monotherapy group and the combination group all solutions were formulated and diluted with dmem medium at ratios of 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 1 32 1 64 and 1 128 v v then filtered through a 0 22 µm microporous membrane before use in experiments cell proliferation was determined in vitro by mtt assay as described above except that cell viability was detected at 24 48 and 72 h based on the results of these experiments drug loading of sn in precursor injections was set to 0 5 that of 5 fu to 0 25 and the combined drug loading to 0 5 0 25 sn 5 fu drug loaded precursor solutions were extracted as described above and diluted with the culture solution to obtain a gradient of sample concentrations to analyze the drug interaction between sn and 5 fu the co administration efficacy analysis software calcusyn 2 1 was used to analyze the inhibition rates irs according to chou and talalay 28 29 and combination index ci values a dose effect curve and a median effect plot were obtained the median effect plot is a graph of x log d vs y log fa fu based on the median effect equation a general equation for the dose effect relationship fa fu d dm m where fa is the fraction affected by the dose fu is the fraction unaffected fu 1 fa d is the drug concentration or dose dm is the median effect dose or concentration usually expressed as ed50 or ic50 m is an exponent signifying the sigmoidicity shape of the dose effect curve m 1 1 and 1 for a given endpoint of the effect measurement in vitro drug release the dialysis membrane method was used to study in vitro drug release in summary approximately 0 5 g of the precursor injection containing sn and or 5 fu was injected into a dialysis bag mwco 1000 which was suspended in a centrifuge tube containing an appropriate amount of ps and subjected to a release test in a shaker at constant temperature 37 c 0 5 c 100 rpm simultaneously equal amounts of free sn and 5 fu solution were treated in the same manner all of the release medium was removed at predetermined intervals and replenished with an equal amount of fresh isothermal release medium all samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm microporous membrane and assayed using a validated hplc method22 to calculate the cumulative release percentage then the function of the cumulative release percentage and time was drawn to predict the release mechanism statistical analysis all data are expressed as mean sd and statistical analyses were performed using spss 22 0 p 80 grade 1 and increased with rising dilution ratio suggesting good cell compatibility of the blank preparation with only mild cytotoxicity furthermore the cytotoxicity of the pyt material was also measured and the same conclusion reached supporting the safety of the matrix agents cell viability 80 grade 1 figure 4 cytotoxicity of the blank precursor injections and pyt means sd n 3 in vitro anticancer activity the viability of hepg2 cells after treatment with sn and or 5 fu solutions at different concentrations and times is shown in figure 5a as expected sn and or 5 fu inhibited cell viability which decreased with increasing concentrations of sn 5 fu or the two combined incubation time also significantly influenced cell viability with prolonged incubation time associated with decreased viability further cell viability was more strongly reduced by the combination of sn and 5 fu than either alone indicating that their inhibitory effects on hepg2 cells may be synergistic cell viability rates of extracts treated with different drug loaded solutions for various incubation times at several dilution ratios following application of precursor solutions are presented in figure 5 figure 5b d extracts from each group of drug loaded preparations had clear inhibitory effects on the growth of liver cancer cells further prolonged incubation time and decreased dilution ratio led to additional reductions in cell viability rates in each group furthermore in vitro cell viability in response to the combined drug loaded preparation was lower relative to formulations containing each drug alone this effect was similar to the in vitro anticancer effects of sn and 5 fu solutions that is it was concentration dependent time dependent and synergistic figure 5 the results of in vitro anticancer activity at different time and dilution ratios a sn and or 5 fu solution b drug loaded p1 c drug loaded p2 d drug loaded p3 means sd n 3 at the same incubation time of the same prescription sn or 5 fu vs sn 5 fu p 0 9 and time dependent moreover the ci values for all incubation times were 30 figure 7a sn figures 7b 5 fu the amounts of the drugs released were close to 100 within 4 h indicating that the drug loaded preparations exhibited significant sustained release p 0 05 figure 7 the results of in vitro drug release of sn a and 5 fu b in addition to visually express the release behaviors and patterns of the preparations release data from the first 12 h were fitted to three commonly used mathematical models higuchi first order and zero order equations linear correlation coefficients are presented in table 4 the r values for the sn and 5 fu release curves indicated that release of these drugs conforms to first order kinetics although the r value for the higuchi equation was the largest for an individual group it did not differ substantially from that for the first order equation overall the release of the drug was consistent with the first order equation indicating that drug release was dominated by swelling 31 table 4 r values of release curves fitted by different equations discussion the precursor injections prepared in this experiment were clear transparent solutions that could form cubic liquid crystals on removal of excess water previous rheological experiments32 have shown that precursor injections exhibit newtonian fluid properties at high shear rates where they exhibit lower viscosity however when the cubic liquid crystals formed solid and elastic properties were dominant indicating that all three liquid embolic agents had good injectability and adhesion as well as being able to resist blood flow clearance to ensure the accuracy of the hemolysis test we determined the λ max of oxyhemoglobin by full wavelength scanning the results showed that the hemolysis rates of the preparations and pyt were well below the safe value 5 specified in the relevant standard gb t 16886 4 2003 iso 10993 4 2002 while different concentrations of ethanol resulted in slight hemolysis 10 indicating that the hemolysis in response to the preparations may be attributable to the ethanol in the solution reports indicate that liquid crystal nanoparticles based on pyt exhibit some cytotoxicity and hemolysis likely because the mesophase structure of the nanostructures is present in biofilms and when the liquid crystal nanoparticles undergo image transformation the high concentration of cationic lipids can interact with cell membranes and destroy their integrity leading to cell lysis and death 33 34 in vivo gelation properties and histocompatibility were investigated by subcutaneous injection of precursor solutions into the backs of rats the results showed that all the precursors could form liquid crystalline gels however only p1 formed a spherical shape while p2 and p3 dispersed into flakes possibly related to the gelation time of each solution if the gelation time is faster gels can be formed in situ before the injection disperses whereas with slow gelation times injections exhibit more dispersibility this suggests that the time of injection should be considered when performing arterial embolization in vivo if the bolus time is too fast the injection may flow to other areas before the gel is formed resulting in ectopic embolization histopathological results showed that p1 had good histocompatibility while p2 and p3 elicited inflammatory responses however the latter subsequently recovered spontaneously high ethanol concentrations generally cause severe inflammation and subsequent necrosis 35 36 comparison of the p1 p2 and p3 solutions indicates that the inflammation associated with p2 and p3 may be caused by excessive ethanol in their solutions therefore p1 is recommended for subsequent in vivo studies unlike traditional methods the preparations were first diluted with medium before use for in vitro cytotoxicity tests including anticancer experiments according to the proposal of zhai et al 33 injection of precursor solutions is accompanied by release of a large amount of drug during the formation of liquid crystalline gel 8 9 as confirmed by our in vitro drug release tests therefore if the liquid crystal gel forms before application in an anti cancer experiment the amount of drug released may be reduced potentially influencing the accuracy of the findings based on our preliminary results from experiments conducted using direct injections the water in the medium was absorbed to form a liquid crystal gel resulting in a decrease in medium content which may starve the cells and affect their proliferation to investigate the true state of drug loaded preparations we did not induce the precursor injection to form liquid crystal gel before the experiment rather we directly extracted the injection and then carried out the experiment our results show that sn and 5 fu have clear synergistic effects across a broad concentration range which were time and concentration dependent various studies have shown that expression levels of bax and bcl 2 are up and down regulated respectively during the apoptosis induced by sin and 5 fu 18 20 indicating that the mechanisms underlying this effect may be associated with increased apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway and downregulation of thymidylate synthase mrna expression it has been suggested that in the course of 5 fu chemotherapy for patients with liver cancer addition of sn can greatly reduce the dose of 5 fu required produce a synergistic effect and reduce the side effects of 5 fu indeed our data show that use of sn and 5 fu in our precursor injection for tace led to good synergistic effects further the blank formulations showed very little cytotoxicity indicating that the effects of the drug loaded formulation are likely mainly attributable to drug release hence this combination has potential for treatment of liver cancer since both sn and 5 fu are poorly soluble in water high drug loading would lead to drug precipitation particularly when they are used in combination therefore we used a drug loading formulation containing 0 5 sn and 0 25 5 fu the results of the in vitro release test showed that drug release exhibited a burst phenomenon and that higher levels of ethanol in the solution led to increases in the amount and rate of drug release during the process of water absorption by the precursor solution to form a liquid crystal gel ethanol in the preparation is exchanged with water releasing large amounts of the drug into the medium resulting in the observed burst behavior in addition higher proportions of ethanol in solutions are associated with lower viscosity and higher fluidity which increases the contact area between the preparation and the release medium leading to elevated drug release 8 33 these data suggest that when this preparation is used in vivo it can quickly reach the blood concentration required in the human body and produce effective treatment while simultaneously reducing the side effects of 5 fu conclusion the results obtained in this investigation demonstrate that all three of the precursor injections we selected exhibit good biocompatibility and good gelation properties both in vitro and in vivo our data also prove that sn and 5 fu synergistically inhibit the growth of hepg2 cells further we evaluated the in vitro anticancer activity and release of sn and or 5 fu loaded precursor injections and our results show that all three formulations can significantly inhibit the growth of hepg2 cells while the combined drug loaded group had synergistic effects the in vitro release profile was generally consistent with first order release kinetics and demonstrated a significant sustained release effect the results of this study emphasize the biocompatibility of these three precursor injections for use in tace and the interaction of sn and 5 fu in inhibition of hepg2 cell growth providing a theoretical reference for clinical treatment of liver cancer however further research is required including study of the feasibility of embolization and in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic investigations we will conduct extensive experimental research in the future with the aim of developing our liquid embolic agent for use in tace and improving therapeutic efficacy
this is part two of a multipart series that aims to answer the following question what is the fundamental value of bitcoin part one is about the value of scarcity part two the market moves in bubbles part three the rate of adoption and part four the hash rate and the estimated price of bitcoin the market moves in bubbles in recent months or even years there s been a lot of talk about the bubbles developing in the bond markets newspapers both financial and non financial talked about it with specialized television stations and prestigious macroeconomists from all over the world discussing how today s world debt has negative interest rates it is financially counterintuitive to have to pay or lend money to someone even if that person is a state we are experiencing an absurd situation that has never happened before in the financial market landscape the main cause is linked to the enormous liquidity injected into the markets by central banks which they use as funding to avoid their own bankruptcy only to then prudently reverse it back onto the states they themselves in difficulty after all john maynard keynes s famous phrase reads financial markets can remain irrational for much longer than you can remain solvent in actuality this absurdity has made it possible to avoid the bankruptcy of the financial system so it is welcome even though it feeds irrational phenomena such as bond markets with negative yields and therefore senseless bond prices and stock markets touching not all but most new highs day after day one phenomenon that isn t actually fueled by central bank money that everyone labeled a meaningless mega bubble in 2017 is bitcoin btc the price of bitcoin rose to a high of 20 000 in december 2017 coinciding with the launch of bitcoin futures by the chicago board options exchange and the cme group the two largest commodities exchanges in the world and then hit a minimum of around 3 100 in 2018 effectively losing over 80 of its value does it represent the bursting of a bubble sure does it represent the end of bitcoin certainly not could there be more bitcoin bubbles in the future of course as always we would like to approach the problem as analytically as possible we reconstructed the table created by the founder of bitcoin satoshi nakamoto using excel to make sure that bitcoin was deflationary and not inflationary inflation the u s dollar and all currencies in the world truthfully including the euro due to inflation is worth less and less over time we can better understand the phenomenon if we think about the value of assets buying a car 40 years ago cost about 13 times less than it does today so a nice car that cost 10 000 in 1980 would cost 130 000 today this phenomenon is called inflation and it is induced by a rule that links the total value of goods in the world to the total currency in circulation if the number of u s dollars in circulation doubles the same goods will tend to cost twice as much it will tend because currency is not a linear phenomenon and it may take some time to happen in the 1970s and early 1980s inflation in the united states reached rates close to 12 per year creating many difficulties for those who didn t have the knowledge and the means to counter it deflation bitcoin was created with a deflationary logic more similar to commodities such as gold and silver this is why it s considered by many to be the new digital gold as it has preservation of value characteristics and not those of impoverishment like the dollar or the euro related is bitcoin a store of value experts on btc as digital gold let s see how it was possible to create and what the effects resulting from these choices are nakamoto decided that the maximum number of bitcoin created and available should be 21 million the number 21 will occur many times it is the greek letter phi which we will also talk about later he could have decided to enter a fixed amount of bitcoin for each block that got mined but doing so wouldn t have created the exponential growth effect that characterizes bitcoin or at least not as marked as it is today consequently he decided to halve the amount of newly issued bitcoin every four years to create a very marked and interesting stock to flow effect that would push the price higher and higher related bitcoin halving explained for the first 210 000 blocks miners were paid 50 btc for each block written on the distributed ledger at a time where the value of bitcoin fluctuated from a few cents up to a few dollars so the remuneration was not in the least comparable with that of today neither was it as difficult to win the challenge in fact in the early years simple computers were enough to do the mining the first halving took place in 2012 i e from the 210 001st block onward remuneration was halved to 25 btc for each writing on the distributed ledger in 2016 the second halving took place which brought the remuneration down to 12 5 btc and again with the third halving taking place in may 2020 bringing the remuneration for each block to 6 25 bitcoin which with a recent price correction of around 40 000 is still around 250 000 related 3 good reasons why 30 000 is probably the bottom for bitcoin the next halving is scheduled for 2024 when remuneration will be further cut by 50 it is set to continue probably until 2140 the year in which the last halving is expected which will distribute less than 1 bitcoin in the last year but how does this halving phenomenon impact the price of bitcoin does the halving of the so called flow or the flow of new capital into the market affect the price of bitcoin itself as we saw previously in the first part bitcoin seems to follow the stock to flow model therefore a reduction in flow while maintaining the same stock should correspond to an increase in price now that we ve had three halvings shouldn t there have been as many bubbles do you know how many bubbles bitcoin has had in its short life three fatalities they are represented graphically below these are the three bubbles bitcoin has faced so far and each time the next maximum price became at least 10 times higher obviously it is not a guarantee that it will do so in the future but there are many factors that lead us to believe that what we experienced in 2017 will not be the last bubble many more will follow in the future can this information be used to determine a correct price for bitcoin or at least a potentially achievable price according to this model in fact we can if we take a look at this graph where the halvings are highlighted by jumps in the x axis in correspondence with the change in status of halving we can estimate the fair value price that is the correct price at which bitcoin could tend toward if the price of bitcoin tends to return around the line described in the figure above it is clear that we can estimate what the future target price of bitcoin will be based on the various halvings that await us from the graph it is clear that the target price of bitcoin is between 90 000 and 100 000 this information is very useful not only because it guarantees that we will arrive at those prices but because we should take into account our investment decisions as it could actually get there and even exceed those price levels obviously these estimates must be taken as an intellectual attempt to understand the dynamics of bitcoin and absolutely cannot be considered a suggestion or advice from the author understanding how bitcoin can reach such values is not easy and anyone approaching this fascinating world for the first time would have a hard time imagining how a seemingly worthless asset could have such a high price especially if you fall into the trap of thinking of it as a dollar par currency to do this it is important to know its various aspects one that is certainly fundamental for determining the price of bitcoin is the adoption rate which is to be described in the next part this article was

after 73 years sri lankans need an independent perspective palitha senanayake recently there has been considerable criticism in printed as well as in the social media of sri lanka s increase dependence on the chinese state and this criticism identifies this dependence with the current rajapakse regime the criticism moreover appears to suggest that there is some danger in this dependence vis a vis the country s sovereignty and independence in this respect it is important to ponder whether sri lanka as a country has been truly independent for the past 73 years of its existence since it was granted independence by its colonizers the british after 145 year imperial subjection by the time the british left after all those years this country had an elite ring of people who were english educated trained and hence always acted in the way the empire would approve the world order at that time being the post world war 11 scenario was inclined in that direction as the ww11 victors appointed themselves to be the arbiters of world way forward the deleterious effect of all that was not just the emulation of the west but the servile mentality our rulers inherited as a result they were subliminally accustomed to a state where they just could not see beyond what the englishman would show you hence we continued with the same economic and social values and the changes that took place since then were more in the form of inevitables than in the form of pre planed to start with the democratic system of governance that was thrust upon us would not have been the most appropriate governing system given the fact that the country s literacy rate at the point of independence was a mere 6 and its standard of living was hardly at the barest of necessities under the democratic form of governance the people are the rulers and you could just imagine the wisdom and providence of a ruler who is only 6 literate and whose basics needs of life were hardly fulfilled the fact is that the new nation bequeathed a human stock that had been neglected for centuries with a life expectancy of only 45 years per capita income of 1 5 and a literacy rate of a mere 6 thus the post independent democratic governments had little choice but to give in to the nation s democratic dictate to raise the level of the human stock by investing heavily on health and education we changed governments one after the other expecting more from the government that succeeded lee kwan yew the architect of singapore s resurgence has maintained many a times that i meet my commonwealth colleagues every other year at the commonwealth convention and they complain of their woes in nation building democracy has only brought regression and not progression to them he further maintains that when a country s people are not educated and when their basic needs of life are not met democracy is the last form of government they should have the governor of a country be it a sheik or a king should carry on for at least for 20 years and instead when you have governments elected for a limited period it is inevitable that such governments will turn out to be time servers we complain of corruption by politicians but corruption is a part and parcel of democratic politics today an mp needs rs 20 million to do an election and how do we expect him to make that rs 20 million every 5 years central bank heist was not for a personal aggrandizement and the funds were needed to do the 2015 unp election campaign in america the presidential campaigns run on corporate finance and as a result today every us government is elected by the country s 2 rich agendas of these corporations does not stop there as the most profitable businesses to day are the arms manufacture and the manufacture of pharmaceuticals the first make money by planting wars and the second by planting decease john perkings is an economic hit man ehm who worked for the world bank he has authored a book titled the confessions of an economic hit man and the us government prevented his book from publishing it for 20 years it is an interesting episode of how wb consultants defraud developing countries for billions of dollars in the guise of development finance and the final benefactors of such activity are the us corporations confessions of an economic hit man details how these operations against smaller nations are carried out with the sanctions of the central intelligence agency of the us economic hit men ehms are highly paid professionals who cheat countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars they funnel money from the world bank the u s agency for international development usaid and other foreign aid organizations into the coffers of huge corporations and the pockets of a few wealthy families who control the planet s natural resources their tools include fraudulent financial reports rigged elections pay offs extortion sex and murder apart from this confessions evidence is omnipresent all over the world with liberation wars alleged human rights violations arab springs export of democracy etc that are disguised to enable the world super powers to maintaining the post ww11 status quo these are modus operands to ensure that they will always rule the world the solutions they advocate to world issues are carefully crafted to ensure that the problems remain permanent so that their corporations could thrive palestine is only a single case in point and today thousands of women and children are dying and the perpetrator of that war is backed by us and britain britain s economy today is behind that of its colonial subject india but thanks to the war in yemen british economy leaped frogged this year current state of the world with so many man made wars deceases and hunger is not a state that will reflect well on its super powers the super powers while they govern their countries with humane and equitable laws advocate the laws of the jungle for world issues that is the reason that why bill clinton was almost impeached for having an illicit affair with a white house intern while george bush who killed millions in iraq on triumphed up wmd charges was not even considered as impeachable material take the case of what sri lanka is made to face for vanquishing terrorism that haunted it for 35 years on march 23rd in 2021 the unhrc adopted resolution a hrc 46 l 1 on sri lanka at its 46th session the resolution was presented by the united kingdom sponsored by a core group of western countries the real motive of this resolution is to prevent sri lanka from clearing the shackles of the previous resolution 30 a brought against sri lanka in 2015 by the united states for alleged human rights violations by the sl forces at the last stages of its war against the ltte lord naseby has produced very clear evidence to prove that these allegations are not consistent with the ground reports of us and british military attaches who were in the thick of these happenings and also contrary to the census surveys carried out post war the most cynical nature of these allegations is that these two super powers who express so much concern about the hr violations in sri lanka today had no heart to express their concern in anyway while sri lankan people suffered at the hands of this most ruthless and organized terror outfit in the world causing the deaths of 80 000 civilians over a period of 35 years whenever they were confronted with this problem they advocated talks as the only way out and finally all the talks successive sl governments held elevated the ltte to a diplomatic status as liberations fighters in the eyes of the west the irony however was that the parties who called ltte the liberation fighters are the same parties that called nelson mandela a terrorist for 40 years it should be clear to all except of course to those who are naïve and so servile to the west that these resolutions on hr violations are now being brought with the sinister idea of rekindling a problem that has been finally brought to an end this is because the western propaganda industry and the west s arms manufacturing corporations thrive at the misery of third world countries on the other hand china and russia helped us to overcome terrorism in this country apart from the physical support they rendered the position of sri lanka in international forums if not for china and russia could well be imagined terrorism is not just about people being killed and maimed but it is the uncertainty of life and the stagnation in development that terrorism accompanies that has plagued this country and 35 years is just half the life time of the sri lankan nation sri lanka is a small country and in a world scenario where imperial powers are at each other s throat for world hegemony it is difficult to envisage a situation where small countries could remain 100 independent things in this world continue to change and according to buddhism that is the only universal phenomenon that is permanent thus things will continue to change and in that this country s language culture and even religion will not be an exception thus in this changing scenario wise people will change things for the better while stupid will remain bigoted and servile in the modern world scenario imperialist in their quest for hegemony use propaganda as the forerunner in their invasions thus those who control the news control the world opinion this is how they prevent people from having independent thoughts based on truth and facts therefore today if you do not read the news you are uninformed but if you read the news you are misinformed if you are uninformed you have no opinion but if you are misinformed you have the wrong opinion in the final analysis it is better to have no opinion than to have the wrong opinion servile mentality not only prevents you from seeing beyond your master but also perceives even those who try to liberate you as your enemies
amazon founder jeff bezos attempted to divert focus from his affair with lauren sanchez in january 2019 by pushing the unfounded theory that saudi arabia had leaked the details according to a new book world s richest man bezos had been married to wife mackenzie for 25 years at the time before it was revealed he was in a relationship with tv host and helicopter pilot sanchez jeff and mackenzie announced their divorce just hours before bombshell details of his affair were revealed in the following months texts and photos sent between bezos and sanchez were revealed and he alleged that he had been blackmailed by the national enquirer tabloid over the affair in a new biography amazon unbound jeff bezos and the invention of a global empire author brad stone details how bezos attempted to push the theory that the saudi arabian government was behind the leaking of personal text messages and a picture of his penis stone says bezos did it to shift focus away from the more unsavory and complicated truth but he says there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that saudi arabia hacked bezos let alone tip off the national enquirer who went on to break the salacious story stone explains that the supposed selfie of bezos genitals was not real and was allegedly ripped from a gay men s escort website by sanchez s brother michael sanchez jeff bezos 57 said he was the victim of an unsuccessful extortion attempt by the national enquirer magazine published intimate texts between him and girlfriend lauren sanchez 51 the two are pictured together last february attending a hollywood event and are still together the detailed revelations have been made in a new book amazon unbound by brad stone michael later told fbi investigators for the southern district of new york that he never actually had an explicit photograph of bezos in his possession stone wrote nevertheless the book as seen by fox news explains bezos suggested in an essay written in february 2019 on medium com how saudi arabia was likely behind the national enquirer story bezos seemed to allege an unsavory connection between the kingdom of saudi arabia and american media inc the publisher of the national enquirer bezos accused ami of extortion and blackmail claiming it threatened to publish naked photos of him bezos took the already muddled question of how the paper obtained his private text messages and photographs and confused it further adding that how the story came about was still to be better understood and that the saudi angle seems to hit a particular nerve with the enquirer s parent company american media inc the tabloid and its parent company ami claimed sanchez s brother michael sanchez was the one who leaked private texts and racy photos of the affair the siblings are pictured together bezos suggested in an essay written in february 2019 on medium com how saudi arabia was likely behind the national enquirer story backing up bezos claim private security expert gavin de becker who is a close friend of the amazon boss wrote a similar piece for the daily beast our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the saudis had access to bezos phone and gained private information as of today it is unclear to what degree if any ami was aware of the details de becker wrote stone wrote in the new book that bezos saudi arabia allegations amounted to only a fog of overlapping events weak ties between disparate figures and more strange coincidences stone reveals in his book that the enquirer was able to receive photos of bezos from michael sanchez who was paid around 200 000 for the scoop he allegedly received pictures and texts from his sister who stone says would frequently forward bezos text messages to him in what is described as an unusual sibling relationship lauren sanchez and jeff bezos attend the amazon prime video celebration in january 2020 for bezos and his advisers though who were still trying to positively spin the embarrassing events surrounding his divorce such a cloud of uncertainty was at the very least distracting from the more unsavory and complicated truth stone concludes in one chapter about the divorce he notes too that an alleged picture of bezos penis was not something handed to the magazine by michael sanchez as he was discussing the story with ami chief content officer dylan howard and editor james robertson over facetime the image is said to have simply been taken from images on a gay escort website rent men a spokesperson for dylan howard said the office of the united states attorney for the southern district of new york has advised all parties that it has completed its investigation of allegations made by jeff bezos in february 2019 and has declined to prosecute the matter we are glad that the government decided that mr bezos s allegations of blackmail and extortion against personnel at the national enquirer did not merit prosecution as we had believed it would all along the national enquirer revealed the tech entrepreneur had been having an affair with sanchez while alleging it was the reason behind his divorce emails to amazon and de becker have not been returned michael sanchez has previously said i would never sell out anyone michael sanchez a hollywood talent agent was the source of the report ami said but sanchez has previously said i would never sell out anyone he last month micheal sanchez doubled down on his claim that he didn t leak an explicit selfie of bezos to the national enquirer his attorney told dailymail com that he neither served as the enquirer s source for the affair story nor did he share any of the photos that backed it up the national enquirer had trailed bezos and sanchez for months when they met up secretly then splashed photos of them together across the magazine bezos split from mackenzie ended up being the most expensive divorce in history in february this year bezos announced he would be stepping down as the ceo of amazon 27 years after founding it with his ex wife and building it into one of the most successful companies of all time now worth 1 7 trillion bezos announced the move in a letter to his 1 3 million amazon employees where he insisted he isn t retiring but wants to focus on his passions including his space and climate change ventures he will be replaced by 53 year old andy jassy the current ceo of the amazon empire

beijing bloomberg china signalled its tolerance for the renminbi s rally is fading after the authorities set the daily fixing at a weaker than expected level and state run newspapers warned against rapid gains beijing fixed the reference rate at 6 3682 per us dollar on monday may 31 versus the average estimate of 6 3656 in a bloomberg survey the rise in the renminbi is due to short term speculation and probably will not last former people s bank of china pboc official sheng songcheng told state run xinhua news on sunday the central bank backed financial news and a former regulator also weighed in the chorus of comments talking down the renminbi follows a subtle shift in policymakers stance at the end of last week after earlier messaging appeared to indicate a greater tolerance for a stronger currency a rapidly rising renminbi may draw increased scrutiny in global financial markets especially at a time when the dollar is losing momentum pboc seems comfortable with the renminbi s direction just not the pace of its gains that was spurred by speculations of the currency being used to curb imported inflation said ms fiona lim senior currency analyst at malayan banking in singapore the level of 6 20 is still possible over the next 12 months especially if broader dollar weakness takes the dollar renminbi pair to that level with china s economy rebounding from the pandemic and foreign funds piling into the nation s equity and bond markets the renminbi has rallied to a five year high against a basket of trading partners currencies it has climbed this year against all but six of the 31 major currencies tracked by bloomberg and is asia s best performer china should prevent huge short term inflows which could push up the renminbi hurt competitiveness of exporters and affect independent operations of the country s financial market and monetary policy dr sheng said possible inflows to the united states from emerging markets and a strong global economic recovery will pose risks to china s exports potentially weakening the renminbi according to an editorial from financial news it added that the renminbi may depreciate in future due to factors such as us tightening the appreciation is not necessarily a bullish factor for chinese stocks boc international china global chief economist guan tao a former official at the country s top foreign exchange regulator said in an interview with state run china securities journal on monday that is because the country s exporters will come under pressure from the renminbi s rally and the stronger currency does not offset the surge in commodities prices he said the offshore renminbi fell for the first time in four sessions on monday dropping 0 1 per cent to 6 3652 per dollar while the onshore rate was little changed at 6 3696 the currency has gained more than 1 6 per cent in domestic and overseas markets in may to head for its biggest monthly advance since november the pboc will properly guide expectations on the renminbi and the exchange rate will continue to be decided by market supply and demand as well as changes in global financial markets dr sheng was cited as saying
taipei reuters intel corp nasdaq s ceo said on monday it could take several years for a global shortage of semiconductors to be resolved a problem that has shuttered some auto production lines and is also being felt in other areas including consumer electronics pat gelsinger told a virtual session of the computex trade show in taipei that the work and study from home trend during the covid 19 pandemic had led to a cycle of explosive growth in semiconductors that has placed huge strain on global supply chains but while the industry has taken steps to address near term constraints it could still take a couple of years for the ecosystem to address shortages of foundry capacity substrates and components gelsinger had told the washington post in an interview in mid april the shortage was going to take a couple of years to abate and that it planned to start producing chips within six to nine months to address shortages at u s car plants intel announced a 20 billion plan in march to expand its advanced chip manufacturing capacity building two factories in arizona and opening its plants to outside customers we plan to expand to other locations in the u s and europe ensuring a sustainable and secure semiconductor supply chain for the world gelsinger said without elaborating intel s plans could directly challenge the two other companies in the world that can make the most advanced chips taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co ltd tsmc and south korea s samsung electronics otc co ltd the two have come to dominate the semiconductor manufacturing business moving its centre of gravity from the united states where much of the technology was once invented to asia where more than two thirds of advanced chips are now manufactured
external affairs minister s jaishankar in a visit to washington dc last week strongly defended the governance record of the government at the hoover institution blaming perceptions to the contrary as political imagery that has been concocted he claimed that the modi government was being harshly judged because its leaders being less familiar with english were less connected to other global centres they were nevertheless much more confident about their culture about their language and their beliefs had ended vote bank politics and deepened democracy he was responding to a question from former us national security advisor h r mcmaster

thomas r oldt ledger columnist editor s note thomas r oldt s monthly q a typically runs the first weekend of the month this time it runs a weekly early as he chats with jake polumbo a lakeland resident and retired major general in the u s air force about security service and sacrifice following an illustrious 34 year career flying spy planes and fighter jets h d jake polumbo retired as a major general in the united states air force six years ago having grown up in winter haven he graduated from the air force academy flew supersonic fighters most of his career commanded numerous air force operations around the world and now lives in lakeland with several other retired generals including his brother the 62 year old aviator runs a leadership consulting firm two blue aces for amusement he teaches civilian pilots the art of flying seaplanes q you re the son of a korea war combat pilot did you always dream of following in your father s footsteps a my dad joined the navy at the end of world war ii then switched to the air force and became a pilot flying combat missions in an f 80 in korea an uncle was a fighter pilot in the navy and i realized i wanted to fly jet fighters my brother rob similarly wanted to do that he was three years behind me at the air force academy and when he got there i told him i was going to go to pilot training when he was a rising senior at the academy and i was a fledgling fighter pilot he came to visit me one day and asked what do you think and i said ain t nothing else in the world i want to be doing except flying these jets and he said ok i m going to do the same q you ve flown supersonic speeds at altitude near supersonic speeds 100 feet off the deck at stratospheric levels in u 2 reconnaissance airplanes managing some of the most sophisticated aerial weapons in the country s arsenal how do those very different planes compare have you a favorite and what is a kc 10 tanker doing in the logbook of an f 16 fighter pilot a in addition to the u 2s i flew as a combat pilot i had 15 kc 10s when i was a commander in the middle east when i wasn t flying the u 2 and had a day off i d fly the kc 10 i was responsible for them and their crews so i said why wouldn t i fly these airplanes but which one did i like the best the f 16 it s built for the pilot it s built around the pilot it s set up for full visibility and speed and maneuverability and it was just plain exciting to fly more gram parsons derry down and preserving a link to winter haven s past more pets are there for you veterinarian mitsie vargas talks about the deep bonds with pets more that buzzing sound in the grove might be andrew osburn drone pilot q in your military flying career what was the closest you came to buying the farm a i was in a u 2 just entering iraqi airspace when the airplane suffered total hydraulic failure i was at 52 000 feet where you make a big adjustment to the tail section of the plane so that when you get to really high altitude 67 000 feet the aircraft is trimmed properly at that altitude and above the u 2 has a very narrow operating envelope the indicated airspeeds go from 99 knots minimum to 109 knots max so you have about a 10 knot window at 98 you stall at 110 supposedly the tail rips off at that particular moment the hydraulic line that controls the horizontal tail the flaps and the speed brakes ruptured and the pressure went from 3 000 psi to zero in about three seconds all the avionics went away the fuel had to be dumped it became a really distressed aircraft very difficult to fly and i had to get home in a sandstorm the landing was extremely difficult it took me two tries to get it on the ground i thought about bailing out which would not have been a good idea because the airplane was under duress but i felt like i was either going to eject and donate a 200 million airplane to the persian gulf or something worse but it turned out all right q because all humans are fallible leadership sometimes fails spectacularly while you were in primary flight training four thunderbird pilots plowed into the nevada desert while practicing a line abreast loop the lead pilot s plane may have had a malfunction that prevented it from pulling up in time whatever the cause his three wingmen as they were trained to do followed their leader straight to their deaths what lessons did the air force and you take from this tragic incident a many i ve had the opportunity to be the investigating board president of these type mishaps one of the more difficult things was to investigate fatalities where likely the problem was pilot error in the thunderbird accident the leader needed to do a better job flying his airplane whether it was working or not and he needed to terminate what he was doing if he had any doubt at all aviation is a great profession but it s pretty unforgiving most aircraft accidents have some element of pilot error the thunderbird diamond crash reflects the extreme amount of trust placed in a leader during close formation flight when something goes wrong it can be catastrophic as in most elements of military operations there is a high degree of trust required between teammates and that leads to a lot of practice repetition and familiarity and occasionally disaster q the extremely bloody history of afghanistan has caused it to be known for good reason as the place empires go to die though empire was not the goal of the united states when we entered the country 20 years ago our success there has been at best piecemeal and may prove to be entirely ephemeral you served in afghanistan what is your assessment of our role there a afghanistan is a classic case of mission creep through the course of 20 years nation building is extremely difficult and the united states should be overly cautious about ever saying we re going to build nations especially when they re in a part of the world that is not remotely the same as the united states whether it s our freedoms our liberties our democracy or our way of life afghanistan is very rural very low tech many of its people are uneducated and building it in the image of the united states was way too ambitious way too costly we really didn t think our way through it we were just throwing money at it sure we needed to clean up the terrorist cells there including osama bin laden who was in afghanistan before moving into pakistan we did that but it took a long time we spent 20 billion a month at the height of this war maybe 10 billion in afghanistan 10 billion in iraq trying to build nations in places where they just didn t like americans q a threat making its presence felt both domestically and militarily is cybersecurity and cyberwarfare we ve seen it in the recent gasoline shortage from a single pipeline shut down by cyber thieves is this form of combat potentially as destructive as atomic weapons in demolishing a country s infrastructure and defenses a absolutely other than a weapon that explodes in a city the quickest way to impact american society is using cyber weapons and it has untold immediate impacts on american livelihood and on our freedoms because everything is at stake from hydroelectric power to fuel supplies to the internet to the stock market our main adversaries have realized that going at us symmetrically tends to turn into lost battles lost ships lost airplanes lost soldiers going at us asymmetrically tends to achieve a tangible impact very quickly the russians know that and the chinese know it even better q in purely military terms china appears to be our most powerful adversary they have been stealing our technology for years is the u s taking cyber security seriously enough a the freedoms that are inherent in our constitution s bill of rights especially our privacy laws are important to americans and we re willing to fight to protect them china does none of that russia none of that they don t care about those freedoms and rights they do what they need to do for their own sovereignty and this becomes an element of warfare why do u s citizens feel like we re getting beat in the cyber realm it s probably our laws our rules but remember there s a difference between overt actions and covert actions and we do both every day there s a difference between acknowledged activities and unacknowledged activities and the united states does both every day when you re covertly doing things and you won t acknowledge it sometimes it causes average americans like you and me to wonder if we re doing enough and the answer is probably but you aren t going to read about it in the ledger q as a consequence of vietnam and the draft males of my generation served in far greater numbers than more recently would the country benefit if we reinstituted compulsory service this time for all citizens male and female when they reach a certain age offering a choice between the military and corresponding civilian programs a would we benefit from it as a nation absolutely could we handle it in today s society no way we can t even have the debate necessary at a national level to really get to the solution it would break down politically generationally regionally and we would fail to achieve anything that made sense i think a better approach is establishing themes for our young people service to the nation service to other people if we could inspire that kind of dialogue i think it would do just about as much good we need to talk about service about patriotic ways of looking at our country we are in desperate need of a reality check we ve got so much abundance and yet such a huge divide between those with resources and those without and we have this ridiculous reliance on social media that s going to be our demise social media is at the root of our political problems right now people don t have a clue what s going on because they get their facts from facebook in my lifetime i m not sure we ve been so poorly informed as we are now q the men and women who volunteer for the armed forces are sometimes at the mercy of flawed political judgment the bravery and commitment of the approximately 10 000 u s military personnel killed in the iraq and afghanistan wars and the many more thousands who were wounded is not in question but did their sacrifices make the u s safer a i believe they did because they showed the discipline it takes for a professional military to be credible and respected and feared around the world the united states military because of its discipline its impressive war fighting skills its high tech weaponry but most importantly the professionalism with which our soldiers marines airmen and sailors use those weapons makes our military a precision tool for our diplomats and our president to exert influence around the world united states military personnel are asked to fight when our presidents and congress define red lines and what is so noble about american military men and women is that given a lawful order they do what they re told even to the point of death which is what memorial day is all about q this memorial day what is the best way we can honor those who have fallen in service to our country a you ve got to remember the people who don t have what you and i have today they don t have their son or their daughter because they died fighting our wars we need to honor the service of those sons and daughters recognizing the dedication and patriotism of those who fought and died and the freedoms and benefits we enjoy because of their sacrifice we need always to pay tribute to the men and women who gave their lives in wars that our country chose to fight or was forced to fight if we do that we re not going to fail because we

jennifer weiner s latest novel that summer is a metoo story but in a broader sense every one of the 15 novels weiner has written could be described as me too stories her heroines are almost always smart self deprecating underdogs who haven t been seen by the world some feel alienated from the normative roles of wife and mother me too think many of weiner s readers others feel bad about being plus size in a world where a woman still can never be too thin me too still others feel cosmically lonely or invisible or ashamed that they have to reach for a pill or another glass of wine to get through the day me too me too me too weiner has made a major literary career out of writing engrossing popular novels that take women seriously at their most basic all of her stories are about women trying to hold on to themselves in a world intent on diminishing them that summer is more explicitly a political novel than most in that its plot is informed by the rise of the metoo movement and the seismic shift in attitudes toward men who claim their actions should be excused because of their youth or because their victims were drunk or dressed provocatively or just because the intertwined story lines of that summer concern two women both named diana who have been harmed in different ways by a man and that s only the beginning of what these two dianas have in common that summer opens with a prologue that is one long held breath weiner writes it in present tense as if the memory it evokes keeps replaying on a loop advertisement she is fifteen years old that summer a thoughtful book struck girl with long lashed hazel eyes and a long legged body that still doesn t completely feel like her own she lives in a rowhouse in south boston with her parents and two sisters and attends a private school in cambridge on a scholarship where she gets mostly b s except for a s in english and art she dreams about falling in love this is diana starling who takes a job as a mother s helper on cape cod during that long ago summer and meets a crowd of prep school boys on the beach and is encouraged to believe that one of them a sensitive handsome guy named poe really really likes her he invites her to a big bonfire party on the last night of summer and as diana sits close to him drinking something he s handed her in a red solo cup she thinks this is the best night of my life it s not for years afterward a traumatized diana struggles and fails and struggles again to heal from the violence inflicted on her that night daisy shoemaker our other diana is a 30 something wife and mother who lives on the tony main line outside philadelphia though her given name is diana she was renamed daisy by her husband hal during their dating days daisy thinks of herself as short and dumpy in contrast to hal an older corporate lawyer who keeps himself in fighting trim daisy is a marvelous cook and had once dreamed of becoming a food writer but her father s early death and her own early marriage at 20 derailed those ambitions now daisy feels lost and isolated patronized by her husband and dismissed by her artsy rebellious teenage daughter beatrice when daisy begins getting emails meant for the other diana their email addresses are almost identical the two begin an online correspondence that quickly develops into an in person friendship but those misdirected emails turn out not to be as random as they first appeared weiner s braided plot not only alternates between the lives of two dianas but shifts around in time the longest compelling section takes place on cape cod where the adult diana starling returns to live working as a waitress and breathing in the silvery magic of a place she loved before it became a nightmare one of weiner s signature strengths as a writer is her ability to realistically depict how people change in body and soul in her 2009 novel best friends forever for instance weiner powerfully described how her heroine addie downs gradually inched out of her cocoon of loneliness and superfluous weight here diana s never to be finished healing spans decades on the cape when the adult diana first arrives back at the cape in offseason courtesy of a loan of a cottage the restaurant manager who hires her instantly sizes her up as a potential washashore meaning the misfits the folks who wash up here and decide to stay diana s first solitary year filled with exhausting restaurant work weekly trips to the library to stock up on novels morning ocean swims and the loving company of a rescue dog eventually coheres into a full life weiner writes incisively yet with restraint about diana s incremental process of reclaiming some measure of peace advertisement that summer is a compelling nuanced novel about the long terrible aftermath of sexual assault and the things that can be stolen from women that can never be fully restored but because it s a jennifer weiner novel it s no polemic it s empowering in its own way weiner seems to steadfastly believe in the saving grace of humor the ability of time to open up possibilities and the strength of female friendship me too share this article share maureen corrigan who is the book critic for the npr program fresh air teaches literature at georgetown university that summer by jennifer weiner

as roughly 1 100 coal miners at warrior met coal in alabama enter the third month of their strike there are growing signs that it is in imminent danger of being shut down and betrayed by the united mine workers of america umwa on may 22 umwa executives assaulted left wing podcasters at a fundraiser for the strike mistakenly thinking they were associated with the world socialist web site the union bureaucrats have been enraged that miners have widely read and circulated wsws articles and statements about their struggle which contributed to their massive rejection of the first umwa backed tentative agreement voted down by 1 006 to 45 although the attack was directed in the immediate sense against the wsws its main purpose was to intimidate rank and file miners and subdue any opposition to the company s demands days after the assault leading union officials including umwa president cecil roberts staged a civil disobedience publicity stunt sitting on a road in front of the no 7 mine until they were led away by police the toothless performance was intended both as a face saving gesture and an effort to head off any serious actions by miners that would actually impact the company s operations the umwa is following a playbook perfected over the course of nearly 40 years of treachery at bitter strikes against at massey and pittston in the 1980s the union worked to crush the resistance of miners who had long been in the forefront of the class struggle and among the most militant sections of the working class umwa leaders including current afl cio president richard trumka replaced the long standing principle of national strikes with impotent selective strikes and middle class protest stunts while at the same time directing thuggish attacks against miners who opposed these betrayals warrior met coal miners have not struck for two months only to suffer yet another sellout and defeat the enforced isolation of the strike must be broken first of all a nationwide walkout of the tens of thousands of miners in the us must be initiated in a counteroffensive against the relentless corporate assault on wages and working conditions in addition to miners the broadest sections of the working class must be mobilized including not only railroad and port of mobile workers who ship coal but also steelworkers autoworkers amazon workers and others both in alabama and beyond there is growing sentiment among workers for a genuine fightback inflation in consumer goods is increasingly eating up take home pay while the stock market continues at near record highs and corporate executives and billionaires grow their fortunes alongside the two month strike at warrior met coal walkouts have taken place this year or are ongoing by steelworkers at allegheny technologies incorporated ati in several states volvo truck manufacturing workers in southwestern virginia nurses at st vincent hospital in massachusetts and graduate student workers at new york and columbia universities in every case the unions have not sought to expand and win these struggles but rather to smother and sabotage them similar to the umwa the united steelworkers usw has strung out steelworkers on inadequate strike pay while refusing to call out its tens of thousands of members at other steel companies at volvo truck the united auto workers uaw torpedoed a two week strike just as it was set to impact other plants in the company s operations sending workers back to the plant without seeing let alone voting on the tentative agreement the blatant pro company maneuver provoked a rebellion by workers who organized a rank and file committee once workers learned of the concessions contained in the uaw backed agreement they voted it down by an overwhelming 91 percent at warrior met the umwa has been starving miners on just 300 a week in strike pay roughly equivalent to the federal minimum wage of 7 50 an hour or an annual wage of just 15 000 below the already absurdly low federal poverty guideline of 17 420 for a household of two while miners have been forced to choose which bills to pay or have been compelled to take on second jobs umwa executives at both the district and national level sitting on 164 million in assets have continued to take home their bloated six figure salaries umwa president cecil roberts based on his annual gross salary of 194 416 in 2020 would have been paid approximately 3 888 every week of the strike umwa district 20 vice president larry spencer who led the assault on the podcasters on may 22 and had a gross salary of 121 277 last year would have a weekly check of 2 425 a central demand of the miners at warrior met is to reverse the 6 an hour wage cut that the umwa forced through in 2016 following the bankruptcy of the company s predecessor walter energy while miners were forced to suffer this painful and humiliating concession the income and assets of the umwa have remained largely stable even as thousands of coal miners continued to lose their jobs in other words the union executives have separated their financial interests from those of the workers they claim to represent the umwa is a microcosm of the pro corporate anti working class operations of the trade unions as a whole the main us trade union federation the afl cio is headed by former umwa president trumka annual salary 286 000 who epitomizes this process having sold out numerous miners struggles working with the mine companies to impose tens of thousands of jobs cuts during his tenure and allow large sections of coal miners to be wiped out predictably trumka and the afl cio have done nothing to inform their millions of members about the alabama coal miners strike let alone mobilize them in its support the reality is that the afl cio unions do not unite workers across industries or even within a given workplace its resources including those derived from workers dues are not used to advance workers interests the afl cio and its subsidiaries function as extensions of management they are overseen by executives who have acquired upper middle class incomes and are hostile to the workers they claim to represent the unions are working closely with the biden administration which is well aware of the explosive social anger that has built up in the united states as a result of the ruling class response to the pandemic the afl cio and the umwa have close relations with the democratic party which is promoting the unions as instruments for suppressing the class struggle and disciplining the working class as part of the economic and military offensive against china contrary to the attempts of umwa bureaucrats to convince miners they are powerless and alone workers in alabama are in fact taking part in an international resurgence of class

combination had been completed after having been approved by roth acquisition s stockholders at a special meeting held on march 16 2021 throughout the class period purecycle touted the technology it licensed from procter gamble however the truth was revealed before the markets opened on may 6 2021 when analyst hindenburg research published a report on purecycle entitled purecycle the latest zero revenue esg spac charade sponsored by the worst of wall street in the report hindenburg wrote among other things that 1 hindenburg spoke with multiple former employees of purecycle executives former companies who said purecycle s executives based their financial projections on wild ass guessing brought companies public far too early and had deceived investors 2 unlike most leading plastics companies publish peer reviewed studies that detail their advancements in the field hindenburg was unable to find a single peer reviewed study in any scholarly journal citing or reviewing purecycle s

something went wrong please try again later invalid email something went wrong please try again later from skyscrapers to hs2 get the latest on birmingham s biggest developments as the city skyline continues to evolve something went wrong please try again later from skyscrapers to hs2 get the latest on birmingham s biggest developments as the city skyline continues to evolve it s almost 100 years since motor industry pioneer henry ford s autobiography reflected that his customers could have any colour of car as long as it was black now it seems that the colour of every other building going up in birmingham is beige and i m not calling your buff while black has always been synonymous with design and chic think of the little black dress and classic taxis beige often seems to stand for boring bland and benign it s the colour homeowners choose when they don t want to offend or to either risk making a statement or worse still a mistake perhaps the use of beige is the architects equivalent of hiding their lamp under a bushel just to be on the safe side bu the effect can be startling as this collage illustrates image google maps graham young birminghamlive on the left is the complex architecture of the former st luke s chuch on bristol street mercilessly demolished in 2018 and the new comparatively featureless beige buildings now being built behind it off hope street which style better suits a memorable gateway to the city a 176 year old church site next to an inner city primary school or beige properties bearing no resemblance to the city s history browse through our photo story here to see if our new beige buildings are to your taste it incudes more examples of the redevelopment off bristol street and how it is changing the character of the area leading city architect and urban designer joe holyoak had an altogether different view when i asked him about it joe said while red brick is visually hard edged buff brickwork can have a crumbly texture which suggests it can be eaten like digestive biscuits an interesting thought but don t try that one at home image graham young birminghamlive what is beige if you type the word beige online the first definition says it s a sandy fawn shade has a calm neutral and relaxing effect representing elegance serenity simplicity warmth and softness it may also stand for dullness and monotony so which beige are you brilliant or bilge image graham young birminghamlive naturally few designers are going to want to go the full hog and be brave enough to design a pink building like the ill fated public in west bromwich see photo story but birmingham s historic buildings are typically built with red orange bricks which have stood the test of time the school of art and midland institute on margaret street and others on nearby church street still look brand new compared with many so called modern buildings catch the long ignored methodist central hall on a sunny day and your eyes go wow what a building image graham young birminghamlive and the dark coloured engineering bricks of our incredible railway viaducts look like they could be as famous as the pyramids in 1 000 years when they will surely still be standing of course the stone used to build such gems as the birmingham city council house birmingham museum art gallery and much of the colmore row facade could be described as beige but here the materials transcend the colour such stonework is more like gold than cheap looking brickwork of the kind which has become horribly disfigured on the 20 year old bull ring indoor market facing pershore street and upper dean street in the city centre image graham young birminghamlive southside bid recently introduced a multi coloured zebra crossing off hurst street and beige wasn t represented by this bold and bright salute to pride and the lgbt community just for fun our picture story showcases the trend that seems to be sweeping across central birmingham from joseph chamberlain college at the highgate end of the a4540 middle ring road to the new lansdowne apartment block at the point where hagley road meets five ways with seemingly everything in between at b5 central on both sides of sherlock street all looking decidedly er beige just like the new bromsgrove house on bromsgrove street and numbers 5 and 2 brindleyplace which perhaps helped to start the trend back in the 1990s but if you asked 100 people whether the city s motto should either be forward or a spin on the old orange advert the future s bright the future s beige would there be many takers image graham young birmingham mail origins of the lighter coloured buildings from his base at the custard factory where else joe holyoak says the urban landscape began to change in 2004 when architect graham morrison decried the habit of making ordinary buildings distorted into unnecessarily complicated shapes by creating a reaction against the post modernist tendency to make every new building into a unique iconic statement he paved the way for a reversion to traditional brickwork joe says this quality which might be called brickiness it draws on the 18th century georgian tradition of architecture and can be seen in brindleyplace where graham morrison s practice allies and morrison contributed two buildings on brindleyplace square one in red brick one in yellow brick image graham young birminghamlive so where do beige bricks come from joe says most of the leading examples of the new ordinariness have been by london architects and built in london therefore they tend to be built in london stock bricks which are yellow buff image alan williams birminghamlive among these you might look at the housing designed by the architect peter barber his work and others like it have become very fashionable and have influenced work elsewhere in places where london stock brick is not the traditional material the birmingham conservatoire is one local example glenn howells southside housing another the quality of brickiness can be equally achieved in the red brick which is local to the west midlands associated architects new building for ucb in charlotte street is an example but i suggest that it is currently less appealing to the eye image darren quinton birmingham live verdict you only have to see the before and after pictures above of the old and new joseph chamberlain college to realise that what matters most is the quality of design and not the colour of the bricks but get it right with red orange as per so many of the redbrick buildings at the university of birmingham and the chances are that you ll be better placed to stand the test of time the same could be said of the mix and match policy employed at brindleyplace more than 20 years ago but the lessons there don t appear to have been learned in quite the way at arena central off broad street as you can see from the photo story above

this marvelous plot comes from an interesting article the monetary and fiscal history of brazil 1960 2016 by joao ayres marcio garcia diogo a guillén and patrick j kehoe the article is part of the becker friedman institute project complete with a big and now easily available data collection effort and forthcoming book if you want a deep historical and economic analysis of fiscal and monetary interactions this is an amazing resource and it summarizes historical episodes that north americans just might want to know more about soon ht ricardo reis who pointed it out in a great discussion last week that i will post as soon as it s available to me the graph is at first blush a reminder that inflation can stop on a dime despite sticky prices seemingly adaptive or sticky expectations phillips curves and so forth brazil seems to have had 6 tom sargent end of inflations episodes in 10 years reminder tom showed that inflation can end very quickly if the underlying fiscal regime causing inflation changes it is also a reminder that politician promises are not enough and inflation can come back pretty quickly as well the steady upward march in 3 6 cases rather than immediate resumption of high inflation is interesting as well but in bresser summer and collor ii we also see an essentially instantaneous reversal i have long thought that the us conquest of inflation had a fiscal and monetary part the high ex post interest rates of the early 1980s may well have represented a fear that we would return to inflation and the fiscal and regulatory reform of 1982 and 1986 may well have had a more important role in cementing the stabilization than is commonly thought the article is too rich to summarize but here is some commentary on the above graph in the end there is so much price control going on that my first impression may be a bit too hasty how much of the slowdowns in inflation just represents temporary price controls is a bit open overview the first plans were based on the idea that inflation inertia due to the highly indexed economy was the essence of the inflationary process and breaking that inertia should be the main focus of the stabilization plan these plans had a neutral shock of freezing prices as one of their main characteristics we know from the nixon attempt just how well that works out unless backed by actual policy changes inflation indexing was an important feature of the brazilian economy an alternative and more standard orthodox theory considers the persistent and large fiscal deficits as the main cause of the inflationary process since the government had to increase the growth rate of the monetary base to raise seigniorage revenues to finance those deficits from the first to the last plan there was less emphasis on the heterodox part of the plan which comprised price freezes and more emphasis on the orthodox part fiscal and monetary policies became a major component of the latter plans while maintaining a device to synchronize the adjustment of nominal variables to avoid threatening the new low inflation level cruzado plan as what became standard in most brazilian stabilization plans the first rule was to change the currency in that case from cruzeiro to cruzado which meant cutting three zeros prices were frozen and any indexation clauses for periods shorter than one year were forbidden wages were converted into cruzados based on the average purchasing power of the last six months but could be readjusted every time inflation hit 20 percent or during the annual readjustment cycle the exchange rate regime also changed with the domestic currency now pegged to the us dollar fiscal and monetary policies were put under the discretion of the policymakers but there was an important change the creation of the national treasury secretariat which would take control over both the administration of the domestic public debt and the government budget under the discretion of policy makers doesn t sound like a great regime shift but the previous part of the paper documents just how much of brazil s budget was not under control in particular brazil had a development bank with the right to print money to finance infrastructure projects and large state owned enterprises a later section weak institutions that provided indirect access to the printing press covers this some detail it all fell apart one huge imbalance was the inconsistency of the plan for inflation and the monetary base the monetary base was increasing much faster than inflation itself in july 1986 the government implemented a timid fiscal package cruzadinho focusing on increasing government revenues but in reality cruzadinho had the opposite result of what policymakers expected imports kept increasing while exports declined a rumor of a large devaluation in the near future reinforced that pattern this expectation lead to a postponement of exports and an acceleration of imports which increased the problems with the balance of payments an exchange rate peg is a fiscal commitment bresser plan in july 1987 the government implemented the bresser plan named after finance minister luiz carlos bresser pereira it was presented as a hybrid plan with fiscal and monetary policies as well as aspects to deal with inflation inertia bresser plan in july 1987 the government implemented the bresser plan named after finance minister luiz carlos bresser pereira it was presented as a hybrid plan with fiscal and monetary policies as well as aspects to deal with inflation inertia as in the cruzado plan prices were frozen as usual the moment in which the price freeze took place was important because the relative prices would remain stuck and possibly off equilibrium trying to get a better result than the cruzado plan in this aspect after the price freeze there was an increase in the prices of public services and some administered prices to correct for misalignments in relative prices but the economic team created another kind of wage indexation micromanagement of relative prices indexing wage adjustments and the equity aspects of price controls seem to be a big part of these plans in the fiscal policy arena the government aimed to reduce the operational deficit from the expected 6 7 to 3 5 percent of gdp the plan did not address or seek to deal with the consequences of the previous default with creditors however the reform was not successful in 1987 the deficit was much higher than promised unlike the cruzado plan which had popular support the bresser plan was not popular rereading tom sargent s methods of poincaré and thatcher popular support is an important force to keep the commitments of a new regime going the latter two observations seem intertwined and will make any us stabilization a messy affair a stabilization needs popular support and our government is obsessed with micromanaging equity and does not hold back from micromanaging prices and wages in any emergency even the last us price controls fell apart with group after group pleading for special exemptions summer plan the government implemented the summer plan in january 1989 again it was a hybrid plan but the debate on the need for changes in fiscal and monetary policies was increasing like the previous plans it included a component of price freezing as well as the adoption of a nominal anchor in this case a fixed exchange rate 1 cruzado novo 1 000 cruzados us 1 was implemented for an indefinite time moreover an attempt was made to end inflation indexation on the fiscal and monetary side the plan was to adopt a tight monetary policy and to fight inflation by controlling the public deficit it intended to control expenditures and increase revenues through the privatization of publicly owned assets and a reduction in the wage bill of the public sector should it come to that government employee and teachers unions and pensions will be part of the us stabilization plan i say that just to say how hard seemingly anodyne policy plans are overall the plan seemed to incorporate everything that was missing in the previous plans although it kept a heterodox flavor it was mostly an orthodox plan aiming to reduce subsidies close public firms and fire public employees with a deindexation plan that was sort of a small default however the government did not have the political power to carry it through without congress privatizations and other unpopular measures such as the closing of public firms were canceled in the end the reforms were not implemented moreover the tight monetary policy put interest rates at high levels and increased the fiscal deficit of the government with low credibility and a reform that did not go through inflation accelerated and the summer plan also failed my emphasis to change a regime one needs durable policy and higher interest rates can lead to a doom loop on the other hand a true sargent end of inflation usually involves instantly lower interest rates and printing more money so the lack of credibility of the plan may show right there collor plan

there is an undeclared war going on in the south east the headlines in frightening details painted the lurid portrait yesterday gunmen kill 7 military men raze police stations gunmen raze courts in imo abia cid building burnt down ipob s stay at home order tension in ebonyi imo others then the big one ahmed gulak shot dead in owerri we should be worried today is the last day of may 2021 it has been a full month of violent deaths tragic crashes and clashes the fact that things appear reaching a climax in may smells deja vu general abdulsalami abubakar has not told us why he chose may 29 1999 as the commencement date for this democracy was it a code a decision that canceled october 1 our independence day from our political diary must be very significant to those who took it nigeria s structural problem started on may 24 1966 when jtu aguiyi ironsi abolished the regions and centralized the country s administrative structure in quick forward march from that misadventure was the may 29 1966 deadly reactions from the north it was called the may pogrom an organized massacre of helpless people and it claimed hundreds of igbo lives then came the counter killings in the east and the may 30 1967 declaration of the republic of biafra all cascading into a 30 month civil war that killed about 100 000 soldiers and two million civilians the crisis which threatens to climax today is therefore not just a reaction to the present systemic injustice it is also of historical nostalgia other parts of nigeria clink glasses every may 29 celebrating democratic civilian rule reflective sad angry igbo families see the celebrations as mocking them their defeat they spend the day to remember the dead count and recount losses and get restive in their blood soaked enclave has nigeria decided to fight yet another war in that corridor three weeks ago president muhammadu buhari met with his security chiefs where he approved new measures to deal with the growing insecurity in the south east and the south south the security measures according to the inspector general of police usman baba would not be disclosed to the public briefing journalists after the meeting mr baba said we have some measures which we have outlined and have been approved by the council and we will see how we can change the narrative within the quickest possible means to restore law and order and restore peace in that area we solicit all law abiding citizens to work with us to identify and deal with the situation that is that i may not go into the details of how we will do that the national security adviser babagana monguno also told journalists that there were those he described as enablers of crime who would be dealt with while there was the need to find quick responses that would mitigate the growing threats to the nation and its stability these enablers are discussed in detail and mr president has already given direction on how to deal with them he said what were those measures some felons valorized as unknown gunmen have been killing poor security operatives in the east most of the murdered were igbo officers and men the gunmen have been setting on fire symbols of state power most of the burnt structures were igbo assets the birds of the felons are defiling their own nest but the state just like it did with boko haram has responded like the blind shooting into the marketplace the attackers are seldom hit it is the igbo earth that is scorched in regrettable deaths and destruction i am not exactly a fan of the igbo as a body of political people they like any other ethnic group have their stock excesses but their elites are the very worst in befriending their tormentors and abandoning their chi and their backers their goats run after any palm frond no matter who is holding it they forget that when the palm wine tapper allows his hemorrhoid to be seen while atop the raffia palm tree what he taps no longer appeals to anyone they do that repeatedly even emeka ojukwu came back from exile and joined the ultra northern npn but then among them there are wonderful persons i always know one could fight shoulder to shoulder with and who won t desert the front in hot pursuit of looted power the ordinary igbo man is that honourable person and he is the one bearing the brunt of today s madness the igbo say water has bones if you do not chew it you won t know the nigerian state appears determined not to take any prisoner in igboland it appears doing more than police action there there are soldiers on the street enforcing compliance with nigeria s non negotiable unity but here is where the bone in the water comes in the igbo response has not been less lethal an american soldier was asked why a vietnamese village was bombed out of existence he told the associated press we had to destroy ben tre in order to save it both sides in the abuja vs igbo conflict like the unnamed us soldier in vietnam appear intent on destroying the land as an acceptable price for its safety is nigeria answering the igbo question right we have learnt no lessons declaring a full blown war on the south east in addition to the interminable ones with terrorists in the north east and the north west and parts of the north central cannot end in praise we do not have a history of learning from past errors from the middle belt to the south repetitive afflictions rise and rebound to our shame for instance in benue the nigerian government is tying down the tiv lion for the feline fulani to eat in bits we read of horrendous killings and hear grating cries of per second bereavement forty two persons were reportedly murdered there as last week was preparing to close but how far can the murderers do that without consequences there was the tragic tiv riot of 1964 and its lingering aftermath whatever happened that time has not taught those wielding power in abuja lessons seeking to overrun tivland failed in 1964 it will fail even in more catastrophic degrees today i can read the same in the blood soaked soil of south eastern nigeria if there are prancing leopards everywhere in the south today who is to blame blame the north and the incumbent president both of whom have become potent threats to the south in all existential ways can you force someone to love you especially when your eyes wear the colours of hatred the igbo for historical reasons resent their nigerianness yes that is very apparent they fought a civil war with nigeria yes but was it not the same igbo that soon after the war provided a deputy for president shehu shagari they forgot everything the war the pogroms and whatever else they suffered they moved on with one nigeria earning their living eating compromising until this government happened to the country and quarantined them like lepers the igbo after the civil war interred all cries and whispers of secession it appeared all they desired from nigeria was fair treatment and justice then buhari the conquistador came with his bayajidda sword and started giving them the snake treatment we should be worried the boys munching peace in igboland today are not the old boys defeated in 1970 nigeria cannot win this war it should negotiate the future with everybody including the igbo democracy clocked 22 years on saturday may 29 in nigeria if you ask the person next to you they may likely say it has been all air no substance the deregulated disaster of recent years has particularly put a question mark on the popular definition of that form of government on saturday i read benue plateau zamfara and niger folks who stressed that it has been about pains and deathly pangs all the way one said he was living like a refugee another said his loss of all his three buildings was his gains from this democracy yet there was the one who agonized that tears hunger and bloodshed had been the lot of the people i can no longer visit my village because it has been taken over by the fulani was the experience of a retired controller of prisons from benue now to something positive this democracy warts and all is not completely about dream killers and mass murders if the eyes can look well enough it should see its neighbour the nose there has been some progress made in certain areas and we have our governors not abuja to thank each of them in their own ways has struggled to fill gaps they plug holes that were dug in the highways of their people by the progressively failing nigerian state i live in ibadan oyo state so i can speak on what i see and i am citing just one instance three years ago i had a reason to go to the nysc orientation camp in iseyin the road to take was the 65km moniya ibadan iseyin road i was on that road as a reporter in 1996 or 97 when it was reworked and commissioned by col ahmed usman now late twenty three years after that reportorial experience i met a road that was more ghastly than horror as i groaned in the car i pitied others including poor fragile corps members in creaky buses there was also the ever present fear of the grim terrain presenting a perfect field of play for marauding herdsmen it was a 40 minute trip that took three hours a journey i wouldn t wish for my enemy so when in 2019 governor seyi makinde said he would reconstruct the road and deliver it in 18 months i laughed and simply glazed his words in cynical frames but today the road is ready rebuilt and it is marvelous in our eyes if i had not been a victim perhaps i would be on the other cynical sniggering side but i suffered it and i am bold to state that because of a decision that was right a million others won t go through what i went through now have you asked why the 127km lagos ibadan expressway is an endless construction site with no delivery date why has abuja not completed one road in six years and governors are inaugurating roads every year ask please oyo has benefited from a positive change of guards in the governor s office and on the reconstructed road i could see that the governor has serially cut himself off from a past of jinxes and has breathed fresh air into what he has had to do i see what has happened to that iseyin road as a metaphor for what can happen to nigeria and its democracy if the head is right that is why we won t stop demanding a structural rebirth of the negotiated nigeria that existed before aguiyi ironsi and his may 24 1966 unification tragedy we can recreate our nation we can rescue our lives from the pains of nigeria without going through another civil war we can only if we are audacious enough to confront the principals and principalities and we will god willing you should not miss these headlines from nigerian tribune we have not had water supply in months abeokuta residents in spite of the huge investment in the water sector by the

that resulted in an initial 4 7 billion verdict in favor of 22 women who used talc products and developed ovarian cancer a state appeals court cut more than half the money out of the verdict and eliminated two of the plaintiffs but otherwise upheld the outcome in a trial in which lawyers for both sides presented dueling expert testimony about whether the company s talc products contain asbestos and asbestos laced talc can cause ovarian cancer the jury found for the women on both points after which judge rex m burlison wrote that evidence at the trial showed particularly reprehensible conduct on the part of defendants the evidence burlison wrote included that the company knew there was asbestos in products aimed at mothers and babies knew of the potential harm and

in autonomous and self driving vehicle news are tesla robotic research aaa valens scania sberautotech mobile industrial robots kodiak robotics beep foresight and jaguar tesla adds driver monitoring camera tesla is now using the interior camera to monitor drivers release notes state the cabin camera above your rearview mirror can now detect and alert driver inattentiveness while autopilot is engaged camera data does not leave the car itself which means the system cannot save or transmit information unless data sharing is enabled model s and model x vehicles made before 2021 do not have a cabin camera though the redesigned versions announced in january which have still not shipped are supposed to have them robotic research gets dla contract robotic research llc a global leader in autonomous driving technology and solutions announced that it was just awarded a contract by the defense logistics agency dla to develop the unmanned autonomous guided vehicle agv which will be used to tow loaded carts inside and outside of warehouses the dla currently maintains 20 storage sites with more than 570 warehouses so a successful agv development could lead to follow on contracts for as many as 100 such vehicles the agv also has broad application in the warehousing and storage sector for both commercial and other military customers we are very excited to be developing an agv for the dla said alberto lacaze co founder and president of robotic research not only would an unmanned tow vehicle save the dla money and increase safety and efficiency conducting autonomous operations in and between warehouses would be a technological first the dla wants an agv that is rugged robust and highly maneuverable the unmanned tug will have to tow loads as heavy as 18 000 pounds climb steep slopes 12 percent grade turn tight corners maneuver safely around people and other vehicles brave inclement weather and less than ideal road conditions and operate indoors without gps guidance to meet these and other requirements robotic research is offering its stock handling autonomous robotic kit shark a platform agnostic solution that can be fitted to any number of commercially available tow vehicles shark will use ai and world modeling safety assist features gps denied localization technologies as well as a mix of sensors lidar radar cameras etc to guide the agv we ve been the key autonomy provider for numerous military programs lacaze said including autonomous ground resupply agr and expedient leader follower exlf and our wearable warloc device which has been deployed with army brigade teams provides gps denied localization the company has demonstrated vehicle agnostic automated technology and the ability to operate alongside pedestrian and mixed traffic in the commercial world as well operating in over 30 cities worldwide and on more than 30 different types of vehicles localization and people avoidance are core agv requirements these capabilities plus our experience with all weather edge cases will be a tremendous asset to the dla and others said lacaze aaa says people are worried about self driving vehicles over the next two years as on road pilot programs and testing increase self driving vehicles will continue to move from novelty to closer to reality meaning more drivers are likely to encounter them regulators must establish guidelines that ensure self driving test vehicles are identifiable and consistent in their actions while on the road with human drivers cyclists and pedestrians doing so will enhance people s trust in self driving vehicles while paving the way for drivers to safely interact with automated vehicle technology big or small fast or slow people are worried about driving alongside self driving vehicles aaa recently teamed up with the technology and public purpose project at harvard kennedy school s belfer center for science and international affairs to survey u s drivers to gain greater insight into how they felt about sharing the road with self driving vehicles the survey found that most u s drivers have concerns with the vehicle type and driving scenario making little to no difference in easing that apprehension sharing the road with safer no difference less safe unsure self driving semi trucks 11 12 53 24 small self driving delivery vehicles 12 19 43 26 self driving vehicles on a highway or freeway 13 15 47 24 self driving vehicles on local or neighborhood roads 13 17 44 26 despite these concerns though the survey also found that implementing certain measures would ease driver anxiety which would make you feel safe clear markings that the vehicle is self driving 62 designated lanes for self driving vehicles only 60 restrictions on times of day and or days of the week when self driving vehicles can use the roads 31 self driving vehicle pilots are in full swing in many states currently 38 states and the district of columbia have active programs that allow self driving test vehicles to operate on public roads while some are highly publicized others are not as heavily promoted researchers at aaa and harvard also wanted to learn more about people s awareness and acceptance of these types of programs the survey found that only 35 of u s drivers know that some states allow self driving test vehicles on public roads support of these programs was split across the board 34 of drivers in favor 36 opposed and 31 unsure about it among those opposed top concerns included the safety of sharing the road with self driving vehicles 77 who would be responsible for crashes with self driving vehicles 62 lack of clarity about who would oversee the test vehicles 56 the need for educating the public about how to behave around these vehicles 51 drivers not knowing if a nearby vehicle is self driving 50 as state programs continue to grow it is critical for policymakers and other state government officials to take actions that will build confidence and foster public acceptance of self driving vehicles this research identified four key areas of focus self driving vehicles demonstrate safe and predictable behavior as defined by regulators when in use on public roads and highways self driving vehicles operate consistently and as designed the public clearly understands who would be responsible in the event of a crash with a self driving vehicle the public can easily and quickly identify when sharing the road with a self driving vehicle valens goes public valens a premier provider of high speed connectivity solutions for the audio video and automotive

by charmaine manansala the asian american native hawaiian and pacific islander aanhpi community includes many ethnicities and nationalities and it numbers roughly 20 million citizens in the united states a population set to nearly double by 2050 at the same time the covid 19 pandemic has caused an increase in anti asian hate crimes we have also seen high covid death rates amongst aanhpis with over 18 000 deaths as of march 2021 there is no singular pandemic experience hawaiian native and pacific islander communities for example have been especially hard hit by covid 19 according to ap m research lab pacific islanders are 200 times more likely to die from coronavirus than their white counterparts a similar rate to those seen in black latino and indigenous communities covid 19 deaths in the aanhpi community have reminded us all of our mortality and demonstrated the importance of planning for the end of life many of us may have avoided these conversations with our loved ones for many different reasons but more and more we are coming to appreciate the value of talking about death before a crisis arrives it is vital that we come together and have the difficult conversations that are necessary to avoid suffering at the end of life for ourselves and our loved ones just as there is no singular aanhpi experience there is no singular answer to end of life care questions for example a person living with a terminal illness might make different healthcare choices than a healthy young person some of us may value the quantity of life while others value the quality of life while the pandemic has illuminated that death reaches all of us it s also shown that communities like pacific islanders and native hawaiians have vastly different end of life experiences due to disparities in care studies have shown that asian americans are less likely to fill out advance health care directives than their white counterparts with completion rates at around 12 while non hispanic white americans fill out their advance directives at a rate of 26 36 also federal data demonstrates that only 28 of asian americans utilize their medicare hospice benefits at the end of life compared to 46 of the white population 34 of african americans and 37 of latino hispanic people without these supports in place patients are more likely to be overtreated and less likely to die at home which surveys show most of us want the national nonprofit compassion choices provides free resources to plan for the end of life no matter who you are these resources are vital in starting the conversation with our loved ones about what we want at the end of life together we can be prepared for an end of life that s aligned with our values and priorities charmaine manansala is the chief advocacy officer for compassion choices the nation s oldest largest and most active nonprofit organization dedicated to improving and expanding healthcare options for the end of life more information is available at compassionandchoices org credit to american forum for sharing this article

powder is displayed johnson johnson is asking for supreme court review of a 2 billion verdict in favor of women who claim they developed ovarian cancer from using the company s talc products ap photo jeff chiu file washington johnson johnson is asking for supreme court review of a 2 billion verdict in favor of women who claim they developed ovarian cancer from using the company s talc products the case features an array of high profile attorneys some in unusual alliances including former independent counsel kenneth starr who is representing the women who sued johnson johnson the nation s largest business groups are backing the company and a justice s father also makes an appearance because of his long association with the trade group for cosmetics and personal care products recommended videos the court could say as soon as tuesday whether it will get involved at the root johnson johnson argues that the company didn t get a fair shake in a trial in state court in missouri that resulted in an initial 4 7 billion verdict in favor of 22 women who used talc products and developed ovarian cancer a state appeals court cut more than half the money out of the verdict and eliminated two of the plaintiffs but otherwise upheld the outcome in a trial in which lawyers for both sides presented dueling expert testimony about whether the company s talc products contain asbestos and asbestos laced talc can cause ovarian cancer the jury found for the women on both points after which judge rex m burlison wrote that evidence at the trial showed particularly reprehensible conduct on the part of defendants the evidence burlison wrote included that the company knew there was asbestos in products aimed at mothers and babies knew of the potential harm and misrepresented the safety of these products for decades nine of the women have died from ovarian cancer lawyers for the plaintiffs said johnson johnson denies that its talc products cause cancer and it called the verdict in the missouri trial at odds with decades of independent scientific evaluations confirming johnson s baby powder is safe is not contaminated by asbestos and does not cause cancer the company also is the maker of one of three covid 19 vaccines approved for use in the united states health concerns about talcum powders have prompted thousands of u s lawsuits by women who claim asbestos in the powder caused their cancer talc is a mineral similar in structure to asbestos which is known to cause cancer and they are sometimes obtained from the same mines the cosmetics industry in 1976 agreed to make sure its talc products do not contain detectable amounts of asbestos last year a u s government led analysis of 250 000 women found no strong evidence linking baby powder with ovarian cancer in the largest analysis to look at the question though the study s lead author called the results very ambiguous the findings were called overall reassuring in an editorial published with the study in january 2020 in the journal of the american medical association the study wasn t definitive but more conclusive research probably isn t feasible because a dwindling number of women use powder for personal hygiene the editorial said a few months later the company announced it would stop selling its iconic talc based johnson s baby powder in the u s and canada citing declining demand driven by what it called misinformation about health concerns the disputed link between cancer and talc is not really a part of the high court case instead the company said it should have not been forced to defend itself in one trial against claims by women from 12 states differing backgrounds and with varying histories of using johnson johnson products containing talc the 1 6 billion in punitive damages is out of line and should be reduced the company also argued in a brief that was written by neal katyal a washington lawyer who aligns with progressive causes and also represents corporate clients katyal who was the acting top supreme court lawyer for a time in the obama administration declined an on the record interview the u s chamber of commerce and trade associations for manufacturers insurers and the pharmaceutical industry are among the business organizations backing johnson johnson s appeal tiger joyce president of the american tort reform association pointed to how long it took the trial judge to read the jury its instructions as an indication of how unfair the trial was to johnson johnson when a defendant is facing a case where it takes over five hours for the judge to read the jury instructions to the jury you just have to ask yourself what are we doing here said joyce whose group generally backs limits on liability lawsuits starr said in an interview with the associated press that none of johnson johnson s legal arguments is worth the court s time as the jury found and as every judge to review this six week trial record has concluded johnson johnson s conduct over decades was reprehensible starr said in addition to starr other members of the women s legal team are former attorney general john ashcroft and washington lawyers david frederick and tom goldstein frequent advocates before the supreme court justice brett kavanaugh worked for starr when he investigated the affair between president bill clinton and monica lewinsky which led to clinton s impeachment another name that pops up in some documents in the case is e edward kavanaugh who was the longtime president of the cosmetic toiletry and fragrance association and is the justice s father kavanaugh s group fought efforts to list talc as a carcinogen or attach warning labels to talc products kavanaugh is retired and the group now is called the

rapid appreciation of rmb unsustainable senior researcher xinhua 14 08 may 31 2021 a staff member displays the banknotes and coins included in the 2019 edition of the fifth series of the renminbi at an industrial and commercial bank of china icbc branch in beijing capital of china aug 30 2019 xinhua chen yehua beijing may 30 xinhua the rapid appreciation of the rmb is unsustainable and also not in line with the domestic and international economic and financial situation a senior chinese researcher and former central bank official told xinhua on sunday the current rapid appreciation of the chinese yuan against the u s dollar may have overshot said sheng songcheng professor of economics and finance with china europe international business school and former director of the surveys and statistics department at the people s bank of china pboc the u s dollar index has fallen by 2 2 percent in the past month and a half while the euro has strengthened against the greenback by 2 3 percent and the japanese yen has weakened by 0 4 percent but the rmb has appreciated by 2 9 percent said sheng the u s dollar index is less likely to decline further and the exchange rate of the rmb against the u s dollar should also be relatively stable according to market rules but the rmb exchange rate has hit record highs recently jumping above 6 4 to the greenback which indicates that there is an overshoot in the market sheng said sheng predicts that the rapid appreciation of the rmb is unsustainable as the u s economy is expected to rebound in the second half of the year and the u s dollar may strengthen accordingly while the narrowing interest spread between china and the united states may weaken the momentum of hot money influx meanwhile the strengthened rmb cannot offset price hikes for bulk commodities and it cannot be used as a tool said sheng noting that the rmb exchange rate overshoot is only short term speculation china encourages long term capital investment but it should prevent a large inflow of short term capital which will push up the rmb exchange rate weaken the competitiveness of export enterprises and disrupt the independent implementation of china s financial market and monetary policy said sheng china has sufficient policy tools to use sheng said since october last year the pboc has adopted policies and reforms on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market to guide the basic stability of the rmb exchange rate at a reasonable and balanced level the foreign exchange risk reserve ratio for forward foreign exchange trading has been lowered from 20 percent to zero since oct 12 last year while some banks have phased out the use of the counter cyclical factor in the pricing mechanism of the yuan s central parity rate against the greenback since oct 27 last year besides these moves the central bank can take other macro prudential adjustment measures to maintain the two way balanced flow of cross border funds he said the central bank has improved a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand and with reference to a currency basket and this regime is suitable for china s national conditions at present and for a long time to come he noted the central bank has reiterated efforts to be firm with the floating exchange rate regime appropriately guide market expectations give full play to the role of the exchange rate as an automatic stabilizer in adjusting macro economy and international payments and keep the rmb exchange rate basically stable he said sheng said he believes the central bank will focus on the guidance of market expectations while the trend of the rmb exchange rate will continue to depend on market supply and demand as well as changes in the global financial market web editor guo wenrui liang jun
my family visited hudson new york for a couple of days in march for the same reason everyone goes there it s a cool little town surrounded by the hudson valley and stocked with wonderful food crafts shops and people we used airbnb com to rent a place for our stay the rental was the only bad part of our visit garbage was piled in front of the driveway when we arrived the patio that looked quaint and cozy online was a mess and ringed with construction equipment the hot water didn t work a load of clothes was in the laundry machine the pedestal sink in the bathroom needed only a gentle nudge to tip over the ladder to the loft bedroom was too steep for kids and so on

this is the second in a series of four posts i m publishing on the contrarian view for inflation part one inflation today is not the same as inflation in the 1970s part two commodity inflation is far more leveraged to chinese stimulus than developed market stimulus and the signs are ominous part three the inventory rebuild supply chain pig in the python the price signals of today are creating the excess capacity of tomorrow part four how to position your investment portfolio to stay updated on the rest of this series sign up to receive email updates from us via the form below i primarily focus on us inflation statistics throughout this this is for no more sinister reason than that north america is the only region with inflation at the moment china s impact on commodity prices advertisement china uses an incredible amount of commodities relative to its size this is not a long term phenomenon it has arisen in the last 20 years here is the chart for steel other commodities are similar why does china use so much more commodities than you would expect based on population or economic size advertisement partly because of the growth in exports china now makes up almost 20 of goods exports but this is not really new chinese commodity demand just displaced demand from other countries and it is not the main source of demand chinese apparent steel demand per capita is about double the average developed country when you strip this out the real culprit is the chinese construction sector highrise infrastructure the big consumer of steel is high rise buildings far more than other infrastructure even railways are not that steel intensive side note bridges are steel intensive but there are just not that many built advertisement for example cru estimates 1t of us infrastructure will need about 6m tonnes of steel 110t of copper per year both are less than 0 3 of the current world annual supply on the other hand there will likely be less global demand for apartments and more for houses following covid less demand for office highrise less demand for retail shopping centres a small fall in demand for these buildings would provide all the steel and copper you need for a 1t us infrastructure package so the completion of existing buildings is keeping demand strong right now but is there a demand air pocket to follow in china urbanisation is the key china has moved an incredible number of people to cities in the last twenty years in recent years it has been around 25m people per annum but the problem is demographic china s population growth is very low and likely to keep falling it is expected to be negative before 2050 there are already almost 65 of people living in cities up from 15 in the 1970s advertisement most countries top out in the low 80 urbanisation levels when will china slow its urbanisation there are 25m people per year moving to cities now a smooth fall like we have seen in other developing nations would see 20m people or less moving to cities by 2025 and falling over time or will it be a sudden stop i e will china try to keep moving 25m people to cities until there are no more people left the difference in the number of people is stark i don t know which it will be i m guessing it will be the latter given china s history which means no short term issues for prices but the main point is that there is structural downside risk i e the amount of commodities needed for building in china could halve in the next ten years which would be around 20 of the total worldwide demand for many commodities advertisement empty apartments estimates are that around 20 of chinese apartments are unoccupied this is about 50 60m apartments chinese construction numbers are difficult to know how to assess new starts have consistently been around double the completions this means that the number of apartments under construction keeps growing suggesting something wrong with the starts number however sales are about the same as starts so maybe a chinese habit of building an apartment but not installing the fixtures painting kitchens electrical etc is partly to blame i e many investors own an unfinished apartment when they rent it or move in they can install the fixtures and not worry about depreciation in the meantime advertisement additionally apartment sizes are growing while people per household is shrinking there are a lot of moving parts what it does mean is the number of apartments completed seems to be about the same as the number of people moving to cities the number sold and started appears to be about double the number of people moving to cities there is enough housing stock currently under construction to cater to about 9 more years of demand there are enough empty apartments to cater to another 4 5 years of demand the net effect is that china can easily afford to slow down construction for years decades without causing problems for its urbanisation plans residential investment measured in dollars expressed another way residential investment in china as a proportion of gdp is advertisement double the level of japan before its housing crash three times higher than the us before its housing crash again on its own this suggests a longer term downside for commodity demand but admittedly there is no catalyst the overspend could last for years one more thing to set the picture most of the recent spend has been driven by increased debt is it just me or is there now a short term catalyst advertisement in 2020 china announced lending conditions on property developers called three red lines these conditions are now being enforced it is trying to slow the property lending market which has grown around 600 over the past decade the central bank also announced caps on property lending by commercial banks effective jan 1 2021 in feb 2021 the ministry of natural resources guided two dozen major cities to carry out land supply policy reform this will likely help stabilize land and property prices china is trying to slow credit to the property sector so far it is working the credit impulse in china has hit zero any number of charts are out there showing that after the credit stops flowing commodity prices fall producer price inflation falls advertisement note china will once increase credit again to the sector in the future it is not a one way ticket however while the long term trend will be down it will be punctuated by bursts of credit to strengthen the chinese economy when it weakens we have just been through a credit burst which looks like it is finishing so the current trend is down there is a lag to both the change in credit and the effect of fewer new housing starts best guess is somewhere around 12 months and credit started rolling over nine months ago chinese recycling rates recycling rates of metals are low in china due to a lack of existing supply moving a farmer to a city apartment creates significant steel and copper demand but knocking down a rural hut doesn t create much scrap over time china will be knocking down old apartments to put up new apartments this does create scrap additionally china put restrictions on imports of all recycling materials in 2018 as a fight against pollution this had the unintended consequence of increases the demand for raw copper and iron ore which are much more energy intensive so after making this mistake china has now essentially reversed the policy it reclassified scrap as a resource rather than waste and suspended import taxes created as part of the us trade war recycling in china will increase estimates vary but more metals every year are going to be recycled significantly more mckinsey thinks by 2030 that china would need around 200m fewer tons of iron ore about 13 of the global seaborne market advertisement finally recycling has also been affected by covid in particular it significantly impacted ewaste recycling which is a major source of copper recycling china recently announced measures to help accelerate the transition to recycled metals i note that accelerating the change reduces china s reliance on imported metals particularly from australia improves environmental outcomes uses less energy all are priorities for the chinese leadership advertisement china s impact through trade china has routinely exported deflation where china hong kong now make up almost 20 of all goods exports prices have been increasing from chinese imports recently however inflation from chinese imports has been lower than us inflation for almost every period in the last few decades and last month was no exception there is a second quandary for those who are concerned that the producer price index which is increasing in china is causing us consumer inflation why is the producer price index affecting american consumer inflation but chinese inflation is running below 1 advertisement this could change if supply chains continue to have problems more on that in the next part of our series long term commodity prices you can get a range of different narratives from commodity prices some argue that it is different now we have mined all of the easy stuff i beg to differ we have always mined all of the easy stuff but that didn t stop real prices from falling for most of the same time frame advertisement and even as the amount mined per annum increased exponentially the years of future production has remained around 40 years due to new discoveries and more efficient mining my narrative is that commodity prices fell for 100 years in real terms up until the turn of the century as technological cost improvements trumped falling grades then the rise of chinese demand in particular construction saw prices spike to record levels on the back of a doubling and tripling of demand over a single decade but the market worked the growth in volumes merely paused in 2015 and prices tumbled back to long term averages or below the latest spike in prices was not caused by a significant increase in demand it has been about a mild demand increase running into supply problems current prices do not look sustainable beware of those who tell you they are an inflation hedge the cavalry is coming covid hit mines will return to full production over the next few years chile the largest copper mining country is increasing its production 20 vale the largest iron ore miner will return to 400mt of production from 300mt countless smaller operations are expanding or starting up spurred on by higher metal prices advertisement what are the odds supply returns just as chinese demand rolls over the most important investment questions others will have you believe that the most important investment question is whether commodities can protect you from inflation i have two different ones what has changed besides short term supply issues that means the world can no longer produce commodities at lower and lower prices every year how confident are you that chinese construction demand won t decline yet many commodity prices are at supercycle levels this has been mainly driven by supply shortages chinese construction is the most critical demand source in the world for commodities infrastructure spend in developed economies is less commodity intensive than the market thinks a range of different measures point to weakening chinese demand quite possibly coming in the next few months several investment banks are pitching the story that you need commodity exposure to protect you from rising inflation a weak chinese construction market will blow that story out of the water advertisement there are both long term and short term reasons for the construction cycle to be peaking in china and commodities are standing directly in its path coming up next

washington johnson johnson is asking for supreme court review of a us 2 billion verdict in favor of women who claim they developed ovarian cancer from using the company s talc products the case features an array of high profile attorneys some in unusual alliances including former independent counsel kenneth starr who is representing the women who sued johnson johnson the nation s largest business groups are backing the company and a justice s father also makes an appearance because of his long association with the trade group for cosmetics and personal care products the court could say as soon as tuesday whether it will get involved at the root johnson johnson argues that the company didn t get a fair shake in a trial in state court in missouri that resulted in an initial 4 7 billion verdict in favor of 22 women who used talc products and developed ovarian cancer a state appeals court cut more than half the money out of the verdict and eliminated two of the plaintiffs but otherwise upheld the outcome in a trial in which lawyers for both sides presented dueling expert testimony about whether the company s talc products contain asbestos and asbestos laced talc can cause ovarian cancer the jury found for the women on both points after which judge rex m burlison wrote that evidence at the trial showed particularly reprehensible conduct on the part of defendants the evidence burlison wrote included that the company knew there was asbestos in products aimed at mothers and babies knew of the potential harm and misrepresented the safety of these products for decades nine of the women have died from ovarian cancer lawyers for the plaintiffs said johnson johnson denies that its talc products cause cancer and it called the verdict in the missouri trial at odds with decades of independent scientific evaluations confirming johnson s baby powder is safe is not contaminated by asbestos and does not cause cancer the company also is the maker of one of three covid 19

mineral similar in structure to asbestos which is known to cause cancer and they are sometimes obtained from the same mines the cosmetics industry in 1976 agreed to make sure its talc products do not contain detectable amounts of asbestos last year a u s government led analysis of 250 000 women found no strong evidence linking baby powder with ovarian cancer in the largest analysis to look at the question though the study s lead author called the results very ambiguous the findings were called overall reassuring in an editorial published with the study in january 2020 in the journal of the american medical association the study wasn t definitive but more conclusive research probably isn t feasible because a dwindling number of women use powder for personal hygiene the editorial said a few months later the company announced it would stop selling its iconic talc based johnson s baby powder in the u s and canada citing declining demand driven by what it called misinformation about health concerns the disputed link between cancer and talc is not really a part of the high court case instead the company said it should have not been forced to defend itself in one trial against claims by women from 12 states differing backgrounds and with varying histories of using johnson johnson products containing talc the 1 6 billion in punitive damages is out of line and should be

us from becoming russians as russian soldiers had already landed on a danish island my heart is filled with gratitude toward all the soldiers who came to help us inge mccormack sebastopol the story of the century editor population declines are a great thing we need to stop being so shortsighted and myopically focused on growth how did people come to believe that in a finite world we could have infinite growth we cannot continue to pollute our waterways overfish our oceans cut down our forests and overheat our atmosphere without repercussions we are on a planet that operates as a web of interconnectivity and interdependence the ongoing destruction of the critical biolayers of insects invertebrates and fish should be a wake up call to all of us scientists have been sounding a warning call that we are ignoring have you taken a minute to imagine a world without insects or fish do you know what will happen to the rest of the world once we lose these do you know what other tiers of biodiversity will disappear all of these are heavily exacerbated by population growth this is the story of the century and instead we focus on politics borders and the stock market as much as i love

unfathomable never mind concerns about climate change the most prevalent threat here and now is human behavior has rohnert park forgotten the june 2003 fireworks fire that burned 40 acres in santa

and i was lucky to be a c plus student but with our water situation today in the past and future some common sense kicked in what about a desalination plant at the mouth of the petaluma river after all it is an estuary or maybe build a plant on a barge that could move up and down the river a pipeline could run from the river to atherton avenue to san marin drive to novato boulevard and end up at the stafford dam or there are other options the drought is an obvious major concern with glaciers and polar caps melting and causing sea levels to rise now is the time for desalination an oil pipeline from texas to the eastern seaboard is 5 500 miles long this proposed pipeline could be 30 40 miles long and be built using money from california s current massive bankroll let s stop wasting time i know there are drawbacks from desalination but what other options do we have and please remember it s not the oil it s the water that is the giver of life john christopher baseheart novato fires and

hank skewis healdsburg tell more about mattsons editor i was very impressed with the article about ken mattson s massive real estate acquisitions in sonoma buying up commercial properties may 9 excellent investigative journalism by lorna sheridan like many great articles it raised more questions than it answered and made me want to know more about exactly why the mattsons are swooping in and buying up an alarming number of sonoma properties something is lost in a community when houses are not lived in and commercial spaces are left empty if there is nothing nefarious about mattson s empire building it is time he came forward and shared his plans for these buildings their conservative politics aside intentionally vacant properties in such key locations in our town is a liability a waste and certainly has nothing to do with all the things we love about living in sonoma i would like to read a follow up article with more transparency from the mattsons themselves jill koenigsdorf sonoma gop obstructionism editor with all but six republican senators blocking the effort to establish a bipartisan commission to investigate the jan 6 insurrection how many more times do you need to see how republicans are more interested in protecting themselves getting back majorities in congress and not offending former president donald trump and his base than actually caring about the nation these people have no integrity no backbone and have lost sight of what they are supposed to be doing the 2022 midterm election is more important than ever to increase the democratic independent

in the week leading up to memorial day 2021 president biden made a number of incredibly stupid remarks among the ridiculous bidenisms were these at the 27 25 mark of his speech of may 27 at cuyahoga community college in ohio biden ran into his usual problem with grade school arithmetic by being unable to manipulate two digit whole numbers saying as my mother would say who died and left them boss laughter well i m serious about it now so you got over 50 of corporate profits goin to stock buy backs and the other percent i think it s 42 ah g g let me see 56 it s forty uh h h no it s 38 goes to um dividends the following day at another speech at joint base langley eustis virginia biden s inner creepy joe went on display again on this occasion he slipped his teleprompter leash long enough to verbally ogle an underage girl whom the new york post reported as appear ing to be of elementary school age the girl s entire family parents and two brothers preceded biden to the podium where her mother introduced him after they returned to their seats and during the speech biden went off script long enough to address the little girl directly i uh love those barrettes in your hair man i tell you what i look at her she looks like she s 19 years old sittin there with her like a little lady with her legs crossed biden held a meeting at the fema national response coordination center earlier in the week while attempting to read from printed notes biden stumbled duh there s you know there to be you know beginning uh this effort ta for 2021 is uh i think we ve learned a few lessons from last year as well there s help as soo we we there you know being there to help uh clear roads rebuilt uh main streets uh and so that families can get back to their lives that s what fema does every single day what does that mean and if i were a cabinet level official in attendance would the expression the 25th amendment suddenly and spontaneously pop into my head but just as casanova s problem was too many women and not enough time my problem here is too many great bidenisms last week and not enough column inch space to include all of them i have to leave out some good ones but i think the absolute best bidenism of the week occurred at the 23 26 mark of biden s cuyahoga community college speech folks diseases like alzheimer s diabetes cancers they re all on the cusp of being able to be dealt with you know if we don t do something about alzheimer s in america every single solitary hospital bed that exists in america as the nurses can tell you every single one will be occupied in the next 15 years with an alzheimer s patient every one costing us an excess of a trillion dollars no mothers giving birth no cancer patients no accident victims no heart patients no narcotics overdoses or gun shooting victims nothing but alzheimer s patients first of all who are these nurses and furthermore when one thinks about it during the next 15 years we should expect to see alzheimer s disease deaths decline why because there have been so many premature china virus deaths the median age of china virus death in 2020 was around 82 years of age and the average age of death was around 80 since alzheimer s disease affects the elderly it stands to reason that if there are fewer elderly there should be fewer alzheimer s patients furthermore most alzheimer s patients spend their final days and months and years either at home or in nursing homes not hospitals whatever the case we ll need to earmark one of those beds for one public official in particular image gage skidmore to comment you can find the mewe post for this article here
