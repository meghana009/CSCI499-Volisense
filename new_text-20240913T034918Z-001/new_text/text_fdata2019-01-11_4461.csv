washington federal reserve chair jerome powell one of the nation s top economic policymakers predicted the economy is not going to plunge into a deep downturn this year i don t see a recession in 2019 powell said thursday in an interview at the economic club of washington d c the u s economy is solid and there s good momentum going into this year the u s economy is solid and there s good momentum going into this year said federal reserve chair jerome powell bloomberg al drago several prominent economists and investors have said there s a heightened chance of a recession by 2020 larry summers a harvard professor and former treasury secretary said this week that he thinks there s better than a 50 50 chance of a recession in 2020 powell stressed that the fed is closely monitoring potential cracks in the economy his biggest concern is weakening growth in china and europe although he warned that a prolonged u s government shutdown could become a drag on the economy the principal worry i would have is global growth powell said but he added i still think the mostly likely baseline case for china is another year of solid growth impact of partial shutdown advertisement the fed chair who has been publicly criticized repeatedly by president trump in recent months warned that if there is an extended shutdown it would have an impact on the economy that would show up in the data very clearly jpmorgan has estimated that the partial government shutdown which is 20 days old thursday is shaving 1 5 billion off the economy each week a modest amount in the context of a 20 trillion economy but an amount that will keep growing while there is wide agreement that the u s economy will grow more slowly than the roughly 3 percent rate of 2018 there s a lot of debate about how fast the slowdown will be the fed is projecting 2 3 percent growth this year but the precipitous stock market drop in december was partly driven by fears that growth will be significantly lower than that interest rate prospects powell also noted that it s a problem that the commerce department is mostly shuttered which means key economic data such as retail sales and gdp growth won t be released later this month unless the government reopens that makes it harder for the fed and investors and government officials to understand how the economy is doing trump has urged the fed not to raise interest rates at all this year the fed has projected two more rate hikes but powell is now signaling the fed will be patient on any further hikes when asked thursday if the central bank intends to raise rates at its meeting at the end of january powell said you should anticipate we re going to be patient and watching send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under
optimism that the united states would reach a trade agreement with china cheered investors and boosted the stock markets meanwhile investors who bought chinese auto stocks near their bottom price and gained from their rebound the day after would be even more excited over the past two days geely 0175 and great wall motors 2333 have been on crazy roller coaster rides especially the blue chip geely which rebounded 8 4 percent after plunging 11 percent a day ago the rebound came after the national development and reform commission s vice chairman ning jizhe told cctv in an interview that it would implement measures to stimulate the market s consumption of automobiles and electronics goods this year this includes encouraging more motor vehicles to be used in rural areas which means more villagers and farmers will enjoy the luxury of driving this led to the boost of auto stocks but how should we view the auto sector in the medium term the reason for the recent rebound was based solely on the policy news as the ndrc intended to hedge negative sentiment on national car makers if china were to open its auto market as part of trade negotiations which would intensify competition within the domestic market however details of the policy are yet to be worked out even if china were to subsidize the price of vehicles in the future the united states will very likely to monitor the policy as us president donald trump would not stand back and do nothing if china were to open its market but at the same time subsidize its own auto sector to counter foreign competition most importantly it would be hard to resolve the cyclical and structural problems that the auto sector is suffering from as the decline of auto stocks earlier was mainly due to the downturn of the chinese economy as well as worries over the expected reforms that would liberalize the auto sector geely s market capitalization has shrunk by almost hk 170 billion over the past year and it is currently valued below hk 100 billion nevertheless the carmaker s sales in 2018 was not bad with 1 5 million vehicles sold globally only 80 000 less than its sales target investors are more concerned about the geely s future outlook rather than its past performance a geely report showed that sales in december stood at 93 000 vehicles a 40 percent plunge from the same month a year ago and near a 16 month low but the most worrying fact is that geely has set its 2019 sales target at 15 1 million vehicles unchanged from last year this is a very conservative target which could also reflect the carmaker s concern over market conditions i visited wuhan over christmas and found that overall consumption has worsened compared with the past one to two years my friend there has been driving a chinese made honda for nearly a decade but has scrapped the idea of trading it for a new car because of all the economic uncertainties that lie ahead so it is little wonder that major investment houses held bearish views on geely and lowered their target prices on the stock ivan tong is editor in chief of the standard

on its recent earnings conference call management discussed core product sales new investment in research and development and the company s answer to rising materials costs check out the latest wd 40 company earnings call transcript venerable lubricants manufacturer wd 40 company wdfc 1 32 followed up an exceptional 2018 for its stock with a credible first quarter fiscal 2019 report which it released on wednesday after the markets closed in the three month period ended nov 30 2018 revenue rose 4 over the prior year comparable quarter to 101 3 million and diluted earnings per share advanced 5 5 versus the first quarter of 2018 to 0 90 let s review three significant comments made by management on the company s earnings conference call that provide context on wd 40 s prospects for the current fiscal year a core product enjoyed moderate expansion during the quarter strategic initiative no 1 is to grow wd 40 multi use product our goal under this initiative is to make the blue and yellow can with the little red top available to more people in more places who will find more uses more often ceo garry ridge wd 40 company aims to achieve 700 million in annual revenue by 2025 given fiscal 2018 revenue of 408 million the company will need to achieve a compounded annual growth rate of 8 over the next six years that s a slightly higher pace than the 7 year over year revenue increase the organization booked last year it also indicates future acceleration over projected current year top line growth of 4 to 7 the path to 700 million will be cleared by the iconic product most of us associate with the company its wd 40 multi use household product line during the first quarter sales of wd 40 multi use expanded by 5 year over year to 78 3 million this equates to more than 77 of total company sales during the last three months for the corporation to meet its 2025 objective wd 40 multi use will itself need to maintain an annual growth rate of at least the mid single digits wider distribution of wd 40 multi use will be supplemented by sales of the smaller but faster growing wd 40 specialist line which is geared toward commercial users this product line recorded 8 3 million in sales in the first quarter an improvement of 13 against the first quarter of 2018 more efficient research and development e continuously focus on optimizing resources systems and processes while applying a rigorous commitment to quality assurance regulatory compliance and intellectual property protection i m really excited to share with you that this month we ll be opening our brand new technology center in pine brook new jersey ceo garry ridge alongside its long term revenue target wd 40 strives for an operational objective it terms 55 30 25 this translates to 55 gross margin 30 cost of doing business defined as total operating expense less adjustments for a few noncash expenses divided by sales and ebitda of at least 25 of sales above ceo garry ridge mentions a new initiative that should help bolster each of these metrics ridge informed investors on the call that the new pine brook facility will allow the company s research and development team to conduct laboratory testing in house this represents a potentially significant leap in research efficiency as the wd 40 company has traditionally outsourced most of its laboratory based testing this should benefit the corporation in speeding up development cycles and thus improving margins but it should also greatly enhance wd 40 s ability to innovate and further expand its secondary maintenance product line which includes brands like wd 40 bike spot shot lava and 3 in one minimizing the impact of rising costs the average cost of raw materials that flowed through our cost of goods in the first quarter was higher this year compared to the first quarter last year which put pressure on gross margin in all three trading blocks cfo jay rembolt during the first quarter the wd 40 company s gross margin dipped by 0 4 percentage points against the comparable quarter to 55 1 the commodity and materials cost increases that cfo jay rembolt refers to above occurred primarily in aerosol cans which produced a drag on gross margin of 0 4 percentage points and petroleum based specialty chemicals which negatively impacted gross margin by 1 6 percentage points the corporation was able to offset most of this total of 2 percentage points of gross margin decline through price increases instituted across its three geographical regions over the last year the price realization accounted for 1 2 percentage points of positive margin impact and the company gained another 0 4 percentage points of relief via higher sales volumes and lower inbound freight costs wd 40 s pricing actions demonstrate its commitment to holding fast to the 55 portion of its 55 30 25 business model and at the outset of the new fiscal year the gradually phased in price hikes have allowed management to shore up its forward financial projections looking forward to the rest of the fiscal year in its earnings release the company reaffirmed its full year projected earnings range of between 4 51 and 4 58 per share
washington federal reserve chair jerome powell one of the nation s top economic policymakers predicted the economy is not going to plunge into a deep downturn this year i don t see a recession in 2019 powell said thursday in an interview at the economic club of washington d c the u s economy is solid and there s good momentum going into this year several prominent economists and investors have said there s a heightened chance of a recession by 2020 larry summers a harvard professor and former treasury secretary under former president bill clinton said earlier this week that he thinks there s better than a 50 50 chance of a recession in 2020 powell stressed the fed is watching the situation closely and monitoring potential cracks in the economy his biggest concern is weakening growth in china and europe although he warned a prolonged u s government shutdown could become a drag on the economy the principle worry i would have is global growth powell said but he added i still think the mostly likely baseline case for china is another year of solid growth the fed chair who has been publicly criticized repeatedly by president donald trump in recent months warned that if there is an extended shutdown it would have an effect on the economy that would show up in the data very clearly jpmorgan has estimated that the partial government shutdown which was 20 days old thursday is shaving 1 5 billion off the economy each week a modest amount in the context of a 20 trillion economy but an amount that will keep growing while there is wide agreement that the u s economy will grow more slowly than the roughly three percent rate of 2018 there s a lot of debate about how fast the slowdown will be the fed is projecting 2 3 percent growth this year but the precipitous stock market drop in december was partly driven by fears that growth will be significantly lower than that powell also noted that it s a problem that the commerce department is mostly shuttered which means key economic data such as retail sales and gdp growth won t be released later this month unless the government reopens that makes it harder for the fed and investors and government officials to understand how the economy is doing trump has urged the fed not to raise interest rates at all this year the fed has projected two more rate hikes but powell is now signaling the fed will be patient on any further hikes when asked thursday if the central bank intends to raise rates at its meeting at the end of january powell said you should anticipate we re going to be patient and watching bloomberg jerome powell chairman of the federal reserve speaks during at the economic club of washington d c on thursday

nio had a good year but a slumping market and some stiff competition lie ahead chinese electric vehicle maker nio nio 2 06 said that it delivered 3 318 vehicles to customers in december that was an increase of 7 4 from its november delivery total and more than enough to beat its own guidance for the month and the full year nio beat its 2018 deliveries target but it gets harder from here december s total put nio at 11 348 deliveries of its es8 in 2018 the es8 an upscale battery electric three row suv positioned as a domestic chinese alternative to tesla s tsla 2 71 model x went into production in late june deliveries have ramped up more or less steadily since ceo william li said that 2018 was a milestone year for nio in which it exceeded its deliveries goal in its first months as a public company he said the company will continue to focus on market penetration in 2019 emphasizing service as a differentiator while cfo louis hsieh said he was pleased with nio s production ramp and delivery totals in 2018 he noted that the company s strong year end total was due in part to a reduction in government subsidies for electric vehicles that took effect at the beginning of 2019 he also hinted that an overall challenging automotive market in china could put a damper on nio s growth for a while why nio might struggle to find growth in 2019 challenging is the right word for china s new car market right now sales of passenger vehicles in china fell 19 in december versus the year ago month a stock market slump and ongoing trade war concerns have dented chinese consumers confidence driving passenger vehicle sales sharply lower in recent months for the full year passenger vehicle sales in china fell 6 from 2017 levels to 22 7 million units nio may also face a second set of pressures in 2019 its much larger silicon valley rival appears to have secured a foothold in china the chinese government said in december that it will temporarily lower import tariffs on u s made light vehicles to 15 from 40 a move that will make imported teslas somewhat more affordable to chinese customers right away chinese buyers may find teslas even more affordable in another year or so the company broke ground on a new factory in shanghai last week that will produce inexpensive versions of the model 3 and tesla s upcoming model 3 based model y suv because they ll be built in china they won t be subject to tariffs the model y in particular could throw a wrench into nio s plans nio is looking ahead to the introduction of its second mass market model a five passenger suv called the es6 in june nio is counting on the es6 to take its sales up a notch and on paper at least the es6 seems likely to give the company a boost it s one size smaller than the es8 with longer range and a lower price but if tesla can deliver the model y to chinese customers at a competitive price nio may find itself watching its big american rival run away with its hoped for sales the upshot nio has a tough year ahead hsieh said that nio will stay focused on fundamentals expanding its sales network and boosting the brand s visibility to support future growth that s the right answer but there may not be much more nio can do in a year in which events beyond its control seem likely to put a damper on its growth at least for a while check out all our earnings call transcripts
the stock market s recent resilience is creating a very favorable environment for investors cnbc s jim cramer said thursday after stocks held their gains despite negative action in parts of the market make no mistake a market that can rally even when two signature leadership groups the retailers and the airlines get slammed well that s some kind of bull he told investors stocks initially fell in thursday s trading session following a plunge in shares of macy s which reported weaker than expected holiday sales results american airlines added to the pain after it cut its guidance citing lower fares both stocks declines dragged their respective sectors lower and raised questions on wall street about how weak the economy really is cramer said on mad money with all of this bad news it would ve been natural for stocks to get destroyed he said however that s not what happened not at all sure investors fled from the airlines and the retailers that s natural but they didn t flee from the stock market instead the money just moved around swapping into consumer packaged goods stocks industrial plays and tech names he said cramer argued that this kind of action which he said is often a sign of a rolling bull market is great for investors who are not fighting the fed if they buy stocks anymore now that its chief jerome powell has pledged to be patient when it comes to hiking interest rates this newfound rolling bull market is all about the fact that we re no longer fighting the fed cramer explained so even with no chinese trade deal even with no functional government and no real sense of how weak these corporate numbers will turn out to be the bulls are running free in this environment even on a day where the averages arguably should ve been crushed by the weakness in two monster leadership groups retail and the airlines

when kirstin herbst found out she was pregnant last winter she and her fiancé were overjoyed but when she went to the doctor for her first ultrasound she found out she was having a miscarriage her doctor prescribed a medication called misoprostol which helps the miscarriage to pass but the misoprostol didn t work right away and herbst needed to take another dose herbst was optimistic when she became pregnant again this past summer when she went in for an ultrasound she learned she was miscarrying again sitting next to pregnant women in the waiting room of the clinic she says was devastating i remember hating being out in public says herbst who lives in toronto i definitely preferred to curl up on my couch and just cry when i needed to cry for her second miscarriage herbst s doctor prescribed a regimen that the latest research shows is more effective she took a medicine called mifepristone and then took misoprostolthe next day the combination worked much better and herbst was able to pass the miscarriage at home you just want to sit at home and watch netflix and be as comfortable as possible she says but for women in the u s it is more complicated to get the two medicine approach than it was for herbst in canada because mifepristone is known as the abortion pill mifepristone causes a woman to have what s essentially a very heavy period and there is a small risk of excessive bleeding it s been heavily regulated since it was approved by the food and drug administration for medication abortions in 2000 government restrictions make it difficult for women who are miscarrying to get it research supports drug combination for miscarriage in june the new england journal of medicine published results of a study that showed the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol was more effective than misoprostol alone to help women expel a miscarriage or what s known as an early pregnancy loss that s when a pregnancy is not viable in the first trimester before these findings were published women who were miscarrying usually had three options a surgical procedure to remove the miscarriage misoprostol alone or waiting for the miscarriage to pass on its own research shows that women tend to prefer the surgery or medication but since a single dose of misoprostol fails about 30 percent of the time many women are forced to return to their doctors for a second dose or to get the surgery it ends up adding insult to injury says courtney schreiber an ob gyn in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the university of pennsylvania and the lead author of the new england journal study the misoprostol alone has really not been a therapeutic intervention in schreiber s study which followed 300 women who were miscarrying the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol was more effective in helping patients expel the miscarriage the overall success rate was 90 percent for patients who took both medications and 76 percent for those who who got misoprostol alone it offers them a sense of control over their own bodies and their own process when they feel that they ve already lost an element of control schreiber says adria malcolm for npr adria malcolm for npr a handout about miscarriages provided to patients at the university of new mexico center for reproductive health in albuquerque miscarriage is common the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that over 1 million american women have a first trimester pregnancy loss each year the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists now officially recommends the two drug regimen yet access to mifepristone is restricted in a way that makes it difficult for physicians to prescribe we clearly need to provide mifepristone says dr karen meckstroth director of the women s options center at the university of california san francisco how do we get it regulations limit access to miscarriage drug mifepristone is regulated by the food and drug administration under what s called a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy a designation the agency uses for extra safety oversight that affects how a medication is distributed but most physicians and the fda itself consider mifepristone safe the fda approved the medication for use in 2000 the rems is in place abortion rights advocates say for political reasons it limits access to a medication commonly used for abortion the rems restrictions mean that mifepristone is not available in commercial pharmacies a doctor can t prescribe it for pickup at a cvs or walmart instead a woman must travel to a clinic or hospital that is designated as a mifepristone supplier under an agreement with the drug s manufacturer danco laboratories the patient must also sign a form that says she understands what the medication is for and understands its risks in canada where herbst took mifepristone for her miscarriage women can get their prescriptions for mifepristone filled at pharmacies like any other medication no definitive data exist on the number of clinics in the u s that stock mifepristone according to rachel jones a researcher with the guttmacher institute who studies the drug but academic medical centers and clinics that provide abortions tend to be the places where doctors can prescribe it danco representatives say they can t provide information on the number and types of sites that stock mifepristone because of confidentiality agreements the restrictions on mifepristone mean that most doctors aren t able to prescribe it for women who are miscarrying that can leave these women in the lurch take allison wray an office manager for a construction company in vancouver wash who has been trying to get pregnant for the past several months she was diagnosed with a miscarriage in november and she wanted to avoid surgery her doctor prescribed only misoprostol for her the misoprostol didn t work and she had to return to her doctor after about five days without passing the miscarriage that week wray says her doctor s office had just started to stock mifepristone so she then tried the combination regimen it started to progress much quicker than the misoprostol which was really like a relieving experience wray says everything kind of just feels better molly solomon opb molly solomon opb in a second round of treatment after a miscarriage allison wray who lives in vancouver wash got mifepristone she says it was a relieving experience but for some physicians who oppose abortion the restrictions on mifepristone may provide an appropriate pause says dr christina francis an ob gyn and chair of the american association of pro life obstetrician gynecologists she says the restrictions on mifepristone help ensure women who take it are under the care of qualified physicians who understand how to use the medication i don t see it as imposing an undue barrier on physicians francis says francis often cares for women who are miscarrying and prescribes only misoprostol for women who want to avoid a procedure she sometimes sends them home with several doses of misoprostol so they can avoid returning to the doctor if the first dose doesn t work francis says she thinks the new england journal of medicine study was too small to prove that mifepristone in combination with misoprostol is effective for miscarriage management she says she hasn t prescribed mifepristone for miscarriages and doesn t plan to change her practice based on this study though she might reconsider if additional research replicates the findings for some doctors eager to use mifepristone in the treatment of miscarriage however prescribing the medication requires some creative thinking in albuquerque n m for example women s health providers have developed a special protocol that helps women who are miscarrying get mifepristone we immediately saw this as a superior way of providing care says dr lisa hofler the chief of family planning at the university of new mexico school of medicine hofler runs a clinic that stocks mifepristone but doesn t routinely provide prenatal care since many miscarriages are discovered when women get their first ultrasound in pregnancy she and her colleagues have developed a workflow that lets women who are diagnosed during a prenatal visit elsewhere get same day appointments for mifepristone in the clinic other women s health providers are working to make mifepristone available in the locations where miscarriage is diagnosed like primary care offices and emergency rooms but because many think of mifepristone as the abortion pill it can be difficult to get it stocked even when its intended use is for miscarriages kristyn brandi an ob gyn at rutgers new jersey medical school in newark says she currently can t prescribe mifepristone to her patients even though she practices at an academic medical center that gets referrals from across new jersey some people are worried about the politics around the medication and how that could create repercussions for the hospital brandi says brandi who started in her position this september says she immediately started the application process to get mifepristone added to the list of available medications at her hospital it was approved in december by a preliminary committee that oversees medications but it s still not available for use brandi is optimistic that will change in the coming months while hofler is happy she can provide women with care that is backed by research she says women shouldn t have to go to special clinics to get mifepristone she s hopeful that a change in access will reduce the shame women feel about both miscarriage and abortion people can talk about miscarriage but it s stigmatized in the undercurrents hofler says society still views this as a failing of the woman challenge to fda regulation meanwhile activists are trying to make mifepristone more accessible by eliminating the fda s requirement for additional oversight multiple medical societies including acog the american academy of family physicians and the american medical association are working to overturn the rems classification of mifepristone in october 2017 the american civil liberties union sued the fda on behalf of dr graham chelius a family physician in kauai hawaii who says he would like to prescribe mifepristone his hospital doesn t stock the medication and it isn t available on the island the fda restrictions on mifepristone are motivated by politics not science says julia kaye the lead attorney in the aclu s lawsuit several professional societies including the california academy of family physicians are also listed as plaintiffs in the case the aclu is in the midst of negotiations with the government about technical aspects of the case kaye says and she doesn t expect arguments to begin for at least several months restrictions continue to be necessary to ensure the safe use of the drug an fda spokesperson wrote in an email statement to npr kaye says the aclu s case is not currently affected by the new research about mifepristone s use in miscarriage but she is hopeful more widespread use of the medication will decrease stigma herbst who took mifepristone and misoprostol for a miscarriage this past summer says she still feels sad about the loss of her pregnancies she is hopeful she ll have a baby in the future and meanwhile she says she feels sympathy for women in the u s who aren t able to get the medication that made a difficult time for her a little bit easier it s already one

u nusually for a man who believed in cutting costs wherever possible herb kelleher the boss of southwest airlines america s most successful carrier liked being flexible with trade unions in 1994 during discussions over an unprecedented ten year agreement that would freeze pilots wages for five years in return for stock options in the airline he promised gary kerans president of the pilots association that if the contract went through he would freeze his own salary and bonus for five years as well chairman and pilots should get the same treatment the deal was done listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element born in new jersey he studied english and philosophy at wesleyan university and then law at new york university it was his wife joan whom he met on a blind date who persuaded him to set up a law firm in texas southwest airlines was born not on the back of a cocktail napkin as he later liked to boast but when one of his legal clients rollin king owner of a small commuter airline and his banker john parker came to his office both men found travelling between houston dallas and san antonio inconvenient and expensive and thought they could do it better american aviation in the 1970s was dominated by the hub and spoke approach pioneered by delta air lines in the belief that the most efficient way to fill planes was to fly through hub cities and hoover up passengers what king and parker were proposing was cheap point to point travel using small convenient airports near to fast growing centres the competition was not other airlines they believed but cars after all the distance between houston and san antonio was less than 200 miles a three hour journey by road pacific southwest airlines had made city hopping efficient in california so why would it not work in texas he put up 10 000 of his own money and on november 27th 1967 he filed southwest s application to fly between the three cities what he hadn t reckoned on was the airborne competition within a day braniff trans texas later texas international and continental applied for a restraining order stopping southwest from taking to the skies arguing that texas was perfectly well served by existing airlines for the next four years through the state district court in austin the state court of civil appeals the texas supreme court and the us supreme court the big airlines pleaded for injunctions that would kill off the new business as the airline s lawyer and later its general counsel he laid out its arguments and rebuttals when the night before one final hearing an anxious chief executive suggested that a sheriff might show up at the last minute and stop southwest s first plane from taking off mr kelleher gave him strict instructions you roll right over the son of a bitch and leave our tyre tracks on his uniform if you have to the legal battles forged the southwest culture mr kelleher who became chairman in 1978 and then also ceo in 1981 was deeply affected by the tactics his rivals had used to try to strangle southwest at birth it offended the sense instilled in him by his mother that you should treat all people equally and with respect and it challenged his beliefs about what america stood for as he would later tell kevin and jackie freiberg two academics who studied southwest and went on to write the bestselling nuts southwest airlines crazy recipe for business and personal success it was an affront to my idealism if you re going to let these guys get away with this it s a radically different type of country from the one i wanted to believe in southwest became his cause when one airline ran an ad claiming that southwest was a cheap carrier he had himself filmed with a bag over his head saying the airline was prepared to offer the same to any mortified passenger when another started a price war and halved its dallas houston fare to 13 southwest countered pay full price and get a bottle of vodka or whisky in return when a rival airline complained that southwest pinched its slogan and began advertising itself as just plane smart he suggested the two chairmen settle the matter over three rounds of arm wrestling instead of using lawyers kool cigarette and a glass of wild turkey bourbon at hand he was always ready to tell stories about his airline how it hired for attitude skills you could always teach how all its flight attendants wore hotpants how when it won its first triple crown for best on time performance fewest customer complaints and smallest number of mishandled bags all its customer service employees were allowed to give up their uniforms and dress casually for a year he put his workers first ahead of his customers fortune dubbed him the high priest of ha ha that every day s a holiday atmosphere would be called branding today and was an important part of the southwest story but it hid some hard headed business decisions in the 1970s southwest bought three brand new 737 200s that boeing had been unable to sell in the slump the airline paid 4m rather than the usual 5m for the planes and boeing provided 90 of the finance southwest used no other aircraft a boon for servicing and spare parts it served no meals just peanuts and to ensure the fastest turnaround it offered no seat assignments planes don t make money when they are on the ground and making money in good times to ride out the lean years was what it was all about southwest has made an annual profit for 45 years on the trot without mr kelleher there would have been no michael o leary and ryanair or stelios haji ioannou rolling up his sleeves at easyjet and yet somewhere along the line something was lost cut price air travel today is endured rather than enjoyed it has become a hideous blend of zero hours contracts and excuses to extort charges for everything from handbaggage that is deemed too big to failing to check in online it is hard to imagine today s airline workers taking out a full page newspaper advertisement praising their chairman on bosses day in 1994 southwest s employees did just that pitching in an hour s salary each to raise 60 000 thanks herb for remembering every one of our names for listening for being a friend not just a boss
by reuters by howard schneider and jonathan spicer washington reuters federal reserve chairman jerome powell on thursday stressed again the u s central bank can be patient in approving any further rate increases as officials gauge whether the u s economy will slow this year as some in financial markets worry or continue motoring ahead as the fed itself expects powell s second appearance in less than a week generated a subdued response in financial markets a sign he may have found his footing in how to describe central bank policy without surprising investors several of his recent appearances have generated large market swings in both directions with no sign of excessive inflation or outsized risk in financial markets powell said the fed would be waiting and watching in coming months to see which of those two competing narratives plays out especially with inflation low and under control we have the ability to be patient and watch patiently and carefully as we figure out which of these two narratives is going to be the story of 2019 powell said at the economic club of washington the s p 500 edged up 0 45 percent on thursday while yields on treasury securities were unchanged in contrast his remarks in his three previous appearances since late november moved stocks an average of 2 4 percent in either direction and his comments last friday spurred the largest market reaction yet to any of his 17 public appearances since taking office last february the s p gained 3 43 percent and the yield on the 10 year treasury note rose 11 basis points in that appearance powell emphasized the fed s flexibility and patience in evaluating data easing expectations of steady rate hikes in a message amplified by a half dozen other fed officials in recent days in remarks at an appearance in little rock arkansas on thursday st louis fed president james bullard was blunt saying that the central bank had reached the end of the road in its current rate increase cycle powell and others have been less demonstrative and noted that economic data remains strong particularly after a recent payroll report that showed more than 300 000 jobs added in december powell on thursday also reiterated that separate from what happens with interest rates the fed would continue allowing its nearly 4 trillion portfolio of bonds to shrink each month to a level substantially smaller than it is now the monthly reductions effectively running on autopilot have been criticized by some as a steady tightening of financial conditions the fed should reconsider a new narrative still powell s comments and those of other officials are developing a new narrative big picture they don t have that much further to go and they don t have to go there fast said robert tipp chief investment strategist with pgim fixed income in newark new jersey part of that message is meant to downplay the significance of the policy projections that officials issue every three months the latest round issued in december showed the median policymaker expected rates would be raised twice in 2019 but powell said it was a mistake to construe that as any sort of official forecast or plan there is no such plan powell said that was conditional on a very strong outlook for 2019 which may or may not materialise with the fed adjusting policy accordingly the u s central bank raised rates four times last year in the face of robust economic growth and unemployment that touched its lowest level in half a century fed officials and many forecasters expect growth to slow in 2019 though to remain strong enough to continue generating jobs and keeping the unemployment rate near its almost 50 year low while markets may be concerned about global trade tensions and slower growth overseas powell said there is no evidence of a u s recession on the horizon if conditions weaken the fed would react there is no pre set path for rates particularly now he said if global growth slows more i can assure you we can flexibly and quickly move policy and we can do so significantly if that s appropriate he added advertisement the fed chief was also asked about the partial u s government shutdown he said an extended shutdown would show up in economic data pretty quickly and since it shutters some agencies that provide economic data it would also make the picture of the economy less clear for the fed reporting by howard schneider and jonathan spicer additional reporting by richard leong in new york editing by andrea ricci

when kirstin herbst found out she was pregnant last winter she and her fiancé were overjoyed but when she went to the doctor for her first ultrasound she found out she was having a miscarriage her doctor prescribed a medication called misoprostol which helps the miscarriage to pass but the misoprostol didn t work right away and herbst needed to take another dose herbst was optimistic when she became pregnant again this past summer when she went in for an ultrasound she learned she was miscarrying again sitting next to pregnant women in the waiting room of the clinic she says was devastating i remember hating being out in public says herbst who lives in toronto i definitely preferred to curl up on my couch and just cry when i needed to cry for her second miscarriage herbst s doctor prescribed a regimen that the latest research shows is more effective she took a medicine called mifepristone and then took misoprostol the next day the combination worked much better and herbst was able to pass the miscarriage at home you just want to sit at home and watch netflix and be as comfortable as possible she says but for women in the u s it is more complicated to get the two medicine approach than it was for herbst in canada because mifepristone is known as the abortion pill mifepristone causes a woman to have what s essentially a very heavy period and there is a small risk of excessive bleeding it s been heavily regulated since it was approved by the food and drug administration for medication abortions in 2000 government restrictions make it difficult for women who are miscarrying to get it research supports drug combination for miscarriage in june the new england journal of medicine published results of a study that showed the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol was more effective than misoprostol alone to help women expel a miscarriage or what s known as an early pregnancy loss that s when a pregnancy is not viable in the first trimester before these findings were published women who were miscarrying usually had three options a surgical procedure to remove the miscarriage misoprostol alone or waiting for the miscarriage to pass on its own research shows that women tend to prefer the surgery or medication but since a single dose of misoprostol fails about 30 percent of the time many women are forced to return to their doctors for a second dose or to get the surgery it ends up adding insult to injury says courtney schreiber an ob gyn in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the university of pennsylvania and the lead author of the new england journal study the misoprostol alone has really not been a therapeutic intervention in schreiber s study which followed 300 women who were miscarrying the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol was more effective in helping patients expel the miscarriage the overall success rate was 90 percent for patients who took both medications and 76 percent for those who who got misoprostol alone it offers them a sense of control over their own bodies and their own process when they feel that they ve already lost an element of control schreiber says miscarriage is common the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that over 1 million american women have a first trimester pregnancy loss each year the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists now officially recommends the two drug regimen yet access to mifepristone is restricted in a way that makes it difficult for physicians to prescribe we clearly need to provide mifepristone says dr karen meckstroth director of the women s options center at the university of california san francisco how do we get it regulations limit access to miscarriage drug mifepristone is regulated by the food and drug administration under what s called a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy a designation the agency uses for extra safety oversight that affects how a medication is distributed but most physicians and the fda itself consider mifepristone safe the fda approved the medication for use in 2000 the rems is in place abortion rights advocates say for political reasons it limits access to a medication commonly used for abortion the rems restrictions mean that mifepristone is not available in commercial pharmacies a doctor can t prescribe it for pickup at a cvs or walmart instead a woman must travel to a clinic or hospital that is designated as a mifepristone supplier under an agreement with the drug s manufacturer danco laboratories the patient must also sign a form that says she understands what the medication is for and understands its risks in canada where herbst took mifepristone for her miscarriage women can get their prescriptions for mifepristone filled at pharmacies like any other medication no definitive data exist on the number of clinics in the u s that stock mifepristone according to rachel jones a researcher with the guttmacher institute who studies the drug but academic medical centers and clinics that provide abortions tend to be the places where doctors can prescribe it danco representatives say they can t provide information on the number and types of sites that stock mifepristone because of confidentiality agreements the restrictions on mifepristone mean that most doctors aren t able to prescribe it for women who are miscarrying that can leave these women in the lurch take allison wray an office manager for a construction company in vancouver wash who has been trying to get pregnant for the past several months she was diagnosed with a miscarriage in november and she wanted to avoid surgery her doctor prescribed only misoprostol for her the misoprostol didn t work and she had to return to her doctor after about five days without passing the miscarriage that week wray says her doctor s office had just started to stock mifepristone so she then tried the combination regimen it started to progress much quicker than the misoprostol which was really like a relieving experience wray says everything kind of just feels better but for some physicians who oppose abortion the restrictions on mifepristone may provide an appropriate pause says dr christina francis an ob gyn and chair of the american association of pro life obstetrician gynecologists she says the restrictions on mifepristone help ensure women who take it are under the care of qualified physicians who understand how to use the medication i don t see it as imposing an undue barrier on physicians francis says francis often cares for women who are miscarrying and prescribes only misoprostol for women who want to avoid a procedure she sometimes sends them home with several doses of misoprostol so they can avoid returning to the doctor if the first dose doesn t work francis says she thinks the new england journal of medicine study was too small to prove that mifepristone in combination with misoprostol is effective for miscarriage management she says she hasn t prescribed mifepristone for miscarriages and doesn t plan to change her practice based on this study though she might reconsider if additional research replicates the findings for some doctors eager to use mifepristone in the treatment of miscarriage however prescribing the medication requires some creative thinking in albuquerque n m for example women s health providers have developed a special protocol that helps women who are miscarrying get mifepristone we immediately saw this as a superior way of providing care says dr lisa hofler the chief of family planning at the university of new mexico school of medicine hofler runs a clinic that stocks mifepristone but doesn t routinely provide prenatal care since many miscarriages are discovered when women get their first ultrasound in pregnancy she and her colleagues have developed a workflow that lets women who are diagnosed during a prenatal visit elsewhere get same day appointments for mifepristone in the clinic other women s health providers are working to make mifepristone available in the locations where miscarriage is diagnosed like primary care offices and emergency rooms but because many think of mifepristone as the abortion pill it can be difficult to get it stocked even when its intended use is for miscarriages kristyn brandi an ob gyn at rutgers new jersey medical school in newark says she currently can t prescribe mifepristone to her patients even though she practices at an academic medical center that gets referrals from across new jersey some people are worried about the politics around the medication and how that could create repercussions for the hospital brandi says brandi who started in her position this september says she immediately started the application process to get mifepristone added to the list of available medications at her hospital it was approved in december by a preliminary committee that oversees medications but it s still not available for use brandi is optimistic that will change in the coming months while hofler is happy she can provide women with care that is backed by research she says women shouldn t have to go to special clinics to get mifepristone she s hopeful that a change in access will reduce the shame women feel about both miscarriage and abortion people can talk about miscarriage but it s stigmatized in the undercurrents hofler says society still views this as a failing of the woman challenge to fda regulation meanwhile activists are trying to make mifepristone more accessible by eliminating the fda s requirement for additional oversight multiple medical societies including acog the american academy of family physicians and the american medical association are working to overturn the rems classification of mifepristone in october 2017 the american civil liberties union sued the fda on behalf of dr graham chelius a family physician in kauai hawaii who says he would like to prescribe mifepristone his hospital doesn t stock the medication and it isn t available on the island the fda restrictions on mifepristone are motivated by politics not science says julia kaye the lead attorney in the aclu s lawsuit several professional societies including the california academy of family physicians are also listed as plaintiffs in the case the aclu is in the midst of negotiations with the government about technical aspects of the case kaye says and she doesn t expect arguments to begin for at least several months restrictions continue to be necessary to ensure the safe use of the drug an fda spokesperson wrote in an email statement to npr kaye says the aclu s case is not currently affected by the new research about mifepristone s use in miscarriage but she is hopeful more widespread use of the medication will decrease stigma herbst who took mifepristone and misoprostol for a miscarriage this past summer says she still feels sad about the loss of her pregnancies she is hopeful she ll have a baby in the future and meanwhile she says she feels sympathy for women in the u s who aren t able to get the medication that made a difficult time for her a little bit easier it s already one of the hardest things you ll deal with herbst says why make it harder i hurt so much for people who are pregnant in the states right now dr mara gordon is the npr health and media fellow from the department of family medicine at georgetown university

part of cannabis and small business and retail expand stories go to more storieson the businessof cannabis investment bank haywood securities inc is defending its work on a recent aphria inc deal after two short sellers took aim at the cannabis grower last month sparking a dramatic selloff in the company s shares in september aphria issued almost 300 million in stock to buy marijuana assets in colombia argentina and jamaica from a company now known as sol global investments corp last month new york based short sellers gabriel grego and nate anderson criticized the transaction alleging that the assets had almost no value and that the deal enriched people with ties to aphria in the wake of the short sellers report haywood which did a formal valuation and fairness opinion for scythian biosciences corp sol s predecessor as part of the sale to aphria sent analysts to visit farms and buildings in colombia argentina jamaica and leamington ont haywood analyst neal gilmer and associate ethan spence said thursday in a report that aphria s caribbean and latin american assets are real companies at varying level of development they added that investors who can stomach some volatility should buy aphria s stock at these levels thursday s haywood report came on the eve of aphria s much anticipated earnings call on friday morning shares of aphria fell 2 per cent thursday to 8 71 aphria s stock had been trading below 5 in the days after the short sellers report tumbling from 10 51 before publication investors are still waiting for aphria s promised line by line rebuttal of the allegations the company has called the short sellers report false and defamatory aphria hired cormark securities inc to advise on the deal and provide a fairness opinion to its board a copy of that opinion has not been released to the public and neither aphria nor cormark released it to the globe and mail when requested last month haywood which was paid 350 000 for its services on the transaction produced a 36 page valuation and fairness report dated july 16 a version with redactions was made public last summer in regulatory filings the original report was prepared by haywood vice president mathieu couillard and was reviewed by managing director campbell becher and mr gilmer who wrote thursday s research note haywood s review included site visits to the foreign assets the original report pegged fair value for the assets between 180 million and 200 million at the time the deal was announced aphria agreed to pay 193 million for the assets a rally in pot stocks pushed the price to 298 million in its fairness opinion haywood concluded that aphria s offer was fair to sol mr becher didn t return multiple requests for comment after the short sellers report mr gilmer didn t return an e mail on thursday requesting comment on his note which describes what haywood analysts found at each site and includes photos the haywood analysts wrote thursday in their report that the site visits were largely in line with our expectations and confirm that there are operations ongoing in december the short sellers wrote that their investigator visited the office in mid november and saw five people working there they showed pictures of farmland and a pilot greenhouse posted on the colombian target company s website that were rather underwhelming but the haywood analysts said thursday that they saw work being done on aphria s farm in colombia they said 40 labourers were working onsite adding that crews have been working on levelling the land relocating power lines and on drainage efforts the analysts also visited an office where eight people were employed haywood analysts said they travelled to buenos aires where they toured a distribution centre owned by aphria that stores pharmaceutical products for distribution as well as a pharmacy that sells typical over the counter items and fulfills prescriptions they also said local management provided them with a document showing that the argentine company had booked us 11 million in sales in 2017 the globe was showed similar documentation the short sellers had alleged that the pharmacy was in a rundown part of buenos aires and that the warehouse was an empty dilapidated office with no signs of existing operations when they visited in october they also said they spoke to an employee who claimed the company generated just us 430 000 in sales in 2017 in jamaica haywood said it visited aphria s head office in the country which the analysts acknowledged was modest as well as a retail store awaiting final licensing and a farm where aphria is legally growing cannabis thursday s report said that limited growing is taking place during december and january and added that a large harvest was completed in november aphria has amassed inventory of nearly 2 600 kilograms of cannabis in jamaica that will be sold once the company is approved to do so the report said among their allegations the short sellers had claimed that the retail store didn t exist and that their researcher wasn t able to find the cannabis farm they said that nobody was at the company s office in kingston during business hours when they went to visit in october mr anderson declined to comment on thursday on friday aphria will report its second quarter earnings for the three months ended nov 30 haywood expects aphria will book 20 million in revenue while clarus securities predicts aphria will post 39 million in revenue

the dow jones industrial average posted a five day winning streak its longest such streak since september after federal reserve chairman jerome powell said he was taking a patient approach of waiting and watching on interest rates powell s comments underscored the more wait and see approach to interest policy that fed officials have been discussing in this month in december after the fed raised a benchmark interest rate and indicated more rate hikes would follow in 2019 jittery investors sold off stocks to 14 month lows since then powell and other fed officials have walked back comments that investors saw as hawkish on inflation while also risking an economic slowdown we re in a place where we can be patient and flexible and wait and see what does evolve and i think for the meantime we re waiting and watching powell said thursday at the economic club in washington d c you should anticipate that we re going to be patient and watching and waiting and seeing initially u s stocks fell on powell s comments thursday including remarks that the fed would continue to reduce its balance sheet to be substantially smaller than it is now after reading the tea leaves of his overall comments investors began bidding up stock prices again the dow closed thursday up 0 51 at 24 001 92 the s p 500 index rose 0 45 to 2596 64 while the nasdaq composite ended up 0 42 at 6986 07 powell s speech also addressed his longer term concern about rising u s debt i m very worried about it he said it s a long run issue that we definitely need to face and ultimately will have no choice but to face in a measure of how much the fed s more dovish approach has soothed investor concerns about rising interest rates a survey by the wall street journal thursday said that about 60 of economists expect the fed to hold rates steady until at least june a few weeks ago many were bracing for another rate increase as early as march
nio had a good year but a slumping market and some stiff competition lie ahead chinese electric vehicle maker nio nio 2 06 said that it delivered 3 318 vehicles to customers in december that was an increase of 7 4 from its november delivery total and more than enough to beat its own guidance for the month and the full year nio beat its 2018 deliveries target but it gets harder from here december s total put nio at 11 348 deliveries of its es8 in 2018 the es8 an upscale battery electric three row suv positioned as a domestic chinese alternative to tesla s tsla 2 71 model x went into production in late june deliveries have ramped up more or less steadily since ceo william li said that 2018 was a milestone year for nio in which it exceeded its deliveries goal in its first months as a public company he said the company will continue to focus on market penetration in 2019 emphasizing service as a differentiator while cfo louis hsieh said he was pleased with nio s production ramp and delivery totals in 2018 he noted that the company s strong year end total was due in part to a reduction in government subsidies for electric vehicles that took effect at the beginning of 2019 he also hinted that an overall challenging automotive market in china could put a damper on nio s growth for a while why nio might struggle to find growth in 2019 challenging is the right word for china s new car market right now sales of passenger vehicles in china fell 19 in december versus the year ago month a stock market slump and ongoing trade war concerns have dented chinese consumers confidence driving passenger vehicle sales sharply lower in recent months for the full year passenger vehicle sales in china fell 6 from 2017 levels to 22 7 million units nio may also face a second set of pressures in 2019 its much larger silicon valley rival appears to have secured a foothold in china the chinese government said in december that it will temporarily lower import tariffs on u s made light vehicles to 15 from 40 a move that will make imported teslas somewhat more affordable to chinese customers right away chinese buyers may find teslas even more affordable in another year or so the company broke ground on a new factory in shanghai last week that will produce inexpensive versions of the model 3 and tesla s upcoming model 3 based model y suv because they ll be built in china they won t be subject to tariffs the model y in particular could throw a wrench into nio s plans nio is looking ahead to the introduction of its second mass market model a five passenger suv called the es6 in june nio is counting on the es6 to take its sales up a notch and on paper at least the es6 seems likely to give the company a boost it s one size smaller than the es8 with longer range and a lower price but if tesla can deliver the model y to chinese customers at a competitive price nio may find itself watching its big american rival run away with its hoped for sales the upshot nio has a tough year ahead hsieh said that nio will stay focused on fundamentals expanding its sales network and boosting the brand s visibility to support future growth that s the right answer but there may not be much more nio can do in a year in which events beyond its control seem likely to put a damper on its growth at least for a while check out all our earnings call transcripts
it actually crossed our orbit already on the 8th it is already moving upwards away from our orbit earth is catching up on it from behind and is closest on the 13th at 61 million kilometers that s further away than mars at its closest and much further away than venus at its closest the red top tabloids and other sensationalist press and youtube videos are going wild about this in many different languages too it is my most often asked question at present from scared people whether their lives are at risk because of this asteroid it doesn t matter if they say it or write it in russian spanish or whatever language it is or enlist the services of clairvoyants or astrologers to pronounce about it it is still utter nonsense this is what it will be like on 13th january they found old observations dating back to 1954 and so have 64 years of observation that lets them calculate the distance accurate to within an amazing 127 kilometers over 61 million kilometers and the time of closest approach to 16 50 on jan 13th exact to the minute they have all its flybys worked out through to 2200 and it always flies past more than fifty million kilometers it was completely removed from the risk tables on 1st august 2002 in detail when first discovered it had a chance to hit just because they didn t know its orbit well there were many virtual orbits through the observations and one of those could hit earth in order to do that it had to do it at a particular time as well as place since both objects are traveling at kilometers per second and they have to be synchronized to a few minutes to hit a bit like trying to hit a bullet with another bullet they soon proved that this was not its correct orbit and so proved it would miss it has no risk at all of hitting earth any time this century or the next through at least to 2200 all its flybys of earth are at distances of at least 50 million kilometers to put this in perspective space is vast the distance to the sun is 149 6 million km so an asteroid that gets to 61 million km of earth is much closer than the sun it will be further away than mars or venus when they are at their closest mars at its closest was 56 million km in 2003 how far away is mars distance to mars venus gets much closer than this 38 million kilometers venus fact sheet you can check any story like this for yourself if it isn t in the impact risk table it s not true see also my how to check if an asteroid impact story is fake colour coded alert levels it was the second object to reach level 1 in the torino scale that is the normal green level a routine discovery in which a pass near earth is predicted that poses no unusual level of danger current calculations show the chance of collision is extremely unlikely with no cause for public attention or public concern new telescopic observations very likely will lead to reassignment to level 0 as expected it was soon reassigned to level 0 not only that it was removed altogether on 1st august 2002 you can find it in the list of removed objects there is nothing suspicious about this there are over 2 000 removed objects now 163132 2002 cu11 was the first to be rated level 1 on 20 march 2002 and completely removed from the sentry risk table on 26 april 2002 diameter 460 meters since then at least one object has reached level 1 and then been removed every year in 2018 then four objects did this the highest any got was apophis which reached level 4 in 2004 but even at level 4 you expect it to miss and that is what happened they proved it would miss for details see can apophis hit earth in 2036 no news in tabloid fish wrapper is google nº 1 so there is nothing unusual about 2002 nt7 except for the journalism some journalists wrote sensationalist exaggerated articles in 2002 before it was proved to miss and these articles continue to be reblogged through to today the astronomers proved it would miss way back in 2002 since then they have made many more observations and also found prediscovery photographs of it back to july 1954 they have a total of 64 years of observation now that lets them predict this flyby exactly to the minute they also know the distance it will fly past it will fly past between 61007782 km and 61007909 km from earth so they now know the flyby distance to within 127 km out of 61 million km there is absolutely no possibility at all of it hitting earth you can check the latest calculations for yourself but you need some help to read it go to jpl small body database browser and look for this entry 2019 jan 13 16 50 00 01 earth 0 407811835507195 0 407810985048842 0 40781268596571 that means that it is closest on jan 13 at 16 50 with the time accurate to less than a minute at that point it will be somewhere between 0 407811835507195 and 0 40781268596571 au that means between 61007782 km and 61007909 km from earth to convert au to km just type into google 0 407811835507195 au in km for the observations used in their prediction look at the top of the page first obs used 1954 07 10 last obs used 2018 08 22 to start with with only a few days observations in early july they expected it to miss but weren t totally sure but then with a few more days of observation they knew for sure and then by 1st august they knew that it can t hit earth all the way through to 2200 and beyond it never was on an orbit that could hit earth but in early july 2002 they had only a few observations these are like fuzzy points in the night sky and you can fit lots of lines through them which they call virtual orbits they didn t know which of those was the correct orbit back in 2002 in early july they had so little information so far that the possible places it could be on 1st february covered half earth s orbit it could have passed by as much as six months too soon to hit earth for all they knew at that time earth is the blue dot in this image and the white dots are the possible positions for 2002 nt7 for late january 2019 which would be a few days before impact if it was going to hit earth as you can see most of the white dots are far from earth by the 1st august they proved it would pass earth two weeks too soon to hit earth this is what it looked like by the 5th august well separated from earth and this is what it looked like by june 2018 they have a few more observations now so it is even more precise but it s already just a dot in that image that s why the astronomers never thought it was likely to hit earth they were misreported by the journalists one of those virtual orbits hit earth in 2019 but only 1 in 60 000 of the virtual orbits so it was highly unlikely that it would hit earth it was no surprise to the astronomers that they soon proved it would miss what confuses people is that the virtual orbit hit earth at a particular time 11 47 am on feb 1 2019 why would it hit on that particular time if there is no real impact it s because earth and the asteroid are moving around the sun several dozen times faster than a speeding bullet they just need to be a few minutes out in their timing and they miss each other the only time the bullet of the asteroid could hit the rapidly moving target of earth was on that date at that time get it wrong even by a few minutes and earth would no longer be there when the asteroid flies past in the end they found that they were out not just by a few minutes but by a couple of weeks so of course it is not going to go anywhere near earth it gets to us far too early to hit us it passes closest to earth s orbit two weeks before earth gets anywhere near where its orbit crosses close to our orbit for more details see what if it was really gong to hit earth if it was really going to hit they would know where it would hit for instance suppose it was going to hit in the atlantic we would then know that all the coastal cities would get a megatsunami so they would have removed all precious things from coastal cities already e g all the new york art galleries would have made arrangements already to move their precious collections to somewhere above the height of the megatsunami they would have probably built temporary cities to house everyone due to the huge numbers of people who would have to evacuate all the coastal cites everyone would be told to leave home on that date and they would be going round door to door telling people they have to move and explaining it to them probably because as with hurricanes there would be people who don t believe it or are brave and stupid and decide not to move they would also have started stock piling food long ago we d all be on rations like the uk in wwii especially for meat in order to build up a stock pile of food to last us because they d expect major crop failures this spring there would be lots of other things going on it would be in the news day in day out and experts working on all the things we have to do none of that happened because it isn t going to hit us they proved it would miss back in 2002 if they had proved it would hit back then they would also have had space missions to try to deflect it and they probably would have succeeded are there any other objects like this could hit us nothing this big can hit us without warning we now have the atlas early warning telescopes and they can spot half of the objects of 50 meters in diameter before they hit usually two weeks in advance by the time it gets to 1 km in size they can spot all of them at least a year in advance this is just for detection using atlas of course other surveys would help with the larger ones atlas is optimized for the smallest ones that can only be spotted within a few weeks of impact they did this test using a simulated set of fictional asteroid impactors it is optimized to find impactors rather than ones that do flybys and for these it is very effective figure 3 of this paper horizontal axis is impactor size in meters the 10 years just means that they ran their simulation for ten years and this was the result they had two modes of operation and i think this must be for the first mode when they had 10 000 impactors chosen to strike the earth randomly in location and time over the next 100 years they add the asteroids that atlas misses slip in from the direction of the sun and south pole or during periods of bad weather an atlas copy in the southern hemisphere or in a different weather pattern would raise the detection fraction for the asteroids that it can find then it usually finds them with lots of warning a week for the 50 meter asteroids and two to three weeks for 140 meter asteroids we see that most 50 m diameter asteroids will be detected between 3 and 9 days before impact and most 140 meter asteroids will be detected 10 40 days before impact so it s more effective than you might think atlas how atlas works and detailed paper here that is enough time to evacuate a city as we know from experience with hurricanes with enough warning then nobody needs to die so nobody needs die of an asteroid of 1 km or larger as we would know about it a year in advance the main risk is from smaller asteroids and we would know about most of those in advance too and as for comets we d know of those long in advance too easier to see than asteroids because of the long tail a one kilometer diameter comet would be seen several years in advance they are very unlikely though because only 1 in 100 of the asteroids that go past earth are comets and those are nearly all the jupiter family comets and other short period comets only about 1 in 100 of those are the long period comets so you can see that they are very rare indeed at present the closest any has come is lexell s comet at six times the distance to the moon in 1770 apart from a tiny non hazardous fragment that got a little closer a few meters across and that was a long period comet that got deflected into a short period comet by jupiter by comparison many asteroids come closer than the moon and sometimes closer even than the orbit for geostationary satellites as for mass extinction level events we know of all the ten kilometer near earth asteroids and comets at least it is a near certainty that we don t even have a single one left to find the largest undiscovered asteroid is probably around 3 5 km in diameter the reason it would be undiscovered is because it has an orbit that is almost exactly one year and it happens to be the other side of the sun from us and so hidden in the daytime sky in the late dawn or early dusk sky as soon as it drifts around into view then multiple sky surveys will find it atlas catalina and pan starrs and any such asteroid then would have to drift all the way around to earth which would take a while since to be undiscovered it has to have been hidden behind the sun for at least a decade since those all sky surveys started it s unlikely that any of the undiscovered objects of one kilometer or larger is any risk at all to earth because very few are anyway and 95 of the objects of 1 km or larger are already discovered of the ones we know of one kilometer or larger large enough to have some global effects there are only three of them that need to be kept an eye on of around 1 2 km but they are exceedingly unlikely to hit earth chances in a billion and not currently at a level considered to be of public interest 29075 1950 da 1 3 km esa estimates it as 2 km analysis based on 523 observations spanning 24010 3 days 1950 feb 22 230140 to 2015 nov 18 504940 i e 65 years and 9 months of observation a reasonably accurate orbit only one possible impact in 2880 0 012 chance of earth impact 1 in 8 300 odds of impact 99 988 chance the asteroid will miss the earth 2010 gd37 1 26 km analysis based on 19 observations spanning 3 3331 days 2010 apr 05 850035 to 2010 apr 09 18316 so once they have more observations they most likely like 2002 nt7 remove it from the table altogether 2010 kv21 1 2 km esa also estimates it as 1 2 km analysis based on 20 observations spanning 4 2997 days 2010 may 17 927225 to 2010 may 22 22691 so another one that will most likely be removed once they have more observations that s out of 894 objects of one kilometer or larger found to date and two of them are just in the table because of short observation arcs of only 3 days or 4 days respectively the only one with a decent chance of impact is for 2880 plenty of time to deflect it in that 0 012 chance that it actually does turn out to be headed for earth once we study it more so chances are there are none of them in the remaining 20 30 objects left to find of above 1 km none of the others are any risk at all for this next century the ones of 10 km or larger large enough for big mass extinctions they are all absolutely fine don t come anywhere near earth for thousands of years except for swift tuttle which has a 1 in a million chance for 4479 that means it is 99 9999 certain to miss in the very remote chance it turns out to be on an impact trajectory it s a job for our great great many times great grandchildren more than two thousand years into the future to deflect it for more about all this seven

air canada will pay 10 per cent more than planned to buy the aeroplan loyalty rewards program and bring it back in house boosting the final purchase price to half a billion dollars under the transaction s final terms announced on thursday the airline has bumped its final price to 497 million when the buyout agreement was reached in august air canada had agreed to pay 450 million the hike stems from recent adjustments to assumptions of future revenues and liabilities that benefit aeroplan s parent company and owner aimia inc despite the jump air canada remains the big winner of the takeover saga helping to explain its aggressive tactics during the battle in late november the airline reached new agreements with aeroplan s credit card partners in just one of these deals toronto dominion bank will pay 1 billion to air canada to be the plan s lead financial partner canadian imperial bank of commerce and american express canada are also chipping in to be secondary partners veritas investment research analyst dan fong noted when the deals were announced air canada s credit card partners are effectively funding the airline s purchase of the loyalty program at the time he calculated a net cash benefit of about 800 million to air canada when all was said and done the card partners see so much value in the program because it has five million members and canadians seek out the credit cards that earn them aeroplan miles when they spend the banks then make money from interest charged on the cardholder balances as well as from interchange or transaction fees merchants pay to the banks every time the cards are used the deal also has strategic advantages for air canada bmo nesbitt burns analyst fadi chamoun recently noted among them less complexity than building a new program and continuity for current members but to realize the benefits air canada had to get aggressive aimia used to be a division of air canada and the airline s chief executive calin rovinescu happened to be one of the masterminds behind aimia s initial public offering in 2005 meaning he targeted the company he took public the takeover saga started in may 2017 when air canada announced that it would end its contract with aeroplan in 2020 and announced plans to build its own in house loyalty program the news sent shares of aeroplan parent aimia plummeting 63 per cent in a single day because air canada was such a crucial partner for the plan for the next 14 months it seemed air canada was serious about building its own program from scratch but last july the airline shocked analysts and investors by launching a hostile bid for the rewards program teaming up with a consortium comprised of td bank cibc and visa canada corp air canada offered to pay 250 million for aeroplan even though mr rovinescu took aeroplan public in 2005 at a 2 billion valuation it has become clear since then that air canada was even more aggressive than was publicly known at the time in a recent regulatory filing aimia disclosed that three months before the public bid air canada teamed up with a private equity firm to acquire all of aimia not just aeroplan in april 2018 with a private equity firm as the lead bidder air canada seemed like more of an arms length partner but aimia s board rejected that offer and instead of giving up mr rovinescu took the lead role in a bid that was solely for aeroplan he also made it public and to sell the bid to aimia shareholders mr rovinescu stressed aimia s 2 billion liability for unredeemed aeroplan miles the suggestion was that the company would be in deep trouble if its members rushed to cash in their miles before the air canada contract expired in 2020 because aimia only had 300 million reserved to cover the liability the scare tactic worked after some tense negotiations the two sides reached a deal in august after air canada boosted its offer price to 450 million in an e mail airline spokesperson peter fitzpatrick disputed the characterization of air canada s actions as aggressive taking issue with the suggestion in financial circles that the airline deliberately sank aimia s stock price to buy the company cheaply in 2017 we made the decision that the commercial agreement with aeroplan no longer worked for us for multiple reasons such as economics data on customers access to our seat inventory etc he wrote but in the end all that will likely matter are the financials and on this front the airline looks good air canada got more than double the amount it paid for aeroplan from its credit card partners the icing on the cake is that the 2 billion in miles liability has likely already substantially shrunk too veritas s mr fong noted thursday that this figure included the profit margin that air canada built in to make money from aimia come 2020 the airline does not need to charge itself the same price which shrinks the dollar value of the liability

changed they re not buying into the story the last to receive the message is the seller the message he says is lower your price to sell the reasons for the change he says are general uncertainty that prices had continued to rise and are in a correction and president trump s new tax law that limits local and state deductions to 10 000 we have another year to go maybe a little bit longer james

one of the nation s leading allergy organizations urged a texas school system to reconsider its decision to stock diphenhydramine benadryl instead of epinephrine for treating children s allergic reactions in a press release issued late wednesday american college of allergy asthma and immunology acaai president todd mahr md said the move by the dallas area weatherford independent school district puts the lives of students in that school district at risk in an interview with medpage today mahr said the decision sets a dangerous precedent my biggest fear is that if they will put this into effect and they will have a child die from food allergies he said mahr said anyone experiencing anaphylaxis should be treated with epinephrine immediately benadryl is not a replacement for epinephrine benadryl is an antihistamine it can mask some symptoms but it will not stop an allergic reaction from progressing epinephrine is the only drug that has been shown to do that he said weatherford officials adopted the so called benadryl protocol in response to recent policy changes from the texas department of state health services which require trained personnel available to administer unassigned epinephrine autoinjectors during school hours the weatherford democrat reported in an article published jan 2 school board president mike guest was quoted as saying that having enough trained people on site to administer autoinjectors at all 11 school system campuses wasn t going to be a workable process according to the article school district trustees voted in november to allow district officials to give over the counter medications to students experiencing suspected allergic reactions mahr told medpage today that the rationale cited by the school board president for not stocking epinephrine autoinjectors makes little sense training school personnel to administer epinephrine is not difficult or time consuming he said these are not technically hard devices to use you don t have to have a nursing degree to do it so i m unclear as to what the problem is my hope is that they are not trying to get around the unassigned epinephrine law to save money forty nine states including texas have laws requiring anaphylaxis emergency preparedness plans that permit schools to stock emergency supplies of epinephrine autoinjectors the texas law passed in 2011 states that each school district open enrollment charger school and private school may adopt and implement a policy regarding the maintenance administration and disposal of epinephrine auto injectors at each campus in the district or school private schools were later included in the law weatherford independent school district officials did not respond to medpage today s request for comment please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus

the potential for washington budget battles weighed heavily on defense companies what happened shares of raytheon rtn fell 12 5 in december according to data provided by s p global market intelligence on mounting evidence that suggests lawmakers in washington will struggle to agree on a fiscal 2020 budget this is a good stock for the long haul but investors should expect further turbulence in the months to come so what raytheon and other defense stocks were among the big winners of the last few years with raytheon shares up nearly 75 from the beginning of 2016 through the first quarter of 2018 that rally was fueled by optimism surrounding single party control in washington and investors were rewarded when lawmakers agreed to a two year budget deal that lifted caps on pentagon spending i warned in october that the u s midterms could cause declines and in december investors saw firsthand how political dynamics can impact stocks like raytheon investors were rattled by the surprise mid month resignation of defense secretary james mattis and a partial government shutdown that began late in the month after the white house and congress were unable to agree on a spending plan raised the level of concern that the two sides will not be able to come together in early 2019 to forge a deal on a fiscal 2020 budget absent a deal caps would return and the pentagon would have to cut its spending by upwards of 100 billion now what shares of raytheon and other defense titans are likely to whipsaw in the months to come as the highly public budget negotiation plays out in washington but for long term investors who can block out the headlines this company is a solid investment raytheon is unique among the defense primes in that it doesn t make the massive warships tanks or planes most closely associated with government contractors but instead specializes in missiles missile defense and the electronics and sensors that make those armaments lethal raytheon also generates about 30 of its revenue internationally tops among defense contractors which provides it a better buffer than most when it comes to weathering political infighting and budget cuts its patriot air defense missile system is deployed with a growing number of u s allies i can t say for sure that raytheon s shares won t fall further in the months to come or predict how quickly they might recover but for long term investors raytheon s diverse portfolio of products and broad customer base make it an attractive addition to the portfolio check out the latest raytheon earnings call transcript
energy just as the federal reserve is thought to use policy to protect equity markets saudi arabia tries to manage crude oil prices by manipulating its production levels writes phil flynn of the price futures group you have heard about the so called fed put that is a term that means the federal reserve has the markets back if the markets or economy start to falter the fed s plunge protection team will get into gear and adjust monetary policy to create a floor for the market that in turn gives investors confidence to take on more risk because even if the market gets weak the fed won t allow it to crash with the recent rebound in crude oil traders are now talking about the saudi put that is that saudi arabia will not allow oil prices to fall and if it does they will cut production accordingly in fact the saudi announcement that they want 80 a barrel for crude and that they will reduce their exports by 800 000 barrels per day is sending a signal to the market that the worst for oil may be over of course saudi arabia s power to manipulate the price of crude oil has diminished some in the age of shale and it helps that the global stock markets are showing more optimism so called progress on the u s china trade discussions is bringing the risk appetite back into the marketplace and cumulative measures talked about in asia to boost their economy is changing the pessimism about overall energy demand a senior chinese official said china plans to introduce policies to boost domestic spending on items such as autos and home appliances this year this comes after china lowered their reserve requirement for bank lending that along with more stimuli should raise oil demand expectations this comes as the american petroleum institute reported that u s crude supplies fell by 6 1 million barrels for the week ending jan 4 according to sources this massive drop in supply is showing that previous cuts by the saudis are already showing up and this could be the beginning of a massive drain on u s oil supplies of course that is looking forward in the short term the big drop in crude was offset by mindboggling builds in products the api reported that gasoline stockpiles surged by an astounding 5 5 million barrels while distillate inventories rocketed by 10 2 million barrels the post market reaction seemed to shrug off the product build and focus more on the crude draw u s shale operators are still in pullback mode and with the opec cuts about to drain our supplies the bottom in oil looks solid of course if we see a reversal or panic in stocks that could change but for now the new oil uptrend will be your friend yet despite the price drop in the big picture energy supply prospects for the future continue to brighten reuters reported that bp struck black gold discovering two new oilfields in the gulf of mexico that could bring an additional billion barrels of oil at an existing field thanks to new seismic technology reuters writes the company has put a heavy emphasis on technology and data processing capabilities in recent years in order to unlock new resources and cut costs the 1 3 billion atlantis phase 3 development will include drilling eight wells and a new subsea production system that will boost bp s production by 38 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day it is scheduled to start production in 2020 together with the new discoveries bp aims to grow its gulf of mexico production from over 300 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at present to 400 000 by the mid 2020s bp said that new seismic technology helped it identify an additional 1 billion barrels of oil at its thunder horse field within weeks whereas previously it would have taken a year to analyze remember peak oil and you can t drill your way to energy independence neither do i hellenic shipping news reports that the middle distillates complex in asia rolled out 2019 on diverging paths while the gasoil market has made a strong comeback since plummeting to its lowest level on dec 21 co distillate jet fuel continued to remain sluggish market sources said that this trend was likely to continue for the rest of the month citing diverging fundamentals between the two products despite the asian gasoil market kicking off the year on a steady footing some traders cautioned that looking forward the middle distillate might be on track for a sustained recovery from here some traders hold a more bullish sentiment for the asian gasoil market in the near term pointing out that volumes flowing out of the region have helped to ease the overhang in supply for january asia exported over 1 million mt of gasoil out of the region a trader said adding that gasoil might see an overall improvement in fundamentals conversely the asian jet fuel kerosene spot market started the year on a weaker footing as a glut of surplus cargoes pressured cash differentials deeper into discount territory while demand has been steady amid the ongoing winter season market participants continued to point to a ready availability of cargoes from south korea and china

fca will pay about 800 million to settle emissions cheating charges but more trouble could lie ahead fiat chrysler automobiles fcau has agreed to pay almost 800 million to settle claims by federal agencies and the state of california that it used software that generated false results on tests of diesel engine emissions fca maintains that it did not deliberately program its vehicles to cheat on emissions tests but the company still faces potential criminal liability for about 100 000 vehicles sold in the u s with what regulators say were defeat devices banned under the clean air act like vw fca was said to be using defeat devices in a case that followed volkswagen s vwagy 1 90 massive global dieselgate scandal the u s environmental protection agency epa and california air resources board carb alleged in january 2017 that the diesel powered version of fca s ram 1500 pickup and jeep cherokee suv had software that acted as a defeat device in violation of the clean air act under the clean air act a defeat device is anything that shuts off a vehicle s emissions controls to allow it to emit illegally high levels of pollutants an automaker that sells vehicles equipped with defeat devices is liable for fines and for the costs of repairing the vehicles to comply with the act if it knowingly installed defeat devices it may also face criminal charges similar to the vw case the epa s key allegation against fca is that its vehicles had software that caused the vehicles emission control systems to perform differently and less effectively during certain normal driving conditions than on federal emission tests resulting in increased emissions of harmful air pollutants at the center of the case diesel powered versions of two big sellers the vehicles at the heart of this case were diesel powered versions of two of fca s bigger sellers in the united states the jeep grand cherokee and the ram 1500 made between 2014 and 2016 the ecodiesel ram as fca called it was for a while the only diesel powered light duty pickup available in the united states and it sold pretty well helping the ram brand to market share gains over ford motor company and general motors in 2014 but in 2016 the german government reportedly found that some of fca s diesel engines appeared to be programmed to shut off their emissions controls after a pre set period of time and testing by west virginia university s center for alternative fuels engines and emissions in 2017 found that diesel powered grand cherokees and rams were emitting nitrogen oxides at three to 20 times the levels permitted by the clean air act nitrogen oxides are the compounds that cause smog what fca agreed to and what it didn t under the settlement fca agreed to pay 311 million in federal civil penalties up to 280 million to resolve claims from diesel owners current and former owners of the affected vehicles will be eligible for a payment averaging 2 800 100 million for extended warranties on the affected vehicles 86 million in state civil penalties in california and several other states 19 million in additional payments to california to offset the impact of excess emissions fca also agreed to recall and repair the roughly 100 000 affected vehicles the repair is a software update it s not expected to be expensive fca took a one time charge of 713 million euros 820 million in the third quarter of 2018 in anticipation of this settlement while fca agreed to settle the case it did not admit wrongdoing it has maintained all along that its software wasn t intended to function as a defeat device in a statement on thursday it said that it maintains its position that the company did not engage in any deliberate scheme to install defeat devices to cheat emissions tests what s next for fca fca is still facing a criminal investigation by the u s justice department as well as an investigation by the securities and exchange commission it s not yet clear whether those will result in further penalties but the good news for shareholders is that fca has cleared one significant and expensive hurdle in its effort to resolve these allegations check out all our earnings call transcripts

a major study at the university of copenhagen study reports that food quality is affected when people s food budgets are constrained as per the definition of insecure or very insecure access to food used in international research people who experience food insecurity also have a lower quality of life and experience poorer psychological well being this is the first extensive representative population survey addressing this topic conducted in denmark the study is based on measurement methods used in the united states where public authorities regularly monitor the prevalence of food insecurity the study estimates that 8 of danish households the equivalent of more than 200 000 households are impacted by food insecurity i e they cannot afford enough food however there is a degree of uncertainty about the exact extent of food insecurity in denmark this is because the study is based on a combination of internet responses and telephone interviews where each survey method yielded different results whereas the incidence of food insecurity was 4 among telephone respondents the figure was 10 among online respondents we believe that the explanation for the differences is that people are more likely to report difficult circumstances when there isn t a live person at the other end of the line as is the case with telephone interviews says associate professor thomas bøker lund of the department of food and resource economics who worked on the study the precise extent of food insecurity in denmark should be explored further but from our study and data from the un food and agriculture organization we can say that at least 4 5 of danish households experience insecure access to food the equivalent of approximately 100 000 households nevertheless this is striking number in a welfare state like denmark says professor lotte holm of the department of food and resource economics who conducted the study with former associate professor annemette ljungdalh nielsen food insecurity is more prominent among low income and single parent families where it affects one in four single parent households and between 31 and 48 of danish households that receive social assistance disability pension or unemployment benefits borrowed food money from family and friends the study reports that people try to adapt their food consumption in a variety of ways among other things they stretch food supplies and stock up on cheap and filling ingredients lower the quality of their food purchases reduce or stop inviting guests and borrow money for food or become addicted to food acquired from family and friends the more financially pressed households become the more radical these adjustments are and the stronger the correlation with unhealthy diet low psychological well being and quality of life the results point to the fact that we cannot assume that everyone in today s denmark has the ability to secure an adequate and nutritious diet we cannot determine whether or not this is a new development we do not know what the situation was like 10 years ago because there are no previous measurements of danes access to food says lotte holm she adds this study demands follow up our data were collected in 2015 since then the social assistance ceiling has been reintroduced and various social services have been scaled back therefore things may have turned for the worse on the other hand more people have become employed in recent years which may have had a positive effect the researchers believe that there is a need to keep track of how many and who will be affected by precarious access to food in denmark and what the impact of this will be on human health and well being

cummings d md said that he had pleaded with his republican colleagues to address this issue and had also urged the president to act i went to the white house early in first year i gave president trump the same bill we re introducing today he said we asked for his endorsement we asked him to do what he had already promised america he would do he initially said he d support the legislation as a matter of fact he told then secretary price to make it happen since then we ve had radio silence there hasn t been any progress since then and it s clear the problem is getting worse l r sen richard blumenthal d conn sen pete welch d vt sen bernie sanders i vt rep elijah cummings d md at podium rep ilhan omar d minn rep joe neguse d colo rep ro khanna d calif photo by joyce frieden congress was not the only branch of government discussing drug prices this week the president and i will not stop until list prices of drugs come down health and human services secretary alex azar said wednesday during an appearance on the fox business channel s varney co show he was responding to a question about several drug companies that announced price increases effective at the beginning of this year this behavior has to stop drug prices must come down and we will roll out more regulatory and legislative proposals and work with democrats and republicans to get prices down it s an absolutely silly system you have that the more you increase the price of your product the more competitive you make it azar continued the companies that have increased their prices on jan 1 all admitted they were doing so basically to funnel kickbacks in the form of rebates to pbms to keep the preferred status of their drugs on the formularies available to patients now we have seen some good behavior amgen merck gilead each have had products they ve significantly reduced the list price we need to see more of this we need other companies to follow and we need bigger products to have those price decreases in may 2018 the trump administration unveiled its blueprint for lowering prescription drug prices including a possible move to require drug companies to include list prices of drugs in their television ads in october the administration issued a proposed rule on the topic other parts of the blueprint such as speeding up approvals of over the counter drugs and preventing brand name companies from taking undue advantage of the patent system have yet to be implemented sen cory booker d n j noted that some of the democrats proposals have already been scored by the congressional budget office and found to save money the bill allowing drug reimportation for example has been scored to save the american taxpayer over 6 billion over 10 years he said we re not only allowing the ongoing pain and hurt to happen to american families but also wasting taxpayer dollars by not using our collective power this has to stop rep ro khanna d calif noted that much of drugmakers profits 139 billion went toward stock buybacks while a smaller amount 80 billion was spent on research and development r d contrary to pharmaceutical companies assertions that they need to charge high prices to make up for all the money spent on research if they were putting all of their money into r d at least they d have an argument he said although the group of democrats sounded optimistic about getting the bills passed they face a large hurdle a republican controlled senate i have confidence that when the overwhelming majority of people are sick and tired of the greed of the pharmaceutical industry when physicians all over the country are outraged that patients can t afford their prescriptions we will have action and our republican colleagues will respond to that outreach sanders said he said he had spoken with at least one republican senator chuck grassley of iowa who was interested in addressing the issue the politics of the country is changing said sen richard blumenthal d conn any who goes home and i go home every weekend cannot appear in a public place without somebody saying what are you going to do about drug costs we re here with serious proposals to deal with an issue that s undeniable in its political force today and the american people are going to hold the administration accountable please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus

investors are growing more fearful that u s companies profits could shrink this year following apple s warning of soft demand in china coupled with mounting evidence of a drag from tariffs a global slowdown and fading tailwinds from tax cuts profit growth estimates for 2019 had already been eroding for months before widely held apple inc darkened the outlook further last week with the first cut to its sales forecast in more than 15 years earnings this year were never going to rise as quickly as in 2018 when federal tax cuts fueled growth rates above 20 percent for s p 500 companies for much of the year according to refinitiv s ibes for 2019 analysts now see profits growing by 6 8 percent down sharply from an oct 1 estimate of 10 2 percent earnings growth moreover in the first half of 2019 profits are seen rising substantially more slowly than that pace thanks largely to the rapid decline in forecasts for technology sector earnings which should account for roughly a fifth of the index s profits that has some investors watching for signs that u s stocks could slip into a profits recession defined as at least two straight quarters of year over year earnings declines the last of those occurred from july 2015 through june of 2016 which dovetailed with a broad run of stock market underperformance you bet it s on the radar said hugh johnson chief investment officer of hugh johnson advisors llc in albany new york the apple comments and where they re headed that s going to cause estimates to come down even further apple warning goes to the heart increased concern over the potential for an earnings recession comes at a turbulent time for stocks with the s p 500 registering its worst december performance since the great depression only to rally more than 9 percent since hitting a 20 month low on christmas eve with the s p 500 recently trading at 14 times expected earnings down from a multiple of 18 a year ago a key argument for market bulls is that stocks have become undervalued after the recent sell off apple s news also highlights the potential impact of trade tensions between the two largest economies the united states and china the warning from apple started to provide kind of a confirmation for the earnings recession folks out there said chuck carlson chief executive officer at horizon investment services in hammond indiana its impact goes beyond just its suppliers it goes to the heart of investment psyche for a lot of folks he said profit forecasts for technology companies have fallen more than for any sector other than energy which has been buffeted by the collapse in oil prices s p 500 tech earnings are expected to decline year over year for the first three quarters of 2019 based on refinitiv s data and deliver growth of just 2 6 percent this year the lowest of any sector that is a big reversal from its long standing role as a profit growth leader tech in the top three sectors ranked by profit growth in seven of the last eight quarters is estimated to have delivered earnings per share growth of 23 2 percent in 2018 to be sure there are plenty of strategists who still say an earnings recession this year is unlikely thanks to a relatively still solid u s economy friday s jobs report helped support that view earnings recessions are exceptionally rare outside of an economic recession said hans olsen chief investment officer of fiduciary trust company in boston i don t think we are going to have another earnings recession but it might feel like a recession profit recession vs economic recession since 1968 as far back as refinitiv s data goes the s p 500 has had 10 earnings recessions the longest spanning from the third quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2009 that roughly coincided with a financial crisis and the worst economic recession since the great depression while the last s p 500 earnings recession occurred without an economic recession that was an exception seven of the 10 profit recessions since 1968 have coincided with a formal economic recession financials health care and other sectors could pick up some of the slack as tech earnings falter some strategists say this year s estimates for those sectors have held up better than others refinitiv s numbers show adding to u s companies potential woes a strengthening dollar could become an even bigger negative for many u s multinationals this year strategists said the dollar index which tracks the greenback against six major currencies rose 1 percent during the fourth quarter and was up 4 4 percent year over year by the end of the quarter people are just starting to talk about dollar strength fiduciary trust s olsen said weaker oil prices will drag as well he said in a reversal of what occurred in 2018 top strategists at some big banks had been getting more pessimistic on earnings heading into the new year morgan stanley in its outlook late last year said there was more than a 50 percent chance of a modest earnings recession in 2019 goldman sachs strategists nodded to the weakening trend in a recent note we expect a sharp slowdown in profit growth in all regions this year particularly in the u s coupled with significant downgrades to consensus expectations
