visitors pass a sign for chinese ride hailing service didi at the global mobile internet conference in beijing in 2017 didi global inc holds vast amounts of sensitive data from half a billion annual active users mostly in china to the world s investors the saga over didi global inc has made china s biggest tech companies a riskier bet as president xi jinping seeks to control one of the country s most valuable resources big data didi is by most measures an appealing success story the company controls almost the entire ride hailing market in china and counts softbank group corp and tencent holdings ltd as major shareholders didi was actually profitable in the first quarter a rarity for the industry its initial public offering of stock last week was the second biggest in the u s by a company based in china and it was well received didi sold 317 million shares about 10 more than originally planned advertisement and yet the listing on the eve of the communist party s centenary didn t appear to trigger celebration back in beijing instead two days after the ipo china s cyberspace regulator said it was reviewing the company on national security grounds two days after that the regulator said didi had committed serious violations in the collection and usage of personal information it then ordered the company s app to be removed from stores what made didi so valuable to investors is the same thing that makes it and other tech companies a potential threat to beijing it holds vast amounts of sensitive data from half a billion annual active users mostly in china over the last year xi s government has sought to gain control of this data both to protect users from abuse and find a way to use it to spur broad based economic growth rather than simply enrich a cohort of billionaires that could potentially challenge the communist party s authority didi like many other chinese tech giants grew rapidly in the absence of comprehensive oversight beijing is now seeking to plug regulatory loopholes but it needs more time by listing in the u s didi effectively sidestepped an extensive approval process by china s securities watchdog at a time when officials have pushed for more companies to raise funds at home advertisement beijing is not pleased to see its national champions cozying up to foreign stakeholders said xiaomeng lu a senior analyst at eurasia group a political risk consulting firm it also wants tech companies to keep their core assets data and algorithms in china some projections show china will hold a third of the world s data by 2025 giving it potentially a massive competitive advantage in areas such as artificial intelligence that will drive the modern economy and the geopolitical stakes are also high the biden administration is reviewing what user data should be off limits to china and beijing is similarly concerned about handing over information that could be used by its adversaries china s campaign to impose tougher controls on the nation s tech companies accelerated late last year as the country recovered from the effect of the covid 19 pandemic and tensions with the u s intensified officials launched a powerful broadside on the fintech sector when they pulled ant group co s 35 billion dual listing in shanghai and hong kong at the 11th hour advertisement like didi ant dominated its field in just a decade the company an affiliate of jack ma s alibaba group had grown to reshape the lives of millions of chinese through its alipay app as well as the giant yu ebao money market fund by march it was clear authorities were widening the offensive president xi at a meeting of the communist party s top financial advisory committee warned that beijing would go after so called platform companies that have amassed data and market power this term essentially covers a variety of companies that offer services to hundreds of millions including didi food delivery giant meituan and e commerce leaders such as jd com inc the crackdown has weighed heavily on the tech sector alibaba s hong kong traded shares have lost 33 since their october high while tencent which is china s leader in social media games and music publishing is down 28 since a record in january didi fell as much as 11 on friday advertisement china isn t alone in trying to control the dominance of large technology companies the u s congress is seeking to force companies such as amazon com inc and apple inc to radically change their business models while google faces a sweeping european union investigation into its advertising technology we have entered a new period globally where the regulatory scrutiny on tech has increased and will be ongoing for some time said joshua crabb a senior portfolio manager at robeco in hong kong but the scale and speed of xi s campaign speaks to the communist party s obsession with control the party is battling what it sees to be multiple threats to national security and its five year plan in october included a focus on security issues for the first time a rivalry with the u s is only intensifying under the biden administration which recently rallied allies to present a more united front against beijing advertisement the issue is chinese entrepreneurs often turn to u s stock exchanges which offer founders something they can t get at home a deep pool of international capital and lower barriers to entry mean the world s largest market remains a key destination for chinese and hong kong companies which were fundraising at a record pace earlier in the year potential forced delistings by the new york stock exchange and tougher requirements on nasdaq have been no deterrent to chinese companies in need of cash though the communist party has little say over the u s listing process for its private companies it can often nudge top level management but exerting influence over a business operations such as it did with didi is a far bolder move and puts the government s stamp on the u s stock market china s cyberspace regulator is trying to step in to exert their influence in this whole process said chucheng feng co founder and partner of plenum a research firm specializing in china s politics and economy they re trying to use didi to set up this example of how a company will become listed in new york moving forward advertisement with assistance from ishika mookerjee

a press release or ii sends a written notice to the holders of the warrants advising of the commencement of the exercise period the warrants held by the insiders are considered to be related parties

this column reports on recent work presented at the first edition of the cepr conference series on the political economy of finance which focused on the politics of regulation and central banking the conference held on 12 february 2021 and co sponsored by three dutch universities erasmus university rotterdam tilburg university university of amsterdam kickstarted the poleconfin initiative www poleconfin org the poleconfin initiative comprises a conference series and an online platform which allows researchers to share their work with a community interested in research on the political economy of finance exploring political economy topics in finance research is still relatively new the political economy of finance looks at how the design of political institutions and the distribution of political power in society affect the development and functioning of financial systems and vice versa see pagano and volpin 2001 perotti 2014 lambert and volpin 2018 for surveys early research focused on topics such as political connections in firms fismann 2001 khwaja and mian 2005 faccio 2006 or politically motivated changes in financial regulation and development kroszner and strahan 1999 biais and perotti 2002 bolton and rosenthal 2002 pagano and volpin 2005 perotti and von thadden 2006 while these contributions appeared mostly in economic journals finance journals also started opening up to this research area in recent years figure 1 shows the number of articles published in the top three finance journals journal of finance journal of financial economics review of financial studies that study questions related to the political economy of finance only a handful of articles were published in the mid 2000s but interest rose following the financial crisis the overwhelming majority of these publications is empirical work taking stock of research in this area reveals increasing awareness of the importance of political economy issues in finance but also reflects that the area is far from saturated figure 1 articles on political economy of finance published in top three finance journals notes we include in this set any articles published in top three finance journals dealing with political institutions electoral politics and special interest politics we do not include articles on policy uncertainty and asset pricing unless the article connects with political institutions and power the six journal of financial economics articles of the pre 2002 period were published in 1990 1994 1996 1998 and 1999 x2 the goal of poleconfin is to connect researchers in this growing area and promote their work and the first edition of the conference series was a successful start of this initiative electoral politics credit and regulation the electoral consequences of financial crises are well documented yet the specific mechanisms through which financial crises affect elections remain elusive sartre et al 2020 and müller 2020 focus on some mechanisms sartre et al 2020 help understand how public finance mismanagement fuels the rise of populism during financial crises between 1996 and 2011 more than 1 500 french municipalities contracted high risk structured loans with the bank dexia in september 2011 the newspaper libération leaked a confidential file from dexia detailing all toxic loans it granted to municipalities for the municipal elections following the leak sartre et al 2020 find that affected municipalities saw a rise in populist voting and an increased entry of both far right and far left populist politicians far right benefited more in areas with more fragile economic conditions and higher growth of the immigrant population müller 2020 investigates how the design of policies contributes to politicians re election prospects he shows that macroprudential policies supposed to curtail the risks of future financial crises were systematically loosened in the run up to 221 general elections across 58 countries politicians seem to do so because they do not want to cut off voters from access to credit institutions reforms and politics policy reforms result from the complex interaction between various interest groups in his keynote lecture available here francesco trebbi berkeley haas depicts the opaque and convoluted channels through which interest groups invest in influence and ultimately affect economic and policy outcomes in particular he highlights the important albeit under studied role of localised charitable giving as a means of contributing to politicians bertrand et al 2020a donations to non profits in exchange for regulatory advocacy bertrand et al 2018a 2018b and firm acquisition as a tool to amplify political contributions of investors bertrand et al 2020b the success or failure of interest groups in shaping policy reforms also depends on various features of political institutions foarta and morelli 2020 study the problem of a regulator who receives imprecise information about the regulatory problem at hand they find that overly complex reforms are implemented when regulators perceive the problem as complicated and are highly uncertain about the incentives of interest groups initiating reform proposals however the complexity of today s reforms increases the difficulty of understanding future problems in this context foarta and morelli 2020 also show that variation in the starting institutional conditions may lead to drastically different regulatory paths complexity traps cycles of complexification simplification or regulatory gridlock perotti and soons 2019 study the political economy of the euro monetary area seen as an arrangement among institutionally diverse economies in their setup politicians in institutionally weak countries need to spend more to remain in power so in some states they may have to devalue the currency to avoid a default they find that a diverse monetary union implies an implicit fiscal transfer to strong countries due to devaluation while fiscal capacity in weaker countries is reduced just as borrowing constraints are relaxed a credible monetary union may require fiscal transfers from strong countries during crises yet it can be mutually beneficial fiscal transfers thus represent a structural feature rather than a design flaw in a diverse monetary union see perotti and soons 2020 for a non technical summary governance and central banking after the financial crisis central banks around the world saw their responsibilities further extended to financial stability domains masciandaro and romelli 2015 distributional choices are thus increasingly left in the hands of unelected central bankers tucker 2019 goncharov et al 2020 and fabo et al 2021 uncover new stylised facts about central banks which further challenge their political independence and accountability goncharov et al 2020 document the presence of a discontinuity in the distribution of central bank profits based on a sample consisting of 155 central banks over 23 years they observe that central banks are more likely to report small profits than losses measures of political and market pressures as well as central bankers career concerns significantly predict small profits versus losses small positive profits are also associated with more lenient monetary policy and higher inflation together these results suggest that central banks are concerned about the sign of their profits probably for political reasons fabo et al 2021 compare research on the macroeconomic effects of quantitative easing produced by central bank economists and academic economists see kempf and pastor 2020 for a summary central bank studies report quantitative easing effects on output and inflation that are stronger and use more positive language in their studies compared to those written by academics moreover central bankers whose studies report more significant effects of quantitative easing have better career outcomes fabo et al 2021 also conduct a survey showing substantial involvement of bank management in research production and public distribution however the extent to which this involvement affects research outcomes remains a question open for future research poleconfin a platform for researchers the 2021 edition of the cepr conference series on the political economy of finance only featured a few key advances but shows how fruitful and innovative the area is it also stressed the importance of putting the political economy at the centre of finance research as pointed out by francesco trebbi in his keynote lecture the political economy of finance is about the reinforcing feedback loop between financial power political power and government policy the by products of the loop are top income inequality stifled innovation and competition sluggish productivity growth and political pushback however researchers active in the political economy of finance tend to be dispersed in discrete disciplinary areas such as macroeconomics public economics economic history law or financial economics only a few other conferences are currently dedicated to research in this area such as the london political finance workshop beck et al 2020 the poleconfin platform seeks to provide a year round meeting point for theorists and empiricists with shared interests in this topical area and build a research

morrisons was at the heart of a bidding war last night as three us private equity firms jostled to buy the british supermarket investment giant apollo became the third buyout predator circling the chain yesterday after revealing it was considering a possible offer it came just 48 hours after fortress made a 6 3billion takeover bid beating the 5 5billion offered by rival clayton dubilier rice cd r apollo s intervention prompted morrisons shares to surge above the price fortress was offering yesterday a sign that investors believe a bidding war will result in an even bigger sale price morrisons was at the heart of a bidding war as three us private equity firms jostled to buy the british supermarket with investment giant apollo becoming the third buyout predator the race to buy morrisons began last month when it emerged that the firm had rejected cd r s bid which it said was too low the supermarket s board members led by chairman andy higginson now back the fortress bid they said the price was fair and claimed the private equity firm and the consortium backing it would be good stewards of the popular brand executives stand to make millions from the deal including chief executive dave potts who could receive 19million but opposition was growing last night as a top shareholder warned that the supermarket should not be sold for the wrong reasons legal general one of britain s biggest investment groups said profits should come from making morrisons a better business not buying its property portfolio too cheaply levering the company up with debt and potentially reducing tax paid to the exchequer the race to buy morrisons began last month when it emerged that the firm had rejected cd r s bid which it said was too low fortress have now made a 6 3billion takeover bid russ mould investment director at the online stockbroker aj bell said private equity firms have been sitting on oodles of cash for a long time and they look intent on going on a spending spree we ve now got three parties interested and fear of missing out could attract further interest the frenzy over morrisons has stoked concerns that the supermarket s customers staff and suppliers could lose out with buyout firms infamous for using ruthless tactics to extract returns from their purchases now china buys up our microchip maker by jim norton technology correspondent for the daily mail britain s biggest microchip factory is to be sold to a chinese owned technology firm despite fears over national security nexperia said it had agreed to buy newport wafer fab in a deal reportedly worth around 63million the facility in south wales manufactures crucial power components for cars the parts have been in limited supply amid a global shortage of microchips ministers have been urged to intervene because netherlands based nexperia is owned by chinese electronics company wingtech whose shareholders include state funded investors the government has new powers to review such sales on national security grounds but said it would not do so despite growing concern over china s intentions tom tugendhat tory chairman of the commons foreign affairs committee urged ministers to review the deal under the national security and investment act he warned that the uk was turning a blind eye to britain s largest semiconductor foundry falling into the hands of an entity from a country that has a track record of using technology to create geopolitical leverage advertisement in the past private equity firms have stripped off and sold assets slashed retirement payouts and laid off staff to wring out efficiencies from firms they take over the daily mail is calling for more transparency in the sector and an end to sharp practices the emergence of apollo a firm once dubbed wall street s apex predator as a potential buyer is likely to heighten concerns its founders have made billions of pounds by snapping up firms at bargain prices and imposing brutal cost cutting measures before paying themselves handsome dividends and management fees until recently apollo was led by co founder leon black a billionaire described by bloomberg as the most feared man in the most aggressive realm of finance the 69 year old hosts extravagant birthday parties attended by celebrities and politicians with sir elton john said to have performed at his 60th he stepped aside as chief executive of apollo in march after details of his business relationship with paedophile financier jeffrey epstein were made public and a rape allegation which he denies was made against him marc rowan one of mr black s lieutenants and a co founder has taken over as chief executive while jay clayton the former chairman of the us stock market regulator is the investment firm s chairman apollo was previously in pole position to buy asda before its rival tdr capital and the issa brothers successfully bid 6 8billion analysts say it may be keen to get a slice of the grocery market after missing out on asda but to do so it will have to outbid fortress an investment firm owned by the japanese giant softbank richard hunter of the online service interactive investor said it was perfectly feasible that competition could emerge from the likes of amazon which has an online partnership with morrisons and bought hollywood studio metro goldwyn mayer for 6billion he said supermarkets were cash generating machines whose relatively low share prices were attractive to private equity firms morrisons ownership of many of its stores as opposed to renting property is also a sweetener offering the prospect of selling the sites and leasing them back darren jones chairman of the commons business committee has called on the competition and markets authority to clarify the powers it has to intervene in take overs following the asda deal he said there is concern that regulatory bodies have insufficient oversight or powers to intervene when new owners act irresponsibly ruth sunderland do they really want to sell morrisons to a firm whose ex boss paid paedophile jeffrey epstein 114m by ruth sunderland for the daily mail bidding wars are usually greeted with great excitement in the city but the battle that has broken out for control of supermarket group morrisons should make our hearts sink no fewer than three rival us private equity groups are vying for control of the grocery chain and still more contenders might well muscle in the morrisons board gives every appearance of being giddy with the thrill of the auction room and the prospect of higher bids before the hammer falls morrisons bidder apollo s co founder leon black stepped down as chairman after revelations he paid the paedophile jeffrey epstein both pictured 114million for personal tax advice in reality all the offers lodged so far are low ball attempts to grab one of our big four supermarkets on the cheap and ought to be rejected on that basis alone that though is not the real point morrisons should not be sold to any member of this circling private equity wolf pack at any price the latest potential bidder apollo looks particularly unsavoury its co founder leon black 69 stepped down as chairman and chief executive in march following revelations that he paid the paedophile jeffrey epstein 114million for personal tax advice black who received more than 134million in pay and dividends last year was served with a lawsuit last month claiming he raped and sexually harassed a young russian model he insists the accusations are lies and says the pair had a wholly consensual relationship for six years be that as it may the late sir ken morrison who built the wholesome supermarket we know and love would be choking on his cornflakes if he were still alive he would also be snorting in disbelief at the glib promises to preserve his legacy made by rival investment group fortress whose bid shamefully has already been accepted by the morrisons board the supermarket is unique in the way it stocks its shelves and fridges with produce from its own farms manufacturing facilities and fishing fleets prudently the firm owns many of its own stores rather than renting them investment giant apollo pictured headquarters became the third buyout predator circling the chain yesterday after revealing it was considering a possible offer this in the eyes of private equity makes morrisons ripe for plunder the notion that private equity would have the remotest interest in sustaining sir ken s business model or his solid yorkshire values is laughable if they take control his legacy is likely to be dismantled wholesale in an orgy of asset stripping and debt one wonders if we will ever learn given there is a long list of such promises made and then casually dishonoured by foreign buyers of uk firms alarmingly these include so called commitments made by the owner of fortress a japanese outfit called softbank it took over the cambridge tech firm arm holdings five years ago and is now trying to flog it off to a us rival despite painting itself as a long term investor in the uk promises such as these are no such thing just so much cynical hot air morrisons directors have a duty to follow the best course of action for shareholders the business the staff the customers and the taxpayer given these bosses are in line for multi million pound jackpots in a takeover though it must be hard to set aside self interest chief executive dave potts has put himself in line for a payout of 19million if the bid from fortress succeeds and possibly more if competitors up the ante tempting as it must be to take the money and run it is also short sighted with its huge growth potential morrisons has no need to put itself at the mercy of private equity black was served with a lawsuit last month claiming he raped and sexually harassed a young russian model he insists the accusations are lies and says they had a consensual relationship it could even be more rewarding for bosses to stick around and create long term genuine growth such a strategy certainly worked well for frenchman pascal soriot the chief executive of astrazeneca when us giant pfizer came banging on his door with a 69billion bid in 2014 he mounted a robust defence which has paid off brilliantly as an independent british firm astrazeneca has grown in value by tens of billions of pounds and has produced a life saving covid 19 vaccine it is barely conceivable that the company would have achieved any such thing if it had allowed itself to be swallowed up by an american aggressor and was then starved of investment and shorn of its research facilities as for soriot he chose to forgo the quick bucks in 2014 but over his tenure he has earned a total of nearly 87million not bad the contrast with morrisons is telling chairman andrew higginson and his spineless board who have already rolled over like whimpering poodles should be ashamed of themselves they need to show some backbone mount a proper defence of morrisons as an independent british company and show this disreputable bunch of bidders the door

driven by the success of america s vaccine rollout and massive government stimulus the us economy is expected to grow as fast as 7 this year and is currently leading the world recovery the commentariat was talking up an american renaissance as the nation celebrated the 245th anniversary of its independence on sunday but there is a problem america just went through an economic renaissance it s not likely to be reborn again a decade ago in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis standard and poor s downgraded us government debt for the first time ever triggering dire forecasts of american decline instead the 2010s saw an expansion of american economic power driven by its tech prowess and its relatively quick resolution of the debt crisis the us share of global gdp rose from a 2011 low of 21 to 25 last year average incomes started the decade 26 higher in the us than in europe and finished more than 60 higher the us income lead over japan grew even more dramatically by early 2020 despite talk of despair in the jobless middle classes us consumer and small business confidence hit highs unsurpassed since the 1960s unemployment fell to 50 year lows as a financial superpower the us reached even greater heights its stock market rose 250 far outpacing all rivals over the course of the decade and its share of global stock markets increased from 42 to 58 the us dollar emerged more dominant than ever helping the us extend its lead over other developed nations by late 2019 75 of all overseas loans to individuals and corporations were denominated in dollars up from 60 before the crisis of 2008 six of every 10 countries used the dollar as their anchor the currency against which they measure and stabilise the value of their own currency near a record high china s efforts to challenge the dollar as the world s favourite reserve currency also failed utterly during the 2010s after a comeback decade america is unlikely to rise anew in the 2020s as i argued at the start of the pandemic booms that are potent are almost always followed by a long hangover the us economy led the world in the 1960s but in the 1970s it worried about falling behind the oil fuelled soviet union in the 1980s it fretted over an ascendant japan the us came roaring back during the tech boom of the 1990s but the 2000s were all about the rise of emerging markets led by china forecasts for another us surge rest in part on faith that it can keep extending its lead in technology but the us internet giants already face challengers in emerging markets from asia to africa where local entrepreneurs are building national and regional market leaders in e commerce e banking and search europe is closing the innovation gap in fields such as robotics and ai and european startups are attracting more private equity money than ever before the european share of global venture capital has also been mounting steadily and its tech sector is worth four times what it was just five years ago booms are often killed by complacency which grips the us now major voices in both parties have argued that america should continue to borrow and spend freely thanks to the unrivalled status of the dollar as the world s most wanted currency pushed upward by stimulus to fight the pandemic lockdowns us government debt spiked last year from 109 to 131 of gdp well above the developed world average easy money flowing out of the fed is threatening to weaken the dollar and feeding the rise of the zombies companies which earn too little to make even interest payments on their debt they barely existed in the us 20 years ago but accounted for 6 of listed companies by 2010 and almost 20 by last year the federal government and corporations are now so deep in debt it is hard to imagine how they can further boost the economy in 2010 the us owed the rest of the world 2 5 trillion a sum equal to 17 of us gdp by early last year those liabilities had risen to 10 trillion and more than 50 of gdp a threshold that has often triggered currency crises in the past currently they are 14 trillion and 67 of gdp optimists believe american consumers will spend freely as the pandemic passes driving a new boom but so far they have used a large part of their stimulus checks to pay down debt or speculate in the markets none of this means that american declinists so wrong in the 2010s will finally be proved right china s rising share in the global economy has come largely at the expense of europe and japan declinists still convinced the us will soon be overtaken by china overlook the fact that china has huge debt problems too what is more likely is that the us will have a mediocre decade weighed down by the excesses of its recent boom relative to other markets us stocks are at a 100 year peak valuations that high reflect the new optimism after a decade of unanticipated us success many analysts now expect more of the same alas this may be as good as it gets for america

given the opportunity taiwan has the power to help the united states together we shall overcome this pandemic by supporting a new global effort to manufacture and distribute vaccines amidst a global pandemic the parallel universe in which taiwan enjoyed a reprieve underwent a reality check in may 2021 when the spread of the coronavirus spiraled out of control for the first time at the local level as a reaction to the bad news taiwan s major stock index experienced two of the largest plunges in history later that same month trading at record volumes similarly according to bloomberg s covid resilience ranking taiwan plunges into the bottom half of the ranking to the forty fourth accentuated by a lagging vaccination drive and a resurgent outbreak since then the coronavirus induced death rate in taiwan has surged past 4 percent well above the global rate at approximately 2 2 percent as a former role model in coronavirus prevention taiwan s fall off the pedestal was largely due to the current administration s complacency and myopia which it contracted during taiwan s coronavirus free experience for most of the duration since the global outbreak the evidence had been clear from the beginning that the cornerstone to returning to normalcy is a vaccinated population yet not only was the government behind in procuring vaccines for 23 5 million citizens the central epidemic command center cecc taiwan s center for disease control even rejected an offer by astrazeneca to manufacture vaccines in taiwan in comparison to another fellow asian country singapore has so far vaccinated 41 1 percent of its population to taiwan s single digital to date more notably south korea announced a vaccine partnership with the united states in may and has since emerged as a global vaccine production base with its fourth coronavirus vaccine contract manufacturing deal struck as of late june the united states also has a similar vaccine arrangement for the quadrilateral security dialogue partnership between the united states india japan and australia under this dialogue the quad will finance manufacture and distribute at least 1 billion doses of safe and effective coronavirus vaccines by the end of 2022 india the world s vaccine leader produces 60 percent of the world s overall vaccine needs the united states and japan finance the initiative india makes the vaccines and australia helps with the logistics and delivery all is not lost for taiwan a statement released by the white house on june 3 unveiled washington s strategy for global vaccine sharing this was followed by a concrete reiteration by jonathan fritz in mid june where the deputy assistant secretary of state for east asian pacific affairs commented on plans for the united states to partner with taiwan to manufacture and distribute vaccines this u s gesture of goodwill already delivered 2 5 million doses of the moderna vaccine to taiwan in june but should also encourage taiwan to proactively seek a vaccine manufacturing agreement following south korea s precedent with the biden administration perhaps alongside the island s semiconductor partnership on may 21 2021 south korean president moon jae in and u s president joe biden announced a u s south korea vaccine partnership to expand vaccine manufacturing and scale up global vaccine supplies taiwan needs to seize this opportunity to end the vaccine drought for its population and at the same time reinforce its indo pacific strategic alliance with the goal of building resilience president biden said that it is an ambitious new joint partnership that is going to boost vaccine manufacturing for global benefits and strengthen vaccinations to benefit the entire indo pacific taiwan and the united states partners can join together to launch an ambitious new partnership to boost vaccine manufacturing for the world s benefit and to strengthen vaccinations to benefit the entire indo pacific taiwan has much to offer these like minded countries in achieving progress on health security while also standing to gain from this partnership primarily by assuring taiwanese that the island will not be short of vaccines in the years to come this is an opportunity for a global response to expand safe affordable and effective vaccine production and equitable access to speed economic recovery and benefit global health as the former commander of the central epidemic command center during taiwan s response to h1n1 influenza during 2009 i know taiwan offers a pharmaceutical capacity for vaccine rollout that could serve as a model for other places taiwan is a country with a universal health care system that ensures a digitized distribution network and stores patient data in a centralized manner domestically such production facilities can also create jobs in management quality control and production that can benefit taiwan s economy amidst the coronavirus pandemic the world meets a single disease and finds a single fate we are at a turning point in the search for good health and vaccination so it was during the spanish flu so it was during h1n1 while people are now divided into the vaccinated and the not we still stand united together because there is no taiwanese problem there is no american problem there is only a world s problem facing the pandemic taiwan is eager to be a solution to that problem given the opportunity taiwan has the power to help the united states together we shall overcome this pandemic by supporting a new global effort to manufacture and distribute vaccines eric chu is a former

from dayton to daytona the arca racing series has continually evolved to fit within a racing ecosystem always much larger than itself over the past seven decades but reaching 1 500 races is effectively an inflection point this is not the arca that series president ron drager inherited in 1996 but that sanctioning body wouldn t have been recognizable to his grandparents arca founders john and mildred marcum either arca has always existed as a driver development platform while also serving as a de facto track day club and that spirit remains true today three years after its official acquisition by nascar despite the merger and arca s integration into the former k n pro series east and west divisions the sanctioning body is still operated by drager out of an unassuming office located in toledo ohio just as it has been for most of its existence jared c tilton getty images drager now has a larger role in nascar s overall decision making process a seat at the figurative table as it were and conviction that his family legacy will continue in some fashion over the decades to come we have been encouraged to continue operating in the ways we always have drager said in fact we were encouraged to employ our business practices with east and west and operate those as closely as we could but the biggest difference is that we re no longer hesitant to ask nascar for help it felt like we were stealing a base when we asked for help arca is now part of a much bigger motorsports world drager compared arca to a little rowboat in the middle of the ocean susceptible to getting rocked by the waves of changing tides and the 2018 sale was about getting on a much bigger boat to withstand that tide the timing proved fortuitous too as drager isn t sure what would have become of arca during the pandemic year without nascar s infrastructure around it i m not saying we wouldn t have survived but i am saying for certain that we would have lost a great deal drager added the arca racing series rule book has always been an interesting read because it exists purely on the existence of trickle down cup series and xfinity series technology it s where journeyman racers and development prospects could get their hands on affordable hand me down cars and race at some of the most iconic venues in the country icon sportswire getty images walking around the arca series garage on any given race weekend will reveal old cup series and busch series cars custom chassis built for arca and k n over the years and various technologies developed for cup with the imminent arrival of nascar s next gen car in 2022 and its radical shift from everything that came before it arca will soon have a considerable amount of trickle down equipment to implement should it so choose there are no shortage of options on the table for arca and nascar there are some high quality safe chassis that are really the framework for what s currently on the racetrack now in cup so how can our arca platform best take advantage of that drager asked rhetorically we know there are a fair amount of those chassis that will go directly into the xfinity series but we also know there are a lot that won t so we ve been working strategically with nascar to try to make sure that we don t miss an opportunity to acquire reasonably economically viable race cars for our teams when i say that i m saying for the same price or less that you can buy a late model roller chassis therefore making the entry point a little more manageable for teams and maybe change parts of our business model where you might need to pay a david gilliland joe gibbs or billy venturini to race to one where teams can buy their own stuff and race as often as they want icon sportswire getty images the cost isn t the car on paper what drager is suggesting seems reasonable and thematically similar to the arca entry list booms of the late 2000s when the introduction of the car of tomorrow led to an infusion of trickle down gen 4 cup series chassis the rules were so similar back then that bill davis racing famously entered scott wimmer into an arca race at atlanta motor speedway that got rained out so they entered the cup race with that same car instead leading nine laps and finishing 22nd with it but veteran racer and tenured megateam owner billy venturini is hesitant to endorse this long term strategy in fact he believes a further integration of the outgoing cup series chassis doesn t address the problems because the current car isn t the primary barrier to entry there are no shortage of competitive cars available in shops across the country or available from venturini himself i ll say this right now car counts are not down because of the vehicles venturini said they keep saying that we have to find ways to make it cheaper to get people in the cars but the cars are not the cost the operating expenses are the cost so the problem is that the decision makers have come in and they look at expenses line by line and circle ones they say are too big and address them that s why arca eliminated live pit stops and replaced them with several field freezing breaks instead but venturini says the operating costs really haven t changed that much by time you get to the bottom line and that s all i care about as a team owner we didn t change the bottom line too much venturini said we just changed how we spent our money and lessened our product in the process all these changes were made in the hopes of keeping teams around that ended up leaving the series anyway chad bryant racing closed when its eponymous team owner joined gms racing ken schrader racing and mdm motorsports both closed after the merger mason mitchell motorsports won a championship and closed down too icon sportswire getty images tommy praytor operated an arca team for a decade alongside son thomas with a stated goal of being the best of the rest arca has traditionally featured three categories the championship caliber cars the mid pack family teams and the start and park drivers the praytors always strived to lead that middle tier now 31 the younger praytor only races once a year nearest to home at talladega nascar s version of the arca racing series hasn t been accommodating to praytor and his contemporaries and that s why most of them are gone it began with the introduction of the ilmor 396 engine and arca s efforts to get every team on that platform and thus off the legacy built engines that had been hallmark of the series for years to do so arca ordered the legacy engines severely detuned rendering them so ineffective that it would further encourage teams to make the transition it started from 9 000 rpms to 8 000 and then to 7 000 ilmor during a race at madison international speedway in wisconsin in 2015 a group of these family teams still on the legacy engine program met with drager to encourage the sanctioning body to restore their engine power output to more competitive levels that group included praytor wayne hixson darrell basham wayne peterson and james hylton and they were unable to convince arca to give them back a little more power because the sanctioning body needed to ensure ilmor was the clear cut engine of choice of course since the k n pro series merger arca has actually given the legacy engines more power but it was too little too late they called us to tell us they gave us our stuff back but we already sold it praytor said the worst thing you can do is to give a racer a reason to go do something else because he won t ever come back it s an old adage in racing that a racer is a racer until they buy their first boat that s absolutely right praytor says the cost to purchase an ilmor is now over 40 000 and 20 000 to get it rebuilt and they can only be built and sealed by the company itself willie mullins racing has three ilmor engines currently and they told autoweek that two need rebuilding at costs of 25 000 and 30 000 each they both said they could go truck series racing for that kind of money and get more return on investment too nascar underestimated the family teams ability to get their legacy engines purchased and rebuilt for far cheaper than what ilmor offered a legacy engine could be purchased for around 12 000 and rebuilt for 7 000 or less basham rebuilt engines himself while praytor had a local business near his home in mobile alabama service their engines after consulting with the series and oem for how to go about it the family mid pack teams often cut sponsorship or under the table deals to get engines rebuilt for even cheaper whatever it took to get to the race track dinah marie photography although we are pro ilmor and composite body it s almost impossible to get into arca without some money now dinah mullins said 10 years ago you could pick up that cheap cup chassis and old cut off body a used cup motor and go racing that s how we broke in but we couldn t get in the door the same way we did in 2008 when nascar took over the finances for arca teams started getting paid via electronic wire transfers and not after the race at the payout booth or team trailer as had been the case for decades while that might work for the likes of venturini and gibbs teams with an operating budget that didn t work for the mid pack family teams i was counting on that 3 000 to get out of here and they started telling us it will be deposited two weeks from now praytor recalled mon and pop teams needed that money that night if there was a race the next week and while it would be easy to tell these family teams to do a better job of operating a race team many of them are no longer there a team like praytor used to go to the annual winter test at daytona international speedway and was only required to pay a flat entry fee for the car and driver the praytors would use that test to bring a couple of dozen crew members or potential sponsors that weekend was like a business sign that said we re open for business and they shut it down praytor said the thinking was that if praytor could just get some potential sponsors in the infield for the test get them access to frank kimmel phil parsons and the broadcast team already on site doing research he could convince them to come back to sponsor the team in front of 10 000 fans in february nascar then began mandating that anyone given access into the infield during the test needed to have a license so much for that business opportunity each winter the nickel and diming didn t stop there even as nascar abolished live pit stops they still required anyone who went over the wall to have a full fire suit and helmet at 350 a crew member for cars that are parked and shut off what the hell is the point of that and now i m out another 2 000 praytor added then came the rule that all gas containers for generators needed to be metal and not plastic another 250 all of this is to say the cost isn t the car because there are at least a hundred cars of various competitive qualities sitting in shops across the country that could make it to the track this weekend but there are other more pressing barriers to entry than the racing platform jared c tilton 23xi racing getty images what about the car venturini says arca s rule book is already too convoluted before trying to make room for an additional spec of car and the uncertainty about what could or wouldn t be permitted or banned is a barrier for entry one of the reasons we struggle with cars right now is if you look through our rule book we have two different chassis we could run and last year it was three we have three different type of motors we can run and each one has a lead aluminum or steel box you have to run with it venturini said there s weight breaks so about 20 different weight combinations in which we can weight there s two different windshields we can use everything is combined into a total weight and there s a lot of different formulas that go into what your car is supposed to weigh you shouldn t have to be worried about all these other variables and that uncertainty is why people aren t there like they don t know if they have the right chassis for the future and what about the motor or windshield and what that means for your weight or weight breaks i ll be honest with you it s kind of insane because it s like trying to combine three different late models in one race and giving them their own rules that s from a team owner who is likely to be here no matter what and who wishes there was just a simplified rule book featuring spec parts across the board and more certainty over what the rules would be from year to year praytor responded to this sentiment by saying get over it but then offered a more reasoned explanation for the take honestly though we did the one car and one motor thing for a couple of years or at least tried to get there praytor said how did that work out for you the you of course being arca itself the expansive rule book was basically come one come all and a spec platform is simply too expensive for family teams to continue participating especially on short tracks adam glanzman outlaws under arrest potentially a much larger issue moving forward is that arca is objectively no longer cool we were kind of an outlaw series venturini said our rules were looser our tracks were different and we were kind of the wild wild west of racing i hate to say it because no one has advocated for this series more than i have but we have become a bland cookie cutter series with the intent of saving teams money races are now cut into segments with controlled pit stops that no longer require professional over the wall crews at best or training school students at worst the cars are serviced by the traveling team under an allotted period of time and they drive off pit road the way they came down it to better reflect the other national tours arca also places a restrictor plate on its various engine packages to run with reduced power big downforce and a considerable amount of drag regardless of what the rules package looks like venturini says arca needs to address the show or the series might not survive the decade why lack of interest lack of interest man venturini said everything we ve done has made the product less attractive people will spend the money if it s cool when it s not they won t as much i just feel like look the low horsepower has created terrible racing i ve never seen less passing on the race track than you do now the lack of pit stops has made the races a glorified practice session it s just not a good product i m sorry to say that i hate to say it because no one has been a bigger advocate of the series than i have i m not completely proud of where this thing is going the schedule increasingly features more cup or xfinity companion races and less signature short tracks one salem race has been replaced by bristol winchester is back but indianapolis raceway park is not fairgrounds speedway nashville is now an arca east race i m not going to say arca isn t cool anymore praytor said but anything that s really cool about arca comes from the family teams and there s far less of them now than ever before without the family teams it s just another nascar series and there s already three of those icon sportswire getty images the bright spot by drager s own admission arca is primarily a de facto minor league and a platform for young drivers to develop their crafts before moving to a national touring level the arca series is a career destination for professional racers and a developmental series for those who aspire to race at higher levels he said for the folks like frank kimmel the venturini family and andy hillenburg they re happy to carve out a living racing here not everyone passes through but we are best known for that development aspect right now there aren t any frank kimmel archetypes in arca that successful short tracker turned national series mainstay drager aspires to bring that back our role is to be a friendly platform for grassroots racers to transition into a series where you can race at daytona international speedway drager said that goal is currently best represented by greg van alst a 40 year old super late model champion who returned to arca this season for the first time since 2002 when van alst captured the 2019 champion racing association championship that prize included a test at daytona the next winter the experience was so enthralling that he purchased a car from chad bryant and has contended for top fives throughout his part time season i really wouldn t mind being the veteran face old guy of arca van alst said that would be awesome but it always comes back to money if we lost our sponsor today i d be able to carry us for the rest of the season but that s it i don t want to say it s borderline too expensive because the reason i looked at doing arca is because when we were running the bristol super late model race the winchester 400 or redbud 400 those bigger races and you compare what it costs to contend in those races to arca and you re almost spending the same i spent less going to daytona in february than i spent going to the winchester 400 45 minutes away from my house van alst says teams are only allowed four sets of tires for the race weekend at pocono and that compares to unlimited set for marquee super late model races so why wouldn t i want to race on tv the same weekend nasca is there that s definitely a point on the board for the arca model i m going to race some of the tracks i never thought i would get to race on so if it s costing me the same why not van alst said now i m not going to lie we re spending more now than i anticipated but only because i didn t anticipate running this well at the start so it s kind of like if we re going to be a 15th place team i was spending the same amount as my late model we re a fourth to eight place team so we re going all out now i m getting good tires to practice on we re not using someone used tires to practice on we re doing what we did when we won the late model championship we re mocking up in practice we re trying to get everything we can out of the race car because we re running up front and that entices you to do more than when you re running with a 15th place car for van alst the decision to run arca comes back to daytona something no other stock car racing platform outside of nascar can offer the test he earned after winning his cra championship changed his entire perspective if we lost our sponsor today and it came down to running daytona or running a full short track or late model schedule i m picking daytona van alst said if i could only run one race a year i m picking daytona there s nothing like going through that tunnel and racing in front of that crowd during speedweeks van alst isn t alone of course as he is joined by veteran tour type modified racer andy jankowiac or super cup stock car series mainstay jason kitzmiller it s just a matter of making arca more viable for them to commit to a more robust schedule jared c tilton getty images optimism persists all told while those within the arca sphere might quibble over rule packages or entry lists everyone agrees that ron drager is the right man to continue steering the ship under nascar s leadership if nascar just lets ron run arca it will be the best version of arca it can be praytor said let it be a family run organization for mostly family run teams in front of families in the grandstands it s a position drager never even expected to be in racingone getty images i wasn t going to do this drager said i went off to ferris state college and got a degree in marketing and a minor in journalism i wanted to be matt weaver the way things worked out grandmother needed help and i wanted to help i ve worked at a race track as long as i can remember cleaning up trash from under the grandstands stubbing tickets and selling programs i thought maybe there could be more to life than working at a race track and i was going to figure it out but arca kept calling me and that other life never happened i don t regret a minute of it i m a believer in fate and that everything happening for a reason so even under the larger nascar umbrella the arca garage is grateful for drager and his continued presence but he s equally appreciative to anyone who has ever participated in arca attended arca races or spent time promoting the events in any capacity that first arca race at dayton raceway took place on may 13 1953 there are thousands of racecar drivers owners sponsors hundreds of promoters and so many people who have been supportive of arca since then drager said crew members who were loyal to the brand and willing to make those sacrifices to get us to the next race the next season i m most proud of all the quality people in our garage that passion support debate and optimism intends to persist for another 1 500 races too read next trackhouse racing s vision now has a foundation
ruth sunderland do they really want to sell morrisons to a firm whose ex boss paid paedophile jeffrey epstein 114m bidding wars are usually greeted with great excitement in the city but the battle that has broken out for control of supermarket group morrisons should make our hearts sink no fewer than three rival us private equity groups are vying for control of the grocery chain and still more contenders might well muscle in the morrisons board gives every appearance of being giddy with the thrill of the auction room and the prospect of higher bids before the hammer falls in reality all the offers lodged so far are low ball attempts to grab one of our big four supermarkets on the cheap and ought to be rejected on that basis alone that though is not the real point morrisons should not be sold to any member of this circling private equity wolf pack at any price morrisons bidder apollo s co founder leon black stepped down as chairman after revelations he paid the paedophile jeffrey epstein both pictured 114million for personal tax advice the latest potential bidder apollo looks particularly unsavoury its co founder leon black 69 stepped down as chairman and chief executive in march following revelations that he paid the paedophile jeffrey epstein 114million for personal tax advice black who received more than 134million in pay and dividends last year was served with a lawsuit last month claiming he raped and sexually harassed a young russian model he insists the accusations are lies and says the pair had a wholly consensual relationship for six years be that as it may the late sir ken morrison who built the wholesome supermarket we know and love would be choking on his cornflakes if he were still alive he would also be snorting in disbelief at the glib promises to preserve his legacy made by rival investment group fortress whose bid shamefully has already been accepted by the morrisons board black was served with a lawsuit last month claiming he raped and sexually harassed a young russian model but he insists the accusations are lies pictured apollo global s headquarters the supermarket is unique in the way it stocks its shelves and fridges with produce from its own farms manufacturing facilities and fishing fleets prudently the firm owns many of its own stores rather than renting them this in the eyes of private equity makes morrisons ripe for plunder the notion that private equity would have the remotest interest in sustaining sir ken s business model or his solid yorkshire values is laughable if they take control his legacy is likely to be dismantled wholesale in an orgy of asset stripping and debt one wonders if we will ever learn given there is a long list of such promises made and then casually dishonoured by foreign buyers of uk firms alarmingly these include so called commitments made by the owner of fortress a japanese outfit called softbank it took over the cambridge tech firm arm holdings five years ago and is now trying to flog it off to a us rival despite painting itself as a long term investor in the uk promises such as these are no such thing just so much cynical hot air morrisons directors have a duty to follow the best course of action for shareholders the business the staff the customers and the taxpayer given these bosses are in line for multi million pound jackpots in a takeover though it must be hard to set aside self interest chief executive dave potts has put himself in line for a payout of 19million if the bid from fortress succeeds and possibly more if competitors up the ante tempting as it must be to take the money and run it is also short sighted with its huge growth potential morrisons has no need to put itself at the mercy of private equity it could even be more rewarding for bosses to stick around and create long term genuine growth such a strategy certainly worked well for frenchman pascal soriot the chief executive of astrazeneca the late sir ken morrison who built the supermarket pictured would be snorting in disbelief at the glib promises to preserve his legacy made by rival investment group fortress when us giant pfizer came banging on his door with a 69billion bid in 2014 he mounted a robust defence which has paid off brilliantly as an independent british firm astrazeneca has grown in value by tens of billions of pounds and has produced a life saving covid 19 vaccine it is barely conceivable that the company would have achieved any such thing if it had allowed itself to be swallowed up by an american aggressor and was then starved of investment and shorn of its research facilities as for soriot he chose to forgo the quick bucks in 2014 but over his tenure he has earned a total of nearly 87million not bad the contrast with morrisons is telling chairman andrew higginson and his spineless board who have already rolled over like whimpering poodles should be ashamed of themselves they need to show some backbone mount a proper defence of morrisons as an independent british company and show this disreputable bunch of bidders the door
america is in celebratory mode states are dropping covid 19 restrictions plane travel is breaking records and many americans are gearing up to celebrate summer as if the last year plus of pandemic madness never happened many people are experiencing a relief they ve been vaccinated and are able to gather again with others said psychologist kristen carpenter who is director of women s behavioral health at the ohio state university wexner medical center yet the pandemic isn t truly over the highly contagious delta variant of covid 19 is sweeping through unvaccinated communities and there is worry that even the vaccinated among us are at risk it s not like somebody put a period on the sentence and we re done with this pandemic we really don t know what s ahead said stress management expert dr cynthia ackrill an editor for the magazine contentment produced by the american institute of stress that s not all violent crime is up historic heat waves are devastating areas of the country not prepared to cope and mental health practitioners can t keep up with the demand for services i think for many people this return to normal feels awfully abrupt and jarring carpenter said adding that the pandemic has been an incredibly difficult period with lots of opportunity for confusion for disagreement and for discord she continued it s a real mixed bag while many will experience much of this reopening as positive there is a subset of people that will really struggle with how to move out of this very challenging time blame the brain if you are tense or anxious about reentering today s so called normal experts say that s understandable blame it on your brain especially your frontal lobe where you do your higher level thinking we ve just expended enormous energy navigating this whole pandemic constantly with loved ones hypervigilant going to the store and that takes extra brainpower ackrill said when your frontal lobe is tired from doing emotional regulation on steroids for a year and a half you re not as good at it she added you could even be at your breaking point if however you find yourself giddy with relief and ready to act as if there was no pandemic to worry about that too makes neurological sense said dr bruce wexler a senior research scientist in psychiatry at yale school of medicine humans are the only animals that shape the environment that shapes our brains and we function and feel better when there s a fit between the two said wexler who has studied brain plasticity for more than 35 years every day we strive to renew ourselves by reconnecting with the familiar faces and places that shaped us and are inside of us that s one of the reasons people were so agitated about wanting to go back to their favorite bars and hangouts wexler added when he realized that motivation wexler said i had more sympathy for the people who were complaining open up open up i could understand their urgency it s time for compassion safely getting back to normal in whatever shape that currently looks like will require being fully vaccinated and adhering to the latest social distancing requirements of local communities and businesses according to the us centers for disease control and prevention coping with anxiety tension or worry about risky pandemic behaviors both our own and those of other people will take a combination of self care and compassion experts say we all have to give ourselves a little grace carpenter said it s really important that we try not to judge ourselves for our emotional response to this change this is objectively really stressful and to have some combination of relief happiness fear or maybe even some anger and frustration is normal it s just as important to show compassion to those around us who are navigating their own reactions to change ackrill said she tells a story of being on a walk while wearing a mask when a woman came close to her and began yelling i m not wearing a mask and i m never wearing a mask i ignored her i had longer legs and walked faster she charged after me again yelling at me and then coughed in my direction on purpose ackrill continued and it just floored me because i thought this is probably a woman whose friends and relatives would be appalled by her behavior and it was her fear coming out fear of feeling out of control and wanting so badly to control things by seeing the woman s behavior through compassionate eyes ackrill was able to calm her own reaction and reduce her stress self compassion and giving compassion don t make us more vulnerable they make us stronger she said so when you re feeling heightened emotions such as anxiety or even anger about someone s risky behavior calm yourself and have some compassion for yourself and that other person taking stock of your emotions like all things this pandemic too shall pass but how well we weather it will be based on our actions experts say recognizing and taking stock of our emotions addressing those and then giving ourselves a little grace are essential to moving forward productively in ways that protect and enhance our well being carpenter said do a wellness check in ask yourself am i protecting my sleep am i eating right am i getting some kind of physical activity into each and every week it s back to basic self care carpenter said many of us have developed great habits with our time at home but many of us evolved into bad habits it s time for a check in do the same for your emotions we have to be more mindful give ourselves time and space to assess how we re doing psychologically and emotionally carpenter said it s important to set aside time to disconnect unplug from all the various things we are now plugged into and ask how am i feeling she advises her patients to begin tracking their activities mood and energy over the course of each day including weekends for at least two weeks is there a rhythm to the way i feel to my stress to my energy level to my mood lots of us don t notice we are struggling until we re kind of halfway or maybe three quarters of the way there she said once you start to notice what that rhythm is you can start to implement change for the better recharge your energy the next step is to plug in activities that you find rewarding and give you a greater sense of well being carpenter advised activities that give a sense of mastery or accomplishment are natural mood boosters reduce stress and help ultimately enhance well being for some that might be social contact for others it might be time spent alone doing hobbies reading or listening to music and don t forget laughing at silly jokes or upbeat movies carpenter said humor is really important you know so engaging with media that does lift the spirits can help she said and of course physical activity is a natural sort of mood enhancer such as walking in nature when to reach for help not everyone will be able to cope with a return to normalcy without assistance for all too many people the past year and a half has been filled with unbearable loss grief and anguish how can you tell if you need professional help with your feelings and concerns anxiety having difficulty concentrating poor sleep restlessness and irritability are signs that anxiety may be taking over your life in an unhealthy way according to the american psychological association persistent or excessive worry about your health or finances often feeling overwhelmed by emotions and a general sense that something bad is going to happen are more signals you re exhausted more irritable and you ve lost the ability to recover between bouts of worry or your anxiety is intruding on your everyday function ackrill said panic attacks at times anxiety can spiral out of control leaving you in a full fledged panic attack you may feel as if you re having a heart attack your heart rate may speed up or pound in your chest you may tremble sweat feel like you re choking or have shortness of breath and feelings of dread such attacks can happen suddenly without warning and leave some people fearful about when the next episode will occur which can cause them to change or restrict their normal activities the apa said depression this condition often begins with a lack of energy and interest or pleasure in daily activities you may develop an inability to concentrate and feel worthless or guilty about an action or the lack thereof paradoxically you can experience significant weight loss or gain a lot of weight you can also either sleep all the time or develop insomnia and sleep little you may even begin to think of death or suicide signs of suicidal thoughts often triggered by a recent loss through death divorce or separation many of the signs that a person is at risk for suicide duplicate those of depression and anxiety a loss of interest in friends or hobbies changes in sleep patterns eating habits and personality low self esteem sadness withdrawal irritability and feelings of guilt or worthlessness people who are at risk for suicide may begin behaving erratically and talk about dying or harming themselves they may show no hope for the future believing things will never get better or nothing will change according to the apa where to find help first look to the people in your own life who can be supportive and can help you experts say there are also federal state and local resources the substance abuse and mental health services administration or samhsa has a national helpline 800 662 help 4357 which provides free confidential treatment referral and information in english and spanish 24 7 every day of the year the american psychological association also has a webpage of resources for suicide substance abuse and domestic violence of course if the situation is potentially life threatening get immediate emergency assistance by calling 911 if you have health insurance many clinics and therapists are offering phone or video telehealth visits many employers are offering free access to therapists as part of their employee benefit plans and many communities have mental health centers with sliding scale fees it s ok to not feel ok and to not know what to do about it but do know there are resources out there ackrill said many people don t choose to go to therapy experts said because they believe that makes them weak or feel it would be too invasive the general public does not understand what therapy means said eve byrd director of the mental health program at the carter center in a may 2020 online forum they might say oh my gosh i am not going to be laying on a couch telling my deepest darkest thoughts that s frightening she said but that s not what therapy is byrd added therapy is really an educational activity she said adding that a therapist s role is to help you think about different ways to react to situations and more positive ways of interacting with individuals ___ how anxiety and depression rates changed in every state during covid 19

medicines for the treatment of cancer metabolic autoimmune and other major diseases and laekna therapeutics shanghai co ltd laekna an emerging innovative pharma company based in china s zhangjiang pharma valley and new jersey in the u s focusing on developing new ground breaking innovative therapies to treat cancer and liver diseases today jointly announced they have entered into a collaboration agreement to evaluate the combination of innovent s pd 1 inhibitor sintilimab and laekna s pan akt kinase inhibitor afuresertib under the agreement the two companies will work together to conduct clinical studies assessing the combination of sintilimab and afuresertib lae002 in patients with multiple types of solid tumors that have been refractory or failed to respond to treatment with pd 1 pd l1 inhibitors the trials will evaluate the safety pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of the combination therapy an investigational new drug ind application will soon be filed with the national medical products administration nmpa in china dr hui zhou senior vice president of clinical development of innovent said since our inception in 2011 innovent has built a robust pipeline of assets with five innovative drugs approved for marketing many unmet medical needs still exist for cancer patients around the world to help address this innovent explores multiple indications and combinations of therapies when developing its existing and new drug candidates at the same time we seek to work together with additional collaborative partners as the chinese biopharmaceutical industry continues to rapidly expand innovent is impressed with laekna s r d pipeline and research team and we look forward to our close collaboration and future possibilities produced by this clinical development agreement dr yue yong chief medical officer of laekna stated we hope our leading pipeline candidate afuresertib can potentially become a first in class targeted treatment in multiple types of cancer by demonstrating improved efficacy and acceptable safety in clinical trials notably sintilimab was included in china s national reimbursement drug list nrdl in 2019 as the first pd 1 inhibitor and the only pd 1 inhibitor to be included in the list that year in addition sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy is currently being reviewed by the u s fda for a potential bla approval in the first line treatment of nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer we now have the opportunity to explore the combination therapy of afuresertib and sintilimab in multiple types of solid tumors with a particular focus on cancers that have commonly shown to be refractory to treatment with pd 1 pd l1 inhibitors we hope this combination therapy demonstrates results that can ultimately lead to it becoming a new treatment option for people with these difficult to treat cancers about sintilimab sintilimab marketed as tyvyt sintilimab injection in china is an innovative pd 1 inhibitor with global quality standards jointly developed by innovent and eli lilly and company sintilimab is an immunoglobulin g4 monoclonal antibody which binds to pd 1 molecules on the surface of t cells blocks the pd 1 pd ligand 1 pd l1 pathway and reactivates t cells to kill cancer cells innovent is currently conducting more than 20 clinical studies of sintilimab to evaluate its safety and efficacy in a wide variety of cancer indications including more than 10 registrational or pivotal clinical trials in china sintilimab has been approved for four indications including the treatment of relapsed or refractory classic hodgkin s lymphoma after two lines or later of systemic chemotherapy in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first line treatment of nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer in combination with gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy for the first line treatment of squamous non small cell lung cancer in combination with byvasda bevacizumab biosimilar injection for the first line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma additionally innovent currently has a regulatory submission under review in china for sintilimab for the second line treatment of squamous non small cell lung cancer innovent also has two clinical studies of sintilimab that have met their primary endpoints in combination with cisplatin plus paclitaxel or cisplatin plus 5 fluorouracil for the first line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma the second line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in may 2021 the u s fda accepted for review the biologics license application bla for sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first line treatment of nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer sintilimab was included in china s national reimbursement drug list nrdl in 2019 as the first pd 1 inhibitor and the only pd 1 included in the list in that year about afuresertib lae002 afuresertib lae002 is an oral small molecule pan akt kinase inhibitor it has been investigated in over 10 phase 1 2 clinical trials including ovarian cancer gastric cancer multiple myeloma and melanoma these studies have demonstrated that afuresertib has strong anti cancer activities and a tolerable safety profile in these studies in recent years akt a serine threonine protein kinase has emerged as an important mechanism in oncology as it plays an important role in regulating various cell functions such as metabolism survival proliferation tissue invasion and chemotherapy resistance pten deletion and akt pik3ca alteration may lead to excessive activation of the akt signaling pathways which is one of the key drivers for cancer growth the increased activation of the akt signaling pathway is particularly common in recurrent ovarian cancer breast cancer and prostate cancer the global randomized open label multi center phase 2 profecta ii clinical trial of afuresertib is the world s first registration directed clinical study of a pan akt kinase inhibitor to treat platinum resistant ovarian cancer laekna currently expects primary results of the endpoints will be available

the oil market is tightening and will continue to draw down inventories for the rest of the year this drawdown is largely due to opec offering less supply than the expected demand growth in the coming months analysts and industry professionals say the opec group is expected to add 2 million barrels per day bpd between august and december that is if the uae vs all others standoff on baseline production levels is resolved and a deal is sealed this week such a deal now looks unlikely as opec called off the meeting on monday morning the proposed additional supply of 2 million bpd in monthly installments of 400 000 bpd production increases would be considerably less than the oil market would need as demand is bouncing back according to many analysts the world s biggest independent oil trader vitol group also believes that the global oil market will continue to tighten regardless of the fact that supply is likely to grow for the rest of 2021 i think there s very little doubt that whatever lessening of the opec production cutbacks we see it will be a fraction of the amount needed to meet growing demand in the second half of 2021 mike muller head of vitol asia told a daily market webinar hosted by energy consultancy gulf intelligence on sunday if we end up with the numbers mooted last week which was 400 000 bpd per month august through the foreseeable next five months we will still have a market which has an outlook for the spot months that will see more demand than supply muller noted as a result global oil stocks are set to continue drawing down because markets would need more crude oil than opec is planning to add for the rest of the year he added a 400 000 bpd easing of the cuts each month until december would be supportive for oil prices ing strategists warren patterson and wenyu yao said early on monday for several weeks indications and comments from the top oilmen in opec have been suggesting that the alliance would not ease production levels too much too soon as they would likely want to see the market a bit tighter than what would be a balanced market the saudi energy minister prince abdulaziz bin salman has signaled continued caution within opec as he has been warning traders for months not to bet against oil there will always be a good amount of supply to meet demand but we ll have to see demand before you see supply abdulaziz bin salman said at a forum in russia in early june related oil prices spike on large crude inventory draw the demand rebound is already here most evident in the united states according to gasbuddy data u s gasoline demand on friday before the july 4 weekend hit a new covid high surging by 9 3 percent from the previous friday the highest single day for demand since 2019 moreover u s gasoline demand on july 3 rose 1 9 percent from the prior saturday closing out the week sun sat with weekly demand up 4 6 percent the highest since august 2019 patrick de haan head of petroleum analysis for gasbuddy tweeted this weekend expectations of demand roaring back keep many analysts bullish on the oil market although a large part of them warn that opec will not let oil prices run too much above 80 oil above 80 would slow down demand growth and hurt rebounding economies with inflation meanwhile the world s third largest oil importer india called on opec again to ease the cuts and stop the price rally threatening demand recovery from price sensitive buyers current prices of around 75 a barrel are challenging for price sensitive buyers such as india its oil minister dharmendra pradhan said last week adding that he is persuading producer friends to work for a reasonable oil price advertisement still rising demand amid opec quarrels about a supply agreement is set to push prices higher at least until oil tests the threshold where demand destruction begins we re in an environment where demand is rising for oil this uncertainty about the supply outlook will feed into higher prices amir khan senior economist at saudi national bank told bloomberg television on sunday by tsvetana paraskova for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com

america is in celebratory mode states are dropping covid 19 restrictions plane travel is breaking records and many americans are gearing up to celebrate summer as if the last year plus of pandemic madness never happened many people are experiencing a relief they ve been vaccinated and are able to gather again with others said psychologist kristen carpenter who is director of women s behavioral health at the ohio state university wexner medical center yet the pandemic isn t truly over the highly contagious delta variant of covid 19 is sweeping through unvaccinated communities and there is worry that even the vaccinated among us are at risk it s not like somebody put a period on the sentence and we re done with this pandemic we really don t know what s ahead said stress management expert dr cynthia ackrill an editor for the magazine contentment produced by the american institute of stress that s not all violent crime is up historic heat waves are devastating areas of the country not prepared to cope and mental health practitioners can t keep up with the demand for services i think for many people this return to normal feels awfully abrupt and jarring carpenter said adding that the pandemic has been an incredibly difficult period with lots of opportunity for confusion for disagreement and for discord she continued it s a real mixed bag while many will experience much of this reopening as positive there is a subset of people that will really struggle with how to move out of this very challenging time blame the brain if you are tense or anxious about reentering today s so called normal experts say that s understandable blame it on your brain especially your frontal lobe where you do your higher level thinking we ve just expended enormous energy navigating this whole pandemic constantly with loved ones hypervigilant going to the store and that takes extra brainpower ackrill said when your frontal lobe is tired from doing emotional regulation on steroids for a year and a half you re not as good at it she added you could even be at your breaking point if however you find yourself giddy with relief and ready to act as if there was no pandemic to worry about that too makes neurological sense said dr bruce wexler a senior research scientist in psychiatry at yale school of medicine humans are the only animals that shape the environment that shapes our brains and we function and feel better when there s a fit between the two said wexler who has studied brain plasticity for more than 35 years every day we strive to renew ourselves by reconnecting with the familiar faces and places that shaped us and are inside of us that s one of the reasons people were so agitated about wanting to go back to their favorite bars and hangouts wexler added when he realized that motivation wexler said i had more sympathy for the people who were complaining open up open up i could understand their urgency it s time for compassion safely getting back to normal in whatever shape that currently looks like will require being fully vaccinated and adhering to the latest social distancing requirements of local communities and businesses according to the us centers for disease control and prevention coping with anxiety tension or worry about risky pandemic behaviors both our own and those of other people will take a combination of self care and compassion experts say we all have to give ourselves a little grace carpenter said it s really important that we try not to judge ourselves for our emotional response to this change this is objectively really stressful and to have some combination of relief happiness fear or maybe even some anger and frustration is normal it s just as important to show compassion to those around us who are navigating their own reactions to change ackrill said she tells a story of being on a walk while wearing a mask when a woman came close to her and began yelling i m not wearing a mask and i m never wearing a mask i ignored her i had longer legs and walked faster she charged after me again yelling at me and then coughed in my direction on purpose ackrill continued and it just floored me because i thought this is probably a woman whose friends and relatives would be appalled by her behavior and it was her fear coming out fear of feeling out of control and wanting so badly to control things by seeing the woman s behavior through compassionate eyes ackrill was able to calm her own reaction and reduce her stress self compassion and giving compassion don t make us more vulnerable they make us stronger she said so when you re feeling heightened emotions such as anxiety or even anger about someone s risky behavior calm yourself and have some compassion for yourself and that other person taking stock of your emotions like all things this pandemic too shall pass but how well we weather it will be based on our actions experts say recognizing and taking stock of our emotions addressing those and then giving ourselves a little grace are essential to moving forward productively in ways that protect and enhance our well being carpenter said do a wellness check in ask yourself am i protecting my sleep am i eating right am i getting some kind of physical activity into each and every week it s back to basic self care carpenter said many of us have developed great habits with our time at home but many of us evolved into bad habits it s time for a check in do the same for your emotions we have to be more mindful give ourselves time and space to assess how we re doing psychologically and emotionally carpenter said it s important to set aside time to disconnect unplug from all the various things we are now plugged into and ask how am i feeling she advises her patients to begin tracking their activities mood and energy over the course of each day including weekends for at least two weeks is there a rhythm to the way i feel to my stress to my energy level to my mood lots of us don t notice we are struggling until we re kind of halfway or maybe three quarters of the way there she said once you start to notice what that rhythm is you can start to implement change for the better recharge your energy the next step is to plug in activities that you find rewarding and give you a greater sense of well being carpenter advised activities that give a sense of mastery or accomplishment are natural mood boosters reduce stress and help ultimately enhance well being for some that might be social contact for others it might be time spent alone doing hobbies reading or listening to music and don t forget laughing at silly jokes or upbeat movies carpenter said humor is really important you know so engaging with media that does lift the spirits can help she said and of course physical activity is a natural sort of mood enhancer such as walking in nature when to reach for help not everyone will be able to cope with a return to normalcy without assistance for all too many people the past year and a half has been filled with unbearable loss grief and anguish how can you tell if you need professional help with your feelings and concerns anxiety having difficulty concentrating poor sleep restlessness and irritability are signs that anxiety may be taking over your life in an unhealthy way according to the american psychological association persistent or excessive worry about your health or finances often feeling overwhelmed by emotions and a general sense that something bad is going to happen are more signals you re exhausted more irritable and you ve lost the ability to recover between bouts of worry or your anxiety is intruding on your everyday function ackrill said panic attacks at times anxiety can spiral out of control leaving you in a full fledged panic attack you may feel as if you re having a heart attack your heart rate may speed up or pound in your chest you may tremble sweat feel like you re choking or have shortness of breath and feelings of dread such attacks can happen suddenly without warning and leave some people fearful about when the next episode will occur which can cause them to change or restrict their normal activities the apa said depression this condition often begins with a lack of energy and interest or pleasure in daily activities you may develop an inability to concentrate and feel worthless or guilty about an action or the lack thereof paradoxically you can experience significant weight loss or gain a lot of weight you can also either sleep all the time or develop insomnia and sleep little you may even begin to think of death or suicide signs of suicidal thoughts often triggered by a recent loss through death divorce or separation many of the signs that a person is at risk for suicide duplicate those of depression and anxiety a loss of interest in friends or hobbies changes in sleep patterns eating habits and personality low self esteem sadness withdrawal irritability and feelings of guilt or worthlessness people who are at risk for suicide may begin behaving erratically and talk about dying or harming themselves they may show no hope for the future believing things will never get better or nothing will change according to the apa where to find help first look to the people in your own life who can be supportive and can help you experts say there are also federal state and local resources the substance abuse and mental health services administration or samhsa has a national helpline 800 662 help 4357 which provides free confidential treatment referral and information in english and spanish 24 7 every day of the year the american psychological association also has a webpage of resources for suicide substance abuse and domestic violence of course if the situation is potentially life threatening get immediate emergency assistance by calling 911 if you have health insurance many clinics and therapists are offering phone or video telehealth visits many employers are offering free access to therapists as part of their employee benefit plans and many communities have mental health centers with sliding scale fees it s ok to not feel ok and to not know what to do about it but do know there are resources out there ackrill said many people don t choose to go to therapy experts said because they believe that makes them weak or feel it would be too invasive the general public does not understand what therapy means said eve byrd director of the mental health program at the carter center in a may 2020 online forum they might say oh my gosh i am not going to be laying on a couch telling my deepest darkest thoughts that s frightening she said but that s not what therapy is byrd added therapy is really an educational activity she said adding that a therapist s role is to help you think about different ways to react to situations and more positive ways of interacting with individuals ___ how anxiety and depression rates changed in every state during covid 19

on new zealand s lack of adequate cyber security defences remember how back in the olden days we had security concerns about the chinese firm huawei allegedly huawei was to be shunned as a business arm of the chinese communist party and supposedly some huawei products contained security glitches that would leave potential users vulnerable to cyber penetration well the last six months have shown that huawei was the least of our problems the russians not the chinese seem to pose more of a cyber security threat moreover it is the security glitches in the supply chains for software already in use there that is triggering major problems here and elsewhere in the last six months alone the us has been hit by several huge and apparently successful cyber intrusions these have included a the solarwinds hack of the us government energy treasury justice and commerce departments and thousands of other users of a particular version of solarwinds software b a ransomware attack on the colonial pipeline that forced the company to shut down nearly 9 000 kilometres of its pipeline system c a ransomware attack on the brazilian firm jbs the worlds largest meat company that resulted in jbs choosing to pay us11 million in ransom and advertisement scroll to continue reading d the kaseya attack for which the revil cybercrime gang are now demanding us70 million in ransom such problems aren t new but they seem to be snowballing the russian fancy bear hacker team has been held responsible for the 2018 hack of the international olympic committee an intrusion widely seen as payback for the ioc s banning of russia from olympic competition a team working within the russian intelligence main directorate the gru called unit 74455 has been formally charged by us authorities with meddling in the 2016 us election some of the same defendants have also been accused of cyber intrusions in france a malware attack on the electricity grid in the ukraine and similar actions elsewhere the suspects were also accused of carrying out an attack in june 2017 that is considered the most costly in history called notpetya it was originally aimed at ukraine but quickly boomeranged around the world paralyzing some of the biggest corporations in europe and the united states at an estimated total cost of 10 billion it was never clear intelligence experts said whether russia intended to limit the attack to the ukrainian economy and any company that dared to do business with ukraine or whether it knowingly built a tool that would wreak global havoc but the estimated cost to mondelez the maker of oreo cookies and ritz crackers alone was more than 100 million merck the pharmaceutical giant reported some 700 million in damages the attack also impeded computer use at hospitals and medical facilities in western pennsylvania medical facilities that sounds familiar the recent attack on waikato dhb seems to have been part of a global pattern routinely the russian government has denied involvement in all such activities at this point it remains unclear whether the russian hackers are working directly for a cash strapped kremlin or are criminal gangs operating at a distance from the kremlin with its tacit blessing and for a share of the profits either way russia has built an a grade cyber arsenal and at present the west is struggling to match its expertise as mentioned the threats are also becoming more sophisticated some of the more recent intrusions have not been targeted at individual firms but at key points in the cyber supply chains that have ripple effects on thousands of customers further down the line with the solarwinds hack the entry was via a software update that contains millions of lines of computer code the hackers clandestinely rewrote 4 032 lines of that code thereby creating back doors into the computer networks of the firms government agencies and think tanks using the solarwinds orion software package to mount an offensive action on solarwinds on the scale required microsoft s president brad smith has said we asked ourselves how many engineers have probably worked on these attacks and the answer we came to was well certainly more than 1 000 if so it is very hard to see how a mere criminal gang would have that level of resources at their disposal directly or indirectly it indicates the involvement of a state actor incredibly the solarwinds cyber burglars went undetected for the best part of a year russian military hackers sabotaged a tiny piece of computer code the hidden virus spread to 18 000 government and private computer networks by way of one of those software updates we all take for granted after it was installed russian agents went rummaging through the digital files of the u s departments of justice state treasury energy and commerce among others and for nine months they had unfettered access to top level communications court documents even nuclear secrets last week s kaseya intrusion has been a somewhat similar story like many other countries new zealand is still discovering how many firms and agencies are vulnerable and or may have been affected several schools and kindergartens have been hit those with good backup systems have been able to readily switch to the backups there s a lesson in that back up everything all the time wider questions arise in new zealand how capable are the cyber security defences a of the state and b of the private sector and c how should those defences be best deployed disturbingly the west s official security agencies still appear to be playing catch up when it comes to detecting and neutralising the threats that are now emerging it was an alert individual at a large us private security firm called fireeye that noticed a problem with the two factor authentication access code on the company phones and then traced the ghostly free rider back to its point of entry and then alerted the us government to this huge problem it had finally located as being within the solarwinds software update with kaseya it was a dutch non profit organisation that alerted kaseya to its vulnerability and kaseya was in the process of fixing it when the july 2 attack was launched new zealand seems ill equipped to detect these kind of challenges beforehand under the coalition government of 2017 2020 this country has just invested heavily in analogue forms of defence long after the security threats had gone digital as werewolf pointed out last week new zealand has been locking itself back within a 60 year old cold war defence configuration alongside our traditional allies at enormous expense we have kitted ourselves out with conventional warfighting tools to meet defence challenges in the pacific region that even the nzdf says in its own reviews and reports will be non existent over the lifespan of the gear in question to counter these phantom threats we have allocated circa 20 billion over the next decade that outlay has left new zealand with almost nothing left over to bolster our defences against the actual threats to our security posed by cyber criminals domestic and global terrorism and climate change against those real and imminent threats our pricey updated frigates poseidon anti submarine aircraft and heavy left super hercules planes will be next to useless defence is the best form of defence similarly the kaseya intrusion has highlighted the mismatch between the resources we ve bought and the threats we face our main clearing house for information about cyber threats is cert nz a small under funded and under staffed sub unit within mbie over the past weekend cert nz did a fine job of summarising the kaseya problem and usefully pointed firms and agencies towards the best available information on sites like the reddit thread of the huntress security firm great work done on a shoestring less impressively the public statements by gcsb director andrew hampton that these attacks are sophisticated and aimed at supply chains were what any ordinary citizen or firm would have got already from watching cnn or from linking to the huntress reddit thread the gcsb commentary added nothing new to the information mix looking ahead a debate needs to be had on how new zealand plans to defend its cyber security arguably we need the cyber equivalent of a defence review where are our main online vulnerabilities are they here or are they mainly being imported from offshore within the software we re purchasing if the latter can we possibly detect those vulnerabilities and insulate ourselves against them or do we see our resources as being best deployed in forward projection actions alongside our 5 eyes allies currently it is very hard to see how the 5 eyes alliance could possibly pursue to use the jargon an effective cost imposition strategy against the kremlin in order to motivate it to desist in the meantime the government has to do more than equip cert nz to send out reminders for everyone to do their constant back ups and to be on the lookout against phishing emails that s good advice but perhaps we also judging by the pattern of the latest attacks need to put in place the cyber equivalent of medsafe to vet imported software products beforehand as safe for local use probably though the expertise required to do that job properly is lacking here even within the gcsb buyer beware ultimately and this takes us right back to the alleged sins of huawei mentioned at the outset there wouldn t be a problem if the software we are importing was up to scratch if there wasn t a cyber weakness waiting for the russians or north koreans or ukrainians to exploit we wouldn t have had a solarwinds hack or a kaseya intrusion we wouldn t have had a problem at waikato dhb either it has been surprising and counter productive that the public has been told so little about the cause of the waikato dhb intrusion let alone about who the likely perpetrators were par for the course almost nothing has been released about the hack at the reserve bank either beyond the rb absolving itself by blaming an independent supplier for whom the rb disclaimed any responsibility but who did it and how at least the public was told that the mid 2020 attacks on stuff rnz and the nz stock exchange were foreign driven distributed denial of service amplifications whereby attempts were made to overwhelm the local servers with sudden mass influxes of foreign traffic but again where did that traffic originate from on cyber security matters the public is largely being left in the dark supposedly this is to avoid tipping off the intruders by publicly disclosing too much as if these expert intruders can t readily see for themselves the nature and the limitations of our responses yet in the case of both solarwinds and kaseya it was non state actors the fireeye private security firm and the dutch ngo that alerted the world to the existence of a problem meaning the pressing need is for greater transparency not for heightened secrecy because the track records indicate that it will be an informed public that will protect the state from cyber threats and not vice versa on cyber security matters though the gcsb still seems to be banging into the furniture in the dark while trying to find a light switch it is how they roll africa calling the sahei desert regions of niger and mali have given us several brilliant musicians over the past decade the tinariwen band from mali are now global superstars and the niger guitarist mdou moctar he s a combination of hendrix level

america is in celebratory mode states are dropping covid 19 restrictions plane travel is breaking records and many americans are gearing up to celebrate summer as if the last year plus of pandemic madness never happened many people are experiencing a relief they ve been vaccinated and are able to gather again with others said psychologist kristen carpenter who is director of women s behavioral health at the ohio state university wexner medical center yet the pandemic isn t truly over the highly contagious delta variant of covid 19 is sweeping through unvaccinated communities and there is worry that even the vaccinated among us are at risk it s not like somebody put a period on the sentence and we re done with this pandemic we really don t know what s ahead said stress management expert dr cynthia ackrill an editor for the magazine contentment produced by the american institute of stress that s not all violent crime is up historic heat waves are devastating areas of the country not prepared to cope and mental health practitioners can t keep up with the demand for services i think for many people this return to normal feels awfully abrupt and jarring carpenter said adding that the pandemic has been an incredibly difficult period with lots of opportunity for confusion for disagreement and for discord she continued it s a real mixed bag while many will experience much of this reopening as positive there is a subset of people that will really struggle with how to move out of this very challenging time blame the brain if you are tense or anxious about reentering today s so called normal experts say that s understandable blame it on your brain especially your frontal lobe where you do your higher level thinking we ve just expended enormous energy navigating this whole pandemic constantly with loved ones hypervigilant going to the store and that takes extra brainpower ackrill said when your frontal lobe is tired from doing emotional regulation on steroids for a year and a half you re not as good at it she added you could even be at your breaking point if however you find yourself giddy with relief and ready to act as if there was no pandemic to worry about that too makes neurological sense said dr bruce wexler a senior research scientist in psychiatry at yale school of medicine humans are the only animals that shape the environment that shapes our brains and we function and feel better when there s a fit between the two said wexler who has studied brain plasticity for more than 35 years every day we strive to renew ourselves by reconnecting with the familiar faces and places that shaped us and are inside of us that s one of the reasons people were so agitated about wanting to go back to their favorite bars and hangouts wexler added when he realized that motivation wexler said i had more sympathy for the people who were complaining open up open up i could understand their urgency it s time for compassion safely getting back to normal in whatever shape that currently looks like will require being fully vaccinated and adhering to the latest social distancing requirements of local communities and businesses according to the us centers for disease control and prevention coping with anxiety tension or worry about risky pandemic behaviors both our own and those of other people will take a combination of self care and compassion experts say we all have to give ourselves a little grace carpenter said it s really important that we try not to judge ourselves for our emotional response to this change this is objectively really stressful and to have some combination of relief happiness fear or maybe even some anger and frustration is normal it s just as important to show compassion to those around us who are navigating their own reactions to change ackrill said she tells a story of being on a walk while wearing a mask when a woman came close to her and began yelling i m not wearing a mask and i m never wearing a mask i ignored her i had longer legs and walked faster she charged after me again yelling at me and then coughed in my direction on purpose ackrill continued and it just floored me because i thought this is probably a woman whose friends and relatives would be appalled by her behavior and it was her fear coming out fear of feeling out of control and wanting so badly to control things by seeing the woman s behavior through compassionate eyes ackrill was able to calm her own reaction and reduce her stress self compassion and giving compassion don t make us more vulnerable they make us stronger she said so when you re feeling heightened emotions such as anxiety or even anger about someone s risky behavior calm yourself and have some compassion for yourself and that other person taking stock of your emotions like all things this pandemic too shall pass but how well we weather it will be based on our actions experts say recognizing and taking stock of our emotions addressing those and then giving ourselves a little grace are essential to moving forward productively in ways that protect and enhance our well being carpenter said do a wellness check in ask yourself am i protecting my sleep am i eating right am i getting some kind of physical activity into each and every week it s back to basic self care carpenter said many of us have developed great habits with our time at home but many of us evolved into bad habits it s time for a check in do the same for your emotions we have to be more mindful give ourselves time and space to assess how we re doing psychologically and emotionally carpenter said it s important to set aside time to disconnect unplug from all the various things we are now plugged into and ask how am i feeling she advises her patients to begin tracking their activities mood and energy over the course of each day including weekends for at least two weeks is there a rhythm to the way i feel to my stress to my energy level to my mood lots of us don t notice we are struggling until we re kind of halfway or maybe three quarters of the way there she said once you start to notice what that rhythm is you can start to implement change for the better recharge your energy the next step is to plug in activities that you find rewarding and give you a greater sense of well being carpenter advised activities that give a sense of mastery or accomplishment are natural mood boosters reduce stress and help ultimately enhance well being for some that might be social contact for others it might be time spent alone doing hobbies reading or listening to music and don t forget laughing at silly jokes or upbeat movies carpenter said humor is really important you know so engaging with media that does lift the spirits can help she said and of course physical activity is a natural sort of mood enhancer such as walking in nature when to reach for help not everyone will be able to cope with a return to normalcy without assistance for all too many people the past year and a half has been filled with unbearable loss grief and anguish how can you tell if you need professional help with your feelings and concerns anxiety having difficulty concentrating poor sleep restlessness and irritability are signs that anxiety may be taking over your life in an unhealthy way according to the american psychological association persistent or excessive worry about your health or finances often feeling overwhelmed by emotions and a general sense that something bad is going to happen are more signals you re exhausted more irritable and you ve lost the ability to recover between bouts of worry or your anxiety is intruding on your everyday function ackrill said panic attacks at times anxiety can spiral out of control leaving you in a full fledged panic attack you may feel as if you re having a heart attack your heart rate may speed up or pound in your chest you may tremble sweat feel like you re choking or have shortness of breath and feelings of dread such attacks can happen suddenly without warning and leave some people fearful about when the next episode will occur which can cause them to change or restrict their normal activities the apa said depression this condition often begins with a lack of energy and interest or pleasure in daily activities you may develop an inability to concentrate and feel worthless or guilty about an action or the lack thereof paradoxically you can experience significant weight loss or gain a lot of weight you can also either sleep all the time or develop insomnia and sleep little you may even begin to think of death or suicide signs of suicidal thoughts often triggered by a recent loss through death divorce or separation many of the signs that a person is at risk for suicide duplicate those of depression and anxiety a loss of interest in friends or hobbies changes in sleep patterns eating habits and personality low self esteem sadness withdrawal irritability and feelings of guilt or worthlessness people who are at risk for suicide may begin behaving erratically and talk about dying or harming themselves they may show no hope for the future believing things will never get better or nothing will change according to the apa where to find help first look to the people in your own life who can be supportive and can help you experts say there are also federal state and local resources the substance abuse and mental health services administration or samhsa has a national helpline 800 662 help 4357 which provides free confidential treatment referral and information in english and spanish 24 7 every day of the year the american psychological association also has a webpage of resources for suicide substance abuse and domestic violence of course if the situation is potentially life threatening get immediate emergency assistance by calling 911 if you have health insurance many clinics and therapists are offering phone or video telehealth visits many employers are offering free access to therapists as part of their employee benefit plans and many communities have mental health centers with sliding scale fees it s ok to not feel ok and to not know what to do about it but do know there are resources out there ackrill said many people don t choose to go to therapy experts said because they believe that makes them weak or feel it would be too invasive the general public does not understand what therapy means said eve byrd director of the mental health program at the carter center in a may 2020 online forum they might say oh my gosh i am not going to be laying on a couch telling my deepest darkest thoughts that s frightening she said but that s not what therapy is byrd added therapy is really an educational activity she said adding that a therapist s role is to help you think about different ways to react to situations and more positive ways of interacting with individuals ___ how anxiety and depression rates changed in every state during covid 19

america is in celebratory mode states are dropping covid 19 restrictions plane travel is breaking records and many americans are gearing up to celebrate summer as if the last year plus of pandemic madness never happened many people are experiencing a relief they ve been vaccinated and are able to gather again with others said psychologist kristen carpenter who is director of women s behavioral health at the ohio state university wexner medical center yet the pandemic isn t truly over the highly contagious delta variant of covid 19 is sweeping through unvaccinated communities and there is worry that even the vaccinated among us are at risk it s not like somebody put a period on the sentence and we re done with this pandemic we really don t know what s ahead said stress management expert dr cynthia ackrill an editor for the magazine contentment produced by the american institute of stress that s not all violent crime is up historic heat waves are devastating areas of the country not prepared to cope and mental health practitioners can t keep up with the demand for services i think for many people this return to normal feels awfully abrupt and jarring carpenter said adding that the pandemic has been an incredibly difficult period with lots of opportunity for confusion for disagreement and for discord she continued it s a real mixed bag while many will experience much of this reopening as positive there is a subset of people that will really struggle with how to move out of this very challenging time blame the brain if you are tense or anxious about reentering today s so called normal experts say that s understandable blame it on your brain especially your frontal lobe where you do your higher level thinking we ve just expended enormous energy navigating this whole pandemic constantly with loved ones hypervigilant going to the store and that takes extra brainpower ackrill said when your frontal lobe is tired from doing emotional regulation on steroids for a year and a half you re not as good at it she added you could even be at your breaking point if however you find yourself giddy with relief and ready to act as if there was no pandemic to worry about that too makes neurological sense said dr bruce wexler a senior research scientist in psychiatry at yale school of medicine humans are the only animals that shape the environment that shapes our brains and we function and feel better when there s a fit between the two said wexler who has studied brain plasticity for more than 35 years every day we strive to renew ourselves by reconnecting with the familiar faces and places that shaped us and are inside of us that s one of the reasons people were so agitated about wanting to go back to their favorite bars and hangouts wexler added when he realized that motivation wexler said i had more sympathy for the people who were complaining open up open up i could understand their urgency it s time for compassion safely getting back to normal in whatever shape that currently looks like will require being fully vaccinated and adhering to the latest social distancing requirements of local communities and businesses according to the us centers for disease control and prevention coping with anxiety tension or worry about risky pandemic behaviors both our own and those of other people will take a combination of self care and compassion experts say we all have to give ourselves a little grace carpenter said it s really important that we try not to judge ourselves for our emotional response to this change this is objectively really stressful and to have some combination of relief happiness fear or maybe even some anger and frustration is normal it s just as important to show compassion to those around us who are navigating their own reactions to change ackrill said she tells a story of being on a walk while wearing a mask when a woman came close to her and began yelling i m not wearing a mask and i m never wearing a mask i ignored her i had longer legs and walked faster she charged after me again yelling at me and then coughed in my direction on purpose ackrill continued and it just floored me because i thought this is probably a woman whose friends and relatives would be appalled by her behavior and it was her fear coming out fear of feeling out of control and wanting so badly to control things by seeing the woman s behavior through compassionate eyes ackrill was able to calm her own reaction and reduce her stress self compassion and giving compassion don t make us more vulnerable they make us stronger she said so when you re feeling heightened emotions such as anxiety or even anger about someone s risky behavior calm yourself and have some compassion for yourself and that other person taking stock of your emotions like all things this pandemic too shall pass but how well we weather it will be based on our actions experts say recognizing and taking stock of our emotions addressing those and then giving ourselves a little grace are essential to moving forward productively in ways that protect and enhance our well being carpenter said do a wellness check in ask yourself am i protecting my sleep am i eating right am i getting some kind of physical activity into each and every week it s back to basic self care carpenter said many of us have developed great habits with our time at home but many of us evolved into bad habits it s time for a check in do the same for your emotions we have to be more mindful give ourselves time and space to assess how we re doing psychologically and emotionally carpenter said it s important to set aside time to disconnect unplug from all the various things we are now plugged into and ask how am i feeling she advises her patients to begin tracking their activities mood and energy over the course of each day including weekends for at least two weeks is there a rhythm to the way i feel to my stress to my energy level to my mood lots of us don t notice we are struggling until we re kind of halfway or maybe three quarters of the way there she said once you start to notice what that rhythm is you can start to implement change for the better recharge your energy the next step is to plug in activities that you find rewarding and give you a greater sense of well being carpenter advised activities that give a sense of mastery or accomplishment are natural mood boosters reduce stress and help ultimately enhance well being for some that might be social contact for others it might be time spent alone doing hobbies reading or listening to music and don t forget laughing at silly jokes or upbeat movies carpenter said humor is really important you know so engaging with media that does lift the spirits can help she said and of course physical activity is a natural sort of mood enhancer such as walking in nature when to reach for help not everyone will be able to cope with a return to normalcy without assistance for all too many people the past year and a half has been filled with unbearable loss grief and anguish how can you tell if you need professional help with your feelings and concerns anxiety having difficulty concentrating poor sleep restlessness and irritability are signs that anxiety may be taking over your life in an unhealthy way according to the american psychological association persistent or excessive worry about your health or finances often feeling overwhelmed by emotions and a general sense that something bad is going to happen are more signals you re exhausted more irritable and you ve lost the ability to recover between bouts of worry or your anxiety is intruding on your everyday function ackrill said panic attacks at times anxiety can spiral out of control leaving you in a full fledged panic attack you may feel as if you re having a heart attack your heart rate may speed up or pound in your chest you may tremble sweat feel like you re choking or have shortness of breath and feelings of dread such attacks can happen suddenly without warning and leave some people fearful about when the next episode will occur which can cause them to change or restrict their normal activities the apa said depression this condition often begins with a lack of energy and interest or pleasure in daily activities you may develop an inability to concentrate and feel worthless or guilty about an action or the lack thereof paradoxically you can experience significant weight loss or gain a lot of weight you can also either sleep all the time or develop insomnia and sleep little you may even begin to think of death or suicide signs of suicidal thoughts often triggered by a recent loss through death divorce or separation many of the signs that a person is at risk for suicide duplicate those of depression and anxiety a loss of interest in friends or hobbies changes in sleep patterns eating habits and personality low self esteem sadness withdrawal irritability and feelings of guilt or worthlessness people who are at risk for suicide may begin behaving erratically and talk about dying or harming themselves they may show no hope for the future believing things will never get better or nothing will change according to the apa where to find help first look to the people in your own life who can be supportive and can help you experts say there are also federal state and local resources the substance abuse and mental health services administration or samhsa has a national helpline 800 662 help 4357 which provides free confidential treatment referral and information in english and spanish 24 7 every day of the year the american psychological association also has a webpage of resources for suicide substance abuse and domestic violence of course if the situation is potentially life threatening get immediate emergency assistance by calling 911 if you have health insurance many clinics and therapists are offering phone or video telehealth visits many employers are offering free access to therapists as part of their employee benefit plans and many communities have mental health centers with sliding scale fees it s ok to not feel ok and to not know what to do about it but do know there are resources out there ackrill said many people don t choose to go to therapy experts said because they believe that makes them weak or feel it would be too invasive the general public does not understand what therapy means said eve byrd director of the mental health program at the carter center in a may 2020 online forum they might say oh my gosh i am not going to be laying on a couch telling my deepest darkest thoughts that s frightening she said but that s not what therapy is byrd added therapy is really an educational activity she said adding that a therapist s role is to help you think about different ways to react to situations and more positive ways of interacting with individuals ___ how anxiety and depression rates changed in every state during covid 19

bloomberg to the world s investors the saga over didi global inc has made china s biggest tech firms a riskier bet as president xi jinping seeks to control one of the country s most valuable resources big data didi is by most measures an appealing success story the firm controls almost the entire ride hailing market in china and counts softbank group corp and tencent holdings ltd as major shareholders didi was actually profitable in the first quarter a rarity for the industry its initial public offering last week was the second biggest in the u s by a company based in china and it was well received didi sold 317 million shares about 10 more than originally planned and yet the listing on the eve of the communist party s centenary didn t appear to trigger celebration back in beijing instead two days after the ipo china s cyberspace regulator said it was reviewing the company on national security grounds two days after that the regulator said the firm had committed serious violations in the collection and usage of personal information it then ordered the company s app to be removed from stores the stock plunged 28 in pre market trading on tuesday as u s markets reopened read more didi plunges after china regulators order stores to remove app what made didi so valuable to investors is the same thing that makes it and other tech companies a potential threat to beijing it holds vast amounts of sensitive data from half a billion annual active users mostly in china over the past year xi s government has sought to gain control of this data both to protect users from abuse and find a way to use it to spur broad based economic growth rather than simply enrich a cohort of billionaires that could potentially challenge the communist party s authority the cyberspace administration of china suggested didi delay its ipo weeks before the debut to check its network security the wall street journal reported citing people with knowledge of the matter the watchdog was particularly concerned that listing in the u s would require didi to disclose its major vendors and suppliers which could leave it vulnerable to security breaches it said citing unidentified people didi said in an emailed statement on monday it was unaware of the chinese watchdog s decision to suspend user registrations and remove didi chuxing from app stores ahead of its listing what is didi and why is china cracking down on it quicktake didi like many other chinese tech giants grew rapidly in the absence of comprehensive oversight beijing is now seeking to plug regulatory loopholes but it needs more time by listing in the u s didi effectively sidestepped an extensive approval process by china s securities watchdog at a time when officials have pushed for more firms to raise funds at home beijing is not pleased to see its national champions cozying up to foreign stakeholders said xiaomeng lu a senior analyst at eurasia group a political risk consultancy it also wants tech companies to keep their core assets data and algorithms in china some projections show china will hold a third of the world s data by 2025 giving it potentially a massive competitive advantage in areas like artificial intelligence that will drive the modern economy and the geopolitical stakes are also high the biden administration is reviewing what user data should be off limits to china and beijing is similarly concerned about handing over information that could be used by its adversaries china s campaign to impose tougher controls on the nation s tech firms accelerated late last year as the country recovered from the impact of the covid 19 pandemic and tensions with the u s intensified officials launched a powerful broadside on the fintech sector when they pulled ant group co s 35 billion dual listing in shanghai and hong kong at the 11th hour read more china widens probe beyond didi roiling global investors like didi ant dominated its field in just a decade the firm an affiliate of jack ma s alibaba group had grown to reshape the lives of millions of chinese through its alipay app as well as the giant yu ebao money market fund by march it was clear authorities were widening the offensive president xi at a meeting of the communist party s top financial advisory committee warned that beijing would go after so called platform companies that have amassed data and market power this term effectively covers a range of firms that offer services to hundreds of millions from didi to food delivery giant meituan and e commerce leaders like jd com inc the crackdown has weighed heavily on the tech sector alibaba s hong kong traded shares have lost 33 since their october high while tencent which is china s leader in social media games and music publishing is down 28 since a record in january didi fell as much as 11 on friday china isn t alone in trying to control the dominance of large technology firms u s congress is seeking to force companies such as amazon com inc and apple inc to radically change their business models while google faces a sweeping european union probe into its advertising technology we have entered a new period globally where the regulatory scrutiny on tech has increased and will be ongoing for some time said joshua crabb a senior portfolio manager at robeco in hong kong but the scale and speed of xi s campaign speaks to the communist party s obsession with control the party is battling what it sees to be multiple threats to national security and its five year plan in october included a focus on security issues for the first time a rivalry with the u s is only intensifying under the biden administration which recently rallied allies to present a more united front against beijing the issue is chinese entrepreneurs often turn to u s stock exchanges which offer founders something they can t get at home a deep pool of international capital and lower barriers to entry mean the world s largest market remains a key destination for chinese and hong kong firms who were fundraising at a record pace earlier in the year potential forced delistings by the new york stock exchange and tougher requirements on the nasdaq have been no deterrent to chinese companies in need of cash though the communist party has little say over the u s listing process for its private companies it can often nudge top level management but exerting influence over a business s operations like it did for didi is a far bolder move and puts the government s stamp on the u s stock market china s cyberspace regulator is trying to step in to exert their influence in this whole process said chucheng feng co founder and partner of plenum a research firm specializing in china s politics and economy they re trying to use didi to set up this

new york amazon founder jeff bezos today will hand over his chief executive title to andy jassy ending a more than two decade run leading the company through its evolution from online bookseller to 1 75 trillion rs276 trillion global retail logistics and internet behemoth foreign media reported the company announced in february that bezos would transition from ceo to executive chair saying he wanted to spend more time on his other ventures including the washington post space company blue origin and philanthropy but even as he steps back into a less public role at the company bezos will still have tremendous influence at amazon amzn for years to come by virtue of being its largest individual shareholder a longtime mentor to the incoming ceo and his role heading the board he ll likely still stay involved though no longer focusing on the day to day and instead able to focus on company wide initiatives and new products and services said daniel elman global technology analyst at market research firm nucleus research his skills for cutting through noise identifying high value opportunities cannot be overstated so it would make sense for amazon to free him from the operational grind to maximise those areas bezos exit as ceo comes at a critical time for amazon the pandemic created massive demand for its services leading to jumps in profits and in hiring but the company s explosive growth has only heightened the attention of regulators some of whom believe it has gotten too big as of last month bezos owned 51 2 million shares or around 10 of amazon common stock much more than the next largest shareholder vanguard group which holds around 6 5 bezos also will almost certainly continue to have the ear of incoming ceo jassy the two have worked closely since the company s early days

islamabad pakistan s embattled prime minister imran khan in a speech that is likely to reverberate in both washington and beijing accused the united states last week of having crushed the self esteem of the pakistani people during his address to parliament which was ostensibly about the fiscal budget passed the previous day khan pontificated on topics as diverse as the golden age of islam genetic modifications of pakistani livestock and the miraculous achievements of the communist party of china but nowhere not even while recounting his own achievements was he as impassioned as when he trained his ire on us pakistan relations describing pakistan s involvement in the war on terror as the blackest period in the country s history he vowed to never again be a partner in conflict with the united states the extent to which he remains able to honor this commitment is yet to be seen widely held responsible for mismanaging the economy which has returned disappointing growth figures and calamitous levels of inflation he has been hemorrhaging support ever since he was elected amid accusations of vote rigging in 2018 in the senate elections of march 3 his party failed to gain a majority in the upper house which was seen as an indictment of not just his leadership but also his ability to enforce party discipline members of the lower house where khan has a numerical advantage and four provincial assemblies are tasked with electing senators in a secret ballot and it is uncommon for the ruling party not to win outright there is also a sense in islamabad that the country s powerful military elite would prefer to keep positive relations with america and that the timing of khan s speech which came a day after he told chinese state media that pakistan would maintain its close relations with china in defiance of us pressure could be construed as an attempt at taking sides speaking on the 100 year anniversary of the cpc khan lauded the special relationship between china and pakistan and promised to maintain it whatever the circumstances you only remember a friend who stands with you in your difficult times he told liu xin of cgtn and not one to rely on the subtlety of implication khan returned to the theme of friendship in his speech the following day is america our friend he asked parliament have you ever heard of a friend bombing you have you ever heard of an ally using drone attacks against you in the febrile atmosphere of pakistani politics exacerbated in this parliament by the opposition s belief that the prime minister was selected by the military rather than elected by the people it must count as something of a victory for khan that his remarks on america seemed to energize the house but then anti americanism has always been a popular rallying call for sartaj aziz who served in the previous administration as adviser to the prime minister on foreign affairs it is also an effective way of diverting the agenda from khan s domestic failings imran s stock is falling and he sees this as a way of elevating himself he told the nation aziz also suggested that khan might have been lashing out at having been seemingly slighted by the biden administration even though he became president in january joe biden has apparently yet to make contact with khan and senior members of the us cabinet have repeatedly skipped pakistan in their visits to the region just last week khan s us educated national security adviser moeed yusuf appeared to bristle at suggestions that islamabad was being snubbed by washington if they don t want to speak to us it s up to them no one here is waiting for their phone call but while the us has yet to reach out to the khan government it has contacted the pakistan military back in may the us charge d affairs to pakistan angela aggeler met with chief of army staff general qamar javed bajwa to discuss matters of mutual interest and the possibility of strengthening ties in the aftermath of khan s incendiary speech to parliament some observers have even begun to speculate that the prime minister is trying to show the people that he is still calling the shots whether or not this leads to the kind of protracted tussle between the political and military spheres that resulted in the ouster of former prime minister nawaz sharif only time will tell but what is certain is that the failure of the biden administration to reach out has allowed khan and his government to paint the united states as a cynical and exploitative superpower prone to pathological displays of irrationality speaking about general musharraf s decision to join the war on terror khan said at the time we were told that america was angry and that like a wounded bear it could throw its claw anywhere i used to ask repeatedly what business we had getting involved in that war al qaeda and the militant taliban were in afghanistan not here pakistan s relationship with america has been placed in sharp focus by the news that the united states is on the verge of withdrawing its forces from afghanistan something that has led many in pakistan to draw parallels with the end of the soviet afghan war islamabad believes with some justification that it was left to deal with the blowback of the mujahideen and the resultant refugee crisis that enveloped the region the subsequent us invasion of afghanistan catalyzed by the attacks on the world trade center in 2001 made pakistan a frontline state in the war on terror according to khan i asked repeatedly what we had to do with that war he said does any country get involved in another s war and lose 70 000 lives what they said we kept on doing musharraf said in his book that he took money and sent people to guantánamo bay in a lately resurfaced interview from january 2002 however khan appears to defend musharraf s decision to join forces with america bearing in mind how opinion has changed since september 11 i do not think the president had much choice i think in the circumstances this is the best he could have done still what is clear despite the u turn is that khan is planning to fight the next election on an anti america platform buoyed no doubt by the exploits of his foreign minister shah mehmood qureshi who was given a hero s welcome on his return to pakistan after he accused israel of having deep pockets in a cnn interview it would appear that khan s strategy is to position himself as an islamic leader albeit one that doesn t seem terribly interested in the plight of the uighurs at odds with the west and american imperialism whether that will be enough to persuade voters disenchanted with his domestic performance remains to be seen at the moment it would appear unlikely but a week is a long time in politics and the next election is not for a couple of years the article was published in the nation us
america is in celebratory mode states are dropping covid 19 restrictions plane travel is breaking records and many americans are gearing up to celebrate summer as if the last year plus of pandemic madness never happened many people are experiencing a relief they ve been vaccinated and are able to gather again with others said psychologist kristen carpenter who is director of women s behavioral health at the ohio state university wexner medical center yet the pandemic isn t truly over the highly contagious delta variant of covid 19 is sweeping through unvaccinated communities and there is worry that even the vaccinated among us are at risk it s not like somebody put a period on the sentence and we re done with this pandemic we really don t know what s ahead said stress management expert dr cynthia ackrill an editor for the magazine contentment produced by the american institute of stress that s not all violent crime is up historic heat waves are devastating areas of the country not prepared to cope and mental health practitioners can t keep up with the demand for services i think for many people this return to normal feels awfully abrupt and jarring carpenter said adding that the pandemic has been an incredibly difficult period with lots of opportunity for confusion for disagreement and for discord she continued it s a real mixed bag while many will experience much of this reopening as positive there is a subset of people that will really struggle with how to move out of this very challenging time blame the brain if you are tense or anxious about reentering today s so called normal experts say that s understandable blame it on your brain especially your frontal lobe where you do your higher level thinking we ve just expended enormous energy navigating this whole pandemic constantly with loved ones hypervigilant going to the store and that takes extra brainpower ackrill said when your frontal lobe is tired from doing emotional regulation on steroids for a year and a half you re not as good at it she added you could even be at your breaking point if however you find yourself giddy with relief and ready to act as if there was no pandemic to worry about that too makes neurological sense said dr bruce wexler a senior research scientist in psychiatry at yale school of medicine humans are the only animals that shape the environment that shapes our brains and we function and feel better when there s a fit between the two said wexler who has studied brain plasticity for more than 35 years every day we strive to renew ourselves by reconnecting with the familiar faces and places that shaped us and are inside of us that s one of the reasons people were so agitated about wanting to go back to their favorite bars and hangouts wexler added when he realized that motivation wexler said i had more sympathy for the people who were complaining open up open up i could understand their urgency it s time for compassion safely getting back to normal in whatever shape that currently looks like will require being fully vaccinated and adhering to the latest social distancing requirements of local communities and businesses according to the us centers for disease control and prevention coping with anxiety tension or worry about risky pandemic behaviors both our own and those of other people will take a combination of self care and compassion experts say we all have to give ourselves a little grace carpenter said it s really important that we try not to judge ourselves for our emotional response to this change this is objectively really stressful and to have some combination of relief happiness fear or maybe even some anger and frustration is normal it s just as important to show compassion to those around us who are navigating their own reactions to change ackrill said she tells a story of being on a walk while wearing a mask when a woman came close to her and began yelling i m not wearing a mask and i m never wearing a mask i ignored her i had longer legs and walked faster she charged after me again yelling at me and then coughed in my direction on purpose ackrill continued and it just floored me because i thought this is probably a woman whose friends and relatives would be appalled by her behavior and it was her fear coming out fear of feeling out of control and wanting so badly to control things by seeing the woman s behavior through compassionate eyes ackrill was able to calm her own reaction and reduce her stress self compassion and giving compassion don t make us more vulnerable they make us stronger she said so when you re feeling heightened emotions such as anxiety or even anger about someone s risky behavior calm yourself and have some compassion for yourself and that other person taking stock of your emotions like all things this pandemic too shall pass but how well we weather it will be based on our actions experts say recognizing and taking stock of our emotions addressing those and then giving ourselves a little grace are essential to moving forward productively in ways that protect and enhance our well being carpenter said do a wellness check in ask yourself am i protecting my sleep am i eating right am i getting some kind of physical activity into each and every week it s back to basic self care carpenter said many of us have developed great habits with our time at home but many of us evolved into bad habits it s time for a check in do the same for your emotions we have to be more mindful give ourselves time and space to assess how we re doing psychologically and emotionally carpenter said it s important to set aside time to disconnect unplug from all the various things we are now plugged into and ask how am i feeling she advises her patients to begin tracking their activities mood and energy over the course of each day including weekends for at least two weeks is there a rhythm to the way i feel to my stress to my energy level to my mood lots of us don t notice we are struggling until we re kind of halfway or maybe three quarters of the way there she said once you start to notice what that rhythm is you can start to implement change for the better recharge your energy the next step is to plug in activities that you find rewarding and give you a greater sense of well being carpenter advised activities that give a sense of mastery or accomplishment are natural mood boosters reduce stress and help ultimately enhance well being for some that might be social contact for others it might be time spent alone doing hobbies reading or listening to music and don t forget laughing at silly jokes or upbeat movies carpenter said humor is really important you know so engaging with media that does lift the spirits can help she said and of course physical activity is a natural sort of mood enhancer such as walking in nature when to reach for help not everyone will be able to cope with a return to normalcy without assistance for all too many people the past year and a half has been filled with unbearable loss grief and anguish how can you tell if you need professional help with your feelings and concerns anxiety having difficulty concentrating poor sleep restlessness and irritability are signs that anxiety may be taking over your life in an unhealthy way according to the american psychological association persistent or excessive worry about your health or finances often feeling overwhelmed by emotions and a general sense that something bad is going to happen are more signals you re exhausted more irritable and you ve lost the ability to recover between bouts of worry or your anxiety is intruding on your everyday function ackrill said panic attacks at times anxiety can spiral out of control leaving you in a full fledged panic attack you may feel as if you re having a heart attack your heart rate may speed up or pound in your chest you may tremble sweat feel like you re choking or have shortness of breath and feelings of dread such attacks can happen suddenly without warning and leave some people fearful about when the next episode will occur which can cause them to change or restrict their normal activities the apa said depression this condition often begins with a lack of energy and interest or pleasure in daily activities you may develop an inability to concentrate and feel worthless or guilty about an action or the lack thereof paradoxically you can experience significant weight loss or gain a lot of weight you can also either sleep all the time or develop insomnia and sleep little you may even begin to think of death or suicide signs of suicidal thoughts often triggered by a recent loss through death divorce or separation many of the signs that a person is at risk for suicide duplicate those of depression and anxiety a loss of interest in friends or hobbies changes in sleep patterns eating habits and personality low self esteem sadness withdrawal irritability and feelings of guilt or worthlessness people who are at risk for suicide may begin behaving erratically and talk about dying or harming themselves they may show no hope for the future believing things will never get better or nothing will change according to the apa where to find help first look to the people in your own life who can be supportive and can help you experts say there are also federal state and local resources the substance abuse and mental health services administration or samhsa has a national helpline 800 662 help 4357 which provides free confidential treatment referral and information in english and spanish 24 7 every day of the year the american psychological association also has a webpage of resources for suicide substance abuse and domestic violence of course if the situation is potentially life threatening get immediate emergency assistance by calling 911 if you have health insurance many clinics and therapists are offering phone or video telehealth visits many employers are offering free access to therapists as part of their employee benefit plans and many communities have mental health centers with sliding scale fees it s ok to not feel ok and to not know what to do about it but do know there are resources out there ackrill said many people don t choose to go to therapy experts said because they believe that makes them weak or feel it would be too invasive the general public does not understand what therapy means said eve byrd director of the mental health program at the carter center in a may 2020 online forum they might say oh my gosh i am not going to be laying on a couch telling my deepest darkest thoughts that s frightening she said but that s not what therapy is byrd added therapy is really an educational activity she said adding that a therapist s role is to help you think about different ways to react to situations and more positive ways of interacting with individuals ___ how anxiety and depression rates changed in every state during covid 19

san francisco and suzhou china july 5 2021 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer metabolic autoimmune and other major diseases and laekna therapeutics shanghai co ltd laekna an emerging innovative pharma company based in china s zhangjiang pharma valley and new jersey in the u s focusing on developing new ground breaking innovative therapies to treat cancer and liver diseases today jointly announced they have entered into a collaboration agreement to evaluate the combination of innovent s pd 1 inhibitor sintilimab and laekna s pan akt kinase inhibitor afuresertib under the agreement the two companies will work together to conduct clinical studies assessing the combination of sintilimab and afuresertib lae002 in patients with multiple types of solid tumors that have been refractory or failed to respond to treatment with pd 1 pd l1 inhibitors the trials will evaluate the safety pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of the combination therapy an investigational new drug ind application will soon be filed with the national medical products administration nmpa in china dr hui zhou senior vice president of clinical development of innovent said since our inception in 2011 innovent has built a robust pipeline of assets with five innovative drugs approved for marketing many unmet medical needs still exist for cancer patients around the world to help address this innovent explores multiple indications and combinations of therapies when developing its existing and new drug candidates at the same time we seek to work together with additional collaborative partners as the chinese biopharmaceutical industry continues to rapidly expand innovent is impressed with laekna s r d pipeline and research team and we look forward to our close collaboration and future possibilities produced by this clinical development agreement dr yue yong chief medical officer of laekna stated we hope our leading pipeline candidate afuresertib can potentially become a first in class targeted treatment in multiple types of cancer by demonstrating improved efficacy and acceptable safety in clinical trials notably sintilimab was included in china s national reimbursement drug list nrdl in 2019 as the first pd 1 inhibitor and the only pd 1 inhibitor to be included in the list that year in addition sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy is currently being reviewed by the u s fda for a potential bla approval in the first line treatment of nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer we now have the opportunity to explore the combination therapy of afuresertib and sintilimab in multiple types of solid tumors with a particular focus on cancers that have commonly shown to be refractory to treatment with pd 1 pd l1 inhibitors we hope this combination therapy demonstrates results that can ultimately lead to it becoming a new treatment option for people with these difficult to treat cancers about sintilimab sintilimab marketed as tyvyt sintilimab injection in china is an innovative pd 1 inhibitor with global quality standards jointly developed by innovent and eli lilly and company sintilimab is an immunoglobulin g4 monoclonal antibody which binds to pd 1 molecules on the surface of t cells blocks the pd 1 pd ligand 1 pd l1 pathway and reactivates t cells to kill cancer cells innovent is currently conducting more than 20 clinical studies of sintilimab to evaluate its safety and efficacy in a wide variety of cancer indications including more than 10 registrational or pivotal clinical trials in china sintilimab has been approved for four indications including the treatment of relapsed or refractory classic hodgkin s lymphoma after two lines or later of systemic chemotherapy in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first line treatment of nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer in combination with gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy for the first line treatment of squamous non small cell lung cancer in combination with byvasda bevacizumab biosimilar injection for the first line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma additionally innovent currently has a regulatory submission under review in china for sintilimab for the second line treatment of squamous non small cell lung cancer innovent also has two clinical studies of sintilimab that have met their primary endpoints in combination with cisplatin plus paclitaxel or cisplatin plus 5 fluorouracil for the first line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma the second line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in may 2021 the u s fda accepted for review the biologics license application bla for sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first line treatment of nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer sintilimab was included in china s national reimbursement drug list nrdl in 2019 as the first pd 1 inhibitor and the only pd 1 included in the list in that year about afuresertib lae002 afuresertib lae002 is an oral small molecule pan akt kinase inhibitor it has been investigated in over 10 phase 1 2 clinical trials including ovarian cancer gastric cancer multiple myeloma and melanoma these studies have demonstrated that afuresertib has strong anti cancer activities and a tolerable safety profile in these studies in recent years akt a serine threonine protein kinase has emerged as an important mechanism in oncology as it plays an important role in regulating various cell functions such as metabolism survival proliferation tissue invasion and chemotherapy resistance pten deletion and akt pik3ca alteration may lead to excessive activation of the akt signaling pathways which is one of the key drivers for cancer growth the increased activation of the akt signaling pathway is particularly common in recurrent ovarian cancer breast cancer and prostate cancer the global randomized open label multi center phase 2 profecta ii clinical trial of afuresertib is the world s first registration directed clinical study of a pan akt kinase inhibitor to treat platinum resistant ovarian cancer laekna currently expects primary results of the endpoints will be available in 2022 and will discuss the data with regulatory authorities if the study outcome supports it about innovent inspired by the spirit of start with integrity succeed through action innovent s mission

the australian wine sector has rebounded from two successive small vintages to produce a record crop of 2 03 million tonnes in 2021 after a season characterised by near perfect growing and ripening conditions across most states and regions according to the national vintage report 2021 released today by wine australia wine australia general manager corporate affairs and regulation rachel triggs said 2021 was being described as a unicorn vintage because of the rare combination of events leading to both exceptional quality and a good crop size good fruit set plenty of water at the right time lack of heatwaves low disease pressure and favourable harvest conditions have resulted in a high yielding high quality vintage triggs said the 2021 crush was 31 per cent higher than the 2020 vintage and 19 above the 2019 vintage the larger crush balanced out the two previous small vintages with the average of the three being closely in line with the 10 year average of 1 74 million tonnes figure 1 south australia was the largest contributor of the states with an estimated harvest of 1 06 million tonnes 52 of the national total followed by new south wales with 580 875 tonnes 29 and victoria with 334 834 tonnes 17 this vintage provides an opportunity for depleted inventory levels to be restored ensuring we have the supply we need to take up new export opportunities triggs said red grapes made up 57 of the crush comprising 1 16 million tonnes an increase of 37 over the previous year the white varieties comprised 864 946 tonnes an increase of 25 overall white variety s share of the crush reduced to 43 the lowest since 2004 the main contributor to the increase in red crush was shiraz up by 41 to a record 538 402 tonnes this saw its share increase by one percentage point to 46 of all red varieties and 27 of the total crush the total value of the crush at the weighbridge increased by more than 400 million 36 to 1 56 billion with the increased crop size amplified by a small increase in overall average value up by 1 to 701 per tonne this was the highest since 2008 the overall increase was made up of a 4 decrease in the average value of reds to 833 per tonne offset by an 11 increase in the average value of whites to 538 per tonne figure 2 triggs said that concerns prior to vintage about the effect on grape prices of the tariffs imposed by the chinese government on australian wine had not been realised in 2021 however she noted that the overall increase partly reflected growth in the contribution of higher priced fruit to the average that s not to say that some producers aren t doing it tough exposure to china is very variable from one producer to another depending on their ability to diversify cash flow and the ability to physically hold stock and it will take producers some time to bounce back which could also have flow on effects for growers triggs said in a note of caution triggs said that the average value for red varieties had declined in 2021 for the first time since 2014 while whites had continued to increase in value indicating that demand is now shifting towards whites to make the most of our opportunities in markets such as the united states and the united kingdom the balance in supply between red and white winegrapes may need to change we are working closely with austrade to grow our exports in emerging asian wine markets such as south korea taiwan and thailand where there has been strong growth in recent times and where consumers strongly favour red wine triggs said are you a daily wine news subscriber if not click here to join our mailing list it s free

america is in celebratory mode states are dropping covid 19 restrictions plane travel is breaking records and many americans are gearing up to celebrate summer as if the last year plus of pandemic madness never happened many people are experiencing a relief they ve been vaccinated and are able to gather again with others said psychologist kristen carpenter who is director of women s behavioral health at the ohio state university wexner medical center yet the pandemic isn t truly over the highly contagious delta variant of covid 19 is sweeping through unvaccinated communities and there is worry that even the vaccinated among us are at risk it s not like somebody put a period on the sentence and we re done with this pandemic we really don t know what s ahead said stress management expert dr cynthia ackrill an editor for the magazine contentment produced by the american institute of stress that s not all violent crime is up historic heat waves are devastating areas of the country not prepared to cope and mental health practitioners can t keep up with the demand for services i think for many people this return to normal feels awfully abrupt and jarring carpenter said adding that the pandemic has been an incredibly difficult period with lots of opportunity for confusion for disagreement and for discord she continued it s a real mixed bag while many will experience much of this reopening as positive there is a subset of people that will really struggle with how to move out of this very challenging time blame the brain if you are tense or anxious about reentering today s so called normal experts say that s understandable blame it on your brain especially your frontal lobe where you do your higher level thinking we ve just expended enormous energy navigating this whole pandemic constantly with loved ones hypervigilant going to the store and that takes extra brainpower ackrill said when your frontal lobe is tired from doing emotional regulation on steroids for a year and a half you re not as good at it she added you could even be at your breaking point if however you find yourself giddy with relief and ready to act as if there was no pandemic to worry about that too makes neurological sense said dr bruce wexler a senior research scientist in psychiatry at yale school of medicine humans are the only animals that shape the environment that shapes our brains and we function and feel better when there s a fit between the two said wexler who has studied brain plasticity for more than 35 years every day we strive to renew ourselves by reconnecting with the familiar faces and places that shaped us and are inside of us that s one of the reasons people were so agitated about wanting to go back to their favorite bars and hangouts wexler added when he realized that motivation wexler said i had more sympathy for the people who were complaining open up open up i could understand their urgency it s time for compassion safely getting back to normal in whatever shape that currently looks like will require being fully vaccinated and adhering to the latest social distancing requirements of local communities and businesses according to the us centers for disease control and prevention coping with anxiety tension or worry about risky pandemic behaviors both our own and those of other people will take a combination of self care and compassion experts say we all have to give ourselves a little grace carpenter said it s really important that we try not to judge ourselves for our emotional response to this change this is objectively really stressful and to have some combination of relief happiness fear or maybe even some anger and frustration is normal it s just as important to show compassion to those around us who are navigating their own reactions to change ackrill said she tells a story of being on a walk while wearing a mask when a woman came close to her and began yelling i m not wearing a mask and i m never wearing a mask i ignored her i had longer legs and walked faster she charged after me again yelling at me and then coughed in my direction on purpose ackrill continued and it just floored me because i thought this is probably a woman whose friends and relatives would be appalled by her behavior and it was her fear coming out fear of feeling out of control and wanting so badly to control things by seeing the woman s behavior through compassionate eyes ackrill was able to calm her own reaction and reduce her stress self compassion and giving compassion don t make us more vulnerable they make us stronger she said so when you re feeling heightened emotions such as anxiety or even anger about someone s risky behavior calm yourself and have some compassion for yourself and that other person taking stock of your emotions like all things this pandemic too shall pass but how well we weather it will be based on our actions experts say recognizing and taking stock of our emotions addressing those and then giving ourselves a little grace are essential to moving forward productively in ways that protect and enhance our well being carpenter said do a wellness check in ask yourself am i protecting my sleep am i eating right am i getting some kind of physical activity into each and every week it s back to basic self care carpenter said many of us have developed great habits with our time at home but many of us evolved into bad habits it s time for a check in do the same for your emotions we have to be more mindful give ourselves time and space to assess how we re doing psychologically and emotionally carpenter said it s important to set aside time to disconnect unplug from all the various things we are now plugged into and ask how am i feeling she advises her patients to begin tracking their activities mood and energy over the course of each day including weekends for at least two weeks is there a rhythm to the way i feel to my stress to my energy level to my mood lots of us don t notice we are struggling until we re kind of halfway or maybe three quarters of the way there she said once you start to notice what that rhythm is you can start to implement change for the better recharge your energy the next step is to plug in activities that you find rewarding and give you a greater sense of well being carpenter advised activities that give a sense of mastery or accomplishment are natural mood boosters reduce stress and help ultimately enhance well being for some that might be social contact for others it might be time spent alone doing hobbies reading or listening to music and don t forget laughing at silly jokes or upbeat movies carpenter said humor is really important you know so engaging with media that does lift the spirits can help she said and of course physical activity is a natural sort of mood enhancer such as walking in nature when to reach for help not everyone will be able to cope with a return to normalcy without assistance for all too many people the past year and a half has been filled with unbearable loss grief and anguish how can you tell if you need professional help with your feelings and concerns anxiety having difficulty concentrating poor sleep restlessness and irritability are signs that anxiety may be taking over your life in an unhealthy way according to the american psychological association persistent or excessive worry about your health or finances often feeling overwhelmed by emotions and a general sense that something bad is going to happen are more signals you re exhausted more irritable and you ve lost the ability to recover between bouts of worry or your anxiety is intruding on your everyday function ackrill said panic attacks at times anxiety can spiral out of control leaving you in a full fledged panic attack you may feel as if you re having a heart attack your heart rate may speed up or pound in your chest you may tremble sweat feel like you re choking or have shortness of breath and feelings of dread such attacks can happen suddenly without warning and leave some people fearful about when the next episode will occur which can cause them to change or restrict their normal activities the apa said depression this condition often begins with a lack of energy and interest or pleasure in daily activities you may develop an inability to concentrate and feel worthless or guilty about an action or the lack thereof paradoxically you can experience significant weight loss or gain a lot of weight you can also either sleep all the time or develop insomnia and sleep little you may even begin to think of death or suicide signs of suicidal thoughts often triggered by a recent loss through death divorce or separation many of the signs that a person is at risk for suicide duplicate those of depression and anxiety a loss of interest in friends or hobbies changes in sleep patterns eating habits and personality low self esteem sadness withdrawal irritability and feelings

tris rating affirms the company rating on amata corporation plc amata and the ratings on amata s senior unsecured debentures at a with a stable outlook the ratings continue to reflect the company s proven record as one of the leading industrial estate developers in thailand the company s strengths are underpinned by its sizable base of recurring revenues from the sale of utility services and dividend income from its investments in several power plants nevertheless the ratings are constrained by the company s elevated leverage coupled with the country and regulatory risks associated with amata s overseas operations the ratings also take into consideration the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 pandemic which has brought about a significant decline in investment activities as well as thailand s slow pace of economic recovery key rating considerations sluggish land sale amid prolonged covid 19 outbreak travel restriction measures and economic fallout during the covid 19 pandemic have led to a significant decline in investment activities and a slump in industrial land sales the volume of amata s land sale in thailand declined significantly to 213 rai in 2020 and 36 rai in the first quarter of 2021 from 600 800 rai per year in 2018 2019 in our view amata s industrial land sales will likely continue under pressure throughout the remainder of this year the growth outlook in 2021 is likely to remain sluggish owing to the prolonged and escalated covid 19 outbreak coupled with the state quarantine requirement for foreign visitors however we expect clearer signs of recovery in 2022 when a certain degree of herd immunity should have been achieved according to the country s vaccination plan together with an easing of travel restrictions and a resumption of normal investment activities our base case forecast projects amata s land presales in thailand of around 300 rai in 2021 before bouncing back to the pre covid level of 550 700 rai annually in 2022 2023 revenue from land transfers in thailand is projected to reach thb1 4 billion in 2021 and elevate to thb1 6 thb2 3 billion per year in 2022 2023 for the medium term we hold the view that amata will benefit from the eastern economic corridor eec development plan on the back of its plentiful land banks totaling about 12 000 rai in rayong and chonburi provinces we also expect the demand for industrial estates in thailand to benefit from the trend of relocation of production bases resulting from the united states china trade tensions additionally the company s strategy to focus on new s curve industries and develop smart city as well as its policy to grow with partners from several countries should improve the company s operating performance in the long term higher revenue contributions from vietnam expected we expect higher revenue contributions from the company s vietnam operations from 2022 onwards after a long delay in the license approval process over the past few years the volume of amata s land sales in vietnam was in the range of 0 40 rai annually in 2018 2020 compared with 220 rai in 2017 the falloff in sales was due to a depletion of available land in the company s first industrial estate compounded by delays in the license approval process for new industrial estates however there are signs of progress at amata s new industrial estate in northern vietnam amata city halong achl following the sale of 204 rai of land in the first quarter of 2021 the company expects land transfers and revenue recognition from this industrial estate to commence in late 2021 we view the business prospects for industrial estate development in vietnam to be promising propelled by the country s low labor costs and proximity to china as well as benefits from the country s free trade agreements with major economies amata has a good number of potential land sale transactions in the pipeline but has been held back by regulatory changes and delays in the license approval process several of amata s projects are in the process of applying for investment certificates and construction licenses further delays in the approval process could cause significant disruptions to the company s revenue stream in the future in our base case forecast we project the volume of amata s land sales in vietnam to reach around 200 400 rai per annum over the next three years revenues from land sales are forecast to be thb0 7 billion thb2 7 billion per year over the same period leverage to rise moderately ongoing expansion over the past few years has pushed amata s leverage up adjusted net debt rose significantly to thb14 2 billion at the end of march 2021 from thb11 5 billion in 2019 the debt to capitalization ratio was 43 2 in 2020 and 42 1 at the end of march 2021 up from 40 5 in 2019 the ratio of adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda surged to 6 4 times in 2020 and 7 times in the first quarter of 2021 from 4 2 times in 2019 going forward we expect amata s leverage to increase further due to the large investments ahead amata needs to acquire and develop new sites in thailand at the same time the company plans to develop several industrial estates abroad in vietnam and the lao people s democratic republic lao pdr we forecast amata s capital expenditure to be around thb4 thb7 billion per annum over the next three years based on our projections ebitda should remain around thb2 1 thb3 billion per year during 2021 2023 the adjusted net debt to ebitda ratio is forecast to be 6 7 times during the next three years while total debt to capitalization could jump to 48 during the same period the ebitda interest coverage ratio should stay at 3 3 4 1 times during 2021 2023 as of march 2021 amata s debt consisted of thb7 0 billion of priority debt out of its total interest bearing debt of thb15 5 billion most of amata s priority debts is unsecured debt at the subsidiaries level as its priority debt is below the threshold of 50 we view that amata s unsecured creditors are broadly not significantly disadvantaged with respect to the priority of claim against the company s operating assets recurring revenue provides some cushion against slowdown amata s strong business profile is underpinned by steady growth from the revenue it earns from utility services utility services are a stable revenue source that can partially offset fluctuations in land sales utility services include supplying raw water processed water and wastewater treatment revenue from utility services rose to thb1 8 billion in 2020 44 of total revenue from thb1 3 billion in 2013 17 of total revenue driven by an increase in the number of customers and rising demand from new power plants located in amata s industrial estates however revenue from utility services has been adversely affected by the covid 19 some manufacturers have decided to temporarily halt or scale down their operations in the wake of the pandemic the thb1 8 billion revenue from utility services in 2020 was a decline by 5 2 from the previous year and further slipped by 0 5 year on year y o y to thb0 5 billion in the first quarter of 2021 nevertheless we maintain the view that the prospects for utility services remain strong we expect the recurring revenue to recover in late 2021 dividends from power business provide highly predictable cash flow amata receives highly predictable dividend income from a number of joint investments with b grimm power ltd in power generation the company has a total installed power generation capacity of 260 megawatts mw proportionate to its stakes in the power generation plants amata through a joint venture jv also holds a 4 0 equity stake in amata b grimm power plant infrastructure fund abpif which owns two power plants in chonburi province over the next three years investments in the power business are expected to yield dividends totaling bt0 4 billion per year manageable liquidity we assess amata s liquidity to be manageable over the next 12 months as of march 2021 amata s sources of funds consisted of thb2 6 billion in cash on hand plus short term investments we project funds from operations ffo to be around thb1 4 billion over the next 12 months the company has undrawn credit facilities of around thb2 6 billion primary uses of funds are debt repayments of thb1 3 billion and capital expenditures of thb4 billion we expect the company to maintain sufficient liquidity to weather potential business slowdown until business recovery is on a firm and sustainable path the financial covenant on amata s debentures requires the company to maintain its interest bearing debt to equity ratio below 2 5 times as of march 2021 amata s interest bearing debt to equity ratio was 0 8 times we expect the company will remain in compliance with this covenant over the forecast period base case assumptions total operating revenue to increase by 17 to thb5 1 billion in 2021 and range from thb7 0 thb7 4 billion annually in 2022 2023 gross profit margin is forecast at 48 while the ebitda margin should stay around 40 42 total capital spending to range from thb4 thb7 billion per annum during 2021 2023 rating outlook the stable outlook reflects tris rating s expectation that amata will be able to maintain its leading position in the domestic industrial property industry we expect the recurring income from the utility service business dividend from the power plants and income from rental properties to provide significant cushion against the adverse effect of unfavourable economic environment rating sensitivities amata s could be upgraded if the company is able to lower its leverage with the net debt to ebitda ratio staying below 4 times on a sustained basis and increase the revenue contribution from its vietnam and or other overseas operations on the contrary amata s ratings could be downgraded if the company s leverage rises to the extent of the adjusted net debt to ebitda ratio remains above 8 times for an extended period company overview amata was founded in 1989 by mr vikrom kromadit chief executive officer and listed on the stock exchange of thailand in 1997 since the company s inception the kromadit family has been the main shareholder and is actively involved in the management of amata the kromadit family held approximately 25 9 of the

private markets encompass both real assets such as real estate and infrastructure as well as the debt and equity of privately owned companies established in 1990 the otpp is already a high profile investor some of its biggest investments include white city place a creative campus in west london and the ritz carlton in toronto complex it recently bought caruna in finland a utility business and evoltz in brazil an electricity transmission business international investor however mr taylor said its deepening drive into private markets would lift the weighting the fund has to regions beyond north america from its current 30 per cent with europe and asia a particular focus under the plan 50 per cent of future private investments will be made outside north america this is a major departure from our current portfolio where some 70 per cent of our assets are based in canada and the usa mr taylor said we want to be an international investor institutional investors including pension funds typically use bonds and equities as the two building blocks of their portfolios with an investment horizon tied to the often long term nature of their liabilities advertisement however analysts say that a combination of low bond yields and expected lower gains from stock markets will force more pension funds to shift allocations to private markets including credit and private equity where returns can be higher but assets are typically less liquid we expect asset owners including pension funds to continue raising allocations to the private markets said michael cyprys an analyst covering brokers asset managers and exchanges at morgan stanley when it comes to the businesses we invest in we try to be thoughtful jo taylor otpp president and ceo mr taylor who took over as head of otpp in 2020 earlier this year unveiled plans to be bolder and bigger with investments in an effort to meet its target expanding its assets to c300 billion by 2030 an amount it calculates is needed to remain fully funded headquartered in toronto otpp also operates out of london singapore toronto hong kong alongside smaller operations in new york and san francisco given the planned allocation to private markets the fund is expanding its in house investing team we need the skills in house to make sure that we continue to perform at a really high level to make sure we get the returns to reach the c300 billion target taking the right amount of risk mr taylor said advertisement addressing asia mr taylor said we do see strong growth there and would probably like to increase our exposure there over time but that s not to say we don t still see great returns and growth in north america the us market has been really successful for us for a long time you can see with some of the stimulus there will probably be good growth coming through too despite criticism of china s human rights record the canadian fund has been increasing its investments there including in the country s education and tech sectors there are issues around the world in terms of the political agenda of governments mr taylor said when it comes to the businesses we invest in we try to be thoughtful but our requirement is to look around the world and say how do we get to a balanced portfolio internationally of c200 billion to c300 billion and it is probably quite challenging to do that if countries like china are excluded completely financial times

america is in celebratory mode states are dropping covid 19 restrictions plane travel is breaking records and many americans are gearing up to celebrate summer as if the last year plus of pandemic madness never happened many people are experiencing a relief they ve been vaccinated and are able to gather again with others said psychologist kristen carpenter who is director of women s behavioral health at the ohio state university wexner medical center yet the pandemic isn t truly over the highly contagious delta variant of covid 19 is sweeping through unvaccinated communities and there is worry that even the vaccinated among us are at risk it s not like somebody put a period on the sentence and we re done with this pandemic we really don t know what s ahead said stress management expert dr cynthia ackrill an editor for the magazine contentment produced by the american institute of stress that s not all violent crime is up historic heat waves are devastating areas of the country not prepared to cope and mental health practitioners can t keep up with the demand for services i think for many people this return to normal feels awfully abrupt and jarring carpenter said adding that the pandemic has been an incredibly difficult period with lots of opportunity for confusion for disagreement and for discord she continued it s a real mixed bag while many will experience much of this reopening as positive there is a subset of people that will really struggle with how to move out of this very challenging time blame the brain if you are tense or anxious about reentering today s so called normal experts say that s understandable blame it on your brain especially your frontal lobe where you do your higher level thinking we ve just expended enormous energy navigating this whole pandemic constantly with loved ones hypervigilant going to the store and that takes extra brainpower ackrill said when your frontal lobe is tired from doing emotional regulation on steroids for a year and a half you re not as good at it she added you could even be at your breaking point if however you find yourself giddy with relief and ready to act as if there was no pandemic to worry about that too makes neurological sense said dr bruce wexler a senior research scientist in psychiatry at yale school of medicine humans are the only animals that shape the environment that shapes our brains and we function and feel better when there s a fit between the two said wexler who has studied brain plasticity for more than 35 years every day we strive to renew ourselves by reconnecting with the familiar faces and places that shaped us and are inside of us that s one of the reasons people were so agitated about wanting to go back to their favorite bars and hangouts wexler added when he realized that motivation wexler said i had more sympathy for the people who were complaining open up open up i could understand their urgency it s time for compassion safely getting back to normal in whatever shape that currently looks like will require being fully vaccinated and adhering to the latest social distancing requirements of local communities and businesses according to the us centers for disease control and prevention coping with anxiety tension or worry about risky pandemic behaviors both our own and those of other people will take a combination of self care and compassion experts say we all have to give ourselves a little grace carpenter said it s really important that we try not to judge ourselves for our emotional response to this change this is objectively really stressful and to have some combination of relief happiness fear or maybe even some anger and frustration is normal it s just as important to show compassion to those around us who are navigating their own reactions to change ackrill said she tells a story of being on a walk while wearing a mask when a woman came close to her and began yelling i m not wearing a mask and i m never wearing a mask i ignored her i had longer legs and walked faster she charged after me again yelling at me and then coughed in my direction on purpose ackrill continued and it just floored me because i thought this is probably a woman whose friends and relatives would be appalled by her behavior and it was her fear coming out fear of feeling out of control and wanting so badly to control things by seeing the woman s behavior through compassionate eyes ackrill was able to calm her own reaction and reduce her stress self compassion and giving compassion don t make us more vulnerable they make us stronger she said so when you re feeling heightened emotions such as anxiety or even anger about someone s risky behavior calm yourself and have some compassion for yourself and that other person taking stock of your emotions like all things this pandemic too shall pass but how well we weather it will be based on our actions experts say recognizing and taking stock of our emotions addressing those and then giving ourselves a little grace are essential to moving forward productively in ways that protect and enhance our well being carpenter said do a wellness check in ask yourself am i protecting my sleep am i eating right am i getting some kind of physical activity into each and every week it s back to basic self care carpenter said many of us have developed great habits with our time at home but many of us evolved into bad habits it s time for a check in do the same for your emotions we have to be more mindful give ourselves time and space to assess how we re doing psychologically and emotionally carpenter said it s important to set aside time to disconnect unplug from all the various things we are now plugged into and ask how am i feeling she advises her patients to begin tracking their activities mood and energy over the course of each day including weekends for at least two weeks is there a rhythm to the way i feel to my stress to my energy level to my mood lots of us don t notice we are struggling until we re kind of halfway or maybe three quarters of the way there she said once you start to notice what that rhythm is you can start to implement change for the better recharge your energy the next step is to plug in activities that you find rewarding and give you a greater sense of well being carpenter advised activities that give a sense of mastery or accomplishment are natural mood boosters reduce stress and help ultimately enhance well being for some that might be social contact for others it might be time spent alone doing hobbies reading or listening to music and don t forget laughing at silly jokes or upbeat movies carpenter said humor is really important you know so engaging with media that does lift the spirits can help she said and of course physical activity is a natural sort of mood enhancer such as walking in nature when to reach for help not everyone will be able to cope with a return to normalcy without assistance for all too many people the past year and a half has been filled with unbearable loss grief and anguish how can you tell if you need professional help with your feelings and concerns anxiety having difficulty concentrating poor sleep restlessness and irritability are signs that anxiety may be taking over your life in an unhealthy way according to the american psychological association persistent or excessive worry about your health or finances often feeling overwhelmed by emotions and a general sense that something bad is going to happen are more signals you re exhausted more irritable and you ve lost the ability to recover between bouts of worry or your anxiety is intruding on your everyday function ackrill said panic attacks at times anxiety can spiral out of control leaving you in a full fledged panic attack you may feel as if you re having a heart attack your heart rate may speed up or pound in your chest you may tremble sweat feel like you re choking or have shortness of breath and feelings of dread such attacks can happen suddenly without warning and leave some people fearful about when the next episode will occur which can cause them to change or restrict their normal activities the apa said depression this condition often begins with a lack of energy and interest or pleasure in daily activities you may develop an inability to concentrate and feel worthless or guilty about an action or the lack thereof paradoxically you can experience significant weight loss or gain a lot of weight you can also either sleep all the time or develop insomnia and sleep little you may even begin to think of death or suicide signs of suicidal thoughts often triggered by a recent loss through death divorce or separation many of the signs that a person is at risk for suicide duplicate those of depression and anxiety a loss of interest in friends or hobbies changes in sleep patterns eating habits and personality low self esteem sadness withdrawal irritability and feelings of guilt or worthlessness people who are at risk for suicide may begin behaving erratically and talk about dying or harming themselves they may show no hope for the future believing things will never get better or nothing will change according to the apa where to find help first look to the people in your own life who can be supportive and can help you experts say there are also federal state and local resources the substance abuse and mental health services administration or samhsa has a national helpline 800 662 help 4357 which provides free confidential treatment referral and information in english and spanish 24 7 every day of the year the american psychological association also has a webpage of resources for suicide substance abuse and domestic violence of course if the situation is potentially life threatening get immediate emergency assistance by calling 911 if you have health insurance many clinics and therapists are offering phone or video telehealth visits many employers are offering free access to therapists as part of their employee benefit plans and many communities have mental health centers with sliding scale fees it s ok to not feel ok and to not know what to do about it but do know there are resources out there ackrill said many people don t choose to go to therapy experts said because they believe that makes them weak or feel it would be too invasive the general public does not understand what therapy means said eve byrd director of the mental health program at the carter center in a may 2020 online forum they might say oh my gosh i am not going to be laying on a couch telling my deepest darkest thoughts that s frightening she said but that s not what therapy is byrd added therapy is really an educational activity she said adding that a therapist s role is to help you think about different ways to react to situations and more positive ways of interacting with individuals ___

newberry all the guy wanted to do was shoot off some commercial grade fireworks on public property without permission during a pandemic after inviting the whole town to come out and watch him it was last summer just before the fourth of july and josiah sharrett a 35 year old hotel maintenance worker wanted to brighten the mood in the upper peninsula village of newberry his hometown population 1 400 or so he lives here with his 10 year old daughter lyla and a massive shaggy 170 pound wolf dog hybrid that follows him everywhere he goes including the halls of the hotel where he works often to the startled amazement of guests for several years on the fourth of july sharrett bought a few hundred dollars worth of fireworks and lit them off in a grassy village owned field across from his sister s house just outside downtown right along the railroad tracks the closest annual fireworks show is in curtis more than 20 miles away and he wanted to spare his family the effort of driving there and back late at night too much noise too many people too much chaos he said and as a parent you re loading up your kids at whatever time the fireworks get done and then spending two hours to make a half hour drive with all the traffic we didn t care for it last year as the pandemic dragged on and people distanced themselves from each other and public events got canceled he decided to open his annual little fireworks display to anyone in town who wanted to come by and watch free of charge i wanted to do something for the entire community actually give them something to celebrate about the year since it just sucked he said a lot of folks never left their houses they were stuck in there they were scared they were terrified and with the community and people being afraid to travel or leave their houses i originally wanted to do it right in downtown newberry in the big field where i had always done em the point was to do them down there so everyone that was stuck in their house and couldn t leave could look outside and see something to have that little bit of normalization back to the world that we were stuck in sharrett spent a couple thousand dollars of his own money to buy extra fireworks hired a landscaping crew to mow the public field s tall grass at his expense and then cheerfully announced the date and location for his newly expanded fourth of july celebration on a facebook page called newberry area yard sales sandwiched among posts offering mattresses or lumber or tools the response was overwhelmingly positive lots of people replied that they d come out everyone was happy everyone thanked us for it sharrett said but just one day before the event newberry s village manager posted a brief announcement of her own on behalf of the village government on the same yard sale page declaring that residents of newberry most certainly cannot host their own amateur fireworks shows on public property more why american dunes golf club feels like a fourth of july party while honoring fallen soldiers more kei ju farm in petoskey unlawfully took in injured wild animals until dnr killed them reminder there are no authorized fireworks events taking place on village property this weekend parks close at 10pm fireworks are prohibited on all village of newberry properties with that it looked like sharrett s rogue fireworks show was shut down before it even began but instead the village manager s declaration just got him riled up anytime someone tells me i can t do something he said it just makes me want to do it twice as much sharrett is thoroughly country a live wire who speaks in a growling rasp and wears jeans with a large western style belt buckle featuring his last initial he loves the fourth of july loves america loves fireworks he s the kind of guy who drives around town in a jeep with a 6 foot american flag flying from a pole hitched to the back the kind who travels several hours to wisconsin every summer to stock up on the good fireworks that you can t get here the ones that explode like bombs in the sky this is his holiday his fireworks shows were apparently fine when he kept it confined to his family but throwing the event open to the whole town raised some eyebrows i was there in the park for three years or four years and no one s ever said anything he complained all of a sudden it was an issue he d already invited the whole town to his fireworks show and he d already spent his own money on all the fireworks but at the last minute the owners of a business in town stepped up and offered the use of their land for his show josiah grew up in this town and i think he just wants to be more involved in the community and have stuff for kids to do cause there s really nothing for people to do around here said misty schubach 41 who with her husband owns schubach farms a wide span of grassy hills featuring rental cabins for tourists i said it s private property go ahead and do it he merrily posted the new location on the newberry area yard sales page if the village wants to have a stick up their ass about a citizen trying to do something nice for the community they can he announced we re moving the event to private property bring your folding chairs and let s all come together as a community the next night a couple hundred people came out of their houses to gather with their neighbors for the first time in months they spread blankets on the ground or grouped themselves in lawn chair clusters with their families underneath a 45 minute fireworks show the first that newberry had had in many years when the grand finale finished everyone was in their car blowing their horns driving down the road just happy to see somebody step up and do that sharrett said but it was just to give everyone somewhere to go and something to do give them a little bit of normal he was so excited by the response that he and the schubachs started planning one for this year bigger and more organized than last year s last minute slipshod effort last year for example he basically threw a quarter inch piece of plywood down as a launch pad which worked well enough other than one of my guys putting a mortar into a tube upside down everything went fantastic he said that one punched a hole right through it and it shot the tube right past my head i couldn t hear there was ringing in my ear for three weeks so we re going to be a lot more safety oriented this year last year that was just kind of thrown together and double the size just because i was told no to doing it downtown this year he built real platforms with stud supports down the middle and legs to raise it off the ground just high enough off where you re not bending over to put your face over a tube to light it he said they opened an account at a local bank for donations put fundraising cans by the cash registers at local businesses and set a goal of 4 000 twice what he spent of his own money last year with no guarantee anyone would contribute i guess there was an incident a few years back where a guy put cans out and was collecting money for a fireworks show and then a bunch of people paid in for the fireworks and then the guy just took off out of town and then they never had a show schubach said so i was worried people would be a little reluctant and have a bad taste in their mouth from the last person that did it but bit by bit one small contribution after another they raised more than 6 000 enough money to get bounce houses a dj and the shaved ice shop downtown to serve hot dogs and hamburgers enough to show that last year s fireworks weren t a fluke we ve heard for years that everyone wants the fireworks back sharrett said and there s been a couple people that have tried and they ve had people throw walls up in their way and say no you can t do that and they immediately accept that me i ll find a loophole i ll find a way to make it happen on the night before the fourth as evening turned to dusk several hundred villagers gathered on the farm their cars formed a wide circle and in the middle was the hill from which the fireworks would be launched country music blared from speakers as families sat around bonfires older folks sat on lawn chairs and kids twirled sparklers as they ran with each other on the lawn this is one of those things that we can bring back to newberry that we really need said ryan wheeler 24 a longtime buddy there to help launch the show instead of everyone leaving town and driving 45 minutes to get somewhere it s right here local they drive five minutes they re here i m happy that it s finally here hundreds of loaded mortar tubes were lined in neat little rows on the wooden platforms with their fuses poking outward ready to light sharrett s jeep was parked there its big flag lit by a spotlight as the the star spangled banner played through the speakers right before he was to launch his personal fireworks show which was now everyone s oh i love it sharrett said it was always a childhood dream to blow stuff up and now i get to do it for the entire town what little boy doesn t want to go around and play with fire and blow stuff up and i get to do it on a bigger scale the way everything is right now i just wanted to show some pride and the fourth allows us to do that on a big scale the anthem ended the sky was dark now sharrett turned to his buddies you boys ready he asked oh we re pumped man whoo said wheeler sharrett pulled out his cigarette lighter lit the propane torch in his hand and laid its long blue flame on the first fuse on the first firework and a cheer rose from the crowd as the sky was set on fire john carlisle writes about people and places in michigan his stories can be found at freep com carlisle contact him jcarlisle freepress com follow

how to use europe s excess savings the covid 19 pandemic is a crisis like no other in 2020 it plunged the global economy into its deepest recession since world war ii but after a year in the doldrums europe s private firms and households are now awash with cash how households in particular use their accumulated savings will be crucial in shaping the continent s post pandemic recovery whereas companies have built their cash buffers on piles of new debt households remained prudent during the pandemic their debt barely increased and debt leverage remained essentially flat households cash buffers or excess savings as they are often called stem from reduced spending mainly on services all those canceled restaurant meals holiday trips and concerts swelled european household savings by 450 billion 534 billion in 2020 alone and renewed lockdowns in the first half of this year could add another 200 billion to the total in 2021 true europe will experience an economic rebound this year regardless of what happens to the excess savings but how households deploy them will help to determine whether the recovery merely marks a return to the pre crisis growth path with all its social dislocations and political blowback or instead ushers in a new era of inclusive and sustainable prosperity households certainly will use part of these savings for consumption as the reopening of economies this year releases pent up demand but the boost might be smaller than some observers expect for starters much of the excess savings have been accumulated by richer households whose income remained stable during the pandemic and who have a relatively low propensity to consume moreover most european households will regard excess savings resulting from lower consumption as a positive wealth shock with the wealth effect on spending at the aggregate level being rather low as households may remain cautious about the lasting effect in the united states by contrast excess savings were fueled mainly by generous income support for all households in the form of lump sum government payments or checks and the income effect was higher particularly among lower income households so it is reasonable to assume that excess savings in europe are mainly accumulated by high income households while they are more evenly distributed and thus more easily spent in the us as a result european households will likely channel only about one third of their pandemic savings into consumption this will give the recovery a welcome moderate boost with only a limited and temporary impact on prices an unconstrained consumption boom on the other hand could easily turn into something altogether uglier causing macroeconomic imbalances and higher prices that might prove longer lasting and even trigger a wage price spiral but even outright bad outcomes are conceivable for starters we cannot rule out the so called housing option whereby the richest european households turn their excess savings into real assets these savers tend to be more financially savvy than most and more able to invest in illiquid assets with the rapid spread of new hybrid work arrangements already fueling rising demand for housing there is a clear danger that these funds will drive house prices to even frothier levels the mainly negative consequences of this would include cemented inequality as a large part of the population is simply barred from entering the housing market and heightened financial risks the same could be said about the equity market option whereby households turn bank deposits into stock investments a rush into the markets now could have a destabilizing effect especially if many retail investors were to use their funds for speculative trades as in the us fortunately there is a good solution using household savings to help accelerate the european economy s modernization and decarbonization would benefit savers financial markets and european union member states alike channeling excess cash into this type of long term investment would yield a double dividend households could earn decent returns bolstering their nest eggs for old age and europe could increase its economic growth potential creating more opportunities and jobs for all but this happy outcome will not materialize by itself without the right incentives the bulk of excess savings might continue to lie idle in bank accounts or find their way into less beneficial investments with environmentally or otherwise undesirable consequences policymakers should thus set the right course to unleash these cash piles potentially positive effects one particularly intriguing option would be to breathe fresh life into the idea of european long term investment funds eltifs as part of the european commission s action plan to strengthen and complete europe s capital markets union eltifs have been around for years but so far have existed mostly in the shadows and largely failed to appeal to retail investors this should change after all the idea behind eltifs is compelling they are a vehicle for investing safely in illiquid assets from start ups to infrastructure projects making them attractive financial products for retail investors requires four main things more flexible investment guidelines more adaptable redemption rules lower required minimum investments and above all favorable tax regimes in addition governments could provide direct subsidies of say 20 for every 100 invested up to a certain limit such an initiative would be easily understood and should prove popular the funds for this could come directly from the 750 billion next generation eu program an elegant way to leverage that instrument s effectiveness channeling excess private savings into long term investments that support europe s green and digital transformation is vital to inclusive and sustainable growth policymakers should capitalize on the one windfall opportunity that the pandemic crisis has brought us copyright

america is in celebratory mode states are dropping covid 19 restrictions plane travel is breaking records and many americans are gearing up to celebrate summer as if the last year plus of pandemic madness never happened many people are experiencing a relief they ve been vaccinated and are able to gather again with others said psychologist kristen carpenter who is director of women s behavioral health at the ohio state university wexner medical center yet the pandemic isn t truly over the highly contagious delta variant of covid 19 is sweeping through unvaccinated communities and there is worry that even the vaccinated among us are at risk it s not like somebody put a period on the sentence and we re done with this pandemic we really don t know what s ahead said stress management expert dr cynthia ackrill an editor for the magazine contentment produced by the american institute of stress that s not all violent crime is up historic heat waves are devastating areas of the country not prepared to cope and mental health practitioners can t keep up with the demand for services i think for many people this return to normal feels awfully abrupt and jarring carpenter said adding that the pandemic has been an incredibly difficult period with lots of opportunity for confusion for disagreement and for discord she continued it s a real mixed bag while many will experience much of this reopening as positive there is a subset of people that will really struggle with how to move out of this very challenging time blame the brain if you are tense or anxious about reentering today s so called normal experts say that s understandable blame it on your brain especially your frontal lobe where you do your higher level thinking we ve just expended enormous energy navigating this whole pandemic constantly with loved ones hypervigilant going to the store and that takes extra brainpower ackrill said when your frontal lobe is tired from doing emotional regulation on steroids for a year and a half you re not as good at it she added you could even be at your breaking point if however you find yourself giddy with relief and ready to act as if there was no pandemic to worry about that too makes neurological sense said dr bruce wexler a senior research scientist in psychiatry at yale school of medicine humans are the only animals that shape the environment that shapes our brains and we function and feel better when there s a fit between the two said wexler who has studied brain plasticity for more than 35 years every day we strive to renew ourselves by reconnecting with the familiar faces and places that shaped us and are inside of us that s one of the reasons people were so agitated about wanting to go back to their favorite bars and hangouts wexler added when he realized that motivation wexler said i had more sympathy for the people who were complaining open up open up i could understand their urgency it s time for compassion safely getting back to normal in whatever shape that currently looks like will require being fully vaccinated and adhering to the latest social distancing requirements of local communities and businesses according to the us centers for disease control and prevention coping with anxiety tension or worry about risky pandemic behaviors both our own and those of other people will take a combination of self care and compassion experts say we all have to give ourselves a little grace carpenter said it s really important that we try not to judge ourselves for our emotional response to this change this is objectively really stressful and to have some combination of relief happiness fear or maybe even some anger and frustration is normal it s just as important to show compassion to those around us who are navigating their own reactions to change ackrill said she tells a story of being on a walk while wearing a mask when a woman came close to her and began yelling i m not wearing a mask and i m never wearing a mask i ignored her i had longer legs and walked faster she charged after me again yelling at me and then coughed in my direction on purpose ackrill continued and it just floored me because i thought this is probably a woman whose friends and relatives would be appalled by her behavior and it was her fear coming out fear of feeling out of control and wanting so badly to control things by seeing the woman s behavior through compassionate eyes ackrill was able to calm her own reaction and reduce her stress self compassion and giving compassion don t make us more vulnerable they make us stronger she said so when you re feeling heightened emotions such as anxiety or even anger about someone s risky behavior calm yourself and have some compassion for yourself and that other person taking stock of your emotions like all things this pandemic too shall pass but how well we weather it will be based on our actions experts say recognizing and taking stock of our emotions addressing those and then giving ourselves a little grace are essential to moving forward productively in ways that protect and enhance our well being carpenter said do a wellness check in ask

when the us jobs figures for june were issued on friday wall street s s p 500 and nasdaq indexes both climbed to new record highs because the jobs data were regarded as a goldilocks moment neither too hot nor too cold a sign for a wall street building wednesday may 19 2021 in new york ap photo mark lennihan coming in at 850 000 the jobs growth number beating economists estimates of 720 000 and well above the figure of 583 000 for may was regarded as a sign of recovery for the us economy but not enough to push the federal reserve towards tightening its monetary policy as the data showed there were still 9 million people unemployed compared with 5 7 million in february 2020 before the pandemic hit as one analyst told the financial times the jobs figures couldn t have delivered better news for wall street enough new jobs to confirm the economy is on a roll enough jobless to give the fed s current strategy a warm hug another part of the good news for wall street was that despite evidence of labour shortages in parts of the us economy and the payment of higher wages the rise in average hourly earnings for the month was only 0 3 percent down from the increases in april and may the significance of the wages jobs growth and overall employment data for wall street is not so much what they signify in and of themselves though that is factor but their implications for the policies of the fed since the fed s massive intervention in march 2020 when it stepped in to halt a meltdown of the financial system with the injection of around 4 trillion wall street has become ever more dependent on the flow of ultra cheap money from the central bank this inflow is continuing at the rate of 120 billion a month more than 1 4 trillion a year through the purchase of treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities and the financial markets are fearful that even a slight lessening of this support could have major effects consequently some analysts are issuing warnings that the present situation in which markets continue to rise based on continued economic growth combined with monetary support from the fed is inherently unstable in a comment published in the financial times last week mohamed el erian noted that as recorded by a recent bank of america survey markets were currently dominated by three core hypotheses durable high economic growth transitory inflation and ever friendly central banks el erian wrote that while he did not have a serious quarrel with the higher growth scenario he did worry a great deal about the widespread conviction that the current rise in inflation will be transitory he did not expect a return to the inflation levels of the 1970s but we have to respect the possibility of a shock to a financial system that has been conditioned and wired for the persistence of lower and more stable inflation if inflation remains low and present rises prove to be transitory then the fed will maintain low interest rates but if that proves not to be the case then a late slamming of the brakes rather than easing off the accelerator would significantly increase the rise of an unnecessary economic recession a much sharper warning about the state of the us and global financial system has been delivered by economist nouriel roubini who came into public prominence because of his warnings prior to the financial crash of 2008 in a comment in the guardian last friday he warned that conditions were ripe for a repeat of the 1970s stagflation and the 2008 debt crisis he noted that debt ratios today were much higher than in the 1970s while a mix of loose economic policies threatened to fuel inflation rather than the deflation that occurred after the 2008 crisis for now loose monetary and fiscal policies will continue to fuel asset and credit bubbles propelling a slow motion train wreck he wrote and pointed to the warning signs these included high price to earnings ratios for shares inflated housing and tech assets irrational exuberance surrounding special purpose acquisition companies firms that are floated on the stock market on a cash only basis with the aim of taking over another firm seeking a public listing the crypto currency sector the level of high yield corporate debt junk bonds collateralised loan obligations the increased use of private equity meme stocks and runaway retail daily trading at a certain point this would trigger a loss of confidence and a crash but in the meantime loose monetary policies will continue to drive inflation creating the conditions for stagflation when the next economic shock arrives he noted that central banks were in a debt trap if they start to raise interest rates to combat inflation they risk triggering a massive debt crisis and severe recession but if they continue on the present course they risk double digit inflation roubini pointed out that the fed was already in a debt trap and its recent adjustment from an ultra dovish stance to a mostly dovish stance when its dot plot of interest rates at its june meeting showed a rise in 2023 rather than 2024 changed nothing the debt trap was in evidence at the end of 2018 more than a year before the onset of the pandemic when the fed dropped proposed interest rate rises and ceased its wind down of asset holdings because of the adverse reaction in financial markets in response to the fed s plan to continue interest rates in 2019 after four rises in 2018 wall street had its worst december since 1931 and fed chair jerome powell reversed course and then began cutting rates in july 2019 with inflation rising and stagflationary shocks looming it is now even more ensnared roubini wrote there is also clear evidence that financial authorities are no better prepared to deal with a crisis than they were in 2008 or in the march 2020 meltdown which triggered the latest round of massive financial support this was highlighted in a recent blog post by the bank of england on the events of the spring of 2020 it was potentially more serious than that of 2008 because it centred on the 21 trillion us treasury market the bedrock of the global financial system and supposedly a safe haven in times of stress as investors buy government bonds in the march crisis however treasuries were sold off the blog began by noting that while financial markets reflect changes in the economy they can amplify them as well and this was evident as the covid 19 pandemic materialised it then drew attention to the role of margin calls in precipitating the crisis investors in financial assets use borrowed money at cheap rates to finance their activities but have to place some collateral with the lender this enables them to make huge profits so long as the underlying asset continues to rise in the market but if there is a downturn the lender demands more collateral a margin call to cover the fall and this can precipitate a dash for cash leading to a negative feedback loop because the value of financial assets falls further as they are sold off the blog post noted that net outflows reached more than 5 percent of assets under management for corporate bonds in the march crisis the highest since the global financial crisis of 2008 the risks of a self reinforcing spiral inherent in the operations of highly leveraged hedge funds crystallised in the us treasury market in march 2020 notably hedge funds unwound us treasury positions following severe portfolio losses and margin calls contributing to a sharp rise in yields and market illiquidity as the blog noted large scale intervention by the federal reserve managed to restore market liquidity and break the self reinforcing loss spiral but as other reports on the march crisis have noted none of the underlying issues that produced it have been resolved and no solutions were advanced by the bank of england blog to prevent a recurrence in fact it concluded with a profession of ignorance saying merely that it had identified key questions emphasised by the covid related financial stress in early 2020 that warrant further investigation and that the authors would welcome further engagement with the research community on these issues such a conclusion only emphasises the fundamental point that in the final analysis the destructive anarchy of the capitalist economy and its financial system arising from the system of private ownership is outside of conscious control and regulation
while the market driven by short term sentiment influenced by the accommodative interest rate environment in the us virus news and stimulus spending many smart money investors are starting to get
