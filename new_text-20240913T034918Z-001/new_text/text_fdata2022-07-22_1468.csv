annualized return on average assets and return on average equity for the quarter ended june 30 2022 were 1 28 percent and 11 08 percent respectively for the six months ended june 30 2022 the company

said timothy k schools capstar president and chief executive officer each of our four key drivers are progressing 1 outside of our specialty banking businesses core bank revenue grew mid double digits compared to the prior year benefiting from robust loan growth 2 our net interest margin expanded due to a favorable earning asset mix shift and modest benefit from rising rates 3 we are working more productively improving our efficiency ratio to 56 and 4 net charge offs were 0 and our past dues reached their second consecutive record low our positive results are attracting the attention of bankers seeking an environment where they and their customers can have a bigger voice last week we were excited to announce additions to our chattanooga and nashville teams and entry into asheville our fourth dynamic metro market while rising rates benefited our core bank earnings they slowed our mortgage and tri net businesses mortgage results were near break even tri net has been an outstanding business having contributed more than 25 million of revenue to capstar over its life however tri net did not produce a gain on sale during the quarter as the sharp increase in market rates and overall slowdown in demand reduced the value of tri net s funded loans we are pursuing hedging strategies to mitigate this risk in the future we expect each of these businesses to experience headwinds in the near term until the rate environment stabilizes we are proud of the strength of our earnings this quarter we remain excited about the increasing contribution of our investments in new markets revenue total revenue defined as net interest income plus noninterest income was 30 3 million in the second quarter this represents an increase of 0 1 million from the previous quarter net interest income and noninterest income totaled 24 4 million and 5 9 million an increase of 3 3 million and a decrease of 3 2 million respectively from the first quarter of 2022 rising interest rates and a positive mix shift in average earning assets contributed to the increase in net interest income while noninterest income declined due to lower mortgage and tri net division revenues and one time boli income in the previous quarter second quarter 2022 average earning assets remained flat at 2 90 billion compared to march 31 2022 as strong loan growth was principally funded from cash during the quarter 106 9 million of tri net loans were transferred from loans held for sale to loans held for investment excluding ppp balances and the tri net transfer average loans held for investment increased 98 1 million from the prior quarter or 19 8 percent linked quarter annualized end of period loans held for investment excluding ppp balances and the tri net transfer increased 85 9 million or 16 9 percent linked quarter annualized including 47 5 million in loan production from the company s recent chattanooga expansion the current commercial loan pipeline remains strong exceeding 500 million and continues to present the company a tremendous opportunity in combination with the recent asheville chattanooga and nashville hires to leverage capital to grow revenue and earnings per share for the second quarter of 2022 the net interest margin increased 44 basis points from the prior quarter to 3 41 percent primarily resulting from continued increases in interest rates and the positive mix shift in average earning assets while the company is managing to a more neutral interest rate risk profile over time in order to enhance earnings consistency net interest income is expected to continue to benefit modestly from rising rates in 2022 the company s average deposits totaled 2 66 billion in the second quarter of 2022 a 40 3 million decline from the first quarter of 2022 during the quarter the company experienced a 15 8 million reduction in higher cost average time deposits and 33 5 million decrease in average interest bearing transaction accounts these decreases were partially offset by a 9 4 million increase in average savings and money market deposits creating an overall net decrease of 39 9 million in average interest bearing deposits when compared to the first quarter of 2022 during the quarter the company s lowest cost deposit category noninterest bearing improved 40 basis points to 27 3 percent of total average deposits as of june 30 2022 total deposit costs increased 4 basis points to 0 23 percent compared to 0 19 for the prior quarter a key longer term strategic initiative is to create a stronger deposit led culture with an emphasis on lower cost relationship based deposits noninterest income during the quarter decreased 3 2 million from the first quarter ended march 31 2022 this decrease was attributable to a 0 3 million decline in mortgage revenue a 2 2 million decline in tri net revenue and 0 9 million of one time boli income recorded in the previous quarter during the quarter 106 9 million of tri net loans were transferred from loans held for sale to loans held for investment to mitigate potential losses related to the adverse impact of rapidly rising interest rates on pricing and investor demand the company s mortgage and tri net divisions have been strong contributors in the past but it is anticipated that they will continue to face challenges in the volatile rate environment noninterest expense and operating efficiency improving productivity and operating efficiency is a key focus of the company during the quarter the company continued to exhibit strong expense discipline noninterest expenses decreased 0 7 million from the first quarter of 2022 to 17 1 million in the second quarter of 2022 this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in nonrecurring first quarter items and no mortgage incentive expense for the quarter ended june 30 2022 the efficiency ratio was 56 32 percent an improvement from 58 67 percent in the first quarter of 2022 annualized noninterest expense as a percentage of average assets improved 9 basis points to 2 19 percent for the quarter ended june 30 2022 compared to 2 28 percent for the quarter ended march 31 2022 assets per employee was 7 9 million as of june 30 2022 compared to 8 0 million in the previous quarter the continued discipline in productivity metrics demonstrates the company s commitment to outstanding performance asset quality

said timothy k schools capstar president and chief executive officer each of our four key drivers are progressing 1 outside of our specialty banking businesses core bank revenue grew mid double digits compared to the prior year benefiting from robust loan growth 2 our net interest margin expanded due to a favorable earning asset mix shift and modest benefit from rising rates 3 we are working more productively improving our efficiency ratio to 56 and 4 net charge offs were 0 and our past dues reached their second consecutive record low our positive results are attracting the attention of bankers seeking an environment where they and their customers can have a bigger voice last week we were excited to announce additions to our chattanooga and nashville teams and entry into asheville our fourth dynamic metro market while rising rates benefited our core bank earnings they slowed our mortgage and tri net businesses mortgage results were near break even tri net has been an outstanding business having contributed more than 25 million of revenue to capstar over its life however tri net did not produce a gain on sale during the quarter as the sharp increase in market rates and overall slowdown in demand reduced the value of tri net s funded loans we are pursuing hedging strategies to mitigate this risk in the future we expect each of these businesses to experience headwinds in the near term until the rate environment stabilizes we are proud of the strength of our earnings this quarter we remain excited about the increasing contribution of our investments in new markets revenue total revenue defined as net interest income plus noninterest income was 30 3 million in the second quarter this represents an increase of 0 1 million from the previous quarter net interest income and noninterest income totaled 24 4 million and 5 9 million an increase of 3 3 million and a decrease of 3 2 million respectively from the first quarter of 2022 rising interest rates and a positive mix shift in average earning assets contributed to the increase in net interest income while noninterest income declined due to lower mortgage and tri net division revenues and one time boli income in the previous quarter second quarter 2022 average earning assets remained flat at 2 90 billion compared to march 31 2022 as strong loan growth was principally funded from cash during the quarter 106 9 million of tri net loans were transferred from loans held for sale to loans held for investment excluding ppp balances and the tri net transfer average loans held for investment increased 98 1 million from the prior quarter or 19 8 percent linked quarter annualized end of period loans held for investment excluding ppp balances and the tri net transfer increased 85 9 million or 16 9 percent linked quarter annualized including 47 5 million in loan production from the company s recent chattanooga expansion the current commercial loan pipeline remains strong exceeding 500 million and continues to present the company a tremendous opportunity in combination with the recent asheville chattanooga and nashville hires to leverage capital to grow revenue and earnings per share for the second quarter of 2022 the net interest margin increased 44 basis points from the prior quarter to 3 41 percent primarily resulting from continued increases in interest rates and the positive mix shift in average earning assets while the company is managing to a more neutral interest rate risk profile over time in order to enhance earnings consistency net interest income is expected to continue to benefit modestly from rising rates in 2022 the company s average deposits totaled 2 66 billion in the second quarter of 2022 a 40 3 million decline from the first quarter of 2022 during the quarter the company experienced a 15 8 million reduction in higher cost average time deposits and 33 5 million decrease in average interest bearing transaction accounts these decreases were partially offset by a 9 4 million increase in average savings and money market deposits creating an overall net decrease of 39 9 million in average interest bearing deposits when compared to the first quarter of 2022 during the quarter the company s lowest cost deposit category noninterest bearing improved 40 basis points to 27 3 percent of total average deposits as of june 30 2022 total deposit costs increased 4 basis points to 0 23 percent compared to 0 19 for the prior quarter a key longer term strategic initiative is to create a stronger deposit led culture with an emphasis on lower cost relationship based deposits noninterest income during the quarter decreased 3 2 million from the first quarter ended march 31 2022 this decrease was attributable to a 0 3 million decline in mortgage revenue a 2 2 million decline in tri net revenue and 0 9 million of one time boli income recorded in the previous quarter during the quarter 106 9 million of tri net loans were transferred from loans held for sale to loans held for investment to mitigate potential losses related to the adverse impact of rapidly rising interest rates on pricing and investor demand the company s mortgage and tri net divisions have been strong contributors in the past but it is anticipated that they will continue to face challenges in the volatile rate environment noninterest expense and operating efficiency improving productivity and operating efficiency is a key focus of the company during the quarter the company continued to exhibit strong expense discipline noninterest expenses decreased 0 7 million from the first quarter of 2022 to 17 1 million in the second quarter of 2022 this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in nonrecurring first quarter items and no mortgage incentive expense for the quarter ended june 30 2022 the efficiency ratio was 56 32 percent an improvement from 58 67 percent in the first quarter of 2022 annualized noninterest expense as a

cnn the nationwide baby formula shortage that federal leaders once said would be fixed within weeks has dragged on for months despite tons of imports and key steps forward in domestic production formula stock rates have been dropping since the end of february when the us food and drug administration shut down a major formula plant and issued a recall of products manufactured there after an inspection found dangerous bacteria in several areas the closure exacerbated shortages caused by supply chain disruptions leaving families struggling to find formula for infants and people with specific nutrition needs more than 20 of formula products powder ready to drink and liquid have been out of stock for the past six weeks according to data released wednesday by market research firm information resources inc before the recall about 10 of infant formula products were typically out of stock formula stock hit a low in late june 22 4 of products were out of stock during the week ending june 26 since then the abbott plant in michigan that was at the heart of the recall has resumed production flooding from severe storms halted production for most of june but it s been back up and running for about three weeks still stock rates have improved by less than 1 percentage point in that time last week 21 9 of formula products were out of stock fda commissioner dr robert califf told a senate appropriations subcommittee on wednesday that there is a robust pipeline of formula coming in production is finally outpacing purchasing as families have eased up on stockpiling too but there was a deficit that s going to take a while to fix he said throughout the shortage federal leaders have been reluctant to share a timeline for when things might get back to normal but califf s comments this week were more tempered than they ve been in may califf said that supply should be back to normal within a matter of weeks over the past two months the biden administration has announced more than a dozen missions to bring formula into the us through operation fly formula the announcements total more than 4 million pounds of formula and the latest one says that enough to make about 61 million 8 ounce bottle equivalents will be delivered by the end of this week but according to iri in 2021 an average of about 561 000 pounds of dry powder formula was sold each day or about 17 million pounds each month that means the operation fly formula missions announced to date account for just about a week of typical powder formula sales in the us kroger has received some supply from the operation fly formula shipments but told cnn this week that it has not seen a big impact on inventory yet nationwide the latest iri data shows that stock rates for powder formula specifically are even worse than overall formula rates and continue to drop more than 31 of powder formula products were out of stock last week up from 27 a month earlier at wednesday s senate meeting sen john hoeven r north dakota said he can t overstate his concern around the formula shortage we have to make sure that we don t have something like that happen again going forward i think that fda should treat essential foods such as infant formula in the same manner the agency treats essential medicines he said rep rosa delauro d connecticut chair of the house appropriations committee has also been critical of the fda s handling of safety concerns at abbott s michigan facility and has co sponsored a bill that would create a food safety administration as a single hhs agency that would be responsible for food safety first let me be clear we should not have to choose between supply and safety especially when it comes to a product we feed our babies this product should face the most rigorous standards of safety to ensure that it is safe to feed our children she said in a statement to cnn the shortage persists because we are overly reliant on one manufacturer to get infant formula back on the shelf delauro posted a video to twitter on tuesday in which she asked americans to send photos of the baby formula aisles of stores in their areas to document the status of the shortage we need to get safe infant formula back on the shelves but we need to know which communities are in the most need please help us find out she said in the video califf said at wednesday s hearing that store shelves might look different because formula manufacturers are packaging products in larger containers when there is a shortage people change what they make to make it so that for example maybe larger containers to optimize bringing forward the product for purchasing so some of the things that people are used to seeing on the shelf may not be there even if the total amount of formula is the same or higher than it was he said iri data does suggest that the variety of products made available to consumers has shrunk less than half as many products are being sold now than during the same time last year in any case it s not going to be a sudden fix califf said he said the fda is understaffed and underfunded and needs more resources to be able to respond to shortages but the safety of the us food supply is one of my absolute top priorities and a full review of the foods program is underway the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

through a deluge of news about the economy interest rates and corporate profits the s p 500 rose 1 after shaking off an early stumble returning to its highest level in six weeks the dow jones industrial average also recovered from a midafternoon slide to end 0 5 higher while the nasdaq composite rose 1 4 as tesla and technology stocks led the market much of wall street s focus was on europe where a yearslong experiment with negative interest rates came to a close in the united states reports suggested the economy is slowing more than expected while a better than expected profit report from tesla headlined a mixed set from the nation s biggest companies stocks briefly lost ground after president joe biden tested positive for covid at the center of this year s sell off for financial markets has been the world s punishingly high inflation and the moves made by central banks to squash it on thursday the european central bank surprised markets when it raised interest rates by more than expected its first increase in 11 years i was trading right when the ecb news came out and it actually caused long term bonds to rally said jay hatfield ceo of infrastructure capital advisors investors also bid up stock prices the s p 500 rose 39 05 points to 3 998 95 the latest gains extended the benchmark index s winning streak to a third day the dow rose 162 06 points to 32 036

the u s federal reserve which is set to raise rates next week for a fourth time this year the hope is that higher rates will slow the economy enough to beat back high inflation the risk is that higher rates push down on investment prices and too aggressive hikes could cause a recession in the u s some areas of the economy have already begun to soften the highest number of workers filed for unemployment benefits last week in eight months though it remains low compared with history a separate report released thursday morning showed manufacturing in the mid atlantic region weakened by significantly more than economists expected the discouraging data helped pull treasury yields lower and could steer the federal reserve toward less aggressive hikes on interest rates that in turn could help support stocks the two year treasury yield which tends to move with expectations for the fed slumped to 3 09 from 3 25 late wednesday forecasts among traders for what the federal reserve will do at its meeting next week have tilted toward an increase of 0 75 percentage points and away from a colossal hike of a full percentage point the 10 year yield which influences mortgage rates fell to 2 90 from 3 03 the primary reason stocks have rallied this week on wall street has been strong profit reports from big u s companies if they can deliver continued growth despite high inflation that would prop up one of the two main levers that set stock prices the other depends on where interest rates go tesla climbed 9 8 in the first trading after the electric vehicle maker reported

companies are bringing in less revenue at the same time companies costs are going up too so they re paying more for the materials they need to make their products the rent on their facilities and the wages of the employees they depend on to get the products out the door still there are some kinds of stocks that do better during inflationary times than others typically these are the stocks of

biden s trip to the middle east simultaneously defied the anti saudi lobby the pro iran lobby and the anti israel lobby us president joe biden s visit to saudi arabia was very important on the one hand saudi arabia has been a key us partner for many decades in fact us policy in the region could be said to rest on the pillar of saudi arabia at the same time however the us has other friends and allies in the region historically the us is also a key ally of israel and the us has now cultivated partnerships with the uae qatar and bahrain as well as egypt and turkey other countries such as iran were once friends of the us now they are enemies the us has also left afghanistan and lost influence in iraq but the us has forces in iraq and syria the shifting policies of the us in the region are of interest turkey is ostensibly a nato ally of the united states throughout the past decade however turkey s far right regime has turned against america the akp party which rules ankara and which has imprisoned most opposition journalists and many opposition politicians has turned ankara into an ally of iran and russia ankara s regime works closely with both countries either on issues regarding syria or even on defense and trade deals the evolution of us saudi relations meanwhile us saudi relations have also been difficult in recent years the obama administration appeared to turn against saudi arabia meanwhile saudi arabia also shifted towards a new era of reform this reform was not to the liking of some countries in the west though some groups that had once relied on riyadh for funding including think tanks and human rights groups were angered to see saudi arabia and the uae turn against the muslim brotherhood mb that is because there is a quiet inroad that the mb despite being a religious extremist group has cultivated in the west when riyadh turned on these islamists some of the westerners who had been close to a different generation of saudi insiders moved to qatar and back to the west to re orient themselves into an anti saudi lobby how does this relate to the biden visit on friday biden met saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman al saud the national reported that they had talks on wide ranging issues including aviation energy iran yemen human rights and sovereignty over islands in the red sea this is important but it is also a test there were voices in the west trying to sabotage the biden trip to israel and saudi arabia for these voices the trip represents the worst of both worlds for many years a lobby in the us that has worked against israel has also begun to turn on saudi arabia for them the biden trip was a nightmare no two state solution and no iran deal was going to come of it they didn t get the human rights talking points either whether it was a statement about shireen abu akleh or jamal khashoggi the anti saudi lobby history flipped the small but loud anti saudi lobby in the us is a true reversal of how things were in the 1990s in those days saudi arabia was the most favored ally and former us diplomats members of congress and security officials all adored riyadh oddly it was in the 1990s when saudi arabia s policies were fostering anti american views and riyadh had a checkered record on confronting extremists in those days saudi arabia was also more anti israel when riyadh became more amicable to israel suddenly the anti saudi lobby appeared those human rights experts who had bashed israel and been happy to endorse riyadh suddenly moved to found human rights groups that would focus on the actions of egypt saudi arabia the uae and bahrain why because those were the countries at peace with israel the message was clear there is a dedicated group of people in the west some of them former officials who back iran and are against any country that makes peace with israel some of these lobbyists clothed themselves in the guise of realism but quietly they believed iran having a nuclear weapon would bring stability to the middle east they wanted to balance israel and also undermine any country that was a friend of the west as such the new anti saudi talking point is that the us shouldn t go to war for saudi arabia or be tied to saudi arabia israel the uae or bahrain for them the only countries they usually want to engage with is qatar and iran they also want a soft stance on russia when it comes to ukraine and they tend to back china the anti saudi effect the overall effect of the anti saudi lobby was that they were able to plant op eds and articles in western media in the period after 2015 for them the narrative was that the new crown prince was destabilizing saudi arabia for them stability meant the brotherhood and anti american and anti israel views for them stability was working with iran they conjured up various scandals about riyadh s new line including complaining that riyadh s new younger leadership had bought an expensive painting for a group that had enjoyed the good old days of the 1990s it was odd to hear them complaining of lavish spending in the gulf when they enjoyed the lavish spending so long as it was from doha or others be that as it may the anti saudi lobby had its achievements it likely caused riyadh to believe a conspiracy existed in the west involving dissidents and that saudi arabia had to act more forcefully the abraham accords and the close ties between saudi arabia and the trump administration fed into the view that saudi arabia had become a partisan issue in dc meanwhile the same process occurred with israel there was a desire in some sectors to turn israel and saudi arabia into partisan issues why make israel and saudi arabia into a partisan issue this benefits those who wanted to make sure that once trump left office that more critical voices would take a tougher line on jerusalem and riyadh if you can convince enough members of congress and officials that israel and saudi are somehow linked solely to one political party then every time the other party is in charge they will lose out this has an effect on the other side as well but this partisan approach to foreign policy was not as successful as some who backed it thought it would be the pro iran deal crowd and the anti saudi crowd are usually the same people the anti israel crowd found that the incoming biden administration didn t want this toxic domestic politics embrace of foreign policy the biden trip to the middle east in mid july is an example of the failure of the anti saudi lobby the pro iran lobby and the anti israel lobby these entwined lobbies are not all the same but they tend to be the same think tanks that pop up and human rights groups that solely focus on obsession with israel or saudi arabia are very transparent in what they are doing the turkey angle at the same time another process was playing out in washington turkey also has a lobby in the west the lobby consists of a few groups some are former officials who believe in a cold war view of ankara they think turkey is an ally of the west against russia they want turkey armed as much as possible there are other pro turkey voices who are also pro brotherhood because the ruling party of turkey has roots in the brotherhood there are also those who came to turkey s aid via the syrian rebellion they dislike the assad regime and they dislike iran and hezbollah but they believe ankara is the best hope of the former syrian revolution and some of them are more sectarian claiming turkey is the best hope of the sunnis by which they tend to mean the syrian rebels the pro ankara voices are not always anti israel or anti saudi regardless of the groups that back a strong turkey us relationship or believe that ankara is against iran and russia which it is not ankara tends to sabotage its own relations with the west ankara likes to meet with the leaders of russia and iran and threatens new invasions and ethnic cleansing of syria seeking to target groups the us backs primarily kurds turkey also works with extremist groups and isis members always seem to shelter near turkey s border in syria as such turkey has found that it now faces a lot of opposition in washington voices in congress don t want turkey getting more f 16s they wonder about ankara helping iran and russia avoid sanctions they also are concerned about press freedom in turkey and the suppression of dissidents and minorities turkey has also undermined nato and threatened greece cyprus france israel the uae egypt and other countries none of this makes turkey seem like an ally anymore biden had to meet with turkey to get finland and sweden into nato but in general ankara gets the cold shoulder turkey the trump era vs now the declining stock of ankara in washington is in contrast to the trump era turkey enjoyed close ties to the trump administration so close it was able to harass us officials and employees of the us embassy in turkey it was able to threaten us troops in syria target activists like hevrin khalaf it was able to detain a us pastor and threaten israel and back hamas without much pushback only in 2020 did some in the trump administration tire of ankara s threats prior to that turkey s leader had a direct line to the white house and made frequent calls to trump the white house decided to leave syria twice after calls with erdogan without informing allies or key members of congress or us central command this chaos ended when biden came into office turkey s far right pro government media which had been deeply anti biden and even hosted american far right groups labeled the left antifa and even made a list of jews in the new biden administration suddenly found itself forced to compromise turkey s leadership began to talk new ties and a reset with israel indeed with benjamin netanyahu out of office turkey sought out better ties this cynical decision came as ankara also pretended it wanted reconciliation with greece egypt the uae saudi arabia and others did it think that with biden in town it would be isolated and needed jerusalem and riyadh to help it get f 16s the future of turkey and the biden administration it s not clear if ankara will achieve many results with the biden administration but it is clear it is trying turkey was emboldened in its anti israel antics and anti nato antics by its ties to the trump administration it felt it had a blank check to host hamas more openly to back extremist groups to do ethnic cleansing of afrin no conflict was too high even attacks on armenia in the summer of 2020 ankara s antics became the most extreme threatening war with greece and threatening france israel was concerned turkey helped stage the media coverage of the khashoggi story and also used a coup attempt as an excuse to purge hundreds of thousands of officials it cracked down on mythical terrorists and even attacked protesters in washington the whole disaster unfolded because ankara believed it had total backing from the white house at the time similarly ankara s leader went to the un and compared israel to the nazis the strategies that led ankara to confront israel between 2016 and 2020 and which led to growing voices against saudi arabia in the us are linked similarly those who support the iran deal and those who sought to prevent israel gulf normalization are linked an israel that was isolated from the middle east was expected to be more compliant and dependent as such those who wanted an iran deal also wanted israel isolated so they could pressure it those who want saudi arabia jettisoned as a us partner are not necessarily the same group that wants israel isolated but the end result of their efforts is that if riyadh is given the cold shoulder which countries will anchor us policy will it be the gulf states such as the uae or qatar or do they want the us to leave the middle east turkey s decision to go from belligerent threats to trying to reconcile is tied to its sense of isolation this is a big difference from a decade or so ago when it was israel that appeared isolated the overall trend is not clear the domestic foreign nexus of us foreign policy has led to a decision to challenge america s historic alliances it has also led to sectarian arguments in the us about backing the sunnis and shi ites this also leads to deep differences over how some view israel saudi arabia and other countries the biden administration has pursued a traditional sense of us security policy minus turkey in the region the difference for the biden administration is that today unlike in the 1990s saudi arabia and israel appear to be converging on interests for some that tectonic shift is shocking for others it means the chance to anchor the us in several strong states in the region and not need to act as a shield for those countries

million reported for the prior year period the net interest margin for the three month period ended june 30 2022 is 3 27 compared to 2 91 for the linked quarter and 2 85 for the comparative prior year quarter when comparing the current quarter net interest margin to both comparative quarters the increase was due to a transition from lower yielding assets into investment securities and loans a reduction in interest bearing liabilities and higher short term interest rates resulting from actions of the federal open market committee fomc of the federal reserve bank compared to the linked quarter average balances of investment securities increased by 31 9 million and loans by 19 4 million these increases were funded through a reduction in average interest earning deposits at correspondent banks this shift resulted in an increase in the yield on earning assets of 34 basis point to 3 58 from 3 24 average balances of interest bearing liabilities dropped by 22 8 million comprised of a 19 8 million decline in interest bearing deposits and a 3 0 million decrease in borrowed funds the cost of interest bearing funds declined by 3 basis points to 0 31 from 0 34 compared to the prior year quarter ended june 30 2021 average balances of investment securities increased by 65 8 million and loans by 11 9 million the yield on earning assets improved by 37 basis points from

liabilities declined 5 basis points from 0 36 the fomc raised short term interest rates on march 17 2022 by 25 basis points which moved the wall street journal prime rate to 3 50 from 3 25 two additional rate hikes of 50 basis points on may 5 2022 and 75 basis points on june 16 2022 have raised the prime rate to 4 75 approximately 27 of the company s loan portfolio is variable rate due to the timing of the 2022 rate increases only the first increase of 25 basis points is fully reflected in the june 30 2022 quarter the second rate increase came about halfway through the quarter and the third with just less than half a month remaining it is widely anticipated that the fomc will raise short term interest rates again at the conclusion of its july 27 2022 meeting while we believe our net interest margin will continue to increase we do anticipate an increase in deposit rates will cause an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities and therefore slow the pace of margin increase net interest income is 18 7 million for the six month period ended june 30 2022 compared to 17 3 million for the prior year period ended june 30 2021 net interest margin for the current six month period is 3 08 compared to 2 86 for the comparative 2021 period the total yield on earning assets increased to 3 41 from 3 24 due to the increase in higher yielding assets the cost of funds declined by 5 basis points from 0 38 to 0 33 during the second quarter the company became aware of a loan system setting which affected the accounting for loan payments collected in prior years and applied to loans previously charged off and in non accrual status the setting adjustment resulted in the recognition of 291 000 in interest income the adjustment positively impacted the net interest margin for the current quarter by 8 basis points and for the six month period by 5 basis points non interest income total non interest income is 3 1 million for the current quarter compared to 2 7

than offset by a 315 000 decline in gains on the sale of originated mortgage loans and a 183 000 reduction in other non interest income the decline in other non interest income is due to a market value loss recorded on certain equity investments of 286 000 compared to losses of 61 000 for the prior year period gains on the sale of investment securities are 7 000 for the prior year period with no sales occurring in the current period non interest expense total non interest expense is 9 2 million for the quarter ended june 30 2022 compared to 9 0 million and 8 8 million for the march 2022

washington the u s house judiciary committee late wednesday passed legislation that would ban certain semi automatic weapons in a renewed push to ban the guns most commonly used in recent mass shootings the party line 25 18 vote followed recent mass shootings in which ar 15 style rifles were used in uvalde texas where 19 children and two teachers were murdered and buffalo new york where 10 people were killed the chair of the committee jerry nadler said that the more than 100 page bill that would place a ban on assault weapons h r 1808 is nothing new and congress passed a 10 year ban on assault weapons in 1994 if the ban were to be enacted into law anyone owning the firearm banned in the bill would have their weapons grandfathered in so they would not have to give up their firearms as we have learned all too well in recent years assault weapons especially when combined with high capacity magazines are the weapon of choice for mass shootings nadler said in his opening statement quite simply there is no place for them on our streets the bill would ban all semi automatic rifles that can have a detachable magazine and have a military feature such as a pistol grip a detachable stock or grenade launcher among other features it also bans all semi automatic rifles that have a fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds it also bans high capacity feeding devices such as magazines strips and drums that are capable of accepting more than 10 rounds the bill has a chance of passing the democratic controlled house but a slim chance of success in the evenly divided senate where it would need to reach a 60 vote threshold congress passed the most comprehensive federal gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years in late june preventing shootings democrats argued the ban would help prevent future mass shootings adding that schools places of worship movies and grocery stores have become dangerous places we are paying for these weapons of war on our streets with the blood of our children sitting in our classrooms rep lucy mcbath a georgia democrat who lost her son jordan to gun violence said rep david cicilline a rhode island democrat and the sponsor of the bill played a one minute audio clip of a student from the marjory stoneman douglas high school mass shooting in parkland florida in 2018 calling a 911 operator gunshots from the ar 15 used in the shooting could be heard as well as the screams of students dangerous military weapons that were created to fight on the battlefield and slaughter enemies do not belong in the neighborhoods and schools and movie theaters where we live cicilline said rep madeleine dean a pennsylvania democrat slammed republicans for refusing to address the fact that there are thousands of victims of mass shootings and that congress has a duty to try to prevent future mass shootings weapons of war republicans did not focus on the victims of mass shootings but instead argued that the assault rifles that democrats wanted to ban were not technically weapons of war rep thomas massie a kentucky republican said that democrats were trying to ban the most commonly sold sporting weapons democrats know this legislation will not reduce violent crime or reduce the likelihood of mass shootings but they are obsessed with attacking law abiding americans second amendment liberties the top republican on the committee rep jim jordan of ohio said jordan along with other gop members on the committee argued that a ban on assault weapons would not lead to fewer mass shootings and that the previous 10 year assault ban did not decrease violence research from a group of injury epidemiologists and trauma surgeons has shown that between 2004 and 2017 the last year of our analysis the average number of yearly deaths attributed to mass shootings was 25 compared with 5 3 during the 10 year tenure of the ban and 7 2 in the years leading up to the prohibition on assault weapons rep steve chabot an ohio republican said that adding a ban on assault weapons was a violation of the second amendment semi automatic firearms are protected by the constitution he said border dispute republican rep chip roy of texas introduced an amendment to the ban that would exempt those who live within 10 miles of international borders in order to protect themselves because the southern border is wide open and dangerous reps matt gaetz a florida republican and andy biggs an arizona republican neither of whom represent districts near the border tried to argue that the increase of migrants at the border posed a threat to americans the comments from biggs about the border caused a member of the audience gun safety advocate and marjory stoneman douglas school shooting survivor david hogg to interrupt the hearing he yelled at biggs that guns used in mass shootings in parkland buffalo and el paso texas did not come from mexico and that shooters were inspired by racist anti black anti immigrant manifestos that the gop is using as talking points capitol hill security escorted hogg out of the hearing room rep veronica escobar a texas democrat said the language that gaetz and biggs were using to describe immigrants was similar to the beliefs that drove a white supremacist to murder 23 latinos in her district in el paso on aug 3 2019 the racist manifesto from the gunman railed against a hispanic invasion he confessed that he did that in order to slaughter mexicans and immigrants and he used the same hateful language of the former president and the same hateful language that my colleagues delight in using escobar said escobar also said she knew that it would only be a matter of time before our republican colleagues pivoted to the border their mingling of xenophobia with guns was unfortunately only too predictable escobar pointed out that she is the only member of the committee who actually lives on the border and raises her children there this amendment and the language that they use is an invitation to violence she said republicans did not respond to her statements that their rhetoric could incite violence against immigrant communities the department of homeland security in june issued a warning that some domestic violent extremists have expressed grievances related to their perception that the u s government is unwilling or unable to secure the u s mexico border and have called for violence to stem the flow of undocumented migrants to the united states democrats spent most of the hearing arguing that a ban on assault weapons could have prevented mass shootings in las vegas in 2017 where 60 people were gunned down at a concert and another 413 shot the pittsburgh synagogue shooting in 2018 where 11 worshipers were murdered in an antisemitic attack and the aurora colorado movie theater shooting that left 10 dead and another 70 injured among others for god s sake parents in uvalde had to identify their children by dna sample because bullets ripped their children apart cicilline said so far this year there have been 356 mass shootings according to the gun violence archive gop amendments republicans submitted 11 amendments to the bill but none passed the amendments that republicans introduced touched on gop talking points such as an amendment from roy to prohibit people living in cities that have decreased police budgets from owning assault rifles another amendment from rep mike johnson a louisiana republican would exempt employees of pregnancy crisis centers from the ban the pregnancy crisis centers are not certified health clinics and are aimed at dissuading pregnant patients from seeking abortions repeal of liability shield the committee was scheduled to mark up another gun related bill one that would allow civil lawsuits against gun makers distributors sellers or trade associations in state or federal court but ran out of time the markup for that bill is not yet scheduled that bill h r 2814 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act provides immunity in state and federal courts from civil liability for licensed manufacturers distributors and dealers of firearms trade associations from negligence and product liability actions house democrats also held a wednesday hearing with several ceos of gun manufacturers looking at their role in gun violence the chair of the u s house committee on oversight and reform carolyn

the billionaire s latest acquisition has made people wonder why rich investors are so interested in gathering large tracts in late june the north dakota attorney general approved the purchase of 2 100 acres of farmland by a company tied to bill gates red river trust bought it from potato growers campbell farms for about 13 5 million according to legal documents obtained by fox business the sale was made last november media reports suggest that the reaction of locals to the deal was far from positive i ve gotten a big earful on this from clear across the state it s not even from that neighborhood those people are upset but there are others that are just livid about this north dakota agriculture commissioner doug goehring told local television station kfyr other concerns cited in the media insist that ultra rich who buy land in north dakota do not necessarily share the state s values before it was revealed that the deal had been approved the office of the attorney general sent red river trust a letter asking how the company planned to use the land in north dakota all corporations or limited liability companies llc are prohibited from owning or leasing farmland or ranchland and from engaging in farming or ranching in addition the law places certain limitations on the ability of trusts to own farmland or ranchland the corporate or limited liability company farming law has certain exemptions such as permitting registered family farms or allowing the use of the land for business purposes our office needs to confirm how your company uses this land and whether this use meets any of the statutory exceptions such as the business purpose exception the letter required an answer within 30 days but there s no information about whether red river trust had anything to reply meet farmer bill the news of the purchase made headlines as many people found it surprising that the microsoft co founder is spending so much money on agriculture still the north dakota case is just the latest example of a billionaire s investment in farmland making big news summarizing the data as of 2020 a magazine called the land report put bill gates photo on its cover with the caption meet farmer bill the outlet called gates and his then wife melinda america s largest private farmland owners in tracking the history of gates investments the land report cited a 2014 article from the wall street journal about a man named michael larson who according to the outlet has managed the billionaire s investment empire since 1994 mostly through a firm called cascade investment llc the wyoming ranch is part of a bet by cascade on the steep rebound in real estate prices since the financial crisis the wsj reported citing its sources the firm owns at least 100 000 acres of farmland in california illinois iowa louisiana and other states or an area seven times bigger than manhattan in 2021 the land report said that gates owned almost 269 000 acres across the country why are you buying so much farmland the same year reddit users had a chance to ask the microsoft co founder about the reasons behind such a large investment the question was hey bill why are you buying so much farmland my investment group chose to do this it is not connected to climate gates replied the agriculture sector is important with more productive seeds we can avoid deforestation and help africa deal with the climate difficulty they already face it is unclear how cheap biofuels can be but if they are cheap it can solve the aviation and truck emissions the uproar over gates latest land purchase created a wave of discussion online during the height of the covid pandemic the microsoft co founder was often in the limelight due to his pronouncements about the virus and even became the subject of conspiracy theories so there s no surprise that his unusual investment unleashed online gossip as well sparking rumors that the billionaire owns the majority of us farmland actually there are some 895 million acres of farmland in the country so even while being the largest private farmland owner gates actually has less than 1 of the country s total and no matter how eccentric the microsoft co founder can be the reasons behind his farmland investment are most likely mundane experts say if you look at farmland purchases in the united states the overwhelming majority is acquired by farmers the next largest group are people somehow close to farming like retired farmers or people from the rural area that are interested in purchasing land people who put together large portfolios are pretty rare todd h kuethe an associate professor in the department of agricultural economics at purdue university in the us told rt usually they re buying it for the financial position and so that land usually stays in production there s no disappearance of that land stable asset still bill gates years long investment in land elicited a question from analysts is farmland such an attractive asset the answer is yes for several reasons farmland is a limited resource offers strong returns and is a stable and low risk asset interest in farmland is rising and prices are climbing accordingly last year s data show the value of us farm real estate having averaged 3 380 per acre up 7 compared with 2020 the us farmland has been increasing in price in recent years because of high returns and low interest rates carl zulauf a professor emeritus in the department of agricultural environmental and development economics at the ohio state university explained to rt the high returns have been from the market and from government programs kuethe agrees it s a really nice thing to be added to a broad investment portfolio to give you some of those diversification advantages farmland is an attractive investment and a lot of folks see the value of adding it to an investment portfolio it s a relatively lower risk than investing in equities or buying individual stocks but it offers a little bit higher return than just bond purchases so it sits in the middle a financial investment where you can get a little bit higher return but not that much additional risk after all stability seems to mean a lot nowadays years of the covid 19 pandemic marked by lockdowns and the current conflict in ukraine which disrupted trade particularly of grain supplies made more countries look carefully at their food security still kuethe thinks that all of these factors are not enough to make individual businessmen buy land for personal consumption i don t think that investors are looking for farming for their own consumption they re still looking at producing commodities for the global market he says i don t have the concern that people are going to start buying up land and wanting to farm themselves because they re worried about food insecurity rt com

chaired by indonesia this year is being pushed into perilously sensitive terrain the group s leaders summit in mid november will be critically important but we cannot wait until then to address today s intertwined crises the g 20 should launch a virtual online process to start working toward a common coordinated response in advance of its november summit according to the world food programme wfp more than 800 million people are now chronically hungry with up to 323 million facing the prospect of starvation energy prices have soared and covid 19 continues to rage through the world s under vaccinated populations only 16 5 per cent of people in low income countries have been fully vaccinated moreover some 60 per cent of low income countries are in debt distress and communities around the world are experiencing droughts floods wildfires and other symptoms of climate breakdown in april un secretary general antónio guterres warned that today s confluence of crises could throw up to 1 7 billion people over one fifth of humanity into poverty destitution and hunger on a scale not seen in decades but though the situation is perilous we are not powerless to change it some multilateral initiatives have already been launched to address debt energy and food insecurity to be effective however such efforts must be coordinated and comprehensive our problems are too interconnected to be addressed piecemeal the immediate priority is to ensure fair prices and secure supplies across food and energy markets at least 10 billion is needed to bridge the wfp s financing shortfall this year so far international institutions and many governments have responded to the food crisis with initiatives such as the global alliance for food security which was launched this spring to coordinate humanitarian financing and investments in food system resilience and more than 80 countries have endorsed a us led roadmap for global food security call to action and there have been important regionally focused summits such as the mediterranean ministerial dialogue on the food security crisis and the uniting for global food security ministerial conference but even though it is well known that open trade is crucial to containing food insecurity more than 20 countries have imposed restrictions on food exports through export licenses taxes or outright bans while world trade organisation member states recently agreed to exempt the wfp s humanitarian purchases from export restrictions that is not enough we need to take full advantage of our knowledge of how the global food market operates both in the short and long run and in terms of both supply and reserves to that end major countries holding grain stocks in reserve should release them onto international markets to dampen further price increases and governments should strengthen the agricultural market information system to improve transparency and monitoring including of futures markets and to prevent speculation we must ensure that more countries can build self sufficiency through agricultural import diversification and more resilient domestic production where possible on energy italian prime minister mario draghi us president joe biden and others have discussed creating an oil purchasing cartel to negotiate better prices and there are many new initiatives to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy improve energy efficiency and reduce dependence on fossil fuels but we need to pick up the pace in the run up to november s united nations climate change conference in egypt for their part the international monetary fund imf and the multilateral development banks can and must do more to provide relief from today s food energy and debt crises only one quarter of the imf s trillion dollar balance sheet is currently committed to providing financial assistance and debt service relief to struggling countries likewise the world bank could lend more by negotiating a capital replenishment with its member states and by leveraging its triple a credit rating to crowd in private capital with loan guarantees to address the looming debt crisis we need a robust preemptive multilateral restructuring and relief initiative for developing countries with unsustainable debt burdens the share of low income countries in debt distress or at high risk of it has doubled from 30 per cent to 60 per centsince 2015 making matters worse many middle income countries credit ratings are being downgraded which means that they will face higher debt service costs especially now that the us federal reserve and other major central banks are tightening their monetary policies new initiatives to alleviate debt distress will need to go much further than similar recent efforts did the debt service suspension initiative dssi that was launched early in the pandemic has since expired after providing only 13 billion in temporary relief to 48 low income countries moreover it covered only official bilateral creditors thus excluding the private creditors who hold the largest share of developing country debt following the launch of the dssi the common framework for debt treatments was established to deal with sovereign insolvency and protracted liquidity problems in dssi eligible countries it is supposed to provide debt relief and restructuring consistent with a debtor s essential spending needs and capacity to pay but one and a half years after its inception only three countries have signed up chad ethiopia and zambia and none has successfully completed a debt restructuring with participation in the common framework currently limited to the 73 poorest countries the eligibility criteria may need to be reviewed and expanded and all creditors including china and the private sector will need to be incorporated into the process greater debt transparency is essential for effective sovereign debt renegotiation while securing chinese participation may prove difficult private sector participation can be required by regulation particularly in the united kingdom and the united states where there is already a precedent for this finally imf surcharges extra fees charged to highly indebted borrowing countries should be suspended immediately the number of countries incurring such costs has already risen from nine to 16 since the pandemic began and the imf projects that the total could rise to 38 by 2025 we are facing an unprecedented confluence of crises that could gravely jeopardise our future once again the world needs the g 20 to step up and act with resolve josé

intuitive nasdaq isrg reported second quarter results that failed to meet the consensus forecast on wall street with the surgical robotics giant warning that covid 19 will likely continue to have an adverse impact on da vinci procedure volumes sunnyvale california based intuitive said yesterday evening that it earned 308 million or 85 per share off 1 52 billion in revenue for the quarter ended june 30 2022 representing a 40 bottom line slide and a top line gain of 4 compared with the same quarter a year ago adjusted to exclude one time items earnings per share were 1 14 a nickel behind the street where analysts were looking for eps of 1 19 on sales of 1 56 billion worldwide da vinci procedures were up 14 year over year in q2 but system placements were down 15 during a conference call with analysts top company officials said that trade ins of da vinci robots are significantly down because there s a lower volume of older generation systems out there supply chain disruptions especially in the semiconductor space negatively affected the timing of system builds to meet orders hospitals meanwhile are feeling pressures on their spending looking to achieve more efficiency gains off existing capital equipment before acquiring more intuitive ceo gary guthart noted that customer demand for procedures was healthy in the second quarter despite a challenging global environment that included covid 19 lockdowns in the company s second largest market china the leading indicator of the health of our business procedure demand remains healthy he said work continues on next generations of intuitive s robotic systems though guthart noted that deeper technological opportunities and clinical impact also mean deeper validation work and we re not afraid of that work i d rather do things that are really clinically meaningful for the customer so it s taking a little longer to get to market than it used to maybe more than a little it s costing us more to get there but that change in environment also means that really well designed systems probably have longer useful life in the field and i think we re starting to see that early evidence of that as well investors reacted by sending isrg shares down more than 12 to 197 49 apiece in after hours trading by the middle of the next day they were just down more than 5 to 212 48 apiece massdevice s medtech 100 index which includes stocks of the world s largest medical device companies was down slightly btig analyst ryan zimmerman walked away from yesterday evening s earnings call weighing two divergent assertions that seemed obvious in hindsight robotic surgery procedures remain solid as customers increase utilization but the hospital capital expenditure environment is worse than expected we are maintaining our buy as we think the sell off will be bought up by investors coupled with isrg s own share buybacks and on the potential for a next gen system launch we think these are the catalysts needed to get shares working again this article originally ran on thursday july 21 2022 updated july 22 with the nest day stock price analyst quote

snap has missed its second quarter earnings posting revenue of us 1 11 billion for the quarter ended 30 june while this was a 13 increase compared to the prior year the company missed its previous guidance of 20 to 25 its net loss was us 422 million compared to us 152 million in the prior year while the continued growth of our community increases the long term opportunity for our business our financial results for q2 do not reflect the scale of our ambition we are not satisfied with the results we are delivering regardless of the current headwinds the company said in its investor letter snap added that platform policy changes have upended more than a decade of ad industry standards and macroeconomic challenges have disrupted many of the industry segments that have been most critical to the growing demand for snap s ad solutions we are also seeing increasing competition for advertising dollars that are now growing more slowly our revenue growth has substantially slowed and we are evolving our business and strategy to adapt snap explained while it is working to reaccelerate growth and take share snap believes it will likely take some time before it sees significant improvements snap explained that the combination of macroeconomic headwinds platform policy changes and increased competition have limited the growth of campaign budgets in some cases advertisers have lowered their bids per action to reflect their current willingness to pay for example in some industries where topline growth remains strong but businesses are experiencing input cost pressure due to inflation snap has observed reduced marketing spending and lower bids per action despite this snap still sees significant room to drive growth via its direct response ad platform it will focus on three core priorities improving its privacy preserving first party measurement tools ensure its ad performance is well represented in advertisers preferred third party measurement solutions and continuing its investment in ranknig and personalisation the company s dismal results also led to companies involved in advertising including meta and alphabet losing about us 80 billion in combined stock market value reuters reported snap s shares also dipped 26 bringing its loss this year to over 70 and also led to the company losing us 7 billion of its market capitalisation reuters added

greene the maine department of inland fisheries and wildlife is in the process of developing a public boat launch on allen pond increasing access to recreational opportunities just miles from maine s second largest urban area the state signed a contract with a private landowner in december to purchase a 4 acre parcel on the northeast side of the pond for 150 000 according to mdifw chief planner diano circo the planned launch would meet americans disabilities act standards providing a level of access that is difficult to find in the lewiston auburn area he said however members of the allen pond improvement association say they are concerned by the environmental impacts of more boat traffic particularly motor boats and jet skis in the narrow shallow pond several members said the state should have studied the impacts of a new boat launch on allen pond and talked with the association before purchasing the property more than a third of the 188 acre pond is designated as a no wake zone under state law members shared allen pond has a small carry in launch on thomas road owned by the town with room to park three vehicles without trailers acquiring land to build a state boat launch on allen pond has been a high priority since allen pond campground and its publicly accessible launch were sold to a developer in 2004 circo said the state is working to develop more launches accessible for people with mobility difficulties near population centers across the state advertisement our goal is really to make sure that there s a fair and equitable opportunity for the general public to enjoy those waters in a similar way to those who have shorefront property circo said under a colonial era law all maine lakes and ponds that cover more than 10 acres are public property however as the state s population grows and maine s shorefront becomes more developed access especially to small lakes and ponds not far from urban areas has become more difficult still residents said the water quality of the pond has noticeably improved since the campground launch was closed and two pairs of loons have since started nesting on its shores increased traffic also poses a greater risk of introducing invasive plants into the pond they said the state has to really do a study and make sure that that boat launch is not going to kill this pond suzanne rousseau president of the association said this pond is fragile already circo said the state will consider the environmental impacts to the pond while designing the launch and has already conducted a survey on the existing use of the pond he counted more than 90 homes and camps surrounding the pond some of which have larger pontoon boats and 100 horsepower engines parts of the lake are shallow that s absolutely true circo said but it doesn t mean that the public shouldn t be allowed to access that advertisement cheryl paluso who lives next to the property planned for a boat launch said she and other members of the association were unaware of the proposed project until a surveyor visited the lot she and other members of the association spoke with circo but said they were not satisfied with his responses or willingness to answer questions about the project the association has contacted the governor s office with their concerns and has submitted a freedom of information act request for all public records related the property survey the purchase of the property and other documents hoping to learn more about the project all that s happening right now is acquisition of a piece of property circo said adding that he is unable to answer most questions about the proposed launch because it has yet to be designed still he said he s happy to talk with anyone who has concerns about the project stocking fish and increasing boating access to allen pond has been something of a controversial topic in greene for many years adding the new launch to allen pond would likely mean that the state would pay to stock the pond in the fall of 2021 greene paid 7 600 to stock the pond with 500 brook and rainbow trout according to town manager carol buzzell selectman anthony reny said the state and town discussed expanding the allen pond launch a couple years ago but the project never moved forward abutting land would need to be acquired for the expansion he explained advertisement reny said he has spoken with circo about the project on allen pond his response made sense to me he said adding that he understands residents concerns he confirmed that there has been problematic activity at the cherry pond launch but stated simply that the pond is public property circo said once the state owns the property an engineer will be hired to help the state determine what is possible to build on the site the state will later need to go before the town to seek permits and hold a public hearing he added noting that this is the stage residents and the pond association will be able to provide input on the plans send questions

the nation s pro migration border chief says his policies match the pro migrant goals of immigrants not the goals set by congress or the goals preferred by citizens i am to a great extent aligned with the expectations of the immigrant community the cuban born border chief alejandro mayorkas told an audience at the aspen institute on july 19 those expectations match my ambitions for what we want to do at the department of homeland security dhs said mayorkas who described himself as a refugee from cuba they reflect i think the president s ambitions for what our country needs and who we are mayorkas said echoing his prior claims that americans must ensure their homeland is a nation of immigrants not a nation for citizens it seems like he does not actually want to be the secretary of homeland security but that he views himself as the champion of illegal aliens getting immigration benefits in the united states said robert law the director of the center for homeland security and immigration at the america first policy institute he s got the wrong job if that s what his perspective is law told breitbart news dhs secretary alejandro mayorkas dodged on how many people the agency expects to come to the border after title 42 ends breitbart news breitbartnews april 2 2022 mayorkas was gently interviewed by msnbc host trymaine lee despite the economic damage that mayorkas inflicts on americans including black americans lee did not ask him about the economic pain caused by the flood of foreign labor and renters msnbc is owned by comcast which uses mayorkas agency to import visa workers that displace americans since february 2021 mayorkas has dramatically expanded the policy of extraction migration which pulls workers consumers and renters into the u s economy this post 1990 bipartisan policy has forced down americans wages pushed up their rents expanded civic chaos and spiked political tensions while shifting vast wealth to the stock market older investors and coastal towns during that period roughly 30 million legal and illegal migrants have arrived including at least 3 million legal illegals visa workers overstays refugees and others since biden s inauguration that flood has tilted the economy away from ordinary americans in favor of investors migrants and coastal property owners this month 75 percent of americans who earn between 30 000 and 100 000 say their income is dropping amid inflation says a survey by primerica that is a jump from 67 percent in march says the survey which also notes that people are cutting back on restaurants and groceries mayorkas insisted the border is secure even though he also admitted that the migrants are not safe from death or rape but his policy is to admit the vast wave of illegal migrants so his vision of an orderly and efficient border is compatible with a vast wave of job seeking economic migrants mayorkas unable to say if illegal alien terrorists have been released into american cities pic twitter com 9boobk11fm breitbart news breitbartnews april 29 2022 to the extent that anyone thinks anything is secure at the border what they really mean is the processing centers where they are just waving people through responded law mayorkas has decided the interests of activist groups are more important than the interests of the american people who put laws on the books through their elected representatives for a reason said jon feere at the center for immigration studies he told breitbart news those reasons are plentiful from concerns about the impact on the labor market to public safety concerns to national security concerns there s a real impact from his non enforcement agenda that is having a negative impact on families across the country in many different ways and it leaves the public wondering what recourses are left to get the outcomes we thought we were going to get through the legislative process mayorkas however suggested that the public s growing opposition to his agenda is illegitimate the divisiveness in this country creates risk and in that divide come foreign adversaries who exploit it who spread disinformation to drive people s behavior who exacerbate the divide and who have an interest in our weakness and our downfall there would be less division in our country if the american people felt that the laws on the books were being enforced responded feere adding his non enforcement agenda is having a negative impact on families across the country in many different ways and it leaves the public wondering what recourses are left to get the outcomes we thought we were going to get through the legislative process what happens when a political appointee decides to ignore sections of federal law what recourse do the american people have his failure to enforce the law is immediately creating public safety threats but long term it s doing damage to our democratic institutions mayorkas is a pro migration zealot who has repeatedly declared his emotional support for migrants over americans interests he has repeatedly described himself as a political refugee from cuba in 1960 and he repeatedly declines to use his extensive executive authority to protect the economic civic and political interests of americans for example he has decided that illegals can remain in the united states to compete for jobs and housing as long as they do not commit violent crimes unlawful presence in the united states alone will not be a basis for immigration enforcement action it is a matter of justice and equity as well he told the u s conference of mayors in washington in january 2022 the core founding principle of the united states is equity and he is building an immigration system built on equity mayorkas declared at an april 2022 meeting hosted by al sharpton s national action network justice is our priority mayorkas declared at a november 2021 senate hearing adding that includes securing our border and providing relief to those who qualify for it under our laws but polls show that voters are ready to punish the democrats in november for enabling mayorkas extremist migration first agenda a political rebuke in november would give the gop leaders an opportunity to build a broad national consensus on migration in 2023 but only if they decide to bypass their pro migration donors yet mayorkas s pro migration policies are still backed by fellow radicals in biden s administration some governors are using migrants as a political tool as a political play white house spokeswoman karine jen pierre said on july 20 we should be making sure that we re doing everything that we can to help folks who are coming into this process in a legal way and making sure that we do this in a safe way and a respectful way and i think it s shameful that is happening said jean pierre a haitian immigrant abc s karen travers asks karine jean pierre if the white house will be providing any relief to new york city and washington d c because

2022 extraction migration since at least 1990 the d c establishment has extracted tens of millions of legal and illegal migrants plus temporary visa workers from poor countries to serve as workers managers consumers and renters for various u s investors and ceos this federal economic policy of extraction migration has skewed the free market in the united states by inflating the labor supply for the benefit of employers the inflationary policy makes it difficult for ordinary americans to get married advance in their careers raise families or buy homes extraction migration has also slowed innovation and shrunk americans productivity partly because it allows employers to boost stock prices by using cheap stoop labor instead of productivity boosting technology migration undermines employees workplace rights and it widens the regional wealth gaps between the democrats big coastal states and the republicans heartland and southern states the flood of cheap labor tilts the economy towards low productivity jobs and has shoved at least ten million american men out of the labor force an economy built on extraction migration also drains americans political clout over elites alienates young people and radicalizes americans democratic civic culture because it allows wealthy elites to ignore despairing americans at the bottom of society the economic policy is backed by progressives who wish to transform the u s from a society governed by european origin civic culture into a progressive directed empire of competitive resentful identity groups we re trying to become the first multiracial multi ethnic superpower in the world rep rohit khanna d ca told the new york times in march 2022 it will be an extraordinary achievement we will ultimately triumph he boasted the progressives colonialism like economic strategy kills many migrants it exploits poor foreigners and splits foreign families as it extracts human resources from poor home countries to serve wealthy u s investors this migration policy also minimizes shareholder pressure on u s companies to build up beneficial and complementary trade with people in poor countries business backed migration advocates hide this extraction migration economic policy behind a wide variety of noble sounding explanations and theatrical border security programs for example progressives claim that the u s is a nation of immigrants that migration is good for migrants and that the state must renew itself by replacing populations the polls show the public wants to welcome some immigration but they also show deep and broad public opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young u s graduates the opposition is growing anti establishment multiracial cross sex non

this story was originally published by grist you can subscribe to its weekly newsletter here last year congress allocated 3 5 billion over five years to a little known federal program designed to help low income households pay for energy efficiency upgrades like attic insulation new windows and energy saving appliances called the weatherization assistance program or wap it s one of the best tools the biden administration has at its disposal to lower carbon emissions while investing in underserved communities wap has historically been funded at a few hundred million dollars per year serving only about 0 2 percent of low income households annually by one estimate so a new average of 700 million per year is a big deal but funding isn t the only factor preventing wap from reaching more people the program has a fundamental flaw many homeowners who are eligible for wap upgrades based on their income are ultimately turned away by program administrators or deferred told that their homes require repairs before any energy efficiency improvements can be made repairs they often can t afford deferrals are a significant problem for equity because the households that could stand to benefit the most are not able to access a significant source of federal funding said gabriel chan an associate professor of public policy at the university of minnesota plus the conditions that cause deferrals plumbing problems asbestos and leaking roofs to name a few layer health burdens on top of energy burdens he said a new program in pennsylvania aims to address the issue earlier this month the legislature voted to create a 125 million whole home repairs program as part of the state budget in addition to paying directly for new roofs septic systems and other structural repairs the money will go toward building up the state s administrative capacity to help people apply to the program and developing the skilled workforce available to do the repair and weatherization work it was a rare win for progressive pennsylvania democrats who secured bipartisan support in the republican controlled legislature the issue cuts across geographies and partisan lines said nikil saval the first term state senator from philadelphia who spearheaded the policy virtually all of the legislators i talked to democratic or republican recognize the issue in their districts the issue isn t just lack of access to energy efficiency funding it s an aging housing stock with homes falling into disrepair which can lead to abandonment which can contribute to the collapse of communities health and safety issues have also been exacerbated by the increase in extreme weather due to climate change saval s program garnered support from community organizers like angelo ortega an allentown pennsylvania resident whose house suffered damages when the remnants of hurricane ida blew through last year he had just moved into his mother s house to take care of her after an injury and was supposed to stay in the finished basement but it flooded during the storm almost a year later he and his mother who suffers from asthma are still trying to manage problems with mildew and can t afford the work required to prevent future flooding friends of his in the community are in need of major roof repairs ortega is a member of make the road pennsylvania a grassroots organization that advocates for working class latino communities he said once make the road started spreading the word about saval s whole home repairs proposal a lot more people began showing up at their biweekly meetings and ortega learned how widespread the need for the program was we didn t know that there were so many persons with problems with their roofs water decay and persons with similar situations like myself with the basement flooding he told grist it was an all out expense for some of them according to the most recent u s census american housing survey some 280 000 homes in pennsylvania lack adequate plumbing heating or electricity or have physical deficiencies like leaky roofs or pipes but it s unclear how many homeowners get deferred from the weatherization program neither the department of energy nor the state collects data on how many people apply to the program or how many are turned away the pennsylvania department of community and economic development the state agency that distributes wap funding recently surveyed the local agencies that actually implement the program to get a sense of how many homes were being deferred and came up with an estimate of 36 percent better data could be on the way the u s department of energy recently told npr that it aims to begin tracking deferrals in spring 2023 however the agency s instructions to states tribes and territories for 2022 says that tracking deferrals is optional saval s whole home repairs program isn t the first aimed at addressing the issue vermont has a zero deferral policy scraping together funds from different sources to pay for repairs since 2016 delaware has run a pre weatherization program that s funded by proceeds from the regional greenhouse gas initiative a partnership between several eastern states that forces power plant operators to buy permits to pollute steve luxton the ceo of the energy coordinating agency a nonprofit that s responsible for administering wap in delaware and philadelphia said the former s pre weatherization program is as good as it could possibly get to be honest with you luxton estimates that in both places close to 50 percent of eligible applicants are deferred due to structural issues in this case rather than saying well i got bad news for you we just let them know that you ve got this issue they don t have to fill out documents or anything we can take most of the information we already have and pretty much do what we have to do connecticut is launching a roughly 8 million weatherization barrier remediation program to pay for repairs this year and last week the department of energy announced several million in grants that will go to city and state agencies around the country for pre weatherization work the challenge for pennsylvania and for many of these other programs is finding a stable source of funding both pennsylvania and connecticut s programs are backed by grants from the american rescue plan act the covid 19 stimulus package congress passed last year we will need to find a recurring source of funding because this is one time dollars said saval
