the joke going around shortly before uk finance minister kwasi kwarteng got fired on friday 14 october was that he was having trouble getting a flight back to the uk from the imf conference in washington because nobody wanted him near business or economy it didn t make much difference though because uk prime minister liz truss fired him as soon as he did get back appointing jeremy hunt in his stead the question now is whether the uk s crazy markets will calm down to an ordinary panic and i think the simple answer is they won t kwarteng may be leaving but the policies he outlined very explicitly belonged to truss sadly it turns out that you can t really signal a major change of policy by firing yourself although i often think some politicians should give it serious consideration in any event as the leader you are left in the unfortunate position of having to pretend someone else is responsible as they say a greater love hath no political leader than that they lay down the lives of their friends for their own but because the fault was so obviously truss s in the first place the chance that she will now enjoy a clean slate from the british financial markets seems unlikely and what exactly is the problem on the face of it all truss did was promise tax cuts which if you are a conservative politician in the uk is like breathing the problem as a british friend explained to me is that neither truss nor kwarteng seemed ready to acknowledge that the era of easy money is over that along with the global reappraisal of the world s economic position gave british markets the heebie jeebies tax cuts are generally speaking enormously popular with both financial markets and the general populace the idea of funding the shortfall with borrowings would normally be viewed benignly when it is possible for the government to borrow at interest rates pegged more or less at zero visit daily maverick s home page for more news analysis and investigations but times have changed rather dramatically and with interest rates in the developed world at around 10 the cost of borrowing is now unlikely to be negligible kwarteng s mini budget which included some thumping 6 billion expenditure to cap gas bills didn t seem to acknowledge this new reality kwarteng was planning to cancel a proposed increase in corporation taxes next april from 19 to 25 but truss beat him to it and reversed the 18 billion corporation tax cut the problem is that the uk s bond market was already pricing in a u turn on the tax cuts so this decision doesn t help matters much the pound which was rebounding slipped even more against the dollar on the announcement as a south african it s funny to hear the british government pay homage to the notion of fiscal constraint in his resignation letter kwarteng wrote it is important now as we move forward to emphasise your government s commitment to fiscal discipline as a serial offender in that department we in south africa would like to issue a warm welcome mr kwarteng as you join us here in the dunce s corner this may all seem very far away from us and vaguely amusing in a cynical kind of way trust me it is not one of the unpleasant little secrets that is now leaking out is how many pension funds in the uk were riding very heavily on very low interest rates at a point this past week a whole bunch of pension funds were issued with margin calls as long term bonds in the uk spiked just the idea of pension funds being issued with margin calls is mind blowing pension funds are supposed to be immune to the kinds of issues the riff raff in the hedge fund business face all the time usually fly by the seat of your pants stock traders using new fangled mathematical equations are the ones who face margin calls when things go pear shaped pension fund investors have long term obligations and they match those long term obligations by buying government bonds called gilts in the uk and then they go on holiday to bournemouth for a very long time alas it s not as simple as that because the uk market is still dominated by defined benefit funds it turns out that long term obligations are hard to satisfy with the meagre earnings you get from government bonds so most uk pension funds vuka their bond investments with something a bit more risky but which pays off at a higher rate and that means there is a lot more hot money in the uk pension fund system than anyone anticipated as a result the uk s reserve bank has been adding liquidity to the market to stop a bad situation from getting worse but in doing so its credibility as an inflation fighting force is now in question this is a very difficult tightrope to walk as we all know as my colleague ed stoddard keeps pointing out south africa has an extremely tough minded reserve bank governor in lesetja kganyago who is always getting it in the ear from cavalier left wing economists for not loosening south africa s monetary policy south africa has lots of things to feel aggrieved about but a credible reserve bank is not one of them it s at moments like this that the utility of facing down the fiscal loonies becomes crystal clear bm dm
he wasn t the only one who thought so the us president added us president joe biden has said that uk prime minister liz truss was wrong to try to solve britain s economic troubles by aggressively cutting taxes this comes amid media reports claiming that mps from truss own conservative party were looking for ways to remove her from office due to her economic failures i wasn t the only one that thought it was a mistake biden said on sunday of truss budget now mostly abandoned he was speaking to reporters at an ice cream shop in portland oregon during an unannounced campaign stop for the democratic party s candidate for governor tina kotek i think that the idea of cutting taxes on the super wealthy at a time when anyway i disagree with the policy the president said adding that the failure of the new uk pm s mini budget was predictable however biden acknowledged that it was up to great britain to make that choice not me the remarks were a rare instance of a us leader criticizing the domestic policies of one of washington s closest allies truss and her cabinet introduced radical tax cuts to counter high inflation and soaring energy prices in the uk which are believed to have been provoked by the economic strain caused by the covid 19 pandemic and the fallout from the international sanctions imposed on russia over the conflict in ukraine however the policy caused havoc in financial markets and a sharp drop in the value of the pound which almost reached parity with the dollar early last week on friday truss sacked kwasi kwarteng her chancellor of the exchequer and announced a reversal of plans to cut corporate taxes contrary to what s happening in the uk the american economy is strong as hell biden claimed i m concerned about the rest of the world the problem is the lack of economic growth and sound policy in other countries he said rt com
fundamental tax reform remains a top agenda item for many in congress especially for house ways and means committee chairman paul ryan r wi and senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch r ut the country needs fundamental tax reform because the tax code is stifling economic freedom and preventing the economy from being vibrant and prosperous fundamental tax reform would alleviate the harm caused by the tax system and could realistically increase the size of the economy by up to 15 percent over 10 years few economic policy initiatives offer a better chance to improve the incomes of all americans and enhance economic opportunities congress should pursue fundamental tax reform regrettably there is little reason to believe that the white house will be a willing partner in pursuing tax reform president barack obama has never indicated that he wants to fundamentally reform the entire tax code nor has he shown any willingness to lead such an effort in practice presidential leadership has proved vital for successful tax reform however president obama has said that he would like to reform only the corporate side of the tax code in fact he quietly released a framework for such a plan in 2012 since then he has done little to push the plan through congress except to include it in his past two budgets the details of the framework are problematic but it at least shows that the president is willing to consider the issue chairmen ryan and hatch as well as other leaders in congress have expressed willingness to reform the business side of the tax code as a first step to full tax reform however before congress undertakes this difficult endeavor members of congress need to have the proper goal in mind of what the completed plan should look like the necessity of business tax reform before reforming business taxes it is useful to understand why reform of the current system is necessary traditionally the impetus for tax reform has originated from concerns about the individual side of the code today the most important purpose of tax reform is to reform the antiquated business tax system because it is a major impediment to achieving prosperity economic growth and higher real wages high tax rate the biggest problem with the business tax system is the high tax rate the u s corporate tax rate exceeds 39 1 percent when including the average rate of the states the federal rate is 35 percent and the states add an average of more than 4 percentage points the u s corporate tax rate is the highest rate among the developed nations defined as the 34 members of the organization for economic co operation and development oecd the average oecd corporate tax rate is 25 3 percent placing the u s substantially above the norm pass through entities usually smaller firms are subject to tax rates as high as 43 4 percent just at the federal level although they are not subject to tax at the entity level in 2011 pass through entities employed more than 50 percent of the private sector workforce and earned 64 percent of all business income according to irs data there were 3 2 million partnerships 4 2 million s corporations and 1 6 million c corporations in 2011 these high rates discourage investment in the u s businesses by both u s and foreign businesses less investment in the u s means fewer jobs and lower wages for u s workers worldwide tax system in addition to high rates the u s is effectively the only major developed country that uses a worldwide tax system to tax its businesses on the income earned abroad most other countries use a territorial system that taxes businesses on only the income that they earn within the country s borders the other six oecd countries that use a worldwide system are chile greece ireland israel south korea and mexico yet each of these six countries has a top corporate income tax rate that is lower than the u s rate making their worldwide systems less economically damaging than the u s worldwide regime the worldwide system in the u s coupled with the high tax rate means that u s businesses pay an extra tax on income that they earn abroad this extra tax reduces the foreign investment that they are willing to make this reduces jobs and wages for u s workers both because u s owned foreign corporations are more likely to buy from the u s and because u s headquartered companies create jobs in the u s when they have successful foreign operations in the mid 1980s the u s business tax system was in line with international norms the rate was competitive and other countries taxed their businesses on a worldwide basis however in the roughly 30 years since other developed countries have aggressively cut their rates and moved to territorial systems because of the tremendous benefits that these policies create for their economies by standing still during those years the u s has fallen behind it now has an anachronistic business tax system that is ill suited for the modern global economy cumbersome depreciation system the cumbersome depreciation system for capital investments in the u s tax code adds to the uncompetitive business environment the u s capital cost recovery system is much worse than the oecd average the concept of depreciating assets wrongly leaked into the tax code from financial accounting which is concerned with determining the financial value of a business tax accounting should not necessarily follow the conventions of financial accounting when accounting for the capital expenses for tax purposes businesses should be able to deduct the full cost of assets at the time they purchase them this is known as expensing anything short of expensing such as current depreciation rules raises the cost of capital and creates a bias against investment by forcing businesses to delay deducting their capital expenses sometimes for as long as 39 years this creates cash flow problems and because of the time value of money makes investments in plants machinery equipment and structures more costly higher capital costs reduce investment therefore reducing the productivity of american workers slowing economic growth and harming the competitiveness of u s businesses furthermore the artificial depreciation timelines created by congress can tilt the market in favor of some forms of capital and against others leading to a less efficient allocation of capital and a smaller economy three phases to achieve the best business tax system assuming a tax on businesses is necessary the best business tax system that congress could establish is a cash flow tax also known as an inflow outflow tax a cash flow tax starts with a business s gross receipts and allows deductions for all business expenses including the cost of labor inputs and capital investment when the business incurs the expenses if properly structured such a tax would eliminate the double taxation of business income a flat tax rate applies to the remaining income preferably one that would be competitive with other developed nations the heritage foundation s new flat tax would establish a cash flow tax a cash flow type tax can also deny a deduction for labor costs to allow for a significantly lower rate therefore taxing labor and capital factor incomes equally at the business level rather than just taxing capital income at the business level this variation is known as a business transfer tax transitioning to such a system would take time given the political and practical difficulties therefore this paper establishes a three phase pathway to reforming the business tax code that would go a long way toward simplifying the current system improving its fairness and promoting job growth and economic prosperity in america phase 1 achievable reforms that would begin unleashing growth the business tax system inhibits economic growth job creation and wage increases because it levies the highest corporate tax in the world denies full expensing for business investment and taxes the foreign earnings of u s businesses congress should first seek to ameliorate the pain caused by these problems with immediately achievable policies specifically congress should lower the corporate tax rate the u s tax rate of approximately 39 percent is the highest among oecd countries this high rate is likely the heaviest drag on the economy in the entire tax code it greatly curtails domestic investment by both u s and foreign firms lowering the corporate tax rate would greatly improve the economy and job and wage growth for american families president obama s business reform plan sets the corporate rate at 28 percent although that is still too high it would be better than the current rate and would be a first step to lowering the rate enough to re establish the competiveness of u s businesses in the global economy it could serve as a starting point for negotiations between congress and the president the u s tax rate of approximately 39 percent is the highest among oecd countries this high rate is likely the heaviest drag on the economy in the entire tax code it greatly curtails domestic investment by both u s and foreign firms lowering the corporate tax rate would greatly improve the economy and job and wage growth for american families president obama s business reform plan sets the corporate rate at 28 percent although that is still too high it would be better than the current rate and would be a first step to lowering the rate enough to re establish the competiveness of u s businesses in the global economy it could serve as a starting point for negotiations between congress and the president tax pass through and c corporations at the same rate a potential pitfall to business tax reform is the disparity between the rates that c corporations and pass through businesses pay pass through entities are subchapter s corporations limited liability companies llcs and partnerships that do not pay income tax at the entity level instead the owners of the business must report the entity s income on the owners individual tax returns sole proprietorships also pay business income taxes on their individual tax returns c corporations pay the 39 percent combined federal and state corporate tax rate pass throughs pay the individual rate 39 6 percent at the federal level plus state income tax rates pass throughs also pay an obamacare 3 8 percent surtax when all these taxes are added together some pass through businesses pay nearly 50 percent in many states far in excess of the rates that c corporations pay if business tax reform lowered the corporate rate and made no changes to the treatment of pass throughs it would greatly exacerbate this already large inequity instead they should be taxed at the same rate an additional risk for pass through businesses is that business tax reform would broaden the business tax base that applies to both c corporations and pass throughs but only reduce the c corporation tax rate this would constitute a large tax increase on pass throughs which are often small or start up companies that are the source of most job creation in principle business tax reform should equalize the rates that all businesses pay and eliminate the double taxation of business income there are two basic ways to accomplish this result first all businesses could be taxed at the entity level and subsequent payments in the form of dividends or distributions from the business to its owners could be free of additional tax second all business entities could be treated as pass through entities in general however entity level taxation is administratively more appropriate for larger firms with widely held ownership in which shares are traded often pass through status is more appropriate for closely held businesses in which ownership changes are less frequent an identical rate for both types of businesses could be established while still adhering to this principle a potential pitfall to business tax reform is the disparity between the rates that c corporations and pass through businesses pay pass through entities are subchapter s corporations limited liability companies llcs and

established while still adhering to this principle lower taxes on the foreign income of u s businesses president obama and former chairman of the house ways and means committee dave camp r mi both recognized the harmful effects of worldwide taxation and both included lower rates on certain types of foreign income in their respective business tax reform plans president obama proposed taxing such income at 19 percent in his most recent budget camp proposed a 15 percent rate whether congress adopts a rate in this range or a lower rate on all overseas earnings as long as the foreign tax credit and deferral are maintained a reduced rate would be a positive step toward a territorial regime and would spark a surge of domestic investment members of congress have discussed changing the tax treatment of the untaxed foreign earnings of u s businesses without fixing the current broken system of international taxation some want to lower the tax rate on this income so that businesses will bring it back either to generate extra revenue to pay for new spending or to spur economic growth both justifications are highly dubious given the interest in changing repatriation policy congress will likely revive the issue if it embarks on business tax reform the approaches outlined above are intermediate and would not fix the problems caused by the worldwide system going forward congress should change repatriation policy only as part of tax reform that creates a true territorial system that permanently addresses the problems an intermediate business plan that does not move toward a true territorial system should not include repatriation changes president obama and former chairman of the house ways and means committee dave camp r mi both recognized the harmful effects of

only as part of tax reform that creates a true territorial system that permanently addresses the problems an intermediate business plan that does not move toward a true territorial system should not include repatriation changes make bonus depreciation permanent bonus depreciation more precisely referred to as 50 percent expensing allows most businesses to deduct 50 percent of most of their capital purchases in the year in which the businesses purchased them this provision has been law for several years allowing it to lapse would move cost recovery policy in the wrong direction and constitute a substantial tax hike congress should improve certainty and solidify the improvement by making 50 percent expensing permanent this would substantially reduce the cost of capital and would increase investment productivity and real wages phase 2 good governance once congress makes the changes in phase 1 it should repair parts of the business tax system that have long needed shoring up these policies will not have as much positive impact on economic growth as those in phase 1 but they are important aspects of the current system that hurt economic growth and that congress has left unaddressed for too long congress should eliminate unjustified corporate tax preferences the corporate tax code has many economically unjustified tax preferences although not as many as is commonly assumed notably provisions that allow businesses to deduct their capital expenses are not tax preferences most true tax preferences are provisions used by individuals nevertheless congress should eliminate these unjustified business tax preferences because it is good policy and will improve economic efficiency eliminating business tax preferences would help to offset a portion of the cost of pro growth advancements on the business side of the tax code as such their elimination should not be construed as a tax increase yet even eliminating all of the tax preferences listed in table 1 is unlikely to offset the entire cost of pro growth policy improvements especially as scored on a static basis by the joint committee on taxation eliminating all of the genuine tax preferences would fund only a small reduction in the corporate rate according to the congressional budget office cbo tax receipts will comfortably exceed their historical average over the next decade there is room for a tax cut especially if in the long run it proves to be small or non existent on a dynamic basis and would substantially improve economic growth job creation and real wage growth when congress fully establishes a cash flow system scrapping unnecessary business tax preferences will not raise enough to offset the entire amount of lost revenue on a static basis it is important that congress accept a business tax cut as the price of reversing its policy of forcing american businesses to operate under the least competitive tax system in the industrialized world such a tax system would create a strong dynamic feedback for revenues because it would markedly improve economic growth and the incomes and opportunities for all americans both factors should make congress much more amenable to a business tax cut retirement account simplification few small employers offer retirement accounts because of the complexity high compliance costs and regulatory risks this makes it more difficult for them to attract employees and more difficult for small business owners and their employees to save for retirement this is one of the most complex areas of the tax law and desperately needs simplification one possible solution would be to amend the internal revenue code to create a small business uniform retirement account as a voluntary alternative for employers with 500 or fewer employees which they could choose instead of 1 simplified employee pensions seps 2 salary reduction seps 3 simple ira plans 4 simple 401 k plans 5 keogh plans 6 regular 401 k s 7 profit sharing plans

reporting and moderate backup withholding whether a payee is an employee or a contractor phase 3 finishing the job with a complete cash flow tax in the final phase of business reform congress should finish the job by fully instituting a cash flow system for all businesses the policies laid out below assume congress has already applied the same rate to c corporations and pass through businesses specifically congress should lower the business tax rate to 20 percent the u s tax rate of approximately 39 percent includes an average state corporate income tax of 4 percent ideally the overall u s business tax rate should be lower than the oecd average rate of 25 percent to achieve a combined federal and state corporate income tax rate lower than the oecd average rate congress should reduce the federal rate to 20 percent the u s tax rate of approximately 39 percent includes an average state corporate income tax of 4 percent ideally the overall u s business tax rate should be lower than the oecd average rate of 25 percent to achieve a combined federal and state corporate income tax rate lower than the oecd average rate congress should reduce the federal rate to 20 percent establish a territorial tax system a lower tax rate on foreign income would be an improvement but to fix completely the problems caused by the worldwide tax system congress needs to scrap it altogether and replace it with a territorial system it can do that by establishing a dividend exemption regime similar to chairman camp s tax reform proposal in 2014 a territorial system would free u s businesses to invest more abroad by making investments profitable that are unprofitable under the current worldwide system the increase in foreign investment would increase domestic investment by businesses in support of their foreign operations and their efficiency and competitiveness as well this would create jobs and raise wages for u s workers however a territorial system requires a robust set of policies to prevent improper base erosion and profit shifting without such policies u s businesses could shift income earned in the u s to countries with lower tax rates shifting income that should be taxable in the u s abroad would improperly narrow the tax base and force tax rates to be higher on domestic only businesses and families higher tax rates hurt growth and are therefore antithetical to the core purpose of engaging in tax reform under deferral foreign corporations owned by u s corporations can earn income overseas and much of it is not taxed until it is sent back to the u s some have estimated that u s corporations have earned an estimated 2 1 trillion overseas that has not been repatriated and subject to u s tax as part of moving toward a territorial tax system this income should be deemed to be repatriated and taxed at a reasonable rate the businesses that earned this foreign source income expected to pay tax on this money eventually and to exempt it from tax entirely would constitute an unwarranted windfall gain however because current law allows for deferral and because of the time value of money taxing this income under a deemed repatriation at the full corporate rate would be equally unfair the new revenue from this deemed repatriation can make a substantial contribution to funding other positive aspects of business tax reform a lower tax rate on foreign income

deemed repatriation can make a substantial contribution to funding other positive aspects of business tax reform provide full and immediate expensing in the modern technology focused economy the rate of capital cost recovery is an afterthought for some however it still matters a great deal since investment in capital formation remains immensely important for economic growth in spite of improvements that 50 percent expensing would represent the capital cost recovery period under the tax code would still be too lengthy consequently the tax code would still raise the cost of capital and deter u s companies from investing this would slow job creation and wage growth to fully establish a cash flow system congress would need to allow businesses to deduct the entire cost of capital purchases at the time businesses make them once congress takes these three important steps combined with improvements in earlier phases it will have established a cash flow tax and modernized the business tax system so that it is once again competitive with other developed countries the american people will greatly benefit when congress fully implements these changes because economic growth job creation and wages will grow sharply conclusion the u s economy badly needs business tax reform the u s has the least competitive business tax system in the industrialized world and this is holding back the economy productivity improvement and the wages of the american people congress and president obama should seek to fix this by instituting business tax reform in three phases in phase 1 congress should take a first step toward a cash flow system by lowering marginal business tax rates applying that rate to c corporations and pass through businesses lowering taxes on the foreign income of u s businesses and making 50 percent expensing permanent in phase 2 congress should improve the efficiency of the tax code by eliminating unjustified tax preferences and substantially simplify and clarify the tax law in many areas that are long overdue for improvement in phase 3 congress should finish moving the business tax system to a cash flow tax by lowering the rate to 20 percent or less enacting a territorial regime for the foreign income of u s businesses and allowing businesses full expensing for their capital investments these long overdue policy improvements will likely reduce tax revenue even if congress eliminates business tax preferences yet the archaic business tax system is such a drag on the economy that the tax cut would be a small price to pay for the benefits that the american people would enjoy curtis s dubay is research fellow in tax and economic policy and david r burton is senior fellow in economic policy in the thomas a roe institute for

santo domingo dr us political analyst danny shaw offered his perspective on the crisis in which haiti has been mired for more than a year and on how susceptible the neighboring nation is to foreign military intervention during an interview granted to journalists of listín diario the professor of the public university of new york also defined the socio political challenges of latin america and analyzed the new tendency of the resurgence of left wing governments in these countries among other points based on the recent call made by the haitian prime minister ariel henry to the international community where he asked for the support of foreign troops for his country which put on the table the possibility that this territory could be intervened shaw said that the measure would be exaggerated i have been traveling to haiti since 1998 and if there really is an intervention or occupation it would be the fifth time in a hundred years that this country is under the command of foreign military troops said the analyst the professor added to understand haiti one must go back in history and understand that this nation has never been poor but an exploited oppressed and misunderstood country from his perspective shaw assured that the haitian people do not need foreign interference they only need one simple thing to be left in peace because they can determine their own future he added he also expressed that the international community has previously tried to wash its hands of the situation in haiti but that really their economies and foreign capital are strongly linked to this nation and it is for this reason that nothing goes unnoticed in haiti for them when questioned on whether he believes that country can overcome the fuel shortages health crisis criminal gangs and social unrest on its own shaw said yes and that the mobilizations are a sign that the people want positive changes for their nation what we are seeing right now is a continuation of the protests that started years ago the people have the right to protest to mobilize he explained shaw indicated that his approach does not suggest that the road to recovering social peace in haiti will be easy however he said he was convinced that the country does not need walls but bridges latin america and leftist governments the rise to power of leftist governments in latin american countries such as chile colombia mexico el salvador argentina and peru was another phenomenon analyzed by the u s expert according to shaw the triumph of leftists such as gustavo petro gabriel boric and andrés manuel lópez obrador in nations that have historically been under the rule of conservative parties is due to an erosion of the traditional socio political system from his point of view globalization never reached the region but only experienced a gringolization he explained this because it was not a balanced exchange between these countries and the great powers still there have always been more benefits and advantages for the japanese north american french or english capital the colombian peruvian chilean argentinean and mexican peoples got tired of so much exploitation and this situation has given these presidents the opportunity to come to power he said shaw said that latin governments are evoking creating their dream of strengthening their child that should be the path that no latino youth should have to leave their country to see their dreams come true he said he emphasized that leftist governments are not always successful for these nations and proof of this is the crisis in which venezuela is immersed u s interference we are in a time where the unilateral model of the united states has proven to be a failure and the peoples are realizing that said the analyst referring to the role that the north american nation has played throughout the last centuries in the socio political reality of the region thus shaw considered that it is possible to talk about the fact that the economic power of the united states over the latin american region is in decline however the military force is maintained dominican republic is going to be the last neo colony of the united states i believe that this country bases 50 of its economy in the commercial exchange with the united states and i doubt that the president wants to change that to associate with another power for example china he added however he added that the perspective to follow should be to end this historical dependence to have more integration unity and multilateral initiatives mobilizations taking stock of the most recent outbursts and social mobilizations in latin america the analyst expressed that they are favorable for the strengthening of democracy historically we have stated that mobilizations are the prelude to something greater to a real change a mobilized people is a conscious people said the professor finally he considered that for any transcendental socio political change in the region and in the world the media and lately the social networks have a significant weight in the agendas of the countries and have the power to make visible some issues over others so they must ensure that there is no censorship and coverage is given to all the facts

greece has many michelin starred restaurants unless one is a gourmand however one may not be aware of their existence this is a tragedy on a homeric level given that there is a significant spattering in and around the country furthermore though they might not be as numerous or acclaimed as those in new york paris london or tokyo they are good enough to rival those abroad interestingly enough the first michelin guides were for motorists rather than for gourmands the system was set up by the french tire company of the same name to encourage the use of cars by providing maps replacement instructions and the addresses of car mechanics hotels and gas stations the first thirty five thousand were free then the michelin brothers edouard and andré began to expand and sell their guides in other european countries it was only in 1926 that the guide began to rate restaurants with a single star initially the brothers introduced the numbering hierarchy ranging from one to three in 1931 however and by 1936 they had established the criteria by which the rankings were starred paul bocuse one of the french founders of nouvelle cuisine once infamously said in the 1960s that the michelin is the only guide that counts how prophetic his words were indeed as a michelin star is the most prestigious award a restaurant can receive bocuse s tenet therefore still holds as true today as it did back then michelin restaurants greece 2 stars for harmony delta restaurant 364 syggrou avenue kallithéa athens delta restaurant is located in the stunning cultural center of the world famous stavros

vasileos georgiou athens although botrini s is the last on the list it is one of the best tucked away in chalandri outside the center of athens it offers a relaxing retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city this wednesday october 12th marked the eleventh year anniversary of this elegant michelin restaurant its owner and chef ettoro botrini was born in 1969 on corfu his father etrusco botrini was a chef himself in many med clubs worldwide in his words this restaurant is the realization of one of my oldest dreams i always believed that one of the greatest pleasures of life is to share food at a common table with friends and loved ones for this reason i wanted to create an affordable restaurant that would bring gastronomy closer to people with due respect to seasonality quality and the indigenousness of my raw ingredients my dream however was more complex because i always believed that one of the greatest pleasures of life is to share food at a common table with friends and loved ones for this reason i wanted to create an affordable restaurant that would bring gastronomy closer to people with due respect to seasonality quality and the indigenousness of my raw ingredients i also designed a flexible menu that allows one to taste the various expressions of my cuisine freely choosing according to mood between the dishes that i suggest adhering to boe s small menu or the larger degustation menu a wonderful philosophy which the execution and presentation of each of his modern mediterranean dishes certainly reflects like its michelin starred restaurants what many do not know is the fact that greek cuisine has been ranked number two in the world the fusion of differing cultures such as greek and italian cuisine has also led to a new mediterranean diet greek food is

washington dc when i took my children to receive their polio vaccines a few years ago i thought about how lucky we are to live in a place where we can access lifesaving interventions with such ease we didn t need to take a long bus ride or walk great distances to get to the clinic and there was no reason to think that there would be no doses in stock although i was fully aware of the protection my children were receiving i never considered that poliovirus could pose a real threat in washington dc after all the virus hadn t been found in the united states for years but recent developments are a wake up call underscoring just how critical something as simple and routine as vaccination can be in july health authorities confirmed that polio had paralysed an unvaccinated person in new york it was the first us case in nearly a decade then the virus was found in wastewater in other parts of new york state which followed the news that london had also detected poliovirus in its sewage the world health organisation has now declared both the us and the united kingdom outbreak countries for variant poliovirus globally such stories are not unique earlier this year wild polio cases were confirmed in africa for the first time in over five years serving as a chilling reminder of how fragile the world s progress against polio is while cases have plummeted by more than 99 per cent since the 1988 launch of a global effort to eradicate the disease the final stretch to absolute zero has been difficult even though it is essential fortunately there is a global strategy in place to finish the job but to succeed it will need to be funded properly launched last year the global polio eradication initiative s gpei five year strategy is already being implemented to stop and prevent additional outbreaks at the strategy s core are two priorities working with at risk countries to protect every child with vaccines and improving surveillance to track the spread of the disease the same strategy is also helping to deliver other lifesaving vaccines to communities in remote areas as well as working to strengthen health systems the bill and melinda gates foundation joined the gpei alongside the who unicef rotary international and the us centres for disease control and prevention in 2007 because we recognised the opportunity the world had to ensure that polio never paralysed a child again that opportunity is even more apparent today wild polio remains endemic in only two countries pakistan and afghanistan and though case numbers have risen slightly this year they are still at extremely low levels there is not only a moral case for ending polio as a health economist i also focus on the broader impact that such achievements can have for polio the financial benefits of eradication would be enormous if we wipe out the poliovirus within the timeframe set by the current strategy the world could save more than 33 billion this century compared to the cost of continuing to control future polio outbreaks a growing chorus of stakeholders recognizes this financial dimension and the opportunity it represents gavi the vaccine alliance a public private partnership that provides support for routine immunisation in 73 of the world s poorest countries joined the gpei in 2019 and just this month more than a thousand global health experts and scientists from around the world signed a declaration urging countries to fund the global polio strategy fully donors must heed this call and ensure that the gpei receives the 4 8 billion it needs a fully funded strategy will be able to vaccinate 370 million children every year for five years while also better preparing countries against future health threats throughout the covid 19 pandemic gpei infrastructure was the first line of defense for many countries since the start of the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 the polio programme has lent support for contact tracing disease surveillance and community engagement as well as facilitating the rollout of vaccines this is not a one off example gpei has responded to threats such as ebola measles and yellow fever consistently demonstrating a high return on investment to be sure the final stretch in the race against polio has proven the most difficult and recent events have made matters more challenging the pandemic reversed progress on routine immunisation globally violent conflict vaccine mistrust and misinformation continue to present barriers in the last areas where polio hides owing to this year s devastating floods in pakistan efforts to stop polio from spreading there must be redoubled still while the destruction in pakistan is staggering it has been heartening to see the impressive response mounted by the government and the international community additional support is still needed to prevent further hardship because the high waters are impeding access to healthcare and accelerating the spread of waterborne diseases like polio cholera and typhoid there is no doubt that such conditions make it more difficult to stop polio but these challenges are not insurmountable gpei partners and governments around the world have the collective experience and a clear plan to overcome them and this month at the world health summit in berlin donors have an opportunity to help achieve a polio free world by pledging resources to the gpei when we invest in polio eradication we invest in a healthier world today and for generations to come that is why our foundation remains steadfastly committed to the gpei s mission we urge others to join us so that we can finally complete it gargee ghosh is president of global policy and advocacy at the bill melinda gates foundation copyright project syndicate 2022 www project syndicate org

a slump first about 47 of the 452 respondents expect the uk to win that unwelcome prize perhaps reflecting greater financial stability risks in that country compared with 45 who said europe only 7 saw the us becoming the first economy to crack and both an american rebound and a prolonged european downturn will pose different sets of risks for wealth and income inequality the trans atlantic gap reflects the war in ukraine and energy crunch adding long run economic pressures across europe that are less prevalent in the us even so investors indicated that the federal reserve is just about as likely as the european central bank or the bank of england to stop its cycle of interest rate hikes first what s more the survey also indicates that any downturn may end up being a long slog for europe and the uk while an overwhelming majority of investors a full 69 say the us will weather the storm best and emerge as the relative winner among major economies from this year s serial crises the survey highlights the clear implications for asset allocation some 86 of investors expect us markets to recover first with respondents slightly favoring stocks over bonds that result suggests the longstanding premium for us stocks will remain in place and that as peak hawkishness becomes apparent investors are prepared to return to us treasury markets in droves us equity futures advanced in early monday trading while treasury yields fell after uk chancellor of the exchequer jeremy hunt said he would ditch the tax plans that investors considered harmful for the economy there are at least three potential reasons that could explain why so many investors see the us as likely to halt rate hikes first allowing the economy and asset markets to recover even though recession risks are much more severe elsewhere the first is global financial stability concerns given the dollar s status as the world s major reserve currency the us may be loath to continue rate hikes in the face of rising global turmoil even if its main locus is outside of the us a second idea to consider is that the fed started aggressive jumbo rate hikes first suggesting its job may be done first as well that s supported by the survey data as a majority of investors see the us as most likely to quell inflation and a third important reason to believe the fed may stop first is simply because it has said so the us central bank has telegraphed its desire to front load rate hikes so that it can hold for a considerable period at a restrictive level beginning early next year neither the bank of england nor the ecb have been so explicit in their forward guidance the survey found some interesting splits between retail and professional investors for example us stocks were more favored by retail than us bonds suggesting a buy the dip mentality has not been permanently broken by the recent bear market in equities retail investors were also more likely to tip the uk as going into recession first one caveat to think about inequality the unspoken downside risk for the us if the survey s outcomes come to pass could be a widening of income and wealth gaps the fed s rate hikes have hit interest rate sensitive sectors like housing the hardest some potential first time homeowners have already been forced to give up on building wealth via buying and rent instead and the central bank s explicit goal is to cool the economy via a softening of the labor market if that happens while us financial markets are first to recover it could magnify wealth differences rebounding financial assets owned disproportionately by wealthier households would be juxtaposed with stagnating labor income from wages and renters trapped by rising rates europe and the uk are unlikely to escape increasing inequality while almost everyone s wealth goes down in a slump the least wealthy tend to lose the most and inflationary recessions are the worst of both worlds because inflation is a de facto regressive tax hitting the poorest who spend the greatest proportion of their disposable income survey respondents are much more pessimistic that the uk and euro area can get the cost of living under control with only 11 and 16 respectively expecting the boe or the ecb to succeed in quelling inflation in 2023 versus 65 in the us in the uk the so called squeezed middle may be in for a particularly torrid time if the 73 of survey respondents who believe the country will face a housing crash next year are correct housing is a powerful driver of wealth effects and falling home prices tend to impede any trickle down into the rest of the economy the upshot could be worsening inequality even as the middle income group sees a fall in asset prices in the end though the survey brings to mind warren buffett s dictum i will tell you how to become rich close the doors be fearful when others are greedy be greedy when others are fearful for those seeking to benefit from us economic and asset market outperformance the time to do so is not after the coast is clear and the path is obvious it is when peak hawkishness and fear pervades so one reading of the overall survey results is this at some point much sooner than in the uk or europe buying the dip in the us will make sense even if that time is not quite now to subscribe to mliv pulse stories click here for more markets analysis see

the ringgit performance against the us dollar and some other major currencies is weakening and its effects are felt across the different groups and sectors of the economy including our purchasing power if we continuously buy in the foreign currency last friday the ringgit was hovering around rm4 70 to us 1 on the same day the local currency set a new record low against the singapore dollar at rm3 30 to s 1 hence the looming fear over the weakening of the ringgit out there is real particularly in terms of protecting our wealth this is despite many assurances on the country s economic fundamentals still being relatively strong and the foreign currency borrowings accounted for less than 3 of the total federal government s debt it is also a well known fact that a weak ringgit could benefit our export driven economy but a weak ringgit will cost parents to fork out more money for their children s education overseas it will also cost more if you are planning for a holiday overseas especially in the countries that predominantly accept us dollars it will also affect those with investments abroad if they are still paying for their investments with ringgit local investors as for local investors it really depends on where you have invested your money if it is locally then there is really no impact apart from the rising inflation and the implications that come with it yes we should worry but not to the point of paralysis said manulife investment management m sdn bhd licensed financial planner rajen devadason another licensed financial planner kimberly law added that the weak ringgit is only a cause of concern for those who have investments in other countries such as singapore and the united states if a person is worried about a particular currency falling further then hedge it against that country in their currency she said devadason meanwhile said parents who try to provide their children with a world class education often look to destinations like singapore australia new zealand the united kingdom canada and the united states sadly the ringgit has generally weakened against the currencies of those destinations the meltdown of the british pound notwithstanding he pointed out it is becoming more and more difficult for parents to send their children abroad to study at the best universities in the world he added it may also take some time for the ringgit to strengthen against the us dollar and that is why most investment gurus would normally talk about diversification of portfolios to protect your wealth currency markets can whipsaw quickly and leave amateur traders in the lurch it is better to never put all our eggs in a single national or asset basket devadason said investment dimensions he opined that people should diversify their investments ideally across three different dimensions it could be via varied asset classes spread out geographic regions that use different currencies and a long timeline through powerful investment strategies such as dollar cost averaging to strip out emotions when investing for the long haul to preserve your wealth he said it is about investing consistently and emotionlessly over the long haul across the three different dimensions it is the best way i know to raise the probability of succeeding financially growing our wealth faster than taxes and inflation erode its buying power over periods exceeding 20 years he said no quick gain law added that people can invest in or buy foreign stocks or other instruments in foreign currency at anytime however it is not recommended if it is meant for quick and short term gains if people are concerned about the ringgit dropping further then they should have investments in various foreign markets in their currency but if the ringgit is not the issue for them then they should have a portfolio in ringgit make sure to grow capital before seeking passive income in your portfolio know your financial goals to determine the time horizon as this is useful in choosing which asset class will suit you as an investor law noted she also believes that entering the market is not as important as determining when to exit the market whatever your views may be on the weakening of the ringgit it is vital to do your own research when accumulating wealth so you know what the opportunities are even in trying times as devadason put it those who truly wish to succeed economically need to focus on generating consistent cashflow surpluses by taking on extra work this unspent money should then be proactively saved and invested in a portfolio crammed with optimally mixed domestic and international assets

accurate representation he said on cnbc s squawk box on monday he also added that the fed tightening rates up to 4 or 5 is far too high and that doing so will risk a much stronger slowdown than is

the republican nominee for the 2022 arizona gubernatorial race kari lake says she decided to run for political office because she realized that all of the success she has had in her three decades long tv career would not mean much if the united states and the freedoms we enjoy are taken away by the radical left i will run through every last penny that i have to save this country lake told epochtv s american thought leaders in a recent interview choosing principles although it was scary to walk away from a lucrative career she ultimately chose to live by her principles i just said god i know this is the right thing to do please i m going to do this i need you to have my back lake said having spent almost 27 years reporting arizona news and 22 years as a lead tv anchor lake compared the level of news bias during the covid 19 lockdowns to propaganda and said it caused her to take a long hard look at her career and her faith although it was scary to walk away from a lucrative career she ultimately chose to live by her principles i just said god i know this is the right thing to do please i m going to do this i need you to have my back lake said some families were forced to comply with the government s vaccine mandates in order to keep their jobs and support their families and obviously that s a stressful difficult choice to make lake said but others said i m walking away i just had somebody reach out who said i went through three jobs during all of that i have not been making as much money as i used to make but you know what i ve got my principles intact read more kari lake the assault on patriotism and the fight to restore the american dream lake said her husband helped her weigh the financial cost of leaving with the ethical cost of not leaving her job and he said i can t expect you to do a job that you believe is immoral that it goes against who you are that would be the worst thing after making the decision to leave the news business lake published a video to tell her viewers her reasons i put that out to let them know and what i didn t expect was it would go viral within a matter of hours she said people understood saying they noticed a change in the news too and many asked her to run for political office screenshot from epochtv the swamp initially lake s plan was to take a position with an organization that did media training to work behind the scene but more and more people kept asking her to go into politics one of the common threads that like a steady drumbeat was would you please consider running for office we need people in politics who we trust to understand the issues of our state who understands us she said at first she just laughed at the thought of running for political office problem of propaganda the government s handling of the pandemic and the i m thinking are you kidding me i m just leaving the corrupt world of media and they re suggesting i go into the even more corrupt world the swamp of politics they must think i m insane and i had zero interest in it the government s handling of the pandemic and the media s biased reporting became clear to lake during the lockdowns and she could no longer follow the one sided top down approach to the news anymore the views presented by media outlets have always been dominated by liberals with diversity only needed for the color of your skin but not the diversity of thought she said this all became all too glaring during the lockdowns any little bit of information that could have helped people get back to life as normal that could have helped people with their health was being censored she said this was censoring when it was coming to the life or death of your business to the life or death of our children s education she did not want to be a part of these unethical practices it s not just unbalanced and biased it is truly immoral what was happening in journalism during covid lake said during this time another red flag for lake was seeing the attacks on conservative president donald trump for suggesting alternative treatments for covid infections her intuition told her something was not right she said and there was just a complete shutdown and censorship of anybody who wanted to at least dig into and explore these treatments that might save lives discussion of hcq has fallen under a censorship umbrella that captured several other treatments known to help boost the immune system and lessen other viral infections stock footage inc shutterstock leaning on faith during this time lake leaned into her christian faith a foundation created from a time when she and her eight siblings went to church each sunday during the lockdowns her regular church was shuttered so she found a church that was holding in person services because she wanted help making decisions about leaving her career lake said i remember thinking we need to get our butts into a church right now i just felt that need and i ended up stumbling into a different church and that church really opened my eyes and changed my life lake said it was really a very powerful period for me spiritually during covid and i don t think i m alone she has seen many including herself embrace god during the pandemic she finally decided to run for governor in her home state the dire state of the nation goliad county sheriff roy boyd checks a site used by cartels to smuggle illegal immigrants through goliad county texas on nov 23 2021 charlotte cuthbertson the epoch times lake worries that drugs like fentanyl are pouring across the southern border and killing hundreds of working age people each day our border with our country right now is in the operational control of narco terrorists the cartels lake said almost 5 million illegal immigrants have come across the southern border since biden took office lake said right now it appears that joe biden is on the side of the cartels and the people of arizona have had enough we don t have a country if we don t have a border but the government that has been going above and beyond to save lives in the face of covid isn t helping save lives risked by the influx of deadly narcotics at the border number one cause of death is not cancer and car crashes it s not covid it is absolutely the drugs that are coming in across our southern border lake said further compounding her concerns about the infiltration of far left ideas into the nation s foundational institutions is how the final result for the 2020 presidential election was called even before polls had closed we don t have fair elections our elections are a mess and we don t have a border we re not going to have a country much longer she said lake said that most people she speaks to across the country feel their first amendment rights have been curtailed meaning that they can t express their conservative views without being attacked or canceled the first amendment s on shaky ground right now that s why i m outspoken because i m going to speak my mind and use my freedom of speech while we still have it lake said so we have got to save this country vision for the future during her journalism career lake said she kept her conservative values to herself in order to allow viewers to make up their own minds but in her current role she is happy to speak her mind and tell people how her administration will approach solving the problems plaguing arizona with the various social problems and economic crises lake said it is becoming more and more difficult to live the american dream if elected her administration will advance vocational training programs so students can access the skills to prepare themselves for the real world and a great salary we ve ignored the trades where we need workers we re sending our kids off to get into debt with degrees that are meaningless when we really should be pushing them into the trades and vocational training to actually get a job lake said her 30 years in the news has given her a solid background in all the major issues concerning arizonians and she is not afraid of being canceled and will stand up for shared american values when i take the oath of office immediately after taking my hand off the bible we re going to sign and issue a declaration of invasion and start tackling that problem on the border she said lake addressed the political attacks from her competitors campaign saying she has been a democrat until recent times but she said she has largely been a republican with a few years of voting democrat and independent i don t think it matters that i m a republican with the ideas i m putting forth our arizona first that s what s so beautiful about that movement it really isn t about politics it s about solutions common sense solutions she said of her campaign lake s priority is to make the streets safer and bring more jobs and businesses to arizona by improving the regulatory environment to allow businesses to flourish in her state her administration will tackle homelessness in order to make communities safer and help those who are mentally ill or drug addicted she said i don t believe for one second that god envisioned any one of us to live on the streets with a needle in our arm we re going to work to get them off the streets banning urban camping by building enough shelter beds to get people help she said we ve got an industry that s formed around homelessness and not everybody in that industry wants to solve the problem so no more state money will go to any homeless program that does not show results skid row in los angeles calif on june 9 2021 john fredricks the epoch times lake believes a clear message needs to be sent to miscreants and criminals that no vandalism crime or violence will be tolerated she said she will also push to hold people accountable for all broken window level offenses and we re going to work fast and we re going to work hard we need somebody in office who is ready to make a transformational change for arizona stand up and fight for the people and i will fight every single day lake said
cai meng china daily economic figures recorded since august have begun to show signs of recovery especially upticks seen in infrastructure and manufacturing investment which are key to hedging the downward pressure on real estate and driving overall investment industrial production is also seen moving back on track but compared with the traditional cyclical recovery as we see the latest round of recovery features atypical characteristics amid the ongoing impact of covid 19 the atypicality is reflected in several factors and is affecting the efficiency of traditional macroeconomic stimuli we are also witnessing extraordinary volatility which exists not only in the real economy but also in the financial markets and volatility is affecting not only just a few countries but the entire world as for the root cause of such an atypical recovery we think the answer may be in the abnormal shocks to the economy first the covid 19 then the russian ukrainian conflict followed by scorching summer temperatures in china and resulting drought conditions these three shocks are different from the impact of traditional economic cycle fluctuations with the biggest difference being that these three shocks are on the supply side the pandemic has led to the suspension of work and production and transportation and logistics have thus been affected the russian ukrainian conflict brought about energy supply woes meanwhile high temperatures and droughts weigh on agricultural and industrial production these shocks have affected the economy directly dragging down growth momentum and leading to lower incomes furthermore the decline in revenue of many enterprises is amplified by the sectoral linkages bringing greater downward pressure on demand for example lower revenue in the catering industry diminishes employee demand for consumer goods and the impact then spreads from supply to demand and ultimately drags down gdp growth the second amplifier is the industrial chain connection for example when chips are affected this may then hinder the automotive sector amid the ongoing covid 19 pandemic many enterprises especially smaller ones are faced with greater uncertainties which has a certain effect on investor confidence many are holding their money and dare not invest which further amplifies the downward pressure from supply to demand the primary impact of such atypical shocks is overall downward pressure on the economy after the shocks stagflation follows which is the most critical issue awaiting solutions and seeking solutions itself may create a dilemma as if there is no policy to support demand the supply shock will bring greater downward pressure on demand if however there is policy to support demand a decline in supply means that inflation will rise policy will have to tighten and growth will still eventually weaken it s an issue that china should have a clear mind about as it matters how much policy easing the country still needs the united states for example has previously introduced too much stimulus to cope with stagnation and now has to handle the resulting inflation a recession is therefore almost inevitable while the situation in china is different as the downward pressure on demand exceeds that on supply the pressure of stagnation is still large under the current situation china needs a relaxed policy environment to drive its growth momentum the second impact of atypical shocks is in supply elasticity it s said in textbooks that in a market economy how the market functions relies on the signals it sends to steer supply and demand by prices under atypical shocks the effects of physical constraints like the russian ukrainian conflict and climate change may exceed the regulatory capacity of market mechanisms and even if prices rise supply increases more slowly than during normal economic cycles furthermore with noneconomic factors affecting the economy more the operation of the economy instead of seeing most impact from traditional macro policies such as those of a fiscal and monetary nature will also see impact from more regulatory measures concerning atypical shock factors in addition noneconomic factors not only affect the momentum but also more fundamentally the structure of the economy not all industries regions and groups of people are affected by the same impact but some are affected more than others as the shock time lengthens the pressure on part of these segments may exceed their ability to endure under such circumstances the government may find that in its macro policy toolbox fiscal policies always function more efficiently than money and credit tools this is partly because monetary and credit policies rely to a considerable extent on price changes such as falling interest rates while fiscal action can directly bring about quantitative changes such as infrastructure investment on the other hand money and credit are more aggregate policies while fiscal policy has stronger structural functions such as being able to more effectively help vulnerable groups and people and industries that have been greatly affected by covid 19 this is also one thing the government needs to consider when thinking about how to deal with downward pressure on the economy in other words structural policies are very important as we see the general direction of policy in the future should be to further optimize covid 19 prevention policies enhance the role of finance and shift more focus to directly stimulating consumption to cope with the structural impact of atypical shocks with the current policy strength according to our calculations there will be a total expansion of 3 percent in fiscal spending this year which is expected to bring 3 percent growth in gdp reflecting the relatively strong support from the fiscal side this year however at present the multiplier effect of traditional fiscal tools on demand has declined and the pull on the economy is limited which is even more obvious amid the impact of covid 19 in 2020 and the second quarter of this year in the second quarter for example the two driving forces exports and infrastructure contributed to 0 5 percent of gdp growth while growth of the overall gdp was only 0 4 percent so why is there weakness seen from the current situation although real estate activity has slowed it is not the major burden on the economy as the strength of financial hedging is actually relatively large the answer lies in the atypical shocks mentioned above the impact of such shocks will lead to a reduction in the multiplier effect through three amplification mechanisms of market sentiment supply to demand and upstream and downstream links in the industrial chain in this case there are three pathways leading the nation out of its current economic woes the first is to continue to optimize prevention and control measures against covid 19 in fact with the continuous mutation of the virus there have been several updates in measures in the past few years with a prominent example being the ninth edition of the covid 19 prevention plan chances are good that the idea of changing protocols in accordance with the covid 19 situation will continue to be the default strategy in the future and since covid 19 is one of the factors leading to atypical shocks a continuously enhanced prevention system will help iron out problems in the industrial chain reduce uncertainty of expectations boost confidence promote both supply and demand and strengthen overall economic recovery the second direction is direct help from the fiscal side to the consumption side such as subsidies to affected groups and low income earners here are some of the advantages of such a strategy first such move will skip over obstacles of industrial chain transmission second consumption is relatively less affected by expectations third promoting consumption which faces fewer physical constraints by covid 19 will help the market to boost effective demand more efficiently however it should be noted that such stimulus is effective in boosting demand but won t bring much improvement to the supply side also the strength of stimulation if exceeding a certain extent can easily lead to rises in inflation in view of its relatively high efficiency in driving consumer demand it is an effective tool for now the third direction involves traditional fiscal and monetary policies like promoting credit demand through interest rate cuts fiscal support for infrastructure tax cuts and fee reductions and policy based finance as mentioned above atypical shocks inhibit the efficiency of these policies to stimulate demand and to achieve the same stable growth effect as before required policies should accordingly be stronger and longer lasting and negative effects as a result may also be greater over the medium and long term the writer is chief economist at china international capital corp the views don t necessarily reflect

us president joe biden portland oregon us president joe biden on saturday called embattled british prime minister liz truss abandoned tax cut plan a mistake and said he is worried that other countries fiscal policies may hurt the united states amid worldwide inflation biden said it was predictable that the new prime minister on friday was forced to walk back plans to aggressively cut taxes without identifying cost savings after truss proposal caused turmoil in global financial markets it marked an unusual criticism by a us president of the domestic policy decisions of one of its closest allies i wasn t the only one that thought it was a mistake biden said i disagree with the policy but that s up to great britain biden s comments came after weeks of white house officials declining to criticize truss plans though they emphasized they were monitoring the economic fallout closely biden was speaking to reporters at an oregon ice cream shop where he made an unannounced stop to promote the candidacy of democratic gubernatorial candidate tina kotek as democrats across the country face a tough political environment amid gop criticism of their handling of the economy biden said he was not concerned about the strength of the dollar it set a new record against the british pound in recent weeks which benefits us imports but makes the country s exports more expensive to the rest of the world plan reversal britain s new treasury chief on saturday acknowledged the mistakes made by his predecessor and suggested that he may reverse much of truss tax cutting plans in order to bring stability to the country after weeks of economic and political turbulence jeremy hunt who was brought in on friday to replace kwasi kwarteng as treasury chief and restore order in truss administration warned of difficult decisions to come taxes could rise and public spending budgets would likely be squeezed further in the coming months he said truss fired kwarteng on friday and ditched her pledge to scrap a planned increase in corporation tax as she sought to hang on to her job after just six weeks in office truss a free market libertarian had previously insisted that her tax cutting plans were what britain needs to boost economic growth but a mini budget that she and kwarteng unveiled three weeks ago which promised 45 billion pounds 50 billion in tax cuts without explaining how the government would pay for them sent the markets and the british pound tumbling and left her credibility in tatters the policies which included cutting income tax for those on the highest incomes were widely criticized for being tone deaf in the face of britain s cost of living crisis truss recognizes her mistakes and he is going to put them right he said it was wrong to cut the top rate of tax for the very highest earners at a time where we re going to have to be asking for sacrifices from everyone to get through a very difficult period hunt said and it was wrong to fly blind and to announce those plans without reassuring people with the discipline of the office for budget responsibility that we actually can afford to pay for them he added we have to show the world we have a plan that adds up financially agencies via xinhua

us president joe biden portland oregon us president joe biden on saturday called embattled british prime minister liz truss abandoned tax cut plan a mistake and said he is worried that other countries fiscal policies may hurt the united states amid worldwide inflation biden said it was predictable that the new prime minister on friday was forced to walk back plans to aggressively cut taxes without identifying cost savings after truss proposal caused turmoil in global financial markets it marked an unusual criticism by a us president of the domestic policy decisions of one of its closest allies i wasn t the only one that thought it was a mistake biden said i disagree with the policy but that s up to great britain biden s comments came after weeks of white house officials declining to criticize truss plans though they emphasized they were monitoring the economic fallout closely biden was speaking to reporters at an oregon ice cream shop where he made an unannounced stop to promote the candidacy of democratic gubernatorial candidate tina kotek as democrats across the country face a tough political environment amid gop criticism of their handling of the economy biden said he was not concerned about the strength of the dollar it set a new record against the british pound in recent weeks which benefits us imports but makes the country s exports more expensive to the rest of the world plan reversal britain s new treasury chief on saturday acknowledged the mistakes made by his predecessor and suggested that he may reverse much of truss tax cutting plans in order to bring stability to the country after weeks of economic and political turbulence jeremy hunt who was brought in on friday to replace kwasi kwarteng as treasury chief and restore order in truss administration warned of difficult decisions to come taxes could rise and public spending budgets would likely be squeezed further in the coming months he said truss fired kwarteng on friday and ditched her pledge to scrap a planned increase in corporation tax as she sought to hang on to her job after just six weeks in office truss a free market libertarian had previously insisted that her tax cutting plans were what britain needs to boost economic growth but a mini budget that she and kwarteng unveiled three weeks ago which promised 45 billion pounds 50 billion in tax cuts without explaining how the government would pay for them sent the markets and the british pound tumbling and left her credibility in tatters the policies which included cutting income tax for those on the highest incomes were widely criticized for being tone deaf in the face of britain s cost of living crisis truss recognizes her mistakes and he is going to put them right he said it was wrong to cut the top rate of tax for the very highest earners at a time where we re going to have to be asking for sacrifices from everyone to get through a very difficult period hunt said and it was wrong to fly blind and to announce those plans without reassuring people with the discipline of the office for budget responsibility that we actually can afford to pay for them he added we have to show the world we have a plan that adds up financially agencies via xinhua

greatly benefitting from a wave of first time users and buyers due in part to changing habits brought on by the covid 19 pandemic said honeywell aerospace president americas aftermarket heath patrick the business aviation sector is expected to recover to 2019 delivery and expenditure levels by 2023 which is much sooner than previously anticipated demand for new business jets is as high as we ve seen it since 2015 and we expect high levels of demand and expenditures for new aircraft for several more years key findings in the 2022 honeywell global business aviation outlook include new business jet deliveries in 2023 are expected to be 17 higher than in 2022 expenditures are expected to be 20 higher five year purchase plans for new business jets are up three percentage points compared with last year s survey this reaches 2019 levels and is equivalent to 17 of the current fleet fleet additions are up for the second year in a row doubling 2021 s rate and topping 2 of the fleet new jet deliveries and expenditures over the next decade are projected to grow at a 2 average annual rate in line with expected worldwide long term economic growth one third of those surveyed expect to fly more in 2023 versus 2022 64 expect to fly at least the same amount and just 4 expect to fly less large long range aircraft classes are expected to account for more than 70 of all expenditures of new business jets in the next five years just 2 of surveyed operators plan to dispose of an aircraft without replacement which is half the rate gleaned in 2021 five year purchase plans for used jets remain high totaling 28 of the current fleet and on par with last year s results high demand for used jets will keep pressuring the already low inventory of jets available for sale new users of business and private aviation the business aviation industry is benefitting from waves of first time private aviation users and buyers which is likely attributed to covid 19 at times in 2022 flight activity met levels not seen since 2007 which was the busiest year ever for business aviation concerns about exposure to pathogens and the reduction of premium class airline services helped drive recent growth in business and private aviation the 2022 honeywell survey sampled first time business aircraft owners who have made their purchases since 2020 and operators who are capturing first time private aviation users nearly 74 of surveyed new users of private aviation expect to keep the same level of flying in 2023 as they did in 2022 which is 10 percentage points above the whole fleet average only 4 expect to fly less in 2023 nearly 85 of first time users operate in the americas within the americas 80 of first time buyers operate in the united states the rest mostly operate in brazil business turboprops and small cabin jets each make up 35 of the fleet carrying these new users followed by medium jets 18 and large long range jets sustainability in business aviation honeywell

report currently implementing at least one method to reduce their carbon footprint which is 30 percentage points above last year s survey the most frequently mentioned current method to reduce carbon footprint is fewer or slower private jet trips 20 followed by increasing passenger capacity 17 sustainable aviation fuel saf is the third most mentioned current method to reduce carbon footprint 14 however operators cite challenges with saf availability more than 60 of operators plan to either adopt or increase methods for more environmentally friendly operations in the future and 37 cite saf as the most common way to achieve this goal the survey asked the remaining 40 what would compel them to adopt any methods to address sustainability in the future and 57 of these operators cited economic

dose mazdutide in phase 1b study has now been published higher dose mazdutide showed favorable tolerability and safety profiles as well as rapid and robust body weight loss efficacy and has the potential to provide patients with severe obesity with treatment options comparable to the efficacy of bariatric surgery combined with the results of phase i and phase ii studies of lower dose mazdutide mazdutide has the potential to become one of the most powerful innovative anti obesity drugs worldwide i am very hopeful that mazdutide will achieve a great success in the phase iii clinical studies and demonstrate benefit to patients as soon as possible dr lei qian vice president of clinical development at innovent said the publication of the phase i results of mazdutide 9 mg and 10 mg cohorts further reflects the efficiency and translational collaboration between chinese biopharmaceuticals and academia in early stage clinical development of innovative metabolic drugs the results of the higher dose mazdutide make it the first single agent anti obesity drug worldwide to achieve a 12 week body weight loss by more than 11 5 we are expecting more encouraging results in the ongoing phase ii clinical study of mazdutide 9 mg which will lay a solid foundation for its potential as an alternative therapy of bariatric surgery mazdutide phase iii studies are in progress and we hope

mammalian oxyntomodulin oxm which uses a fatty acid side chain to prolong the duration of action and allow once weekly administration mazdutide is thought to exert its biological effects by activating glp 1 receptor and glucagon receptor in human beings which is estimated to improve glucose tolerance and induce weight loss mimicking the effects of endogenous oxyntomodulin in addition to the effects of glp 1 receptor agonists on promoting insulin secretion lowering blood glucose and reducing body weight mazdutide may also increase energy expenditure and improve hepatic fat metabolism through the

cai meng china daily economic figures recorded since august have begun to show signs of recovery especially upticks seen in infrastructure and manufacturing investment which are key to hedging the downward pressure on real estate and driving overall investment industrial production is also seen moving back on track but compared with the traditional cyclical recovery as we see the latest round of recovery features atypical characteristics amid the ongoing impact of covid 19 the atypicality is reflected in several factors and is affecting the efficiency of traditional macroeconomic stimuli we are also witnessing extraordinary volatility which exists not only in the real economy but also in the financial markets and volatility is affecting not only just a few countries but the entire world as for the root cause of such an atypical recovery we think the answer may be in the abnormal shocks to the economy first the covid 19 then the russian ukrainian conflict followed by scorching summer temperatures in china and resulting drought conditions these three shocks are different from the impact of traditional economic cycle fluctuations with the biggest difference being that these three shocks are on the supply side the pandemic has led to the suspension of work and production and transportation and logistics have thus been affected the russian ukrainian conflict brought about energy supply woes meanwhile high temperatures and droughts weigh on agricultural and industrial production these shocks have affected the economy directly dragging down growth momentum and leading to lower incomes furthermore the decline in revenue of many enterprises is amplified by the sectoral linkages bringing greater downward pressure on demand for example lower revenue in the catering industry diminishes employee demand for consumer goods and the impact then spreads from supply to demand and ultimately drags down gdp growth the second amplifier is the industrial chain connection for example when chips are affected this may then hinder the automotive sector amid the ongoing covid 19 pandemic many enterprises especially smaller ones are faced with greater uncertainties which has a certain effect on investor confidence many are holding their money and dare not invest which further amplifies the downward pressure from supply to demand the primary impact of such atypical shocks is overall downward pressure on the economy after the shocks stagflation follows which is the most critical issue awaiting solutions and seeking solutions itself may create a dilemma as if there is no policy to support demand the supply shock will bring greater downward pressure on demand if however there is policy to support demand a decline in supply means that inflation will rise policy will have to tighten and growth will still eventually weaken it s an issue that china should have a clear mind about as it matters how much policy easing the country still needs the united states for example has previously introduced too much stimulus to cope with stagnation and now has to handle the resulting inflation a recession is therefore almost inevitable while the situation in china is different as the downward pressure on demand exceeds that on supply the pressure of stagnation is still large under the current situation china needs a relaxed policy environment to drive its growth momentum the second impact of atypical shocks is in supply elasticity it s said in textbooks that in a market economy how the market functions relies on the signals it sends to steer supply and demand by prices under atypical shocks the effects of physical constraints like the russian ukrainian conflict and climate change may exceed the regulatory capacity of market mechanisms and even if prices rise supply increases more slowly than during normal economic cycles furthermore with noneconomic factors affecting the economy more the operation of the economy instead of seeing most impact from traditional macro policies such as those of a fiscal and monetary nature will also see impact from more regulatory measures concerning atypical shock factors in addition noneconomic factors not only affect the momentum but also more fundamentally the structure of the economy not all industries regions and groups of people are affected by the same impact but some are affected more than others as the shock time lengthens the pressure on part of these segments may exceed their ability to endure under such circumstances the government may find that in its macro policy toolbox fiscal policies always function more efficiently than money and credit tools this is partly because monetary and credit policies rely to a considerable extent on price changes such as falling interest rates while fiscal action can directly bring about quantitative changes such as infrastructure investment on the other hand money and credit are more aggregate policies while fiscal policy has stronger structural functions such as being able to more effectively help vulnerable groups and people and industries that have been greatly affected by covid 19 this is also one thing the government needs to consider when thinking about how to deal with downward pressure on the economy in other words structural policies are very important as we see the general direction of policy in the future should be to further optimize covid 19 prevention policies enhance the role of finance and shift more focus to directly stimulating consumption to cope with the structural impact of atypical shocks with the current policy strength according to our calculations there will be a total expansion of 3 percent in fiscal spending this year which is expected to bring 3 percent growth in gdp reflecting the relatively strong support from the fiscal side this year however at present the multiplier effect of traditional fiscal tools on demand has declined and the pull on the economy is limited which is even more obvious amid the impact of covid 19 in 2020 and the second quarter of this year in the second quarter for example the two driving forces exports and infrastructure contributed to 0 5 percent of gdp growth while growth of the overall gdp was only 0 4 percent so why is there weakness seen from the current situation although real estate activity has slowed it is not the major burden on the economy as the strength of financial hedging is actually relatively large the answer lies in the atypical shocks mentioned above the impact of such shocks will lead to a reduction in the multiplier effect through three amplification mechanisms of market sentiment supply to demand and upstream and downstream links in the industrial chain in this case there are three pathways leading the nation out of its current economic woes the first is to continue to optimize prevention and control measures against covid 19 in fact with the continuous mutation of the virus there have been several updates in measures in the past few years with a prominent example being the ninth edition of the covid 19 prevention plan chances are good that the idea of changing protocols in accordance with the covid 19 situation will continue to be the default strategy in the future and since covid 19 is one of the factors leading to atypical shocks a continuously enhanced prevention system will help iron out problems in the industrial chain reduce uncertainty of expectations boost confidence promote both supply and demand and strengthen overall economic recovery the second direction is direct help from the fiscal side to the consumption side such as subsidies to affected groups and low income earners here are some of the advantages of such a strategy first such move will skip over obstacles of industrial chain transmission second consumption is relatively less affected by expectations third promoting consumption which faces fewer physical constraints by covid 19 will help the market to boost effective demand more efficiently however it should be noted that such stimulus is effective in boosting demand but won t bring much improvement to the supply side also the strength of stimulation if exceeding a certain extent can easily lead to rises in inflation in view of its relatively high efficiency in driving consumer demand it is an effective tool for now the third direction involves traditional fiscal and monetary policies like promoting credit demand through interest rate cuts fiscal support for infrastructure tax cuts and fee reductions and policy based finance as mentioned above atypical shocks inhibit the efficiency of these policies to stimulate demand and to achieve the same stable growth effect as before required policies should accordingly be stronger and longer lasting and negative effects as a result may also be greater over the medium and long term the writer is chief economist at china international capital corp the views don t necessarily reflect those of china daily

jurisdictions as the middleman in a crooked headquarters deal blue orca further concluded that ndependent evidence including archived disclosures on miniso s chinese website reports in chinese media and interviews with former employees indicate that miniso is a brand in serious peril noting that miniso lowered its franchising fee by 63 over the past two years in a desperate effort to attract

individuals and entities associated with 1globe a family investment office that is owned and controlled by defendant jiaqiang li li li was sinovac s largest shareholder when 1globe s chief executive officer made an offer in january 2016 to buy sinovac for approximately 350 million li supported a competing group that sought to buy sinovac for a higher price rather than provide this support in an open and transparent manner li and 1globe used deceptive practices to advance their position after sinovac adopted the rights agreement on march 28 2016 which contained a poison pill that limited the amount of sinovac stock that a shareholder could acquire defendants made many intentionally false and misleading statements and violated their statutory disclosure obligations under section 13 d of the securities exchange act of 1934 section 13 d in order to conceal the extent and purpose of li s and 1globe s ownership of sinovac stock in addition to misrepresenting the amount of sinovac stock that li and 1globe owned defendants misrepresented their secret plan to act in concert with other shareholders to try to take control of the company while sinovac knew that li and 1globe were acting in concert based on the company s private communications with them during the battle for control of the company this information was not known to public shareholders plaintiff and the class are sinovac shareholders that have been caught in the middle of this battle between sinovac s management and 1globe for control of the company while plaintiff and the class also seek to receive fair value if sinovac is taken private defendants behind the scenes scheming impeded this effort instead defendants have caused plaintiff and the class substantial harm by making them lose their ability to collect at least millions of shares they would have otherwise been entitled to under the rights agreement even the purchase of a single share of sinovac stock above the rights agreement s 15 thresholder constitutes a trigger event under the rights agreement all of li s and 1globe s purchases of sinovac stock that they made or directed to be made on their behalf after march 28 2016

exchange under the rights agreement to be delayed by several years if li had fully disclosed his ownership of sinovac stock as he was required to do under section 13 d it would have been clear as day that the rights agreement was triggered by may 2016 at the latest while sinovac knew enough information starting in 2016 largely based on private correspondence to determine that 1globe and li triggered the rights agreement defendants hid the full extent of their ownership of sinovac stock and their agreements in connection with the battle for control of the company defendants therefore also tortiously interfered with sinovac s contractual obligations to its shareholders under the rights agreement if 1globe and li s actions were disclosed publicly as they were required to be under section 13 d plaintiff s rights would have been exercisable based on that disclosure and an exchange would have occurred based on that date by misrepresenting the true nature of their ownership of sinovac stock defendants caused that date to be delayed almost three years until february 22 2019 resulting in plaintiff and the class losing their rights to acquire additional shares of sinovac stock for all of their shares that they sold in the interim while sinovac should have implemented the rights agreement in 2016 based on the information available to it at the time 1globe and li exacerbated the problem by violating their disclosure obligations under section 13 d moreover defendants caused the value of sinovac stock to be artificially depressed by preventing the public from accounting for

medtronic repeatedly assured investors that the minimed 780g model was on track for approval by the u s food and drug administration fda and would provide medtronic with the edge it needed to close a growing gap with its competitors in the diabetes market medtronic made these representations despite known issues with the minimed 600 series models indeed in november 2019 the company issued a warning that certain minimed 600 series insulin pumps might have damaged pump retainer rings which could cause the system to release too much insulin and instructed customers with damaged rings to contact the company for replacements on february 7 2020 the fda classified medtronic s november 2019 notification as a class i recall the most serious type of recall problems with the minimed 600 series mushroomed in october 2021 when the company expanded its recall to all minimed model 630g and 670g insulin pump systems whether or not any retainer ring damage was actually visible despite

continued to surface on may 26 2022 when medtronic reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022 and provided guidance for fiscal year 2023 notably medtronic disclosed that as a result of the company s need to improve its quality control system and its expectation that the minimed 780g model which defendants had repeatedly identified as crucial to future growth would not be approved in 2023 the company expected revenues from its diabetes group to decline between 6 and 7 in fiscal year 2023 on this news the price of medtronic common stock fell 6 10 per

the october 2020 budget reflected the emergency in fiscal terms net debt was to rise from 24 8 per cent of gdp in 2019 20 to 43 8 per cent of gdp by june 2024 two years later another october budget and more than half of the 80 billion deficit for 2021 2022 that had been forecast at the march budget has disappeared it was wiped away by higher revenue due to strong commodity prices on the one hand and a significant underspend of allocated funds on the other the government has time to carefully think through how it will fund its policy priorities ahead of the may 2023 budget statement as a result net debt in june 2022 was 22 5 per cent of gdp far below what was expected and not altogether much more than the pre pandemic net debt level of 19 2 per cent of gdp as at june 2019 the budget emergency has subsided with no pressing need therefore for emergency spending cuts and the major policy announcements already known the government has time to carefully think through how it will fund its policy priorities ahead of the may 2023 budget statement meanwhile who will be the winners in this october budget in truth practically everyone advertisement first from budget night the federal public service will finally have its riding instructions the change of government effectively cancelled the march 2022 budget and without it the public service has limited authority to act budget night provides that mandate and government will be back to normality second and closely connected to first the backlog of important but not urgent today matters that have been gathering on the shelf for two years or more can start to be addressed as one example we estimate there are more than 100 measures announced by previous governments but never enacted more than 80 of these are tax measures such as the patent box regime and clarification of the corporate residency test clearing the backlog will reduce policy uncertainty and help keep the economy moving population growth third this budget is bound to raise population growth forecasts as the government has lifted the skilled migrant cap to 195 000 this is good for us all unemployment is very low and participation in the labour force is close to its all time high our worker shortage including in education and the caring economy is caused by an actual lack of workers this risks stoking inflation best avoided fourth this budget offers an opportunity for the government to indicate its direction for the digital economy our online world exploded during the pandemic and cracks were revealed advertisement from improving the legislative and regulatory framework that governs cybersecurity data breaches and consumer protection to the evolution of services australia to the ongoing task of ensuring legislation is technology neutral and digital communication is enabled there is plenty to do finally this budget could do well to resist the redeployment of at least some of last year s underspent funding and either reallocate unspent funds for future years or bank it and commence structural budget repair our bottom line has improved in the short term but structurally we are in deficit with programmatic spending exceeding average revenue in financial year 2021 2022 there was a 5 billion underspend in transport investment and in health we should not continue to rely on windfall revenue and underspent budget allocations to fix our fiscal position over the medium term should structural deficits persist net debt will grow over time and limit our resilience for the next economic shock all things being equal a big if we anticipate gradual fiscal repair could see the budget moving to a surplus in 2034 2035 and net debt reduced to zero by 2049 2050 but only if the government chooses to address this fiscal challenge in the decades ahead after three long years exiting the urgency trap and getting back to business as usual feels exciting even though the hard work of true repair is only just beginning amy auster is chief economist with pwc australia
