source xinhua 2019 01 04 07 10 24 editor zd video player close new york jan 3 xinhua for another year heart wrenching scenes in the aftermath of mass shootings in the united states repeatedly made headlines in 2018 as gun violence was still rampant across the country despite a huge public outcry panicked people were seen fleeing in all directions from deadly bullets heavily armed police stood by in maximum vigilance tears were glistening amid candlelight in vigils politicians expressed condolences but were shy of taking action according to gun violence archive a non profit organization that tracks gun related violence in the united states more than 56 800 shootings took place in 2018 killing over 14 600 people and injuring some 28 000 a slight decline from 2017 but still staggeringly high on average some 40 lives were taken by guns every day across the country as a result of personal conflicts gangster wars terror attacks or public place shooting rampages among others nearly 3 500 of the victims were under 18 years old deadliest attacks in terms of mass shooting which generally means a shooting incident with four or more victims several attacks recorded in 2018 turned out to be among the bloodiest in modern american history on valentine s day 19 year old nikolas cruz a former student at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland the u s state of florida opened fire on campus with an assault style rifle killing 17 students and educators within 6 minutes and 20 seconds three months later in santa fe texas a 17 year old shooter killed 10 and wounded an equal number of others with a shotgun and a 38 revolver in sante fe high school about 54 km southeast of downtown houston many of the victims had attended the same classes with the shooter in october a synagogue in pittsburgh pennsylvania was left in a bloodbath after 46 year old robert bowers killed 11 and injured six others during a baby naming ceremony on a quiet saturday morning he was using an ar 15 assault rifle and three glock 357 handguns in what was believed to be among the deadliest attacks against the jewish community in the united states in november 28 year old ian david long a former u s marine opened fire at the borderline bar and grill in thousand oaks a suburb about 64 km northwest of los angeles using a glock 45 handgun with an extra capacity magazine thirteen people were killed and 11 others injured many of them college students regardless of the motivations or mental status of the attackers they seemed to have chosen guns as their weapons so as to maximize the harm and they especially preferred semi automatic guns that could be legally acquired in many u s states fruitless debates guns have become a coherent part of american culture ever since the founding of the country according to a decade long survey released by the graduate institute of international and development studies in geneva in june 2018 u s citizens who make up only 4 percent of the world population own some 40 percent of all guns in the world despite widespread gun related violence and tragedies gun control has remained one of the most divisive issues among americans with a distinct partisan feature polls have shown that democrats generally support gun control while a vast majority of republicans are gun rights hardliners citing the second amendment of the u s constitution as proof of their undeniable rights in recent years debates over gun laws were revived several times in the wake of major shooting massacres especially after the sandy hook elementary school shooting that claimed the lives of 20 children and the 2017 las vegas carnage that left 59 dead and over 400 wounded however little progress was made by the administrations under president barack obama or president donald trump in this aspect either failing to gain congressional support or lacking the political will to be honest politically they the guns are not going away we will never see strict gun control in the united states jon r taylor a professor of political science at the university of st thomas in houston texas has told xinhua part of it is the second amendment because u s supreme court has ruled consistently over roughly about 130 years or so that state has not the right to strictly restrain the gun ownership and usage taylor said what happened politically is that we get the same mindset of that yes this is terrible yes this is tragic yes something should be done and then a week or two later something else gets our attention and the gun issue declines it s never an issue in presidential campaigns it s brought up but nobody would really talk it that much other than the occasional mass casualty incident he added the problem is also rooted in the obstruction from gun lobbying groups that have been very vocal in preventing meaningful legislation that can prevent gun violence from passing congress said kyleanne hunter vice president for programs at the brady campaign and center to prevent gun violence a not for profit organization dedicated to the fight against gun violence the gun lobby has been hijacked by corporate interests that profit from increased gun sales they have put quite a bit of money into blocking meaningful legislation hunter said in a written interview with xinhua actions and hope still the year 2018 saw many gun control activists especially the younger generations alarmed by the tragic school shootings stand up against the long time inaction of politicians and push for some real changes led by survivors of the parkland florida shooting hundreds of thousands of americans mostly teenagers gathered in washington d c for march for our lives event on march 24 holding signs that read never again and am i next crowds of angry protesters flocked to the pennsylvania avenue which connects the white house to the u s capitol calling for stricter gun laws to ensure school security and protect the country s future i have a dream that enough is enough nine year old yolanda renee king granddaughter of martin luther king told the crowd and that this should be a gun free world period meanwhile some 800 marches happened in various u s cities from coast to coast in new york former beatles member paul mccartney joined the rally and made a stop at a central park memorial honoring his former band mate john lennon who was shot and killed in this area in 1980 one of my best friends was killed in gun violence right around here so it s important to me mccartney told cnn referring to lennon a number of student activists for gun control emerged from the event who were hailed by some u s pro gun control media as representatives of the country s new generation that could make a difference they were on tv interviews and magazines covers taking a firm and unwavering stance on gun control and protecting young americans some positive progress has also been made on the level of state legislatures according to a recent report published by giffords law center 67 new laws regarding gun control were enacted in 2018 in 26 states and washington d c tripling that in 2017 the new regulations on gun use include raising the minimum age to buy guns banning ghost guns and bump stocks disarming domestic abusers among others one of the main takeaways from the 2018 u s midterm elections was that guns were no longer an off limit issue in fact some newly elected members of congress ran specifically on the issue and won said hunter in the brady 2018 national electoral report published by hunter s organization the 2018 midterm elections were labeled as a major victory for the future of gun violence prevention gvp in key races across the country nra national rifle association backed lawmakers with a long history of blocking even basic progress towards passing sensible gun laws were defeated by candidates who ran and won on a gvp platform the report noted however neither the march for our lives nor the progress in state gun laws has been able to prevent fresh shooting tragedies from happening including those in santa fe pittsburgh and thousand oaks while there are good signs of hope the road for effective gun control in the united states is almost certain to remain long and thorny

to grasp the significance of circo s opening in dallas you must understand the empire of italian born patriarch sirio maccioni it s a bit confusing in 1974 maccioni opened le cirque the famous and michelin starred upper east side restaurant that was the ne plus ultra of elegant high end french dining haunted by jacqueline kennedy onassis and other degrees of air kissing titled or social royalty but in 2017 after 43 years le cirque s owners filed for bankruptcy the same year circo the italian style offshoot that opened later in midtown manhattan with a circus tent grand canopy and the exuberance to match also shuttered by then the enterprise had grown to include a le cirque in las vegas and a circo in abu dhabi and was in the hands of maccioni s three sons then came another twist in the tale whiterock hospitality based in dallas stepped in offering to partner with the maccioni sons to oversee the le cirque and circo names across north america for the next 25 years circo dallas was to be the brave new prototype for a brand that has its sights on beverly hills but the glitzy opening long delayed and much researched felt like a series of false starts the decor has elements of tackiness the dangling plaster monkey that cannot help but make me think of michael jackson s pet monkey bubbles the glass bottomed glass pool on the second floor deck with clear plastic chairs they call this circo beach the attendant in the women s restroom who hands you a flute asking if you would like champagne you don t really you are in the bathroom what kind you ask prosecco she answers brightly after tilting both the bottle and her head unlike abu dhabi s circo whose menu is tuscan circo dallas announced it would serve coastal italian fare what is coastal italian few on the floor seemed to know not the servers most nights not one of the shareholders who offered a fuzzy definition that involved gesturing as though to a swath of liguria or amalfi and gushing that the bolognese is not over creamed to chef eddie barron it means an emphasis on seafood his father was a commercial fisherman he knows the medium well perhaps it can be whatever you want it to be that seems to be the principle under which the kitchen operates on an immense white plate a new age blockhouse of romaine comes draped with exactly three cured anchovies a poached egg that hides under a drift of parmesan in a hollow dry brioche sidecar crouton is a gimmick that makes you gasp look closer and you might spy the browned edges of lettuce cut too soon its flaws covered with more parmesan here began the comparisons to wedding banquet fare i felt as though we had time warped to the 80s when chefs impressed with avant garde presentation now things have to tickle other senses too this was followed by the inauspicious appearance of a sodden greasy fritto misto done no favors by a duo of lackluster sauces foie gras that exquisite delicacy was peculiarly bland though well sourced as a slice of torchon surrounded by cognac and honey soaked compressed pears it was upstaged by a toasted brick of brioche and seemed to pop only because of the salt kevin marple kevin marple using his noodle executive chef eddie barron took the helm after opening chef alfio longo left right a hearty beef veal and pork sausage bolognese twines with house made tagliatelle in a filet mignon rossini style that most classic of dishes sumptuously topped with a slice of pan seared foie truffles and a madeira demi glace here a beef jus an abundance of truffle petals were stiff and flavorless as card stock and chanterelles crisp as blackened toast they accompanied a pale and forgettable lobe amid all these trappings was a classic case of over promising and failing to deliver one evening red snapper arrived with lovely fresh artichoke hearts that are carved in the morning and green olives the vegetables rolled in a luxurious sauce vierge but the snapper itself was not sweet instead unpleasantly fishy and 36 hour braised beef cheek a special one night resting on house made pappardelle was cloyingly sticky with an oversweet tacky demi glace that clung to the roof of the mouth the dish needed cutting through from the peppery spice with a mouth filling chianti which is not to say that everything was dismal the gloriously thick wintry bolognese is very good the cacio e pepe meanwhile made me wonder why i paid 24 for a bowl of buttered noodles and overall it seems a very broad menu executed by a team that doesn t quite have everything under its belt the servers will recommend a pinot grigio or chardonnay but are a bit lost if you ask questions if pressured they ll nudge you toward a gavi perhaps hinting it s most like chardonnay it s a shame as aaron benson a fine sommelier was at circo long enough to craft an excellent wine list under his direction this could be a place for a barbera d asti or brunello or a crisp dry little known italian white perfectly chilled one thing they do very well is lobster the le cirque lobster salad is a lovely ring with avocado asparagus tips and nasturtium leaves or baked lobster itself fresh as though just plucked from the sea the meat succulent sweet and pristine though the presentation with herbed bread crumbs lands soupy and gluey the kitchen has changed a number of items and the stuffed lobster is one of them originals from le cirque fare well in their respect for quality and simplicity most notable is the iconic le cirque crème brûlée decadent and silky that crackles and then slips over your tongue it was far better than a grand marnier souffle served with a quenelle of orange sorbet that joined in an impression like hot marmalade or an awful assemblage with a sable crust more like a dull undercooked wafer a curious balsamic zabaglio ne and slivers of unripe poached pear stuck in like razor blades the unfortunate totality set jauntily to the extreme edge of the plate on a saturday night when patrons are dressed to the nines a little girl in her going out dress and a large party in sparkling head turning floor sweeping gowns it seems to achieve what circo dallas aspires to be but there were so many times when i was baffled by the collision of gaffes and high price point let it go my dining partner mouthed the night a server returned to murmur that they couldn t make my macchiato as they lacked the caramel syrup i blinked and then i did

hey there time traveller this article was published 02 01 2019 1930 days ago so information in it may no longer be current new york behind apple s disconcerting news of weak iphone sales lies a more sobering truth the tech industry has hit peak smartphone a tipping point when everyone who can afford one already owns one and no breakthroughs are compelling them to upgrade as frequently as they once did some manufacturers have boosted prices to keep up profit but apple s shortfall highlights the limits of that strategy the company said demand for iphones is waning and revenue for the last quarter of 2018 will fall well below projections a decrease traced mainly to china apple s shares dropped 10 per cent thursday on the news its worst loss since 2013 the company shed 74 6 billion in market value amid a broader sell off among technology companies which suffered their worst loss in seven years the apple logo is displayed at the apple store in the brooklyn borough of new york thursday jan 3 2019 apple s shock warning that its chinese sales are weakening ratcheted up concerns about the world s second largest economy and weighed heavily on global stock markets as well as the dollar on thursday ap photo mary altaffer apple s news is a wakeup call for the industry said analyst dan ives of research firm wedbush securities and it s not just apple demand has been lacklustre across the board ives said samsung long the leading seller of smartphones has been hit even harder as its phone shipments dropped 8 per cent during the 12 months ending in september the smartphone industry is going through significant headwinds ives said smartphone makers used to be like teenagers and the industry was on fire now it feels like they re more like senior citizens in terms of maturity tech innovations in phones grew in leaps and bounds earlier in the 2010s with dramatic improvements in screen size screen resolution battery life cameras and processor speed every year but the industry is a victim of its own success innovation began to slow down around 2014 once apple boosted the screen size with the iphone 6 and 6 plus models while phones kept improving new features tended to be incremental such as a new flash technique to already excellent phone cameras it s the stuff consumers won t typically notice or want to shell out for since the iphone 6 you ve seen it has been tough to innovate to continue to raise the bar ives said apple customers now upgrade every 33 months on average longer than the 24 or 25 months three years ago he said apple s diminished growth projections fueled by plummeting sales in china have reinforced fears the world s second largest economy is losing steam its 1 000 iphone is a tough sell to chinese consumers unnerved by an economic slump and the trade war with the u s they also have a slew of cheaper smartphones from homegrown competitors such as huawei xiaomi and oppo to choose from the fact that even apple s iphone juggernaut is suffering cements a larger trend for all major smartphone makers after a steady rise for a decade worldwide smartphone shipments fell 3 per cent to 1 42 billion in 2018 the first annual drop according to international data corp which tracks such movements idc estimates that shipments will rebound 3 per cent in 2019 to 1 46 billion but that still falls short of 2017 levels it doesn t help that top phones come with four digit price tags 1 100 for the iphone xs max and 1 000 for samsung a galaxy note 9 the top end max model sells for 1 450 in the u s they re getting more and more expensive while offering fewer and fewer new innovative features that i ll actually use said zachary pardes a tech savvy 31 year old in fairfield connecticut i ll upgrade when the battery stops working when i m forced to buy a new phone i ll buy a new phone vivian yang a manager at a beijing technology company also balked at the price nobody needs such a phone she said idc analyst ramon llamas said the cycle might bottom out and start growing again in 2021 or 2022 when people s current phones start reaching the end of their useful life people will still replace their phones it s going to happen eventually he said but there s no silver bullet that will spur growth to levels seen in the past when the industry was less mature foldable smartphones with screens that unfold like a wallet to increase display size are one thing that could spur excitement but they re expensive and not due out until at least the end of the year another thing that might spur growth 5g the next generation that telecom companies are currently in the process of building expected to be faster and more reliable than the current 4g network the first 5g compatible phones are due out this year there s more pressure on 5g as the next wave smartphone since sales are so lacklustre said ives there will be a battle royale for 5g phones winnipeg free press newsletter business weekly monday mornings the latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week sign up i agree to the terms and conditions cookie and privacy policies and casl agreement but 5g will take years for broad nationwide deployment so the new 5g smartphones coming out this year are not likely to make much of a splash immediately either analysts say smartphone makers need to push into under saturated areas like africa and elsewhere and also sell more services like cloud storage streaming music and phone software but the glory days of untrammeled growth appear to be over it s going to be a slow slog llamas said by no means is this the end of the smartphone market but this is an indication that the smartphone market can be a victim of its own success ___ associated press writers tali arbel in new

author s note this three part article is a very detailed analysis of agnc investment corp s nasdaq agnc income statement technically speaking the company s consolidated statement of comprehensive income i continue to perform this type of detailed quarterly analysis for readers who want to fully understand agnc s ever changing mortgage backed securities mbs investment portfolio and risk management strategies for readers who just want the summarized account projections i would suggest to scroll down to the conclusions drawn section at the bottom of each part of the article focus of article the focus of this article is to provide a detailed projection of agnc s comprehensive income for the fourth quarter of 2018 prior to results being provided to the public in late january early february via the company s quarterly press release i would like to analyze agnc s consolidated statement of comprehensive income and provide readers a general direction on how i believe this recent quarter has panned out i believe this quarter has a heightened level of importance to readers due to the recent events surrounding the federal open market committee s fomc decision regarding monetary policy and certain global macroeconomic events which impacted the yield curve specifically there was heightened importance regarding the fomc s decision regarding the federal fed funds rate and movements within the london interbank offered rate libor due to the length of the material covered i believe it is necessary to break this projection article into three parts side note predicting a company s accounting figures within the mortgage real estate investment trust mreit sector is usually more difficult when compared to other sectors due to the various hedging and asset portfolio strategies that are implemented by management each quarter as such there are multiple assumptions used when performing such an analysis agnc s actual reported values may differ materially from my projected values within this article due to unforeseen circumstances which has been a rare occurrence since i began covering agnc over five years ago such variances could occur because management deviates from a company s prior business strategy and pursues a new strategy that was not previously disclosed or anticipated readers should be aware as such all projections within this article are my personal estimates and should not solely be used for any investor s buying or selling decisions all actual reported figures that are above the mean of my account projections will be deemed an outperformance in my judgment all actual reported figures that are below the mean of my account projections will be deemed an underperformance in my judgment unless otherwise noted all figures below are for the three months ended quarterly timeframe to see how my agnc projections for the third quarter of 2018 compared to actual results accurate within range please see the following prior article analyzing agnc investment s results for q3 2018 including november 2018 february 2019 dividend projection by understanding the trends that occurred within agnc s operations during the fourth quarter of 2018 one can apply this information to sector peers as well as such the discussion analysis below is not solely applicable to agnc but to the fixed rate agency mortgage real estate investment trust mreit sector as a whole this includes but is not limited to the following fixed rate agency mreit peers 1 arlington asset investment corp ai 2 armour residential reit inc arr 3 cherry hill mortgage investment corp chmi 4 annaly capital management inc nly and 5 orchid island capital inc orc technically speaking ai s recent entity status is not a reit per the internal revenue code irc but a c corporation however ai still maintained many mreit like characteristics including the type of investments held by the company similar risk management strategies and the amount of dividend distributions paid to shareholders beginning in 2019 ai intends to switch back to a reit entity per the internal revenue code irc consolidated statement of comprehensive income overview using table 1 below as a reference let us first look at agnc s quarterly consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the fourth quarter of 2018 estimate column table 1 also shows agnc s comprehensive income for the first third quarters of 2018 actual columns for comparative purposes table 1 agnc quarterly consolidated statements of comprehensive income source table created by me partially using data obtained from agnc s quarterly investor presentation slides table 1 above is the main source of summarized data regarding agnc s net income loss amount as such all material accounts within table 1 will be separately analyzed and discussed in corresponding order to the boxed blue reference next to the december 31 2018 column part 1 of this article will include an analysis of the following accounts 1 interest income 2 interest expense and 3 gain loss on sale of investment securities net part 2 of this article will include an analysis on the following account including several sub accounts 4 gain loss on derivative instruments and other securities net 1 interest income estimate of 580 million range 530 630 million confidence within range moderate to high see boxed blue reference 1 in table 1 above and table 2 below next to the december 31 2018 column agnc s interest income is comprised of the following two sub accounts a cash interest income and b premium amortization net i show my projection for these two figures in table 2 below some past actual figures within table 2 are derived from agnc s 10 q or 10 k where applicable this excludes all recalculated figures and ratios as such there will not be an identical sheet agnc provides that matches the data i have prepared in table 2 below table 2 agnc quarterly interest income projection source table created by me partially using agnc data obtained from the sec s edgar database the first component of agnc s interest income is the company s cash interest income sub account two assumptions should be noted within table 2 above when projecting agnc s cash interest income for the fourth quarter of 2018 first i am projecting agnc s average securities at cost balance increased by 11 8 billion rounded for the fourth quarter of 2018 when compared to the prior quarter 76 2 billion versus 64 3 billion i would consider this a notable increase and a somewhat aggressive projection this is mainly due to a projected increase in agnc s mbs investment portfolio as a direct result of the company s august and november 2018 equity offerings i am projecting agnc increased the company s on balance sheet mbs investment portfolio while basically maintaining its net long to be announced tba mbs position which is discussed in part 2 during most of the fourth quarter of 2018 second i am projecting a minor increase to agnc s weighted average coupon wac for the fourth quarter of 2018 when compared to the prior quarter 3 86 versus 3 77 this projection factors in agnc s tba mbs position portfolio reinvestment and the net movement of mortgage interest rates during the quarter still using table 2 above as a reference i am projecting a cash interest income increase of 119 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 when compared to the prior quarter 700 million versus 581 million the second component of agnc s interest income is the company s premium amortization net sub account during a falling interest rate environment generally an increase in prepayments will occur because a growing number of homeowners have mortgages that have higher interest rates when compared to current market interest rates as such the attractiveness of a mortgage refinance increases as a result prepayment risk generally increases while extension risk decreases therefore the average life of agnc s fixed rate agency mbs portfolio generally shortens this would directly lead to a higher quarterly premium amortization expense in addition seasonality trends should also be considered when analyzing projecting this account after a modest net increase in mortgage interest rates long term u s treasury yields during the first half of the fourth quarter of 2018 a sharp reversal occurred during the second half of the quarter through research i have determined a majority of agnc s mbs holdings experienced a minor modest net conditional prepayment rate cpr percentage increase during the fourth quarter of 2018 as a whole i also believe agnc s lifetime cpr as of 12 31 2018 slightly modestly increased when compared to 9 30 2018 this has a negative impact on agnc s premium amortization expense using table 2 above as a reference including the assumption of a larger average mbs balance partially offset by a lower weighted average purchase price during the quarter i am projecting a premium amortization net expense increase of 39 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 when compared to the prior quarter 120 million versus 81 million when my projections for the cash interest income and premium amortization net expense sub accounts are combined i am projecting agnc s interest income to increase by 80 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 when compared to the prior quarter 580 million versus 500 million 2 interest expense estimate of 400 million range 360 440 million confidence within range moderate to high see boxed blue reference 2 in table 1 above and table 3 below next to the december 31 2018 column now let us take a look at agnc s interest expense account i show my projection for this figure in table 3 below some past actual figures within table 3 are derived from agnc s 10 q or 10 k where applicable this excludes all recalculated figures and ratios i have gathered specific information derived from multiple tables charts for a more detailed analysis of agnc s interest expense account table 3 agnc quarterly interest expense projection source table created by me partially using agnc data obtained from the sec s edgar database to project agnc s quarterly interest expense one takes the quarterly average of the company s outstanding repurchase agreements and multiplies this amount by the quarterly average cost of funds rate once this figure is calculated one needs to back out a portion of the quarterly interest income expense in relation to agnc s interest rate payer swaps this reclassified amount is accounted for within agnc s gain loss on derivative instruments and other securities net account this account will be projected in part 2 of the article the final calculated amount is agnc s quarterly interest expense figure there is also another methodology that can be performed to project agnc s interest expense account including a reclassification amount however for purposes of this article i will solely focus on the methodology shown in table 3 above two assumptions should be noted within table 3 when projecting agnc s quarterly interest expense figure for the fourth quarter of 2018 first let us calculate an appropriate quarterly average repurchase agreements balance based on an earlier calculated figure within agnc s interest income account see table 2 above i am projecting the company had a quarterly average securities at cost balance of 76 2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018 if one takes this figure and divides it by the quarterly average of agnc s outstanding repurchase agreements balance a calculated ratio of average securities versus average repurchase agreements is projected this ratio has been in a range of 1 14 1 16 during the prior three quarters for the fourth quarter of 2018 i am using a ratio of 1 15 when calculated this balance is projected to be 66 3 billion this is a projected increase of 10 0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018 when compared to the prior quarter 66 3 billion versus 56 3 billion second let us now obtain a suitable quarterly average cost of funds rate i am projecting an increase of 15 basis points bps regarding agnc s average cost of funds rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 when compared to the prior quarter 2 00 versus 1 85 as mentioned earlier all interest income expense in relation to agnc s interest rate payer swaps are reclassified out of this account as such a portion of the quarterly average cost of funds rate is not in relation to agnc s outstanding repurchase agreements agnc s interest expense regarding the company s outstanding repurchase agreements is based on a small fixed rate percentage and a variable rate percentage mainly based on libor during the fourth quarter of 2018 repurchase agreement interest rates rose by a fairly similar amount when compared to current spot u s libor agnc s weighted average interest rate on the company s outstanding repurchase agreements was 2 30 and 2 18 as of 9 30 2018 and 6 30 2018 respectively u s libor had a modest notable net increase across all tenors maturities during the fourth quarter of 2018 this was mainly due to the market s anticipation that the fomc would once again increase the fed funds rate in december 2018 as i have correctly stated for several years via articles and comments once the fed funds rate lifted off u s libor would either immediately follow suit and increase by roughly the same bps or the market would anticipate such a move thus causing u s libor to increase leading up to this event now that we have determined agnc s average repurchase agreements balance and average cost of funds rate let us calculate the company s interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 still using table 3 above as a reference after a reclassification of 70 million in relation to the net periodic interest income regarding agnc s interest rate swaps third consecutive quarter interest income would be recorded received by the company very important to understand as this partially mitigates the rise in borrowing costs i am projecting the company s interest expense to increase by 88 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 when compared to the prior quarter 400 million versus 312 million 3 gain loss on sale of investment securities net estimate of 75 million range 175 25 million confidence within range moderate to high see boxed blue reference 3 in table 1 above next to the december 31 2018 column agnc s gain loss on sale of investment securities net account can be somewhat difficult to accurately project at times through detailed research and data compilation one can project to a reasonable degree how management should act within any given quarter regarding purchases and sales however i stress beforehand this will not be an exact science each quarter there will be some variances that occur in a quarter if more less sales and or purchases actually occur versus originally projected additionally unanticipated quarterly changes in the percentage of coupons maturities held within the mbs portfolio would cause a slight deviation in asset valuations at periodic intervals management provides some clarity on the company s intended strategy regarding investment sales when mortgage interest rates long term u s treasury yields rise or fall however several assumptions still need to be made therefore this particular account is directly tied to agnc s unrealized gain loss on investment securities measured at fair market value fmv through net income net and unrealized gain loss on available for sale afs securities net accounts that will be discussed in part 3 of this article therefore if agnc s gain loss on sale of investment securities net actual amount is above or below my projected figure range the variance is automatically offset in these two other accounts as such my combined projected figures would be accurately represented this consideration has been proven correct in numerous prior quarters in my professional opinion these three accounts should really be looked at as one combined account the unrealized gain loss on investment securities measured at fmv through net income net and unrealized gain loss on afs securities net accounts have an immediate impact on bv while the gain loss on sale of investment securities net account is merely a reclassification out of the unrealized account readers should understand this notion prior to this account s analysis when compared to the prior quarter i am anticipating a relatively unchanged amount of activity within this account during the current quarter as such i am projecting an investment sold at cost amount of 5 0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018 the more important figure to discuss is not the amount of investment securities sold but whether a gain loss occurred from the quarterly sales as of 6 30 2018 agnc had an accumulated other comprehensive loss ocl balance of 1 11 billion agnc s accumulated ocl balance increased to 1 30 billion as of 9 30 2018 with the modest material net increase in mbs pricing across most coupons during the fourth quarter of 2018 analyzed in part 3 the probability of the company recording a net loss within this account in future quarters has partially decreased the total amount of agnc s net realized gain loss would be dependent on which particular investment securities were sold and at what time during the quarter these sales occurred when taking both factors above into consideration i am projecting agnc will report a net realized loss on the sale of investment securities of 75 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 which would be a minor increase when compared to a net realized loss of 40 million during the prior quarter brief discussion of nly s mbs investment portfolio impacts to the same general accounts discussed above when it comes to agnc s sector peer nly i see several minor modest differences that would impact the accounts described above for instance as of 9 30 2018 only 5 of nly s fixed rate agency mbs portfolio consisted of 15 year maturities whereas agnc had 14 of the company s mbs portfolio in 15 year maturities including tba mbs positions it should also be noted beginning several years ago nly diversified the company s investment portfolio by allocating more capital into commercial debt real estate preferred equity corporate debt residential whole loans mortgage servicing rights msr and middle market mm lending nly s added diversification should result in reduced volatility during certain interest rate cycles reduction in duration in addition nly acquired a variable rate agency mreit hatteras financial corp hts in 2016 and acquired a hybrid mreit mtge investment corp mtge in september 2018 these additional portfolios will impact nly s interest income and expense accounts accordingly proportionately speaking conclusions drawn part 1 to sum up the analysis above i am projecting agnc will report the following account figures for the fourth quarter of 2018 look back to table 1 near the beginning of the article for quick reference 1 quarterly interest income of 580 million 2 quarterly interest expense of 400 million 3 quarterly net loss on the sale of investment securities of 75 million first i am projecting agnc had a modest increase in interest income when compared to the prior quarter i am projecting an increase of 80 million in this account due to the following factors regarding agnc s mbs investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2018 when compared to the prior quarter 1 notable increase in the average securities balance positive factor 2 minor increase in the wac rate positive factor and 3 modest increase in net premium amortization expense negative factor second i am projecting agnc had a modest increase to the company s interest expense figure when compared to the prior quarter i am projecting an increase of 88 million in this account due to the following factors during the fourth quarter of 2018 when compared to the prior quarter 1 notable increase in agnc s average outstanding repurchase agreements balance negative factor and 2 modest increase to the weighted average interest rate on the company s outstanding repurchase agreements negative factor therefore when compared to the prior quarter i am projecting a very minor decrease in agnc s net spread income when excluding tba mbs activity during the fourth quarter of 2018 which should be seen as a cautionary trend third i am projecting agnc had a modest net realized loss on the company s investment securities sales during the fourth quarter of 2018 this projection is due to the following factors 1 very large ocl balance as of 9 30 2018 negative factor and 2 modest material increase in fixed rate agency mbs pricing across most coupons during the fourth quarter of 2018 more of a positive factor for future quarters my buy sell or hold recommendation i decided to provide my agnc recommendation to readers after part 1 of this article so there is a better sense on my thoughts regarding the company s current valuation so readers do not have to wait until part 3 i would stress beforehand this recommendation is based on all of my agnc account projections including accounts that will be discussed in part 2 and part 3 all i ask is to please be patient for part 2 and part 3 also please do not ask for my agnc book value bv projection as of 12 31 2018 until it is provided in a future bv article see my final note below on how to gain access to my 12 31 2018 and current bv projections on all 20 mreit stocks i cover prior to earnings throughout the quarter from the analysis provided above including additional catalysts factors not discussed within this particular article i currently rate agnc as a sell when i believe the company s stock price is trading above my projected non tangible bv as of 12 31 2018 a hold when trading at through less than a 7 5 discount to my projected non tangible bv as of 12 31 2018 and a buy when trading at or greater than a 7 5 discount to my projected non tangible bv as of 12 31 2018 these ranges are unchanged when compared to my last agnc article approximately two weeks ago therefore i currently rate agnc as a hold since the stock is trading at through less than a 7 5 discount to my projected non tangible bv as of 12 31 2018 along with the data presented within this article this recommendation considers the following mreit catalysts factors 1 projected future mbs price movements 2 projected future derivative valuations and 3 projected near term dividend per share rates this recommendation also considers the recent four fed funds rate increases by the fomc during 2018 this is a more hawkish view when compared to most of last year and possible two increases during 2019 due to recent macroeconomic trends events this also considers the continued wind down decrease of the fed s balance sheet through gradual runoff partial non reinvestment which began in october 2017 which has increased spread basis risk part 1 of this article is only a partial analysis of agnc s consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the fourth quarter of 2018 part 2 of this article will just pick up where part 1 s analysis ends part 2 of this article will discuss agnc s projected gain loss on derivative instruments and other securities net account part 2 will also discuss agnc s projected net income and earnings per share eps amounts part 3 of this article will discuss agnc s projected oci ocl and comprehensive income loss amounts part 3 will also summarize agnc s entire statement of comprehensive income loss this will be followed by a projection of agnc s bv as of 12 31 2018 and the company s current bv in late january which will be available to readers

political watchers are well aware that former new york mayor michael bloomberg is probably running for president in 2020 that makes his media empire s attacks on president donald trump more concerning than ever the cover story of the jan 7 issue of bloomberg businessweek shows a dejected looking trump with his red tie extending all the way to the ground the trump slump the headline read why the market said goodbye to the trump bump green means up and red means down in the stock market lately there have been many red days but the true color of today s market is golden orange the hue of the pompadour atop the head of president donald trump wrote economics editor peter coy with joshua green and shawn donnan they added because for better and for worse this has become trump s stock market after calling out the president for his volatile personality and volatile presidency they noted the recent increase in a market volatility index they quipped america finally has a stock market to match the man in the oval office although they acknowledged the conventional wisdom among economists that presidents deserve less credit and blame for stock moves he insisted there are times when presidents do matter a lot and this is one of them the article clearly tried to pin the blame on trump but without providing much evidence for that argument the writers admitted there s a theory to explain volatility being lower despite the trump chaos until october when something soured for stocks the question is what and who s to blame they asked before citing trump s contribution as the trade war with china twitter attacks on the chairman of the federal reserve and trump s leadership style while it was a fair point to note trump has claimed credit for stocks rise and blamed others for the downswing the writers calling that rough justice ultimately the cover story was heavy on supposition and light on proof connecting trump to the slump perhaps that s why it closed with a parting shot the trump slump is a bigger phenomenon than just a downturn in the stock market but every red day on wall street is another punch to the president s gut although bloomberg hasn t formally announced his presidential bid yet he s held private meetings with iowa democrats and even told radio iowa he might sell his media company if he runs so far he s still the owner of not only bloomberg businessweek but bloomberg com bloomberg television bloomberg radio and bloomberg live
jars of sunflower butter and tahini butter made by oskri have been voluntarily recalled by the company over fears that they may be contaminated with listeria listeria is a bacteria and infections are marked by high fever intense headaches body aches and stiffness as well as gastrointestinal symptoms like pain nausea and diarrhea the infection is particularly dangerous to pregnant women and has been known to cause stillbirths and miscarriages but no one has been sickened so far listeria was discovered in two jars of the oskri sunflower butter that were sold to consumers in ohio but additional jars were distributed to california arizona georgia connecticut indiana texas florida south carolina and new hampshire jars of osrki tahini butter organic sunflower butter and thrive sunflower butter left to right sold in 10 us states have been recalled over fears they may be contaminated with listeria oskri is recalling shipments which included products expiring in october 2019 january 2020 and february 2020 this includes lot 099 of organic sunflower butter tahini butter shipped in lot 193 and thrive sunflower butter from lot 233 all of the potentially contaminated products were sold in 16 oz plastic jars and the lot number should be visible on the top or the bottom listeria is most often found in deli meat and hot dogs spreads dairy products including certain cheeses smoked seafood and spruts but it can find its way into other foods as well and there are usually a few outbreaks a year the bacteria comes from soil and water and occurs naturally in poultry and cows which is why it is often found in meats and dairy products and can survive even refrigerator temperatures fortunately for healthy adults they are not usually vulnerable to the infection and it isn t typically life threatening when they do get it pregnant women too usually develop only a mild illness but the infection can be devastating even deadly to developing fetuses listeria may also endanger the lives of the elderly and small children if they eat food contaminated with the bacteria so it poses a serious enough threat that even when it s possible that food is contaminated with the bacteria the food and drug administration fda asks its producer to pull all products that may have been contaminated from shelves oskri said in a statement that the contamination was discovered because one of its customers randomly sent our product in for testing and it tested positive for listeria as a result the fda and osrki are urging retailers to return their stocks and consumers to throw away any of the three products if they match the reported lot numbers and expiration dates meanwhile the agency and company will continue to investigate the circumstances of the outbreak
it was only a matter of time before people said no more and when they did they said it in chinese apple inc s admission that sales of its iphones would fall 5 billion short of expectations was a stunner all right but it wasn t exactly a surprise for the past couple of years the company has propped up its revenue by charging lavish prices for the iphone 1 000 or more for a gadget that s only slightly better than the one users already had you saw it coming of course but don t get too cocky we all did advertisement we should have seen that part of it coming too china is apple s third biggest market after the united states and europe but it is facing a sluggish economy aggravated by a simmering trade war with the united states at the same time the country s own smartphone makers like huawei oppo vivo and xiaomi make excellent phones and charge half the price of an iphone so when millions of patriotic chinese facing a thrifty new reality are due for a new smartphone why bother with apple get trendlines a business newsletter from globe columnist larry edelman covering the trends shaping business and the economy in boston and beyond enter email sign up but the chinese downshift isn t the whole story in his letter to apple shareholders chief executive tim cook admitted that even in developed markets iphone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be presumably he is referring to the united states europe and japan to tim bajarin president of industry research firm creative strategies the message is clear apple s nosebleed pricing strategy has reached its limit i think apple s actually dealing with the threshold of how much they can charge for a product bajarin said i think everything over 1 000 isn t going to fly anymore and that means apple s in for a challenging year or two as it recalibrates its business strategy the stock took a major drubbing on wall street thursday igniting a big selloff in us markets it ended the day down nearly 10 percent advertisement let s not exaggerate the damage though apple is still vastly successful and astoundingly rich it expects to have about 130 billion in cash at the end of this quarter and despite the falloff in china sales cook said first quarter earnings per share would set a record thanks to a 19 percent revenue increase in the company s other businesses apple watch cloud based services such as apple music and the app store and the venerable mac line of personal computers which got a major overhaul last year still the iphone is about two thirds of apple s revenue so the company must change its ways so what s the plan in his letter cook tells us what to expect first apple will offer new incentives to trade in old phones it sounds like a continuation of last year s unusually aggressive trade in program the desperation move that alerted apple watchers that there really was trouble in paradise still it s a smart play apple can avoid a humiliating and costly price cut on its premium products while still making them more affordable meanwhile the used phones get refurbished and resold often to people who ve never owned an iphone before now apple can sell these people on subscribing to the company s cloud based services like music streaming apps and online data storage it s an excellent way to keep making money in a smartphone market that s not growing anymore advertisement yet this strategy amounts to a holding action cook alerts us to expect more apple innovates like no other company on earth he said and we are not taking our foot off the gas what s next the next big thing in smartphones will probably be 5g the superfast wireless technology that s just starting to be deployed in a few cities in the united states and abroad apple has said it doesn t expect to sell a 5g iphone until 2020 which makes sense because it will probably take at least that long before 5g is widely available but other phone makers including samsung and huawei plan to offer 5g phones this year so 5g alone won t give apple much of an edge unless they can combine it with something more like augmented reality perhaps that s the technology that lets you see digital images overlaid on the real world and without a lot of fuss apple has been making major investments in it for one thing apple has added augmented reality features to its iphone software but it has also spent millions of dollars buying up companies that make the components needed for a new kind of augmented reality device one of them makes sensors for tracking eye movements another makes head mounted displays and another builds see through video screens for ar glasses existing ar glasses are far too heavy and bulky because of all the computing horsepower needed to make them work enter 5g it moves data so fast that remote computers in the cloud could do the hard work then the network could relay augmented reality images to a sleek and comfortable pair of glasses with the apple logo etched into the frame advertisement tim bajarin is convinced ar is apple s next big bet if they get that right he said it ll be another big innovative hit for them indeed it would be apple s first new product category since the ipad was released nine years ago can apple make it work it s no sure thing but the company needs a new hit after the chinese meltdown apple s smartphone business will never

washington it s now been one year since the republican controlled congress passed a major federal tax overhaul for individuals and businesses since that time both supporters and opponents of the tax cuts and jobs act have been monitoring its impact on americans the 2017 tax bill cut taxes for most americans including the middle class but it mostly benefited the wealthy and corporations by slashing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent in addition its treatment of pass through entities resulted in an estimated 17 billion in tax savings for millionaires in 2018 american corporations are also showering their shareholders with stock buybacks which many say is due in part to their tax savings prior to the tax plan passage at the end of december 2017 treasury secretary steven mnuchin forecast that the stock market will go up higher if republicans passed the tax overhaul package he also said that not only would the gop s tax plan pay for itself but it will pay for the debt and added it would cut down the deficits by a trillion dollars however one year later both the s p 500 and dow jones industrial average were down from where they were on december 22 2017 when president donald trump signed the tax cuts and jobs act and the united states federal budget deficit has also increased to 779 billion in fiscal year 2018 up 17 percent from the year before critics of the tax plan point to the growing deficit and the wall street tumble as proof that americans are not seeing the broad benefits proponents of the law were hoping for and are now casting fears and concerns on what the long term repercussions of the plan will be for middle class and low income americans chautauqua county s representative in congress tom reed r corning ny 23 disagrees with the recent criticism that s been expressed the past couple weeks like most republicans in congress reed voted in favor of the tax plan during a conference call on wednesday with local media wrfa asked him if the critical assessments of the plan one year later are warranted when you look at unemployment numbers that are now at historic levels when you look at the growth that we re seeing across all spectrums of the u s economy when you see the investments that are behind those job numbers when you see folks having their wages start to increase for the first time wage growth not being stagnet or decreasing but increasing that is directly attributable to the tax cut bill and that is exactly what we were designing it to do reed said reed is correct about unemployment the u s bureau of labor statistics reports the national unemployment rate decrease by 0 4 percentage points between november 2017 and november 2018 with 155 000 jobs being created in november 2018 alone unemployment figures for december 2018 will be released on friday the bureau also reported real average hourly earnings increased 0 8 percent seasonally adjusted from november 2017 to november 2018 reed also said the tax plan has allowed business opportunities to grow and that the treasury is seeing increased revenue we re allowing people to invest their money more rapidly into their entrepreneurial and innovative spirit we re allowing them to grow their businesses and create new businesses which means more jobs and now we re starting to see on the revenue side in the u s treasury coffers growth on revenue of 2 percent going in reed pointed out despite reed s assurance that the tax plan is doing what was intended critics say that while the tax cuts have juiced economic growth and injected a one time jolt into the us economy it s not going to last forever and the short term economic boon has already started to dissipate one such indicator is gross domestic product which saw growth at an estimated 4 2 percent in the second quarter of 2018 and at 3 5 percent in the third quarter of the year number for the 4th quarter have not yet been released but most economists agree those numbers aren t sustainable on an extended basis they also say the tax reform package was the wrong thing because it disproportionately benefits the wealthy and corporations and also done at wrong time because it was an attempt to deliver fiscal stimulus when the economy was already strong and it might have been a better idea to try to address the debt congressman reed said that the best way to address the debt is to not tax your way out of it but instead work to reduce government spending he said that can be done by not slashing social safety net programs but instead by establishing policies that cut healthcare costs which in turn would bring down government spending for programs like medicare without harming those who rely on it i think a lot of the health insurance reforms of the affordable care act will remain and go forward but if we can prioritize the issue of reform by focusing on health care costs you would not only be impacting the private market place but most importantly if you deploy those healthcare costs reduction measures in the space of medicaid medicare you would have a huge positive impact on the spending ledger when it comes to federal expenditures reed noted the idea of congress tackling healthcare costs has been brought up in both the house and senate earlier this year u s senator and doctor bill cassidy r la put forward six policy areas to lower healthcare costs empowering patients to reduce their healthcare costs lowering health insurance premiums ending healthcare monopolies by increasing competition decreasing drug costs for patients eliminating administrative burdens and costs reducing costs through primary care prevention and chronic disease management time will tell if new laws are passed to help control healthcare cost and if the users of healthcare take advantage of that which could help to reduce spending in programs like medicare the other option for cutting spending would be to simply restrict access to medicare to some americans currently using the program something that is unlikely to take place as long as democrats remain in control of one of the two chambers of congress it also appears only time will tell just how beneficial or problematic the gop tax reform plan of 2017 will be for america

russia s 2014 annexation of crimea its war in eastern ukraine its interference in the 2016 u s presidential election and other aggressive acts against the united states and its allies demand a strong western response for the past four years that response has been dominated by sanctions and other coercive economic measures u s and european officials have hoped that the economic measures would not only exact a cost for such actions but also deter the kremlin from escalating its assault on american and european interests the economic pressure has certainly had an effect the imf estimated that the sanctions linked to the 2014 invasion of ukraine cost russia 1 to 1 5 percent of its gdp by mid 2015 the sanctions also hurt the russian treasury s bottom line since russia had to make up for lost western capital by spending billions of dollars to prop up large companies that depended on western funds the more recent sanctions announced in april 2018 in response to russia s interference in the u s election rattled russian financial markets and put pressure on the value of the ruble specific people and companies have also felt the squeeze the net worth of oleg deripaska the pro putin oligarch for example has tumbled because of u s sanctions and yet sanctions have done little to change moscow s ways not only has russia refused to make concessions on its military intervention in ukraine but in november 2018 it seized three ukrainian naval ships transiting the kerch strait according to a recent report by u s director of national intelligence dan coats sanctions did not stop russia from interfering in the u s midterm elections in 2018 and indeed coats said that china and iran tried to interfere as well nor have they dissuaded moscow from abetting north korea s efforts to bypass international sanctions propping up syrian president bashar al assad or using a military grade nerve agent in the salisbury attack on sergei skripal a russian exile living in the united kingdom the united states and europe need a tough coherent strategy to contain russia s economy and to have a meaningful chance of affecting russian decision making targeted sanctions remain useful in punishing individual officials oligarchs and companies when they attack western interests but simply imposing such measures from time to time in response to russian provocations will never change russia s behavior instead a more ambitious long term approach is needed that focuses not only on specific officials and oligarchs but on russian government revenues and the russian economy as a whole in a best case scenario a more ambitious economic strategy could raise political tensions in russia and convince putin to curb his aggression but even in the more likely scenario where economic pressure fails to alter putin s strategic calculus an ambitious strategy is key to undercutting russia s ability to achieve putin s objectives for an example of an effective program of economic pressure policymakers need look no further than the end of the cold war in 1983 u s president ronald reagan signed national security decision directive 75 nsdd 75 stating that u s policy was to contain and over time reverse soviet expansionism the directive identified four intermediate economic goals to ensure that western relations with the soviet union did not facilitate soviet military power to avoid subsidizing the soviet union so as to increase internal economic stresses over time to minimize soviet economic leverage over u s allies in europe and around the world and to permit some trade such as grain trade that was mutually beneficial and offered no strategic advantage for all that has changed over the past 35 years reagan s economic campaign against the soviet union still provides a useful template for a modern approach to containing russia a better strategy any economic pressure campaign likely to affect russia s outlook has to starve the country s military industrial complex the united states and europe know this they adopted export controls against russian defense industries in 2014 and in 2017 the u s congress passed a law sanctioning foreign companies and governments that engage in significant transactions with the russian defense sector these sanctions threaten russia s ability to export military equipment a trade that is worth billions of dollars to russia annually and helps extend the country s global influence in september of this year the trump administration sanctioned a senior chinese military official and the chinese military s equipment development department for purchasing russian combat aircraft and a russian air defense system any economic pressure campaign likely to affect russia s outlook has to starve the country s military industrial complex washington should press this advantage further still persuading u s partner countries such as india and turkey to cancel planned purchases of major russian defense systems in doing so the trump administration should rely not only on the threat of sanctions but also on positive inducements such as the potential for greater u s military cooperation washington s decision late last month to authorize the sale of patriot missiles to turkey for example allows a u s ally to use u s military equipment instead of russian technology at the same time the united states can put pressure on russia s military supply chains although russia produces most of its defense equipment domestically it still imports component parts and dual use equipment technology that has both military and non military uses technological innovations with major military applications such as autonomous vehicles are dominated by u s firms and will likely increase u s and european leverage in this area any measures western governments can take to constrain russia s access to such emerging technologies are worth pursuing western policymakers are already aware of the need to withhold resources from russia s military but military sanctions are only one piece of a larger and more complex effort to diminish russia s economy and state revenues on this score since 2014 policymakers in washington and brussels have been reluctant to impose the most severe sanctions on russia such as blacklisting the largest russian banks or kicking russia out of the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication swift international payments network out of concern for the effect such sanctions might have on global financial and energy markets with russian european trade alone amounting to nearly 200 billion euros approximately 230 billion each year and russia remaining one of the world s dominant energy producers the collateral costs of suddenly unwinding trade and financial relationships could be very high indeed the u s treasury department was forced to partly roll back the sanctions it imposed on deripaska who made his fortune in global metals markets after the sanctions caused global aluminum prices to rise 20 percent in the weeks after they were announced indeed in late december the treasury department announced that it would remove several of deripaska s companies from u s sanctions lists in exchange for deripaska divesting a part of his shares u s and european officials are right to be concerned about how sanctions could affect market stability but there are still viable options sanctions and tough diplomacy could be used to deter new large scale investments in key russian export sectors such as energy which in 2018 reached a post soviet record level of production and which continues to attract significant new western investment the goal of new sanctions should not be to cause a near term disruption in this and other commodity exports which could raise global prices and have significant adverse consequences instead they should be designed to deter new investments in russia with the goal of reducing the long term volume and value of these exports and other major sources of russian revenue over time this gradual decline would give alternative suppliers time to enter the breach in addition russia s leverage over major global energy companies would gradually weaken as the companies refrain from making new investments in russia restrictions on moscow s access to international capital markets including its sovereign borrowing are another useful tool and would reduce the capital available for investment inside russia taking these steps would gradually make russia s adventurism harder to sustain even while the kremlin would be forced to make stressful tradeoffs among domestic economic priorities to increase the discomfort u s and european officials should continue to try to drive a wedge between putin and a russian oligarch class that has profited handsomely off of his tenure but the efficacy of oligarch sanctions has its limits landing on u s and european sanctions lists has if anything forced some oligarchs to tie themselves even more tightly to the kremlin given the lack of alternative business opportunities for example one of the first oligarchs sanctioned in 2014 longtime putin confidant and childhood judo partner arkady rotenberg ended up becoming the contractor putin hired to build the bridge connecting mainland russia to the occupied crimean peninsula this suggests that oligarch sanctions may be stronger in the threat than in the execution policymakers should therefore make very clear what steps russian oligarchs can take to distance themselves from putin in order to avoid sanctions russian aluminum tycoon oleg deripaska leaves after the talks of russian president vladimir putin with south korean president moon jae in at the kremlin in moscow june 2018 sergei karpuhkin reuters ultimately an economically weakened russia is a russia with less leverage over other nations including the united states and europe but loosening those bonds requires a dedicated effort one that policymakers should aggressively make since 2014 the european union has taken steps to reduce its dependence on russian energy pledging to import more liquefied natural gas from the united states this step is a positive one but just last year russian oil giant rosneft announced plans to acquire one of india s largest refiners essar washington and allied governments should use diplomacy and international investment restrictions to encourage governments to block such acquisitions particularly by russian state linked companies because they provide russia with long term leverage in the countries where they occur in the united states the trump administration can use the recently reformed committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius review process to restrict russia s ability to acquire stakes in technology firms doing so will not only reduce russian leverage over u s businesses but also prevent russia from gaining access to cutting edge u s technology congress could step up disclosure requirements around russian real estate purchases which have become a gray market haven for russian money and congress should enact legislation requiring greater disclosure about who owns companies in the united states which a 2012 study found ranks as the second easiest country in the world in which to establish a shell company the lack of disclosure around real estate purchases and corporate ownership creates loopholes for putin s cronies to move money into the united states taken together these tactics will significantly increase the economic pressure on russia but even as they pursue this plan the united states and europe should be careful not to hinder mutually beneficial trade just as reagan recognized 35 years ago with the soviet union some business can serve both countries interests western exports of consumer products automobiles and other non sensitive goods for example generally benefit ordinary russians as opposed to the russian state russia remains a profitable export market for the western manufacturers of such goods new tools in putting this strategy into practice policymakers would rely on familiar tools sanctions export controls and national security reviews of foreign investments but they should think of creative new ways to put additional pressure on moscow reagan after all also authorized large scale covert attacks on russia s energy pipeline infrastructure in 2011 for example the european union initiated an antitrust investigation into the state controlled russian oil company gazprom the eu settled the investigation in may 2018 in exchange for price concessions allowing gazprom s european customers to resell gas across national boundaries the eu should vigorously enforce this agreement and impose heavy fines on gazprom and other russian government controlled companies should they engage in future anticompetitive activities litigation can also play a role in the strategy ukraine has already sought billions of dollars from russia over the latter s failure to reliably supply gas since the countries 2014 conflict began ukraine has also brought a legal challenge at the international court of justice over russia s seizure of crimea the u s and european governments can encourage other victims of russia s malign activities ranging from assassinations to cyberattacks to bring suit russia can claim sovereign immunity a legal doctrine that generally limits citizens right to sue foreign governments for governmental actions to oppose such lawsuits russia for example is seeking to invoke sovereign immunity to block the democratic national committee s lawsuit over russia s hacking of the its computer servers during the 2016 election western governments could provide would be plaintiffs with legal tools by limiting sovereign immunity as a defense in cases involving election interference and certain other major crimes much as the u s congress has limited terrorist supporting countries right to claim sovereign immunity as a defense a heightened risk of private litigation and the possibility that victims of malicious russian activities will be awarded russian assets could chill moscow s enthusiasm for extending its influence through such means playing the long game containment through economic pressure is a long game just as it was during the cold war reagan did not expect his strategy to result in immediate soviet policy shifts in central asia latin america or europe back in 1983 and he noted that it was unlikely to yield a rapid breakthrough in bilateral relations today there is always a chance that raising economic pressure will ultimately convince putin to curb his attacks on the united states and its allies especially if doing so forces russia to begin cutting domestic spending on key programs and state subsidies to close allies that underpin his government s popularity the more likely scenario however is that putin will continue to challenge the west in that case a strategy designed to gradually weaken the russian economy and bring about growing internal divisions and tradeoffs is necessary to limit the kremlin s ability to advance its foreign policy washington should always be open to relaxing pressure and improving relations if russia does change course unless it does however washington must seek to contain and undermine russia s economy over the long

what to know kelleher co founded southwest airlines in 1967 first flight was in 1971 often regarded as a maverick and a pioneer for spearheading an employee first philosophy in management funeral arrangements for kelleher are pending herb kelleher co founder and chairman emeritus of dallas based southwest airlines died thursday at the age of 87 herb was a pioneer a maverick and an innovator his vision revolutionized commercial aviation and democratized the skies herb s passion zest for life and insatiable investment in relationships made lasting and immeasurable impressions on all who knew him and will forever be the bedrock and esprit de corps of southwest airlines the airline said in a statement the entire southwest family extends our deepest sympathies to herb s wife joan and his entire family the airline posted online a long farewell to its founder which can be read here kelleher s private funeral for friends and family will be held wednesday at christ episcopal church in san antonio according to a san antonio mortuary a public celebration of kelleher s life will be held in dallas at a later date kelleher was nothing short of a texas icon as legend has it kelleher and co founder rollin king sketched out their plan for southwest airlines in 1967 on a cocktail napkin however due to a prolonged legal battle it would be more than four years before the intrastate airline would get off the ground when the first flight departed love field in june 1971 the airline had just three aircraft and would fly 12 daily routes between dallas and houston and dallas and san antonio from the beginning it was clear that kelleher was running a different kind of airline with a whole lot of moxie kelleher rocked the airline establishment with a simple idea that flying should be affordable for all texans herb kelleher through the years the air service at that time in texas was a very poor quality and the prices were very high kelleher told cnbc we wanted to set texans free because they were captive there were monopolies in texas in the air and we were out to destroy them along with cohort colleen barrett kelleher cultivated southwest s reputation as the love airline for it s dedication to customer service but even more important to the team known as herb and colleen was the way they treated their employees employees came first employees first customers second shareholders third if the employees serve the customer well the customer comes back and that makes the shareholders happy kelleher told cnbc it s simple it s not a conflict it s a chain it wasn t long before southwest wasn t so little anymore growing beyond texas and spreading its wings from coast to coast as it did kelleher became one of the world s most admired business leaders for his powerful blend of profits and personality kelleher led southwest airlines until 2008 but even after he stepped down he remained at the heart of the company s culture herb kelleher is arguably the most transformative figure and character in the history of modern aviation he is the epitome of the can do entrepreneurial spirit my heart goes out to his family and all our southwestair friends t boone pickens boonepickens january 4 2019 nearly 50 years after their first flight kelleher in a 2017 interview with cnbc said the airline is probably worth about 20 billion far more than the 500 000 in seed money used to create it in that same interview kelleher shared why despite the company s success he never took a raise i always turned down pay increases bonus increases to set a good example for all of our people kelleher told cnbc of course the stock that i got rose enormously in value but that was in lieu of cash compensation it s what i thought was a requirement of good leadership in june 2011 kelleher was honored by the city of dallas with the renaming of the roadway approaching the terminal at dallas love field as herb kelleher way this very sweet occasion was never anticipated in even my wildest dreams and i ve had some really wild dreams kelleher said when i heard about this belatedly i checked my pulse to make sure i was still alive because i thought that streets were only dedicated to you after you were dead this is really a sublime honor which frankly i cherish and treasure more than any that i have ever received for more than three decades southwest was restricted on where they could fly out of dallas love field by the wright amendment the legislation by u s rep jim wright d fort worth was put in place in 1979 to restrict interstate travel from love field and ensure that the newly created dallas fort worth international airport was profitable southwest airlines celebrated the expiration of the wright amendment on monday which restricted destinations on non stop flights from dallas love field meanwhile virgin america opened its first gate at the airport when the wright amendment expired in october 2014 southwest could add nonstop service to an additional 41 states and washington d c it s nirvana for me kelleher told nbc 5 in 2014 it s heaven because i have been waiting and working to get love field freed up for many decades on thursday southwest airlines released a video of ceo gary kelly talking about the life and legacy of kelleher southwest airlines ceo gary kelly talks about the life and legacy of the airlines founder herb kelleher who died on thursday nbc 5 also talked to dallas mayor mike rawlings about kelleher s impact on the city of dallas and love field dallas mayor mike rawlings talked to nbc 5 on thursday night about the life of southwest airlines founder herb kelleher despite lasting legacies on the city of dallas and the aviation industry his greatest influence was perhaps the way he treated his employees we spoke with kelleher s former senior director of corporate communications ed stewart who called kelleher a genius a mentor and a joy to be around if you treat the employees well they ll treat the customers well that ll make the shareholders happy and everybody wins and guess what he was right said stewart ed stewart worked for southwest airlines as the senior director of communications and says founder herb kelleher was right that if you treat employees well they treat the customers well the airline is now one of the largest in america and its business model has been copied around the world what can never be duplicated is kelleher himself honoring herb
i think this is probably the first major downgrade that we ve seen for fourth quarter earnings although i suspect this isn t the last one he said in an interview in new york the dow jones industrial average was down 660 02 or 2 8 in the second trading day of the year to 22 686 22 the s p 500 index was off 62 14 points at 2 447 89 while the nasdaq composite lost 202 43 points at 6 463 50 with apple falling by 10 canada s main stock index posted a triple digit decline as the s p tsx composite index closed down 134 41 points to 14 212 75 after hitting a low of 14 155 27 it s a bit of a nasty day out there again and until we kind of get a footing around the proper number to use for earnings estimates next year i think we re likely to still see some of this volatility in the market archibald said the weaker outlook for china and weak u s manufacturing numbers released thursday will put pressure on the presidents of the world s two largest economies to make a deal faster to stop some of the economic uncertainty the weakening will also likely slow the federal reserve s interest rate hikes which will weaken the u s dollar i think that s part of the reason why you ve seen canada hold up relatively well in the first couple of days of this year because the commodities complex particularly gold and oil have acted fairly well in the context of a bit of a weaker u s dollar he said the canadian dollar traded at an average of us74 02 compared with an average of us73 50 on wednesday despite losing ground the tsx held up better than u s markets as gold and oil prices increased the february crude contract was up us55 at us 47 09 per barrel and the february natural gas contract was down us1 3 at us 2 94 per mmbtu the february gold contract was up us 10 70 at us 1 294 80 an ounce and the march copper contract was down us5 5 at us 2 57 a pound the canadian information technology sector fell 3 9 while economically sensitive areas such as industrials consumer discretionary and materials fell miner teck resources ltd b shares lost more than 6 on copper dipping below the 2 60 threshold on concerns about china meanwhile utilities and telecommunications were in the black as investors continued to move to defensive sectors energy lost some ground even though the price of west texas intermediate hit its highest level in two weeks that gave a little bounce to mid and small cap energy names like precision drilling corp and yangarra resources ltd which gained nearly 5 archibald said the market is oversold presenting an opportunity for stocks to have a bit of a rally so the bulls are starting to try and back into this market a little bit but with 500 point swings in the dow industrial average on a daily basis it s difficult to put a lot of new money to work with a lot of confidence

politics worries grow about impact of a prolonged government shutdown house majority leader kevin mccarthy r calif speaks to reporters as he returns to the capitol from a meeting with president donald trump about border security and ending the partial government shutdown in washington wednesday jan 2 2019 ap photo j scott applewhite the associated press washington ap with president donald trump warning that it could be a long time before the partial shutdown of the government ends concerns are rising about potential economic damage given that the shutdown is coinciding with other threats most analysts don t regard the shutdown alone as severe enough to imperil an economic expansion that has lasted nearly a decade but should it drag into february the slowdown in government activity could help shake confidence and cause businesses and consumers to stop spending the shutdown is coming on top of lots of other problems the trade war the slump in the stock market brexit trump s political problems said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics by itself the shutdown may not be a big deal but if you add it up and mix it with all this other noxious stuff it could become a real problem advertisement though he still foresees only a minimal impact from the shutdown zandi said that if the trade war isn t settled soon that will be a real problem and if it conflates with a prolonged shutdown that could be fodder for a recession the shutdown has already suspended the government s release of some economic data making it harder to fully assess the state of the economy and the risk is growing that tax refunds could be delayed if furloughed irs workers aren t around to process returns the shutdown which began dec 22 will mark its two week point on friday and trump and democrats in congress remain far apart over trump s demand for funding for a wall along the mexican border economists at macroeconomic advisors have lowered their forecast for economic growth by a scant 0 1 percentage point for both the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 to a solid 2 7 percent annual rate for the october december quarter and a tepid 1 5 percent rate for the january march period analysts had already expected the economy to slow this year as a boost from tax cuts and increased government spending last year begins to wane but the longer the shutdown persists the more it could erode consumer and business confidence compounding troubles for an economy that was already slowing advertisement if the shutdown lasts into february zandi said he would lower his growth forecast for the current quarter from a solid 2 6 percent to just above 2 percent with further downgrades for each week the shutdown lasts beyond that point the trump administration has sounded a more optimistic note about the shutdown s impact while agreeing that the risks will grow the longer that 800 000 federal employees roughly half of them working for now without pay remain furloughed kevin hassett chairman of the president s council of economic advisers told reporters thursday that he doesn t foresee big economic effects from the shutdown assuming it ends relatively soon congress has already signaled that it plans to follow past practice and eventually restore lost pay for all furloughed workers but some of the work that isn t getting done is already having an effect in the financial sector employees at the commerce department who produce a range of economic reports from home sales and durable goods orders to trade deficits and the gross domestic product have been furloughed that means those economic reports aren t coming out making it harder for both private analysts and those at the federal reserve to evaluate the economy as it slows from last year s stellar growth to more modest gains advertisement even when the shutdown eventually ends key economic reports will be further delayed as government statisticians try to process a backlog of data government workers will work overtime to catch up but i worry about the quality of the reports and that means they could be subject to bigger revisions that will make accurate forecasting harder to do said sung won sohn chief economist at ss economics the effect of delayed government economic reports may not be as severe as during the previous prolonged shutdown in october 2013 when not only commerce but also the labor department were shut down this time labor whose funding had already been approved by congress remains open and continues to produce such key reports as the monthly jobs numbers and inflation data still the concern is rising that the delay could last long enough to jeopardize the ability of the internal revenue service to process tax refunds on a timely basis some 52 000 irs staffers about 65 percent of the irs workforce have been furloughed just as the tax filing season is getting underway and this year taxpayers and the irs are facing the most sweeping overhaul of the u s tax code in three decades the new tax law which took effect a year ago provides generous tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest americans and more modest reductions for middle and low income individuals and families to avoid lengthy delays in processing tax returns the irs may recall some employees to work in accordance with its contingency plans but refunds would still likely to be delayed if the shutdown persists because the funding for them wouldn t be available that would hurt retailers that rely on consumers who file their taxes early and spend their refund money in

by howard schneider atlanta reuters fed chair jerome powell s hope for a more plainspoken approach to his job may have landed him in hot water with markets and require more nuance going forward a former top fed official said on thursday in a critique of the current u s central bank as the fed begins a broad review of its operations former fed vice chair donald kohn said in what he called a memo that powell and an array of other fed officers needed to overhaul how they communicate so both investors and the public have a better sense of the central bank s job and policies a plain english approach to describing the fed s management of interest rates and inflation a process that is part science part art and part public psychology can be tricky as we ve seen of late kohn now a senior fellow at the brookings institution said in remarks at a conference on fed policy organized by george mason university s mercatus center chairman powell needs to be careful that plain english doesn t become the enemy of necessary nuance the powell fed s hallmark emphasis on data dependency or setting policy around the flow of economic statistics with less reliance on the guidance of economic models could result in shifting messages and policy volatility he said powell whose offhanded way of speaking in recent appearances left aspects of fed policy uncertain and seemed to contribute to market sell offs last fall will ramp up his public appearances this year by holding press conferences after each of the fed s eight annual policy meetings beginning this month he has also put open question and answer sessions on his calendar including one on friday morning at the american economic association meeting here and emphasized the importance of justifying the fed s actions to the broader public he will speak at a particularly volatile period with president donald trump unhappy with the fed s interest rate hikes global growth slowing and doubts among investors about whether the u s recovery can continue bond markets of late have given troubling signals with the 2 year treasury bond yield on thursday briefly dipping below the fed s short term target policy rate that has traditionally been a sign investors expect the central bank will be forced to cut rates in the near term rather than continue raising them kohn a career fed employee and phd economist was named to the fed s board of governors in 2002 he helped develop policies used to combat a deep financial crisis and recession as vice chair from 2006 to 2010 he hearkened back to some of those strategies in his remarks saying for example that a single appearance on a major network show like cbs 60 minutes used by former chair ben bernanke at a key point in the crisis reached a broader set of people than 100 appearances on cnbc the cable business network where fed officials often appear they should consider doing more of this kohn said he said the fed could also be clearer about how it does business by focusing more on the uncertainty around its deliberations by downplaying policymakers quarterly estimates of future interest rates and deemphasizing the median of those estimates as holding any particular meaning the many public appearances of the fed s 12 regional presidents kohn said show the central bank s face around the country but too often highlight differences in what each of them think rather than focusing on the larger logic behind central bank actions public understanding of the policy process would be helped by concentration on the story behind the federal open market committee s policy choices and expectations rather than on for example the precise number of rate increases an individual policymaker expects next year a staple element of some reserve bank officials speeches kohn said

washington ap with president donald trump warning that it could be a long time before the partial shutdown of the government ends concerns are rising about potential economic damage given that the shutdown is coinciding with other threats most analysts don t regard the shutdown alone as severe enough to imperil an economic expansion that has lasted nearly a decade but should it drag into february the slowdown in government activity could help shake confidence and cause businesses and consumers to stop spending the shutdown is coming on top of lots of other problems the trade war the slump in the stock market brexit trump s political problems said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics by itself the shutdown may not be a big deal but if you add it up and mix it with all this other noxious stuff it could become a real problem though he still foresees only a minimal impact from the shutdown zandi said that if the trade war isn t settled soon that will be a real problem and if it conflates with a prolonged shutdown that could be fodder for a recession the shutdown has already suspended the government s release of some economic data making it harder to fully assess the state of the economy and the risk is growing that tax refunds could be delayed if furloughed irs workers aren t around to process returns the shutdown which began dec 22 will mark its two week point on friday and trump and democrats in congress remain far apart over trump s demand for funding for a wall along the mexican border economists at macroeconomic advisors have lowered their forecast for economic growth by a scant 0 1 percentage point for both the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 to a solid 2 7 percent annual rate for the october december quarter and a tepid 1 5 percent rate for the january march period analysts had already expected the economy to slow this year as a boost from tax cuts and increased government spending last year begins to wane but the longer the shutdown persists the more it could erode consumer and business confidence compounding troubles for an economy that was already slowing if the shutdown lasts into february zandi said he would lower his growth forecast for the current quarter from a solid 2 6 percent to just above 2 percent with further downgrades for each week the shutdown lasts beyond that point the trump administration has sounded a more optimistic note about the shutdown s impact while agreeing that the risks will grow the longer that 800 000 federal employees roughly half of them working for now without pay remain furloughed kevin hassett chairman of the president s council of economic advisers told reporters thursday that he doesn t foresee big economic effects from the shutdown assuming it ends relatively soon congress has already signaled that it plans to follow past practice and eventually restore lost pay for all furloughed workers but some of the work that isn t getting done is already having an effect in the financial sector employees at the commerce department who produce a range of economic reports from home sales and durable goods orders to trade deficits and the gross domestic product have been furloughed that means those economic reports aren t coming out making it harder for both private analysts and those at the federal reserve to evaluate the economy as it slows from last year s stellar growth to more modest gains even when the shutdown eventually ends key economic reports will be further delayed as government statisticians try to process a backlog of data government workers will work overtime to catch up but i worry about the quality of the reports and that means they could be subject to bigger revisions that will make accurate forecasting harder to do said sung won sohn chief economist at ss economics the effect of delayed government economic reports may not be as severe as during the previous prolonged shutdown in october 2013 when not only commerce but also the labor department were shut down this time labor whose funding had already been approved by congress remains open and continues to produce such key reports as the monthly jobs numbers and inflation data still the concern is rising that the delay could last long enough to jeopardize the ability of the internal revenue service to process tax refunds on a timely basis some 52 000 irs staffers about 65 percent of the irs workforce have been furloughed just as the tax filing season is getting underway and this year taxpayers and the irs are facing the most sweeping overhaul of the u s tax code in three decades the new tax law which took effect a year ago provides generous tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest americans and more modest reductions for middle and low income individuals and families to avoid lengthy delays in processing tax returns the irs may recall some employees to work in accordance with its contingency plans but refunds would still likely to be delayed if the shutdown persists because the funding for them wouldn t be available that would hurt retailers that rely on consumers who file their taxes early and spend their refund money in february or march and any such pullback in spending would weigh on the overall economy ___ ap business writer marcy gordon contributed to this report

government shutdown affecting several dairy industry reports published friday january 4 2019 the following is from lee mielke author of a dairy market column known as mielke market weekly welcome to 2019 as of midnight dec 21 a partial shutdown of the government went into effect due to the failure of a house passed continuing resolution in the senate at issue is president trump s insistence of funding a border wall with mexico the agriculture department announced a contingency plan for its services it will continue to publish its weekly national dairy products sales report but will not produce the monthly nass milk production cold storage or dairy products reports monthly milk price announcements will also continue the first casualty on the dairy side was the dec 27 ag prices report which would have included the latest milk feed price ratio by the way the last time a shutdown impacted dairy programs was october 2013 as i reported last week the november cold storage report indicated positive news for the butter market as we saw the biggest drawdown ever for that month fc stone says the butter inventory was 16 million pounds below their expectation and reaffirms the strength the butter market has witnessed throughout november but fc stone adds the caveat that either commercial disappearance hit a record high or production slowed down to a crawl for stocks to be drawn down as much as the report showed without knowing if it was supply or demand driven it is hard to classify this report as bullish or bearish seasonally speaking demand should cool and production should increase so moving forward prices should experience sell side pressure however for now the market seems supportive total cheese inventories were marginally lower than anticipated according to fc stone both american and other cheese stocks were also under forecasts by 1 2 million pounds however these lagging monthly reports often convey little in the way of market moving data when the figures are inline with expectations we will say that this report can be construed as neutral to slightly bullish for cheese there have been a lot of media reports of the heavy stocks of cheese in the u s and volumes are the highest they have been in 15 to 20 years but is the situation as bad as it sounds the answer gets a bit complicated because it s hard to compare the present to the past due to the olden days when uncle sam s price support program was purchasing cheese and storing it analyst jerry dryer also points out that the cheese market has grown and there is a lot more cheese in aging programs today such as sharp cheddar plus other varieties that used to be imported but are now being produced here the dec 27 daily dairy report says that while u s milk production so far is up 1 percent from 2017 cheese output through october exceeded 2017 s record breaking volume by 2 5 percent the ddr adds that even as milk production has topped year ago volumes by ever narrowing margins the rate of growth in u s cheese output has not slowed compared to the same month in 2017 u s cheese production is up 3 percent in july 3 1 percent in august 2 9 percent in september and 3 percent in october another factor the ddr points out is while convincingly higher class iv prices would argue that milk should be directed to butter and powder rather than cheese and whey most processors don t have either the flexibility or the incentive to move milk that way the bottom line is that the u s is producing more than it s consuming and until exports resume milk prices are going to suffer speaking of hurting prices and exports the latest margin watch mw from chicago based commodity and ingredient hedging llc reports that dairy margins were weaker in the nearby quarters while deferred periods held steady over the past two weeks it adds feed prices continued higher as nearby milk prices were lower deferred milk stayed steady on hopes of expanding dairy product exports as a client perhaps comes back into the fold thawing u s china relations saw tangible evidence as china modestly re entered the u s soybean market and the u s formally postponed increasing existing tariffs until march 1 while negotiations are ongoing optimism is high for china to expand its presence in the u s market with an array of agricultural product purchases including the dairy space the mw said u s dairy and product exports for october were encouraging at 413 9 million pounds an increase of 5 5 percent from september and were higher by 7 percent over last year despite the current global trade environment butter and nonfat dry milk also revealed monthly and yearly gains while cheese exports were greater on the month by 9 6 percent but down 2 percent from 2017 november milk totaled 17 4 billion pounds an increase of 6 percent from 2017 production was greater in spite of having 38 000 fewer milk cows than last year production per cow was 19 pounds greater compensating for the reduction in animals and was estimated to be 1 856 pounds per cow the mw concluded optimism for 2019 fc stone s dave kurzawski stated in the dec 31 dairy radio now broadcast that he s happy to put 2018 to bed and hopes 2019 to be a better year he believes the biggest long term risk we currently face is the ongoing trade talks with china leaders are expected to meet again the week of jan 7 if the trade talks go south kurzawski sees escalating tariffs ahead but if they are productive that will shape perceptions by fund managers and market participants in all commodities including dairy for what kind of price movements we can face in 2019 he expects better demand to resume as it was in the early part of 2018 when it was better than expected but then came the tariff wars the economy is strong kurzawski said although we re currently in a corrective mode in the stock market but overall the underlying fundamentals are there and to some degree inflationary but is somewhat supportive of dairy prices and producers out there can certainly use some better prices and some better margins as we enter 2019 he warned that we posted a lot of production particularly on cheese and our biggest trading partner on that front mexico slowed purchases in the second part of this year but kurzawski is encouraged by the drawdown we have seen on nonfat dry milk powder the past six to eight months he believes the market is starting to pay attention to that as the powder market and class iv market in general has been getting some lift because we re moving through inventory and we might start seeing it on cheese in the first half of 2019 meanwhile penn state s monthly dairy outlook reported that projected feed costs remain a mixed message nationally the price of corn alfalfa hay and soybean meal declined in the second half of 2018 pennsylvania has seen a similar decline in soybean meal and for the most part corn grain alfalfa hay average prices for pennsylvania markets increased in august september and october primarily due to inventory issues driven by weather adversity the outlook warned these localized issues will probably continue into the first half of 2019 overall feed costs in 2019 will likely be static but have the potential to increase driving milk margins even tighter due to the persistent precipitation through the second half of 2018 forage nutrient content and quality issues mold growth abnormal fermentation are concerns on many of pennsylvania s dairy farms cheese moves higher cme cheddar block cheese closed the last friday of 2018 at 1 43 per pound up 4 cents on the christmas holiday shortened week but 11 cents below a year ago as traders anticipated the first global dairy trade auction of 2019 on jan 2 the barrels finished last friday at 1 29 per pound down a half cent on the week 15¼ cents below a year ago and 14 cents below the blocks five cars of block traded hands on the week at the cme and 18 of barrel cheese production was somewhat busy during the holiday week reports dairy market news plant managers reported that holiday priced milk was flowing in from flat to 4 under class cheese demand has met expectations in general within the midwest some plants report current stocks are minimal while others relay shifting production away from slower selling varieties some midwestern contacts are concerned about the number of dairy farms closing after feed rations dry up particularly the more remote and or rural cheese operations with milk supplies coming from smaller nearby dairy farms cheese markets have regained some of the momentum they lost during the fall but current market tones are less than bullish as stocks outweigh demand nationally dmn warned cash butter closed last friday at 2 2175 per pound up 1¼ cents on the week and a penny above a year ago with just 1 carload finding a new home on the week cream supplies destined for the churns were expectedly easier to locate during the holiday week and butter makers report cream is nearing plant capacity some churners report being booked up early into 2019 and are hopeful that cream availability will remain similar into the first quarter of next year sales reports have remained positive and they are currently producing to get ahead of spring holiday demand butter markets remain solid going into 2019 and contacts expect a similar pattern which butter maintained throughout 2018 if only slightly lower on the average with increasing export competition grade a nonfat dry milk ended christmas week a quarter cent lower but 26 cents above a year ago only three cars were sold

apple s woes apple stock fell nearly 10 percent thursday a day after ceo tim cook announced the company is now projecting first quarter revenue of 84 billion after initially predicting between 89 billion and 93 billion cook blamed apple s shortfall on the mounting costs of president trump s tariffs on steel aluminum and chinese imports along with trouble in emerging market economies his warning was the latest red flag to indicate a potential global economic slowdown i ve got more on the downturn here reactions it s not going to be just apple there are a heck of a lot of u s companies that have sales in china that are going to be watching their earnings being downgraded next year until we get a deal with china kevin hassett chairman of the white house council of economic advisers there are a heck of a lot of u s companies that have sales in china that are going to be watching their earnings being downgraded next year until we get a deal with china kevin hassett chairman of the white house council of economic advisers at some point this had to be done president trump about his tough trade actions on china leading the day gop senator calls on congress to end shutdown without border deal sen cory gardner r colo who faces a potentially tough reelection in 2020 says congress should fund the federal government even without a deal to finance president trump s border wall gardner is the first senate republican to call for ending the partial shutdown without granting trump s demand for 5 billion to fund a border wall i think we should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open the senate has done it last congress we should do it again today he said gardner says then democrats will face pressure to explain why they don t support more money for border security after they voted to spend an additional 46 billion on the border in 2013 the hill s alexander bolton tells us more here the background all but five democrats on the senate appropriations committee last year supported a homeland security funding bill that allocated 1 6 billion for border fencing democratic leaders have scaled back that offer to 1 3 billion the same amount congress appropriated for fiscal 2018 for border fencing we can pass legislation that has the appropriations number in it while we continue to get more but we should continue to do our jobs and get the government open gardner said then let democrats explain why they no longer support border security but senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky says he will not schedule a vote on a clean stopgap funding measure to re open federal agencies without prior sign off from the president trump made a surprise appearance at the white house briefing room on thursday after democrats elected nancy pelosi to her second speakership you can call it a barrier you can call it whatever you want but essentially we need protection in our country we re going to make it good the people of our country want it he said about his demand for a border wall the road ahead senate appropriations committee chairman richard shelby r ala warned reporters on thursday that the partial government shutdown could last for the long haul and separately told reporters that the shutdown could last for months and months congressional leadership met with trump on wednesday at the white house for a briefing on the border but made no progress toward an agreement they are expected to meet again on friday house democrats later tonight are expected to vote on a package to reopen the government one measure would fund the department of homeland security through feb 8 while another would fund other agencies through the end of fiscal 2019 but mcconnell has said that plan is a total non starter trump s growing anger with fed chief poses market risks president trump would likely find himself in murky legal waters if he attempts to dismiss federal reserve chairman jerome powell but experts say the bigger concern is that any move on that front would ignite a chain of calamities that could derail the global economy and financial markets mossecondads trump has frequently criticized powell and the fed for raising interest rates and the president has reportedly polled advisers on whether to fire his hand picked chairman while it s uncertain whether trump could remove powell making a drastic move against the central bank s chief policymaker could unleash economic chaos at a time when the president prepares to seek reelection if he were to actually be stupid enough to do it it would trigger a massive reaction from financial markets that would be catastrophic to his entire presidency said daniel alpert managing partner at investment firm westwood capital there will be all sorts of hell to pay i explain why here the details an attempt to fire powell would be an unprecedented test of the fed s independence and the laws meant to protect the central bank from politics in washington the move could also trigger a staggering stock market meltdown spark intense congressional backlash and damage the country s role as the world s largest economy the fed is considered critical to the stability of the u s economy and its policies have profound influence over foreign counterparts analysts say if trump threatens the fed s independence it could throw the global financial system into chaos without clear guidance from the fed global markets could be roiled by uncertainty and fears of growing instability triggered by internal turmoil at the central bank trump s influence would also raise questions about the fed s loyalty to its dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment good to know senate finance committee ranking member ron wyden d ore on thursday reintroduced a bill that would require president trump to publicly release his tax returns the government shutdown will cut u s economic output by about 0 1 percent every two weeks according to the white house council of economic advisers president trump on thursday called democrats opposition to his proposed border wall strictly political and accused the party of seeking an advantage in the 2020 presidential election as a partial government shutdown entered its 13th day a top u s bank regulator told reuters on thursday she had no concerns that stock market volatility will threaten the u s banking system which she said has adequate capital to weather wall street s woes odds and ends

celebrated for doing so that s the way we like it we are slamdance here find featurettes about slamdance 19 films go to slamdance com for more info and slugmag com for more fest coverage i d take the bus and cross the city to see my favorite band play in whatever dump and i d arrive alone but was never alone because they were family boni bonita edges in with these imploring words uttered over roving garage rock you re my family today it s autumn 2007 at a crowded concert in brazil and beatriz ailín salas stands awed by the unseen rockers face lit up only by stage lights amid her mother s death and a strained relationship with her father the 16 year old has made her way from argentina to brazil there she begins a relationship with the 30 something rogério caco ciocler a musician trapped at a standstill beneath his grandfather s musical legacy the pair spend their days at rogério s family beach house rogério is constantly drinking guitar in hand and often shirtless beatriz is constantly smoking and often unsmiling her stomach is usually covered hiding scatters of self inflicted scars seasons and years unravel the two are tender then destructive they fight then make up rogério remains at a dead stop beatriz doesn t behind their toxicity persists the empyrean jurumirim reservoir its gleaming waters verdant lands and cloud roaring skies over four laconic chapters writer director daniel barosa s boni bonita is an uncluttered chronicle of loss loss of self and family dreams and direction youth and innocence and it remains a coming of age story i didn t have a story or a catch says barosa i only had in my head beatriz and this decadent rocker brought to life by salas and ciocler s excellent performances beatriz and rogério go on to become archetypes or artifacts of two respective generations languor frustration and drift i idolized it all says barosa of his own experience in são paulo s indie scene but as i grew older things changed i saw that everyone was as lost as i was boni bonita was shot over three years and magnificently across three formats super 16 16 mm and digital when writing this film i always pictured it with a nostalgic look says barosa so he and directors of photography andré dip and caio pedron decided to use different stocks formats and lenses to accentuate the passage of time the result is beautiful as much a sensuous visual gradient as it is the passing of days and years the cycles and chapters through which we grow up kathy rong zhou read the full q a with director daniel barosa below for more information about boni bonita and the 2019 slamdance film festival visit showcase slamdance com slug boni bonita was shot over three years across s16 16 mm and digital the film footage is stunning i d love to learn more about your decision to shoot across these three formats and your commitment to the power of shooting on film what notable pre or post production challenges and triumphs did you encounter daniel barosa when writing this film i always pictured it with a nostalgic look i m a film stock buff so while discussing possible looks with caio pedron and andré dip boni s directors of photography we were sure we wanted to shoot on film kodak also gave us incredible support which motivated us even more we decided to use different stocks formats and lenses to accentuate the passage of time in the story we shot with old zeiss lenses on part 1 more modern cooke lenses on part 2 and then migrated to digital on parts 3 and 4 we tried to make the transition as organic as possible though andré dip chose to work with pro mist filters and vintage lenses including an old lomo lens he had during the digital phase it all gave the film a sort of gradient look we go from old film stock to a strange digital but it s all very smooth and not meant to seem like a sudden change that draws too much attention the pre production of course involved a lot of tests we had to find the right camera it s not that easy to get good working 16mm cameras in brazil nowadays and were lucky to find a rental place called hagadê which used to represent aaton in brazil it still has some cameras that are working great and hagadê s owner helped us in the whole process kodak s support was also key they indicated some good labs for us in latin america and helped with extra film stock some material we developed in an independent lab from an argentinean film school universidad del cine to get that dirty old stock look while other materials we developed in brazil and in mexico to get a cleaner look it all depended on which period of the film it was and the look we wanted to give so all in all it was a lot of work to get all these schematics working but it was totally worth it the film looks beautiful and different a lot of people talk about it i m sure film stock will make a comeback it s still used frequently in the usa right and soon it ll be easier to shoot film again in brazil slug you note in your director s statement that you drew on your own experiences in são paulo s early 2000s indie scene what more can you tell us about the foundation for the script what urged you to create and follow beatriz and rogério s stories barosa ailín and caco were a godsend this film wouldn t be what it is without them and i m lucky to have worked with these two talented and acclaimed actors because the script started with the creation of the characters i didn t have a story or a catch i only had in my head beatriz and this decadent rocker who eventually became rogério when i was in high school in 2001 nikolas maciel boni s executive producer and i were very into punk rock hardcore and indie music i d go to all the dive bars where local bands would play in these small improvised stages with horrible acoustics heck i even started playing in a band while i was barely 16 so a lot of beatriz and how she sees rogério s world and music came from personal experience writing boni bonita at first i didn t realize it but slowly it hit me i m actually projecting a lot of myself in beatriz i d go out to these places were everyone was older and seemed so wise confident and sure of where they would be in 10 years i idolized it all but as i grew older things changed i saw that a lot of it were false idealisms and that everyone was as lost as i was the script also had amazing help from fellow director barbara sarasola day who worked as a script doctor in the film and helped broaden beatriz s character she also helped a lot with rogério he was a tough character to work with because he is so dislikable but so sad at the same time in the end i think the story has its significance by showing a toxic relationship between men and women that a couple of years ago people wouldn t even a second thought thankfully nowadays it s different i believe the film follows this same logic in its progression of time slug lastly what artists or works did you look to in the making of this film if any and can you tell us about the decision to have apeles provide the original soundtrack that anchors bona bonita barosa the influences are many and all very different from one another i threw it all in the blender and i guess something came out rohmer and cassavetes have always been a huge influence for me and i feel their cinematography is very palpable in boni bonita there were a lot of bands some i m familiar and some introduced to me by eduardo praça from apeles that were essential to create the film s mood chaotic brazilian bands such as ludovic and vzyadoq moe for example ney matogrosso and his music was also a huge influence and when we got a chance to have him do a cameo we just couldn t believe it i also got a lot from greek mythology when writing the characters especially persephone s myth and a friend after reading a first draft from boni bonita recommended to me jennifer egan s work and i fell in love with her writing it shed a new light to the film which is always welcome when you re developing the same project during three years as for apeles eduardo praça i ve worked with him in almost all my shorts we re childhood friends and always shared similar ideas inspirations and influences so it was incredible to have him do the original soundtrack we talked about how the music would sound and what type of music rogério since the very beginning when i only had a treatment for the film we discussed that the music in boni bonita would be sort of intermission pieces but that would also help explain the characters through melodies we re very happy with the results the music shows rogério s sadness it reinforces beatriz s anxieties this interview has been condensed and edited
the shuttering of the securities and exchange commission during a prolonged government shutdown could ripple throughout the markets including slowing some highly anticipated stock offerings by companies such as uber and lyft securities experts say the agency provides day to day guidance to companies weighing what to disclose to shareholders and must sign off on most initial public stock offerings or ipos without this advice companies may have to delay mergers public offerings or even annual meetings experts note asking the sec to shut down is a bit like asking someone to hold her breath you can do it for a while without disastrous consequences but at some point you turn blue and the effects become quite serious said joseph grundfest a professor at stanford law school and a former sec commissioner the nearly two week old shutdown comes as wall street is expecting big companies including uber lyft airbnb and pinterest to conduct ipos this year pushing the amount raised in public markets into record territory said kathleen smith of renaissance capital but in order to stage those public offerings the companies need the sec to sign off first if the federal government shutdown is prolonged it could slow down the process of getting ipos out the door said smith a manager of ipo etfs an exchange traded fund that tracks ipos of various companies it is critical want to get reaction from the sec on their documents an extended shutdown of this part of the wall street would eventually turn into a drag on the economy said james angel a georgetown university finance professor the capital markets are the lifeblood of the economy corporations need to be able to raise money to invest he said even without the partial government shutdown wall street has seen volatile swings in the past year with markets posting the worst yearly decline since 2008 the dow jones industrial average an index of 30 well known companies fell another 2 percent thursday after apple surprised the markets by lowering its quarterly estimates for the first time in 15 years large parts of the government including the sec have been shuttered since dec 22 amid president trump s demands for more than 5 billion to build a new wall along the u s mexico border with no obvious path to a compromise congressional leaders have said the shutdown could be lengthy it could go on for months and months said sen richard shelby r ala chairman of the appropriations committee the effects of the showdown are already being felt throughout the country hundreds of thousands of federal government employees have been furloughed and major components of the u s immigration system are offline due to the shutdown it has also left many national parks without most of the rangers and others who staff campgrounds and keep the parks running the sec of course has endured shutdowns before lynn turner a former chief account for the sec served during a brief shutdown in 1990 but says this time is different we were told not to go in for work but people were not as concerned about it then said turner a senior adviser at accounting firm hemming morse but i don t think there was the level of uncertainty you have today but for now the existing crew of a few hundred workers will not continue work on ongoing investigations or start news ones at the top of the agency s website it tells visits that sec has staff available to respond to emergency situations involving market integrity and investor protection including law enforcement if the shutdown remains brief the impact on investigations is likely to be minor securities experts say noting that sec cases tend to take months or years to complete still even a brief halt t offers companies targeted by the sec some breathing room they say it may also make it harder to pursue some cases that are already close to their statutes of limitations clearly not having the cops on the beat is going to make it easier for the bad guys said angel of georgetown losing hundreds of human years of investigative capacity is going to make it harder to bring cases also pressing securities experts say is the absence of the day to day guidance the sec offers to companies on matters both complex and mundane january begins a busy season in which corporate executives are preparing major reports for shareholders including an annual report and a proxy statement while compiling those documents executives often ask sec for help interpreting complex rules securities experts say the sec s phone rings countless times a day for exactly that type of guidance said james cox professor at duke university school of law the shutdown has also left some companies in limbo awaiting key decisions johnson johnson for example has asked the agency to weigh in on whether it must allow its shareholders to vote on certain issues the dispute is being closed watched throughout corporate c suites and by investors said turner the former sec chief accountant but there is no one at the sec to give them that answer he said until j j can get that answer from the sec they can t move forward sec an american flag flies outside the headquarters building of the u

the health of the chinese economy is becoming a big worry for some international firms buffeted by the ongoing trade war between beijing and washington not to mention an already anticipated slowdown in domestic growth engines the world s second largest economy has drawn negative commentary out of sectors ranging from consumer technology to autos on wednesday apple ceo tim cook cut his company s revenue forecast laying some of the blame on falling sales in china and the trade war that has levied high tariffs over the last several months across hundreds of different products and commodities sold between the world s two largest economies stocks in asia traded mostly lower on thursday and u s futures pointed to another volatile session for wall street following cook s comments china sales growth slows as the trade war tariffs continue to take their toll despite an agreement between president donald trump and his chinese counterpart president xi jinping not to apply any new levies during a 90 day negotiation period there are plenty of signs that china s growth is slowing the chinese academy of social sciences a government led think tank recently cut its growth estimate for china s economy from 6 5 percent this year to 6 3 percent while that seems like a small difference it signifies a big drop in consumer spending when spread out over the country s 1 4 billion people we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration particularly in greater china cook said in a letter to shareholders wednesday although apple has faced significant pressures in china since before the trade war kicked off cook told cnbc it s clear that the economy began to slow there for the second half and what i believe to be the case is the trade tensions between the united states and china put additional pressure on their economy it s a big market intel chief financial officer and interim chief executive officer bob swan said on an earnings call in october that china is a big market for us adding that the company was working with customers and suppliers to adapt to any new tariffs it s going to be a wait and see as we go into 2019 he said hp ceo dion weisler told investors in november that china was a very strategically important market for us we obviously continue to assess the situation and the potential impact on our business and our plans that we may or may not need to make as a result but again we re not chasing ghosts but we re also not sticking our heads in the sand either he said of the trade war the tariffs have already cost u s automakers especially ford whose ceo jim hackett complained earlier this year that the tax penalties on steel and aluminum were costing it 1 billion last year alone that pain has been exacerbated by a slowdown in car sales in china in recent months auto sales there fell 14 percent in november over the same month in 2017 according to the chinese association of automobile manufacturers ford s sales in china fell more than 30 percent during the first 11 months last year compared with the same time frame in 2017 in november ford s china sales fell more than 50 percent over the same month in the prior year this is the first sustained downturn in memory said michael dunne ceo of zozogo a firm that advises automakers on doing business in china we would have to go back to the asian financial crisis in 1998 1999 to see the last time china had flat or down sales for four months or more in a row tesla meanwhile is speeding up construction of a factory outside of shanghai and has cut prices on some of its models in china to try to offset the trade war s impact on sales there the company said it was operating at a 55 to 60 percent cost disadvantage to local manufacturers in the country wells fargo analyst ike boruchow told investors wednesday there are high levels of uncertainty around potential new tariffs in 2019 raising fears that the rhetoric between the two governments will lead to a backlash against american brands that operate in china this has already played out between china and canada chinese consumers were reportedly boycotting the canada goose brand due to the recent tension between the two countries chinese tourists retailers are getting hit particularly hard on china related news even if the impact hasn t quite hit their bottom line tiffany s shares fell 9 6 percent on nov 28 after the jeweler released disappointing third quarter sales that were hurt by weaker spending from chinese tourists in the u s and hong kong the luxury jeweler s earnings were in line with estimates but revenue of 1 01 billion was shy of the 1 05 billion estimate from analysts surveyed by refinitiv target said in september that it was deeply troubled by the trump administration s escalating trade war saying it threatens to undermine the u s economy penalizes american families and raises prices on everything from backpacks to playpens the trade war hasn t impacted all u s companies equally lululemon and nike have cited china as a bright spot in recent earnings reports nike sales there grew by 31 percent during the company s fiscal second quarter that ended nov 30 now while there has been uncertainty of late regarding us china relations we have not seen any impact on our business chief financial officer andy campion told analysts on a conference call last month nike continues to win with the consumer in china lululemon starbucks and other retailers have fared better by partnering with local companies in china china is also the world s fastest growing aviation market and a slowdown would hurt aircraft manufacturers and carriers although it hasn t affected them so far the international air transport association an industry group representing commercial airlines around the globe has said it expects china to overtake the u s as the largest aviation market in the world by 2022 so far the industry mood has been upbeat in september boeing the world s largest commercial aircraft manufacturer raised its estimate for the number of planes china will need through 2037 by 6 percent to nearly 7 700 planes worth some 1 2 trillion luxury products luxury retail and product companies meantime are at risk of losing a valuable set of customers should chinese sales slow chinese shoppers are expected to account for 45 percent of the luxury market by 2025 according to a recent study by consulting firm bain so far the effect has been slight sales of estee lauder s premium cosmetics in china slowed to 4 4 percent in november down from 7 8 percent in july according to analysts at jefferies executives at luxury goods maker lvmh told analysts in october it is seeing only a modest decline in demand from its chinese shoppers still fear of losing chinese luxury

beijing ap apple s 1 000 iphone is a tough sell to consumers in china unnerved by an economic slump and the trade war with the u s ceo tim cook said in a letter to shareholders wednesday that demand for iphones is waning and revenue for the last quarter of 2018 will fall well below projections a decrease he traced mainly to china the iphone is apple s biggest product accounting for about 60 percent of its revenue in the july september quarter the latest reported its stock fell 9 percent in afternoon trading thursday wiping out about 67 billion in market value apple is the latest company grappling with increasing chinese consumer anxiety other brand names such as ford motor co and jeweler tiffany co already have reported abrupt declines in sales to chinese buyers china still is one of the fastest growing economies with 2018 s expansion forecast at about 6 5 percent but china s tariff fight with the u s and an avalanche of bad news about tumbling auto and real estate sales are undermining consumer confidence after two decades of almost unbroken rapid growth it s definitely worrying said china specialist david dollar senior fellow at the brookings institution overall consumption growth is slowing down in china the apple news shows how vulnerable many big u s companies are to a slowdown in china especially as the world s two biggest economies seek to settle a contentious trade dispute it s not going to be just apple kevin hassett chairman of the white council of economic advisers told cnn thursday he said many companies have a lot of sales in china and will be watching their earnings downgraded next year until we get a deal with china and i think that puts a lot of pressure on china to make a deal emily li a 37 year old advertising designer in beijing said she is putting off replacing her car or making other major purchases people are worried about losing jobs she said weakness in chinese demand is especially painful for apple and other smartphone makers china accounts for one third of the industry s global handset shipments shipments in china fell 10 percent from a year earlier to 103 million handsets in the quarter ending in september according to research firm idc it expects last year s total chinese purchases to shrink by 8 percent to 9 percent compared with 2016 the belt tightening in the world s second largest economy is bedeviling global industries including autos and designer clothing that count on china to drive sales growth the trade war with washington has shaken a sense of china s invincibility said mark natkin managing director of marbridge consulting a research firm in beijing chinese are waking up to the fact that their economy is vulnerable to the uncertainties of the global economy he said the slump is a setback for the ruling communist party s efforts to nurture self sustaining consumer driven economic growth and wean china from its reliance on exports and investment china s third quarter economic growth of 6 5 percent was stronger than most other major economies but the country s lowest since the 2008 global crisis the deceleration partly reflects a deliberate government campaign to rein in china s high debt levels at the same time beijing has sought to relieve the economic pain with higher government spending they re trying to aim at a very fine target said dollar a former world bank and u s treasury department official they want to see the economy slow down but they don t want to see it slow down too much china reported this week that factory activity shrank in december for the first time in more than two years and auto sales in the biggest global market are on track for their first annual decline in three decades after plunging 16 percent in november soft real estate sales have forced developers to cut prices overall export growth decelerated to 5 4 percent over a year earlier less than half october s 12 6 percent rate sales to the u s market have held up despite

a lot of u s companies that have sales in china that are going to be watching their earnings being downgraded next year until we get a deal with china china s weakening economy gives trump the upper

when the reporting season begins later this month apple s warning comes on the heels of two key reports in recent days from china indicating its manufacturing sector is slowing investors said the slowing chinese economy puts even more pressure on china and president trump to seal a deal with china and end the tariffs on chinese goods before the downturn infects the united states the data puts

the united states to china represent only 7 8 percent of total u s exports yardeni said yardeni said the chinese economy is suffering from insufficient domestic demand which makes its 500 billion in exports to the united states critical to china s economic health the chinese can t really afford to have any weakness in their exports given the weakness in their domestic economy and demand yardeni said people are living longer and not having enough kids to support them with domestic growth china is rapidly emerging as the world s largest nursing home some worry that the u s president may take the wrong route i think president trump is going to say now i ve got them where i want them stovall said i worry that he will not give them an opportunity to save face the news from apple unleashed a shock wave just a few months ago the tech giant was the first u s company to cross 1 trillion in market capitalization it peaked in august at 1 1 trillion as tech stocks suffered a brutal turn toward the end of last year apple has fallen out of the top three most valuable u s companies it was surpassed by in the last quarter of 2018 by microsoft as the most valuable company with a market capitalization of 780 billion yardeni expects brighter days ahead my hunch is that the biggest problem for apple is that everyone has a smartphone the market is saturated he said that will all change once 5g replaces 4g stimulating a huge upgrade wave starting later this year into 2020 some money managers said investors and computer are reacting to every wisp of news as the 10 year bull market

delta s earnings warning freaks out many airline investors what happened shares of delta air lines dal 0 21 declined 10 in early trading today before recovering slightly to an 8 4 loss as of 2 45 p m est on thursday curiously shares of southwest airlines luv 0 75 followed suit falling 5 4 before paring that back to a 2 4 loss most curious of all was the fact that american airlines aal 0 70 shares dropped 11 3 at first before clawing back to a 7 1 loss why was this curious because of the three stocks named only delta issued an earnings warning today so what this morning in an 8 k filing with the securities and exchange commission delta warned investors that it expects total revenue per available seat mile trasm for the fourth quarter of 2018 to come in only about 3 higher than in q4 a year ago that s after having predicted just one month ago that trasm would grow 3 5 delta noted that it still expects adjusted earnings to come in between 1 25 and 1 30 per share at the high end of previous projections with pre tax profit margins up significantly from last year s 9 8 at 10 to 11 in this year s q4 that sounds like good news but investors are accenting the negative development in sales growth and focusing on delta s warning that its pace of improvement in revenue growth in late december was more modest than anticipated because so many air travelers are agnostic about the airline they choose basing their decision more on fare price weak ticket price trends at delta could spill over and affect other airlines hence the sliding share prices at southwest and american neither of which has yet to issue an earnings warning of their own now what one imagines it s that yet that has investors feeling nervous today delta has dropped one shoe but investors in southwest and american aren t waiting around to see which shoe drops next instead they re following the stampede out of airline stocks is making discretion the better part of valor the right call perhaps fear may be the correct response to what s happening at delta today but i have to say that with delta stock selling for just 9 times earnings today and southwest even cheaper at 7 3 times earnings despite not having echoed delta s earnings warning yet investors might want to heed warren buffett and be greedy because others are fearful check out the latest delta air lines southwest airlines and american airlines earnings call transcripts
toronto the financial health of canadian defined benefit pension plans was eroded in the fourth quarter by a combination of weak stock markets and low long term interest rates two pension advisory firms said thursday in separate reports toronto the financial health of canadian defined benefit pension plans was eroded in the fourth quarter by a combination of weak stock markets and low long term interest rates two pension advisory firms said thursday in separate reports mercer canada and aon each concluded that fewer than half of the country s defined benefit pension plans were fully funded at the turn of the new year and warned that the current outlook for 2019 is murky at best they also noted that defined benefit plans only one of the ways that employers can provide for the post retirement financial needs of their employees were generally in good shape before the fourth quarter began in october the report was issued shortly before north american stock markets closed lower thursday continuing a bumpy downward ride that investors experienced through the fourth quarter we don t expect the volatility to end in 2019 but pension plans financial positions remain strong after the longest bull run in history said calum mackenzie aon s head of investment for canada he said plans were hit by a double whammy of reduced stock prices and lower canadian long term bond yields lower bond yields affect defined benefit plans but increasing how much they ll need to earn from investments in stocks real estate or other classes of investments both firms noted that some of the fourth quarter pain was offset by a decline in the value of canada s dollar which had a positive impact on investments denominated in the u s dollar canadian pension plans took a significant hit in the fourth quarter but thankfully they were starting from a very strong position said manuel monteiro who leads mercer canada s financial strategy group the mercer pension health index based on a hypothetical model plan dropped to a solvency ratio of 102 per cent at dec 31 from 112 per cent at sept 28 and from 106 per cent at the beginning of 2018 meanwhile the aon median solvency ratio fell in the fourth quarter to 95 3 per cent as of jan 1 2019 a decline of nearly eight percentage points from the third quarter of 2018 a solvency ratio of 100 or more indicates a plan is fully funded while anything less indicates there would be some shortfall if a plan had to be wound up often a worst case scenario for defined benefit plans defined benefit plans are supposed to deliver a predictable retirement income for its members supported by either the plan s own investments or by a combination of investments and additional employer payments mercer canada estimated that less than 30 per cent of canadian defined pension plans were fully funded at the end of 2018 while aon estimated 38 5 per cent of plans were fully funded as of jan 1 2019 both firms said that the impact on plan sponsors should be minimal because pension assets had been in surplus until the last part of 2018 mercer also noted that defined benefit plans within ontario and quebec jurisdictions will be helped by new provincial legislation that will reduce the need for cash infusions when solvency ratios fall below 100 per cent the percentage of paid workers with a defined benefit pension from their employer has dropped to 67 3 per cent in 2016 from more than 80 per cent in the 1980s according to an annual report by statistics canada by contrast about 17 per cent of paid workers with an employer pension are covered by a defined contribution plan and a smaller percentage are covered by a hybrid pension with aspects of both db and dc plans with defined contribution plans and group retirement savings plans employers make contributions but aren t obliged to make up short falls if investments don t fare well nevertheless many employees in the private sector don t have a company pension at all with fewer than 6 3 million canadians under a registered pension plan of those 52 3 per cent were in the public sector according to statistics canada

good crossover sales weren t enough to offset big declines in sales of sedans check out the latest gm earnings call transcript general motors gm 0 07 said that its u s sales fell 2 7 in december as sales of its new pickups weren t strong enough to overcome big year over year declines in sales of its sedans for the full year gm s u s sales were down 1 6 from 2017 how gm s 2018 u s sales compare to rivals most of gm s rivals also lost ground year over year in 2018 the big exception was fiat chrysler automobiles fcau which rode its pickup and suv heavy lineup to a solid sales gain automaker 2018 u s sales change vs 2017 gm 2 954 037 1 6 ford motor company f 1 15 2 485 222 3 5 toyota 2 426 672 0 3 fiat chrysler automobiles 2 246 467 8 4 honda 1 604 828 2 2 nissan 1 493 877 6 3 what worked for gm in 2018 crossover suvs gm put a lot of money and effort behind revamping its entire line of crossover suvs in 2016 and 2017 as expected it reaped the benefits in 2018 with five models setting new sales records vehicle 2018 u s sales change vs 2017 buick encore 93 073 5 7 chevrolet equinox 332 618 14 5 chevrolet trax 89 916 13 4 chevrolet traverse 146 534 18 6 gmc terrain 114 314 33 8 as a group sales of gm s crossovers rose 7 in 2018 to just over 1 million midsize pickups while sales of gm s full size pickups were roughly flat in 2018 more on that below its one size down chevrolet colorado and gmc sierra each had a good year sales were up 19 and 4 3 respectively the chevrolet bolt ev you may have heard that u s sales of the little electric chevy fell almost 23 in 2018 but that s only part of the story gm only produces the bolt in one factory in orion township michigan and exports it to several markets around the world what happened was that demand in canada and south korea exceeded gm s expectations so it sent more bolts out of the u s leaving its u s dealers with tight supplies for part of 2018 we won t have final full year totals for another day or two but it s already clear that higher bolt sales in canada and especially south korea offset most or all of the decline in u s sales of the electric chevy gm is already addressing the supply issue it increased production of the bolt in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company said today that it expects sales of the bolt in the vehicle s major markets the u s canada and south korea to rise in 2019 what didn t work for gm last year full size pickups the jury is still out on gm s all new full size pickups the chevrolet silverado and gmc sierra but we know this 2018 s sales were flat versus 2017 s to be fair gm was selling a mix of old and new models for much of 2018 which complicates the task of gauging the new trucks success and to its credit it has been stingy with incentives on the new trucks but by the simplest of measures gm s pickups had a tough year sales of fca s ram pickups rose 7 in 2018 while ford s market leading f series gained 1 4 sedans more and more buyers are choosing crossover suvs over sedans that s good news for gm s crossovers but it s not so good for the company s sedans most of gm s sedan models were overhauled in the last few years and most of them are very competitive with the best global rivals but most saw sales plummet in 2018 gm has responded by announcing the closure of several north american factories that make sedans a number of formerly big selling models including the chevrolet cruze and impala and a few critical favorites like the superb cadillac ct6 will be going away after 2019 as gm like many rivals focuses on higher profit suv and truck models the upshot gm is choosing profit over sales right now gm is willing to give up on slumping sedan models because it wants to maximize its profit margins not only on general principles but because it s investing heavily in a new generation of battery electric vehicles that will begin rolling out in a few years on balance gm appeared to have a solidly profitable 2018 in north america thanks to those crossovers but it s clear that the company like most of its rivals has further work to do over the next couple of years
investors are hoping a strong december jobs report and dovish words from the federal reserve chairman will ease rising concerns about an economic slowdown the december employment report released at 8 30 a m et friday is expected to show 177 000 non farm payrolls were added after 155 000 in november and an unchanged unemployment rate of 3 7 percent according to thomson reuters traders were encouraged ahead of the report by strong adp payroll data with 271 000 new jobs in december the jobs report also comes on the heels of thursday s shockingly weak ism manufacturing survey down 5 2 points to 54 1 the largest one month decline since the financial crisis the report which still shows an expanding economy was worrisome because it contained an 11 point drop in new orders the ism report added to a weak market tone thursday already negative after apple s warning wednesday that iphone sales were down in china and revenues would be sharply lower apple blamed trade wars for the decline and the ism report only added to fears that trade was a potential catalyst for a broader global slowdown you had some really strong adp data the market completely ignored then you had a pretty horrendous ism print that the market really reacted to strongly that makes the setup for interesting it wouldn t matter if the data is good but it will matter if it s bad said tom simons chief money market economist at jefferies not long after the employment report fed chairman jerome powell joins a panel at 10 15 a m et with former fed chairs ben bernanke and janet yellen the event will be at the american economic association s annual meeting in atlanta and moderated by neil irwin of the new york times the powell appearance has been widely anticipated in markets even though many economists do not expect him to provide much new insight into policy powell s last appearance was at the briefing following the fed s rate meeting in december and he spooked markets when he said that the fed s policy of winding down its balance sheet was on auto pilot markets are looking for powell to show some flexibility on that program under which the fed has been shrinking its balance sheet by allowing securities to roll off as they mature i m worried we re overhyping this appearance a little bit it could be a real fluffy event said simons attention is going to be split up over three different people who are going to be talking about different things and two of whom are going to be speaking in retrospect investors have been speculating that powell could send a dovish message to intentionally reverse the impression he gave after the rate hike i think he has to be careful with the sequencing i think first he has to tell the markets he s going to take a pause on rate hikes before he starts talking about the balance sheet said peter boockvar chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group markets have been concerned that the fed is heading for a policy mistake of tightening too much in a too weak economy the important thing about today is that the market has this belief that if the fed is done that s good they re not hiking anymore that s good but they re stuck with a still fat balance sheet and a 2 25 2 50 percent fed funds rate if we get a poor payroll number that could be a precursor to jobs weakness said boockvar you want the fed to be done with their hiking cycle because they think they ve done their job you don t want the fed to be done with their hiking cycle because the economy is weakening in its face boockvar said the risk is a self fulfilling prophecy where stock market weakness leads to a recession the stock market fell sharply thursday and buyers bid up bonds sending yields to fresh lows the dow was down 660 points or 2 8 percent while the nasdaq hit hard by apple was down 3 percent at 6 463 the sank 2 5 percent to 2 447 the 10 year treasury yield was at 2 55 percent the lowest in a year but even more significant yields on shorter duration notes rose above longer duration yields for instance the 7 year yield at 2 43 percent fell below the 1 year note at 2 52 percent the 2 year note yield at 2 38 percent was below 2 40 percent the effective federal funds rate it means the market is pricing in a recession risk in the next 24 months said ian lyngen head of u s rate strategy at bmo lyngen said the market is also indicating an interest rate cut by the fed is also possible within 24 months the futures market is currently not pricing in any rate hikes though the fed forecasts two hikes this year lyngen said the 10 year yield could continue to move lower friday and the ism data could be signaling a change in the economy they ve just reversed any expectations for any further momentum trumponomics even in the corporate sector that also benefited from the gop s tax reform has now priced it out said lyngen joe lavorgna chief economist at natixis americas said the fed has to pause he said the trade war is a big worry for markets but the fed is bigger the fear is people are going to lump the trade war as an excuse for everything and it may work and if there s a deal there might be a bounce that s a bear market trap if the fed does not relent said lavorgna

by michael erman and ankur banerjee reuters bristol myers squibb co said on thursday it would buy celgene corp for about 74 billion combining two of the world s largest cancer drug businesses in the biggest pharmaceutical deal ever both bristol myers and celgene face separate challenges and some wall street analysts questioned whether the combination which the companies said would create 2 5 billion in cost savings and significantly raise earnings would solve them amid clinical setbacks and other missteps bristol myers shares fell 15 2 percent in 2018 while celgene plunged nearly 40 percent last year bristol s most important cancer immunotherapy and growth driver opdivo has lost much of its luster as merck co s rival drug keytruda seized dominance in advanced lung cancer the most lucrative oncology market meanwhile celgene has endured high profile clinical failures and u s exclusivity on its flagship multiple myeloma drug revlimid will start being phased out in 2022 on thursday bristol s stock ended another 13 3 percent lower at 45 12 doing this transaction clearly indicates that risk to opdivo in lung cancer is obviously a concern suntrust robinson humphrey analyst john boris said in an interview there is also shareholder concern that drugs in development would not have enough sales to offset major products losing exclusivity between 2022 and 2026 but cash flow from revlimid buys bristol myers time to pay down debt and position for another transaction boris said revlimid is expected to record nearly 10 billion in 2018 sales celgene shares were up 20 7 percent at 89 43 both of them were coming into this year kind of limping said brad loncar who runs the loncar cancer immunotherapy etf the deal makes the combined entity a lot stronger he added including debt the deal is worth 95 billion eclipsing pfizer s 89 billion purchase of warner lambert in 2000 according to refinitiv graphic some analysts including baird equity s brian skorney said it raised the possibility of a new era of big drug deals much like in 2009 when pfizer inc merck and roche holding ag all pulled off transformational acquisitions the news pushed up shares of rivals gilead sciences inc allergan plc biogen inc and regeneron pharmaceuticals inc bristol expects to achieve the 2 5 billion in cost savings by 2022 with 55 percent coming from cuts in sales general and administrative expenses 35 percent through reduction in research development spending and 10 percent from manufacturing it said the deal will add more than 40 percent to its earnings in the first year after the deal closes expected in the third quarter of 2019 under terms of the deal celgene shareholders will receive one bristol myers squibb share and 50 in cash for each share held or 102 43 per share a premium of 53 7 percent to celgene s wednesday close celgene shareholders will also receive a so called cvr payment or contingent value right of 9 if three treatments in development achieve timely approvals those are the high profile multiple sclerosis drug ozanimod lymphoma treatment liso cel by dec 31 2020 and a car t therapy for multiple myeloma known as bb2121 from a partnership with bluebird bio by march 31 2021 blood cancer dominance what s important to us is the sustainability of celgene s leadership position in hematology through their pipeline even after revlimid loses patent protection bristol myers chief executive giovanni caforio said in an interview his company s strength has primarily been in solid tumor cancers the new york based drugmaker said it expects six product launches over the next two years five coming from celgene s pipeline it also highlighted promising early clinical assets it would gain with the new jersey based biotech celgene brings experience with potentially revolutionary car t therapies from its 9 billion purchase of juno therapeutics and the bluebird collaboration the therapy takes immune cells from a patient engineers them to better recognize and attack cancer and returns them to the patient the deal could also provide a graceful exit for celgene ceo mark alles who has only committed to staying through the transition his rocky tenure included management shakeups and the loss of more than half its market value since october 2017 as an expensive experimental crohn s disease drug touted as a future multibillion dollar product failed and the expected approval of ozanimod was delayed alles on a conference call urged shareholders to support the deal jeremy bryan portfolio manager at gradient investments which has small positions in both companies said the celgene purchase puts bristol myers on the clock to do more deals when you have a significant amount of cash coming in in the next three years it gives you the flexibility for deals if they are out there or to buy back significant amounts of stock bryan said talks between bristol and celgene opened in september with bristol approaching celgene according to two sources familiar with the matter bristol has obtained fully committed debt financing from morgan stanley senior funding inc and mufg bank ltd morgan stanley co llc is the lead financial adviser to bristol myers and evercore and dyal co llc are its financial advisers kirkland ellis llp is its legal counsel j p morgan securities llc is serving as lead financial adviser and citi is the financial

the tax brackets standard deduction and other tax provisions had been based on the cpi u consumer price index for all urban consumers this index tracks a basket of goods and services that affects the typical u s household so it made sense that it was used to gradually increase tax related figures over time the new tax law uses a metric known as the chained cpi instead which makes the assumption that if a particular good or service becomes too expensive consumers will begin buying a cheaper alternative without getting too deep into a discussion about the chained cpi the effect is that the index grows at a slightly slower rate over time than other forms of the cpi this is a relatively subtle change and unlikely to have a big impact on a year to year basis however because chained cpi increases at a slower pace over time it could have a big impact on the inflation adjustments to the tax code over decades simply put the long term effect of this means that the higher tax brackets will begin to apply to lower income taxpayers as real inflation will theoretically rise faster than the income thresholds of the marginal tax brackets higher standard deduction the tax cuts and jobs act nearly doubled the standard deduction from previous levels taxpayers can choose between using the standard deduction or itemized deductions itemizing deductions means adding up all of the individual tax deductions to which you re entitled and then subtracting them from your adjusted gross income agi note adjusted gross income is your total income minus a few adjustments common adjustments to income include traditional ira contributions and student loan interest just to name a few on the other hand the standard deduction simply is a set amount that americans can choose to deduct instead taxpayers can use whichever of the two methods is more beneficial to them the majority of u s households use the standard deduction so this change will certainly affect millions of people with that in mind here s a comparison of the standard deductions that were in place for the 2017 tax year and those now in effect for 2018 and 2019 filing status 2017 standard deduction 2018 standard deduction 2019 standard deduction single or married filing separately 6 350 12 000 12 200 married filing jointly 12 700 24 000 24 400 head of household 9 350 18 000 18 350 the effect of this change is that more americans will end up using the standard deduction on their returns beginning in 2019 when they file for the 2018 tax year historically approximately 70 of individual tax returns used the standard deduction while the other 30 found it more beneficial to itemize for 2018 and beyond experts have projected that roughly 95 of individual tax returns now will utilize the standard deduction the personal exemption is gone to be perfectly clear although the standard deduction has roughly doubled it doesn t mean that people are getting double the tax break far from it actually while the standard deduction has increased the valuable personal exemption has gone away the reasoning for this is that in addition to a tax cut lawmakers were also attempting to simplify the tax code so instead of giving taxpayers a standard deduction and a number of exemptions these two things were essentially combined into a higher standard deduction in plain english a personal exemption is a certain amount of income americans can exclude from their taxable income each year in prior tax years americans could claim one personal exemption for themselves their spouse and one for each dependent in the 2017 tax year each personal exemption was an effective 4 100 tax deduction and there was no limit to the number of personal exemptions that could be claimed for example a married couple with six dependent children could claim eight personal exemptions you can see how the higher standard deduction may not exactly be a gift especially for larger families the child tax credit has doubled although families with several children may feel the sting from the repeal of the personal exemption there s some good news not only has the child tax credit been increased but more of the credit now is refundable and the income limitations are far less restrictive briefly it s important to mention that a credit is very different from a deduction while a deduction lowers the amount of income that the government considers when taxing you a tax credit actually reduces the amount of tax you owe dollar for dollar if you owe 1 000 in tax a 1 000 credit would pay it off for you while a deduction just would lower the income level that your tax rate would apply to in other words a 1 000 credit is far more valuable than a 1 000 deduction tax reform was good for the child tax credit which was doubled to 2 000 per qualifying child under age 17 as much as 1 400 of this amount is refundable meaning that it can be claimed even if the taxpayer s federal income tax liability is already zero so even if a parent has little income or otherwise owes no federal income taxes they could still take advantage and get this money back furthermore the income phase out thresholds are significantly higher than the previous levels which makes the credit available to far more americans than in previous years several tax breaks phase out above certain income levels the reason is that many tax benefits are intended to benefit low to moderate income taxpayers not the rich however the range of people who can benefit from the child tax credit has been significantly expanded tax filing status maximum agi for full credit agi where credit disappears single 200 000 over 240 000 married filing jointly 400 000 over 440 000 head of household 200 000 over 240 000 married filing separately 200 000 over 240 000 most education tax breaks remain the two popular tax credits for college expenses the american opportunity credit and the lifetime learning credit both survived tax reform unscathed these are designed to lower the tax bills of people who paid college tuition the american opportunity credit applies to tuition paid toward a degree or certificate program but only for the first four years of college while the lifetime learning credit applies to nearly all tuition and fees however it s worth noting that the tuition and fees tax deduction is no longer available as the bipartisan budget act of 2018 only made it available through the 2017 tax year although it s possible that congress will still choose to extend it previously certain taxpayers who couldn t qualify for one of the two credits could deduct as much as 4 000 worth of tuition and fees as an adjustment to income now taxpayers who can t qualify for either credit are out of luck expanded use of 529 savings plans the two main college savings accounts 529 savings plans and coverdell education savings accounts or esas both remain in the revised tax code these accounts provide a tax advantaged way for parents and other relatives to save and invest money for educational expenses such as tuition fees books and certain other qualifying expenses while there s no deduction for contributions to these accounts on federal tax returns any money these accounts earn from investments can be withdrawn tax free when used for a qualified expense however a change was made to 529 savings plans to allow use of the funds for qualifying educational expenses at any level not just for college this was already the case with coverdell esas as one potential example if you end up sending your child to a private high school you could potentially use funds from their 529 savings plan to help pay for it mortgage interest still is deductible but the deduction for mortgage interest is one of the most popular u s tax breaks in fact tax benefits like these are often a primary reason americans decide to buy a home fortunately for many homeowners the mortgage interest deduction survived the tax reform efforts but it did receive two major modifications first the cap or limit on the total deduction allowed has been reduced to the interest on up to 750 000 of qualified residence debt or mortgage principal on a primary or secondary home this is down from the previous limit of 1 million although mortgages obtained before december 15 2017 are grandfathered in to the higher limit second the previous additional limit that allowed taxpayers to deduct interest on as much as 100 000 of home equity debt has been eliminated to be clear interest on a home equity loan such as a heloc may still be used as a deduction but if and only if the loan was used to substantially improve your home in this case it becomes qualified residence debt and is counted as part of your 750 000 cap charitable contributions the charitable contributions deduction is another wildly popular tax break and was never really on the chopping block in fact highly charitable taxpayers can now deduct donations of as much as 60 of their agi a boost from the previous 50 maximum one potential negative change however is that donations made regularly to colleges and universities in exchange for the right to purchase athletic tickets are no longer deductible the medical expense deduction is lower for 2018 but the tax cuts and jobs act lowered the threshold for medical expense deductions to 7 5 of agi from the prior threshold of 10 in other words a taxpayer with an agi of 100 000 can now deduct medical expenses exceeding 7 500 the irs has a long list of expenses that qualify as medical expenses so it can be a good idea to start keeping track of yours if you think you may qualify however this change only was made for the 2017 and 2018 tax years so you ll be able to take advantage of it on the tax return you file in 2019 beyond that time however the threshold is set to increase to 10 again unless congress acts to extend it the salt deduction bad news for high tax states the biggest tax deduction by dollar amount that americans have taken advantage of in recent years is the deduction for state and local taxes also known as the salt state and local taxes deduction specifically americans have been able to deduct the following state and or local property taxes such as those paid on a personal residence automobile or other personal property state and local income taxes or state sales taxes whichever results in the larger deduction generally speaking income taxes are the better deduction but the option to deduct sales tax allows residents of states without an income tax to benefit as well if you choose the sales tax option you don t need receipts the irs provides a calculator to determine this deduction starting with the 2018 tax year however the salt deduction is limited to a total of 10 000 this may sound like a lot but many americans especially those in high tax states like new york new jersey and california have been deducting several times this amount for example the property tax on my parents modest home in new jersey almost reaches the 10 000 cap all by itself now millions of americans cannot deduct their state and local taxes and on top of that the higher standard deduction means that many families who pay high amounts of state and local taxes may not be able to take advantage of the salt deduction at all no more obamacare penalties starting in 2019 while the republican administration and congress have thus far been unsuccessful in repealing the affordable care act the tax cuts and jobs act did eliminate the individual mandate aka the obamacare penalty this is the penalty you pay for not having health insurance one important caveat the penalty is only repealed in tax years 2019 and beyond if you didn t maintain qualifying health coverage throughout 2018 you still may face the penalty when you file your tax return in 2019 the new pass through income deduction designed as a tax break for small business owners the tax cuts and jobs act includes a 20 deduction for pass through income this includes income you receive from a sole proprietorship or other pass through entities such as partnerships llcs and s corps real estate income counts as do dividends you receive from reit real estate investment trust stocks there s one notable restriction the new law sets a maximum amount of income people in professional services businesses such as lawyers doctors and consultants can earn while still taking advantage of the deduction for the 2018 tax year the pass through deduction for these types of business starts to phase out at an agi greater than 157 500 single filers or 315 000 married filing jointly big changes to the alternative minimum tax many legislators had initially sought a repeal of the alternative minimum tax or amt but it still exists in 2018 and beyond if you aren t familiar with it the amt is designed to ensure that high income taxpayers pay their fair share of taxes even if they re entitled to tons of deductions and credits taxpayers still need to calculate their taxes twice once under the standard method and again using the amt and pay whichever results in a larger bill don t worry though your tax preparation software program will determine if you need to be concerned about the amt however there were a couple of significant changes made by the new tax law first amt exemptions never were indexed for inflation this became the main problem with the amt because it didn t change over time with purchasing power it began to apply to more and more americans the amt never was designed to affect the middle class but it had started to do just that from here on out the amt exemption amounts will be indexed for inflation second the amt exemption amounts themselves as well as the phase out limits at which they start to go away have been increased significantly here s a look at the amt exemptions for the 2017 2019 tax years tax filing status 2017 amt exemption amount 2018 amt exemption amount 2019 amt exemption amount single or head of household 54 300 70 300 71 700 married filing jointly 84 500 109 400 111 700 married filing separately 42 500 54 700 55 850 and finally here s how dramatically the exemption phase out income thresholds have changed tax filing status 2017 phase out threshold 2018 phase out threshold 2019 phase out threshold married filing jointly 160 900 1 000 000 1 020 600 all others 120 700 500 000 510 300 the estate tax applies to even fewer american families now to be perfectly clear the estate tax which is essentially a tax on inherited wealth only applied to the wealthiest u s households even before the tax cuts and jobs act was passed however the new law makes it apply to even fewer filers under the former tax law the estate tax only applied to the portion of an estate that was in excess of 5 59 million 2018 the new law doubled the threshold to 11 18 million for 2018 and will increase again in 2019 tax year estate tax lifetime exemption annual exclusion 2018 11 18 million 15 000 2019 11 4 million 15 000 which tax deductions are gone as we ve seen many tax deductions survived the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act either in their previous form or with modifications on the other hand there are some that didn t get to remain on the books at all remember the goal of the tax reform effort wasn t just to cut taxes but to simplify the u s tax code as well as part of the simplification several deductions got axed here are the most significant tax breaks that americans can no longer take advantage of moving expenses this was an above the line deduction meaning that it could be taken whether or not a taxpayer itemized and was designed to offset the costs of job related moving expenses now this deduction is gone except for certain moves related to active duty military service this was an above the line deduction meaning that it could be taken whether or not a taxpayer itemized and was designed to offset the costs of job related moving expenses now this deduction is gone except for certain moves related to active duty military service casualty and theft losses if your home was burglarized you formerly were able to deduct the value of the stolen items now the deduction only can be used for losses attributed to a federally declared disaster if your home was burglarized you formerly were able to deduct the value of the stolen items now the deduction only can be used for losses attributed to a federally declared disaster the miscellaneous deduction category this is one true simplification to the tax code there used to be a long list of deductions that americans could take advantage of to the extent that they exceeded 2 of agi this included things like unreimbursed employee expenses tax preparation expenses and more starting with the 2018 tax year these deductions are gone so some taxpayers with lots of these expenses may feel the sting from this which tax breaks stay the same in 2019 as i mentioned many tax breaks survived the tax cuts and jobs act unscathed this is not an exhaustive list but here are some tax deductions and credits that weren t affected at all capital gains and qualified dividend taxes the child and dependent care credit the american opportunity credit the lifetime learning credit the student loan interest deduction tax deductions for retirement savings will these tax changes expire after 2025 or will congress make them permanent one big uncertainty is what will happen to the tax code after 2025 the way the tax cuts and jobs act is set up the changes to the corporate side of the tax code are permanent but the individual tax changes are mostly set to expire after the 2025 tax year the most significant exception is the change from the cpi w to the chained cpi when it comes to calculating inflation that one s a permanent change here s the problem if the tax changes expire as scheduled after 2025 and our individual tax code reverts back to its previous form the lower inflation calculation will effectively make taxes even higher than they were before for most americans there s currently an effort underway to make the changes permanent lawmakers refer to this as part of tax reform 2 0 however with a split congress any further tax bills are likely to face an uphill battle seem like too much to digest don t fret admittedly these changes may sound a little complicated however the good news is that if you use tax preparation software or have your taxes done by a professional you don t need to worry too much about them they ll ensure you re following the updated tax code and will calculate the effect of these changes on your wallet

getty want to discuss gender lens investing metoo increasingly discussed in asset management firms and the financial press alike gender lens investing is one of the most rapidly growing segments of sustainable investing specifically gender lens investing is an investment thesis that seeks to turn the abstract idea of an investment s benefit to women into a functional investment strategy it integrates gender based factors into investment decisions with goals ranging from enhancing risk adjusted returns to driving gender equality the basis of the investment thesis is manifold studies show that greater gender diversity on boards is a predictor of long term value creation and lower stock price volatility and that european firms with a larger share of women in senior positions have significantly higher returns the limited access of women run businesses to capital is also well documented just 3 of venture capital funding was raised by female ceos in addition the international finance corporation ifc estimates a 320 billion financing gap for female entrepreneurs in formal sector small and medium enterprises in developing countries alone naturally the global total across firm sizes and including the informal sector is larger according to the law of diminishing returns where capital is scarce returns to that the capital should generally be greater than where capital is plentiful lastly according to harvard business review women make the majority of consumer decisions 94 of furniture 92 of vacations 91 of homes 60 of cars and 51 of consumer electronics according to patamar capital managing partner beau seil companies often fail to consider or analyze the specific needs of women without relying on pervasive stereotypes in the products and services they create the power of women as consumers should grow if their labor force participation rate rises the wide spectrum of gender lens investors from purely commercial to more mission driven accordingly purely commercial gender lens investing may consider the share of the board founders or senior management team that is female or whether products disproportionately benefit women when evaluating investment ideas the investment thesis for purely commercial gender lens investing is that changing government policies and social movements such as japan s womenomics initiative metoo the women s march are likely to drive greater long term value creation to firms that fare better in gender lens analysis as rachna saxena who leads gender lens investing work at dalberg advisors explains as more investors adopt gender lens investing strategies there is likely to be greater insight into which metrics make the most sense to track and greater definition around what constitutes investor best practices meanwhile more mission driven gender lens investing aims to increase the number of women led companies and to deploy capital to businesses that promote gender equity or benefit women through products and services according to ifc s south asia gender lead shalaka joshi gender lens investing may also include integrating gender into the financial analysis of investments from a risk perspective gender lens investors range from the fifth largest asset management firm worldwide bny mellon investment management to the g7 development finance institutions which committed to collectively mobilize 3 billion to improve female access to quality employment leadership opportunities and products and services that enhance economic participation and access through the 2x challenge to expound on these two examples bny mellon investment management s dreyfus japan womenomics fund allocates capital to japanese listed companies that could benefit from womenomics by way of background womenomics is a japanese government initiative that aims to drive economic growth through increasing gender equality in addition to increasing female labor force participation the japanese government wants 30 of leadership positions to be filled by women by 2020 specifically the dreyfus japan womenomics fund s target investments i attract the growing power of women consumers as female labor force participation rises ii benefit from more women in the workforce or iii employ and promote more women and are therefore viewed as likely to outperform on the other end of the purely commercial vs mission driven spectrum as part of the 2x challenge the us government s development finance institution overseas private investment corporation committed a 100 million loan to indusind bank ltd to on lend to women throughout india there are numerous other examples of gender lens investment product introductions and initiative launches in the last two years recent european product launches include ubs s global gender equality ucits etf ucits are investment funds that are regulated by the eu across the atlantic according to barron s canadian product launches include rbc s evolve funds group s and mackenzie investments exchange traded funds rldr hers and mwmn us products include state street global advisors gender diversity index she etf which allocates capital to listed large cap us companies with high levels of gender diversity among senior executives and on their boards the barclays women in leadership total return index wil etf which invests in us publicly traded companies with at least a female ceo or at least 25 female members of the board and impact shares and ywca usa s womn etf which invests in firms with business practices that align with gender equality standards also noteworthy is the decision of the second largest bank in the us bank of america to hire a recognized leader in and author of a book on gender lens investing jackie vanderbrug to run its impact investing strategies a long road ahead as long as governments and societies retain focus on increasing gender equality gender lens investment products and initiatives should continue to proliferate according to the world economic forum s most recent global gender gap report this trend could continue for years at current rates of progress toward gender parity the gender gap will close in 61 years in western europe 70 years in south asia 171 years in east asia and the pacific and 165 years in north america naturally policy makers and other stakeholders can expedite this process if they choose bold action until then gender lens investing remains an investment thesis to watch

with the swearing in of nancy pelosi as the speaker of the house and the beginning of a different kind of washington traders in a couple of markets found confidence in taking new directions the yields in the benchmark treasury bonds and notes dropped below significant uptrend lines a notable move stocks in gold mining operations had their best day in months both the major firms and the smaller more volatile outfits i would guess it s likely that the treasury moves and the gold stock moves are coming from a certain kind of new thinking about the global economic picture skipping the stories about such things and simply examining the price charts is what i like at least to begin with let s start with the move in the treasuries here s what the 30 year yield looks like now on a weekly basis stockcharts com the trend line upward from the june 2016 low connecting the late 2017 low is broken the rise in this interest rate measure is over when viewed from the standpoint of weekly levels the new trend is downward as of mid december 2018 and now confirmed by a close below the ichimoku cloud it s possible the yield could now decline to the next level of support which would be the lows of the mid to late 2017 period here s the look of the monthly 30 year yield chart right now stockcharts com after breaking above the long term downtrend from 2010 2011 the yield is now back to just above the downtrend line it s back in the mid to late 2017 level chartists will be watching to see if a bounce begins at this spot or if it breaks down back below the downtrend line to resume that longer term direction stockcharts com you can see that the yield is all the way back down to the breakout level of the previous january it s also back down to a close below the ichimoku cloud although just barely will the 10 year yield make it back to the the august september 2018 low yield whatever in the global economy is taking the bond yields down also seems to be taking the price of gold higher here s the weekly price chart for the precious metal stockcharts com what s most significant here is that recent price low in august of 2018 managed to stay well above the previous price low of late 2016 thus even with the wide swing the trend is upward now it s may be that the upper line that connects the early 2018 highs will now become an eventual target and resistance if it gets there here s the monthly gold price chart stockcharts com a lot is at stake here that s a significant down trend line connecting the 2011 and 2012 high prices with the 2018 high prices a close above such a long term trend line would be quite an event as the next level of serious resistance would be way back up there at the 2011 2012 highs what might cause the price of gold to take out this line inflation fear those are usually the 2 big factors or some combination of the 2 it s gonna be interesting i do not hold positions in these investments no recommendations are made one way or the other if you re an investor you d want to look much deeper into each of these situations you can lose money trading or investing in stocks and other instruments always do your own independent research due diligence and seek professional advice from a licensed investment advisor
