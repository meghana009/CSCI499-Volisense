washington d c in an open letter delivered to the white house last week the ceos of major u s airlines urged president biden to drop his outdated federal mask mandate for those flying on airplanes as well as for inside airports the letter was signed by the ceos of alaska air american airlines atlas air worldwide aviation fedex express hawaiian airlines delta air lines jetblue airways southwest airlines united airlines ups airlines and airlines for america the ceo s called upon biden to end the federal mask mandate after it expires on 18th april as well as covid 19 testing requirements for incoming international travelers stating now is the time for the administration to sunset federal transportation travel restrictions while other countries such as the uk and france no longer imposes testing on vaccinated travelers the u s still requires incoming international travelers to show proof of a negative covid test before boarding their flights the ceos said they had supported and cooperated with the federal government s measures throughout the pandemic but the burden to enforce the now outdated regulations fell on their employees it is critical to recognize that the burden of enforcing both the mask and pre departure testing requirements has fallen on our employees for two years now this is not a function they are trained to perform and subjects them to daily challenges by frustrated customers this in turn takes a toll on their own well being the letter added the ceos also said that since the measures were introduced early in the pandemic the situation has changed considerably stressing they no longer make sense in the current public health context the persistent and steady decline of hospitalization and death rates are the most compelling indicators that our country is well protected against severe disease from covid 19 the letter noted given that we have entered a different phase of dealing with this virus we strongly support your view that covid 19 need no longer control our lives we are encouraged by the current data and the lifting of covid 19 restrictions from coast to coast which indicate it is past time to eliminate covid era transportation policies the ceos added the white house has yet to comment about the letter

in a dramatic appearance at a crowded rally in the castro longtime queer activist and leader cleve jones announced sunday that he plans to fight the eviction from his 18th street duplex jones who is is 67 hiv positive and has copd had previously said that he had planned to voluntarily end his 12 year tenancy after the building s new owner lily pao kue a 30 year old self described stock trader who purchased the building for 1 585 000 said she would raise jones rent from from 2 393 to 5 200 as reported by the san francisco chronicle and the bay area reporter jones said he didn t want to fight but has no choice photo by garrett leahy this was not a fight we sought this was not a fight we want this was not a fight for which we are prepared but i have come to the conclusion that it is not a fight from which we can walk away i m not leaving said jones addressing the rally jones made it clear that this is not about him i will be fine he said noting that he has a good job legal resources and political connections he s not going to wind up on the streets that he pointed is not the case for many others who face housing insecurity so fighting the eviction he said is about standing up for the rights of all tenants his decision sets up a political and legal battle that could set a precedent for how landlords can interpret state law to evict tenants and whether the city will allow it to happen pao kue s case to raise the rent and evict jones relies on an interpretation of the costa hawkins act that is at the very best a stretch pao kue has claimed that jones had vacated the apartment after purchasing a cottage in guerneville and that his roommate and partner brenden chadwick is an illegal subtenant in justifying jones eviction from the apartment jones disputed those claims during the rally sunday saying that he was unable to occupy the guerneville cottage during the first year of ownership due to flooding and wildfires in the area and since then only occupied the guerneville cottage sporadically namely when he had to quarantine away from his partner due to potential covid exposure the sisters gave a blessing photo by tim redmond and under city law a hard won tenant victory sponsored by then sup jane kim it s legal to bring in a partner or roommate to a one bedroom apartment as long as the zoning allows it the building management company that jones used to pay his rent to was aware of the situation and approved it jones said jones neighbors corroborated jones claim that he rarely spent time in his guerneville cottage saying they regularly saw him at his apartment i saw him coming and going all the time there was social distancing but he was always home mike pierce who regularly socialized with jones said in an interview jones said that artifacts and historical documents related to harvey milk s activism the founding of the san francisco aids foundation and the creation of the aids memorial quilt have been moved out of the apartment as a precaution i moved that stuff out it s safe harvey s bullhorn is safe all the records are safe jones said during an interview after the rally jones said that reflecting on his years of activism and history in the castro ultimately persuaded him to hunker down and fight the eviction i was overwhelmed with guilt i m getting all these messages on social media saying we understand your decision but we wish you could fight how am i supposed to tell people to fight back which is what i ve done for decades in this community if i m not willing to stand up and fight back jones said in an interview rafael mandelman said that he would ask the city attorney to look at what sf can do to support people facing these sorts of evictions photo by garrett leahy jones and others underscored that jones eviction case is just a symptom of a problem of pervasive evictions in the castro which are often used by real estate speculators to purchase and clear out rent controlled units in order to flip them to market rate high end housing and that those less politically connected than jones face tougher circumstances fighting those evictions if somebody with his stature in san francisco who is so beloved and so much a part of the community and with all the connections he has if this can happen to him we know it s happening across the city to people with far fewer resources said race bannon who been jones neighbor since 2010 jones underscored the importance of queer neighborhoods as a nexus of political power and activism for queer communities which has been a key part in electing queer lawmakers and crafting legislation beneficial to queer people all across california sometimes this gets reduced to a silly conversation about gay bars closing but it goes far deeper the gayborhoods are crucial jones said when we lose that geographic concentration of actual queer and trans people sharing space we lose political power if we re not in large numbers in certain precincts we can t elect our own and defeat our enemies jones added that the ability for lgbtq people to gather and live in the same neighborhood is also a crucial element in making the castro a hub of art and creativity it s not an accident that this neighborhood created the rainbow flag and the aids memorial quilt and the first gay synagogue and the gay men s chorus and the lgbtq film festival and so many other things jones said it came out of that creative cauldron when we inhabit the same space district eight supervisor rafael mandelman whose district includes the castro said that the city has done a lot to preserve the castro s history as a queer neighborhood but that evictions in his district present a threat to that legacy mandelman s district has faced similar numbers of no fault evictions since 2009 including ellis act evictions as district nine which includes the mission according to reporting by the san francisco chronicle we do a lot to preserve the queer legacy of the neighborhoods but you can t have a queer neighborhood if the queer people can t afford to live here and the people who made it a queer neighborhood have all been displaced and evicted mandelman said in an interview mandelman said that jones and people in his situation shouldn t have to fight these battles alone he said would speak to city attorney david chiu to weigh the city s options mandelman added that while he believes that while the city can do more to protect tenants from no fault evictions by speculators there needs to be a prioritization at the state level to strengthen tenant protections including repeal or reform of the ellis act specifically mandelman said he supported amending the ellis act to curtail its use by speculators to flip rent controlled housing units by making new property buyers remain landlords for the first five years after purchase before being eligible to evict tenants under the act i think the city does what we can but there s more to be done right we have right to counsel but we can strengthen that we have a small sites program that needs to be strengthened but really we need changes in state law we need the legislature and the governor really to care about tenants in california sup david campos who is running for state assembly said that he wants to be sure that the interests of tenants are represented in a legislature that is dominated by real estate interests jones said that he is uncertain if he will be successful in maintaining his tenancy and acknowledged he will need support in what is likely to be a protracted legal battle i will need a lot of help and support if nothing else maybe we can slow down this swarm of locusts that has descended upon this city jones said tim redmond contributed reporting to this story

washington d c in an open letter delivered to the white house last week the ceos of major u s airlines urged president biden to drop his outdated federal mask mandate for those flying on airplanes as well as for inside airports the letter was signed by the ceos of alaska air american airlines atlas air worldwide aviation fedex express hawaiian airlines delta air lines jetblue airways southwest airlines united airlines ups airlines and airlines for america the ceo s called upon biden to end the federal mask mandate after it expires on 18th april as well as covid 19 testing requirements for incoming international travelers stating now is the time for the administration to sunset federal transportation travel restrictions while other countries such as the uk and france no longer imposes testing on vaccinated travelers the u s still requires incoming international travelers to show proof of a negative covid test before boarding their flights the ceos said they had supported and cooperated with the federal government s measures throughout the pandemic but the burden to enforce the now outdated regulations fell on their employees it is critical to recognize that the burden of enforcing both the mask and pre departure testing requirements has fallen on our employees for two years now this is not a function they are trained to perform and subjects them to daily challenges by frustrated customers this in turn takes a toll on their own well being the letter added the ceos also said that since the measures were introduced early in the pandemic the situation has changed considerably stressing they no longer make sense in the current public health context the persistent and steady decline of hospitalization and death rates are the most compelling indicators that our country is well protected against severe disease from covid 19 the letter noted given that we have entered a different phase of dealing with this virus we strongly support your view that covid 19 need no longer control our lives we are encouraged by the current data and the lifting of covid 19 restrictions from coast to coast which indicate it is past time to eliminate covid era transportation policies the ceos added the white house has yet to comment about the letter

every day 200 to 300 people die of covid 19 in germany the number of new infections registered daily is 300 000 according to health minister karl lauterbach the real number is twice as high since the beginning of the pandemic the robert koch institute rki has recorded 20 million infections this sad record was reached on saturday two thirds of these infections have occurred under the traffic light coalition since the social democratic party spd greens and liberal democrats fdp took over the government on december 8 2021 13 million people have been infected twice as many as since the pandemic began the new government is also responsible for one fifth of the 128 000 deaths in germany a woman walks past an abandoned coronavirus test center in frankfurt tuesday nov 2 2021 despite the ongoing ba 2 wave germany has lifted almost all protective measures and what is it doing to contain the disaster it is abolishing all protective measures like a fireman dousing a fire with petrol instead of water it is fuelling the pandemic last week the government passed the new infection protection act which should rather be called the deliberate mass infection act it abolishes almost all previous protective measures and delegates responsibility to the l√§nder federal states although these can introduce mandatory mask wearing social distancing rules and similar measures in hotspots the threshold for doing so far exceeds the previous ones the fragmentation of responsibility to the federal states is further heightened by the fragmentation into districts public appearances by health minister lauterbach spd are increasingly taking on a schizophrenic character on friday he appeared at the government press conference flanked by the head of the rki lothar wieler and the chairperson of the doctors marburger bund susanne johna and sounded the alarm unfortunately the situation was not good lauterbach complained three hundred deaths a day was intolerable and there had to be immediate and swift reactions since the federal government s hands were tied he said he directed his appeal to the federal states to do something it was not enough to hope that the incidence level would fall with the improvement in the weather he declared but lauterbach himself is responsible for the law that ties the hands of the federal government and takes away all effective instruments from the states rki head wieler also emphasised the desperate nature of the situation within a week 3 percent of the population had tested positive he said more than 4 million people were currently infected which increased the risk of infection the pandemic was far from over this wave will not be the last wave he warned doctors representative johna described the catastrophic situation in hospitals three quarters of which had had to restrict their services the reason was the costly care of coronavirus patients and the high absence of doctors and nurses who have contracted covid 19 or resigned because of the unbearable workloads all three agreed on the need to increase vaccination coverage but there is nothing left of the vaccination campaign that the coalition loudly announced when it took office of the particularly vulnerable over 60s alone 2 2 million are still not vaccinated the planned vaccine mandate is talked to death in endless parliamentary committees and will probably never come into force there is a method behind the irresponsibility of the federal government it is not limited to germany but characterises the coronavirus policies of almost all governments in the world with the exception of china they have abandoned all responsibility for the health and lives of their own populations even though the social and health consequences of the pandemic are devastating in the first two years taking into consideration excess mortality 18 million people worldwide have died because of the pandemic this is roughly equivalent to the number of soldiers and civilians who died due to combat during the four years of the first world war most of these deaths could have been avoided with a consistent covid elimination strategy behind each death remain those who lost a relative a friend a breadwinner or a child there are still no reliable statistics on the health and social consequences of long covid but numerous studies show it is being completely underestimated the wsws has repeatedly warned of this danger and interviewed renowned scientists about it an article that appeared in the science section of the faz on march 8 providing an overview of the current state of scientific research concludes it is now clear that long covid or as it is often called in medical terms post covid is for all the difficulty of defining the disease precisely and narrowing down the dozens of possible symptoms as well as the heterogeneity of the duration of suffering virtually a mass inheritance of the coronavirus infection waves according to a danish study based on 150 000 respondents more than a third of those infected still complained of at least one covid problem six months to a year after infection half of them reporting exhaustion persistent memory problems and or great difficulty in concentrating brain fog anxiety and other mental health problems also seem to be particularly persistent medical studies found that even mild coronavirus infections can lead to a reduction in the density of grey matter in the brain severe cardiovascular disease and a weakening of the immune system children are also affected cardiovascular conditions such as heart attacks heart inflammation strokes pulmonary embolisms and leg vein thrombosis often occurred months after infection a social system whose governing layers are neither willing nor able to protect the lives and health of their populations has lost any reason to exist there is a direct link between the deep global crisis of capitalism and the irresponsible coronavirus policies being pursued social inequality which has been increasing for decades has rapidly worsened in the pandemic while in the words of british prime minister boris johnson the bodies are piled high stock market prices are reaching new highs wall street banks made record profits of 45 billion in the first three months of last year the 180 000 workers in the industry received an average annual bonus of 257 500 while a large section of the american working class is sinking into poverty the situation is no different in germany and other capitalist countries the orgy of enrichment of a tiny minority is maintained by the central banks which pump huge sums into the economy in the form of bond purchases and interest free loans this speculative bubble is in danger of bursting if the exploitation of the working class is not constantly intensified this is the main reason for the removal of all coronavirus protections profits take precedence over human lives the ukraine war has further aggravated the crisis of capitalism russia s reactionary attack on ukraine was systematically prepared and deliberately provoked by nato s expansion to the east nato s goal is not only the integration of ukraine into its sphere of influence but regime change in moscow and the subjugation of russia and china as well as control over their rich mineral resources the weekend edition of handelsblatt appeared with a picture of putin and chinese leader xi in the crosshairs underneath the headline runs the great battle for raw materials it goes on to say the war shows the dependence on a few producing countries this is only the beginning china is establishing monopolies on all important materials at the expense of the german economy the war is serving as a pretext for a huge rearmament offensive the german military budget is being tripled this year from 50 billion to 150 billion whose costs are to be imposed on the working class the war course like the reckless coronavirus policy is supported by all parties from the far right alternative for germany afd to the left party the demands of the ultra right coronavirus deniers and anti vaxxers who rioted in the streets last year now form the basis of government action the offensive against russia is characterised by the same contempt for human life as coronavirus policy politicians and the media now openly discuss the pros and cons of a nuclear war that would mean the end of humanity typical is a comment by faz editor berthold kohler who writes that the concerns putin could use biological chemical or even nuclear warheads were not unjustified nevertheless he rejects considering any concession or brokering a diplomatic solution even if russia withdrew from ukraine immediately there would be no return to the pre war relationship for the west either politically or economically the danger of a nuclear world war must be taken seriously confronted with a global crisis of the capitalist system and fierce class tensions a turning point in history as chancellor olaf scholz puts it germany s ruling class is again resorting to war and authoritarian forms of rule it already proved 80 years ago under hitler what desperate acts and crimes it is capable of in doing so it is completely useless to appeal to the ruling class and its parties under these conditions the struggle against covid against war and against cuts in social programmes and wages necessarily coincide this requires the building of an independent movement of the international working class fighting for socialism

here s the best take i ve seen on the equities round trip of the past few weeks the cotd feb 15thlinkhere that i ve had lowest confidence in one or two weeks after publishing and might have retracted if i could was the one showing the historical playbook for geopolitical events but as it turns out that playbook has worked remarkably well with the s p 500 now back above levels from the point where the us warned of an imminent russian invasion of ukraine late on friday11th february this marked the start of the escalations and a geopolitical induced market sell off so hats off to my equity colleagues binky chadha and parag thatte for their analysis on which i based a lot of my last month s thoughts even if i was prepared to forget i ever highlighted it at the market nadir 2 and a half weeks ago basically the duration and the scale of this sell off has been almost identical to the median seen through history when we ve experienced geopolitical or domestic us political events the bounce back has actually been a few days quicker than normal it normally takes three weeks to hit a bottom and 3 weeks to fully recover this event took around 3 weeks and just over 2 weeks respectively to do the same a reminder that we also highlighted that what happens after the recovery was complete then mostly depends on what conditions were like going into the crisis geopolitical events have rarely left a deep scar on markets but even before events escalated around ukraine markets were trying to come to terms with inflation and rate hikes that will continue to be the dominant theme for markets in h1 and beyond
article 3 months old fyi mar 28 2022 richard rick mills ahead of the herd as a general rule the most successful man in life is the man who has the best information it is 2050 beyond the emissions reductions registered in 2015 no further efforts were made to control emissions we are heading for a world that will be more than 3c warmer by 2100 the first thing that hits you is the air in many places around the world the air is hot heavy and depending on the day clogged with particulate pollution your eyes often water your cough never seems to disappear you think about some countries in asia where out of consideration sick people used to wear white masks to protect others from airborne infection now you often wear a mask to protect yourself from air pollution you can no longer simply walk out your front door and breathe fresh air there might not be any instead before opening doors or windows in the morning you check your phone to see what the air quality will be melting permafrost releases ancient microbes today s humans have never been exposed to and have no resistance to fewer people work outdoors and even indoors the air can taste slightly acidic sometimes making you feel nauseated the last coal furnaces closed 10 years ago but that hasn t made much difference in air quality around the world because you are still breathing dangerous exhaust fumes from millions of cars and buses everywhere our world is getting hotter over the next two decades projections tell us that temperatures in some areas of the globe will rise even higher an irreversible development now utterly beyond our control oceans forests plants trees and soil had for many years absorbed half the carbon dioxide we spewed out now there are few forests left most of them either logged or consumed by wildfire and the permafrost is belching greenhouse gases into an already overburdened atmosphere the increasing heat of the earth is suffocating us and in five to 10 years vast swaths of the planet will be increasingly inhospitable to humans we don t know how hospitable the arid regions of australia south africa and the western united states will be by 2100 no one knows what the future holds for their children and grandchildren tipping point after tipping point is being reached casting doubt on the form of future civilisation some say that humans will be cast to the winds again gathering in small tribes hunkered down and living on whatever patch of land might sustain them the pandemic has fallen off the headlines replaced by the regional war between russia and ukraine as the media chases fast moving global events one of the most enduring problems of our time continues to churn in the background climate change it was previously thought that the worst effects of climate change wouldn t happen until 2100 recent climate modeling has brought the point of no return forward last summer the much ignored intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc put out a report stating that the earth s average temperature will rise 15 degrees celsius by 2030 a decade earlier than earlier projected even if the 1 5c target is achieved the report says it would still generate heat waves rainfall droughts and other extreme weather unprecedented in the observational record to take just one example at just slightly higher levels of global heating what was once a once in a century flooding event will happen every year by 2100 a warming planet threatens to worsen substantially higher prices that are already making it hard for people to make ends meet in both developed and developing countries food inflation the war in ukraine is accelerating a global food crisis that is reverberating across the world in countries that literally depend on the region for putting food on the table the conflict has choked off over 25 of the world s supply of grain putting the market on track for the sharpest shock since the 1970s higher prices are speeding up food inflation and raising concerns for countries reliant on foreign supply gallup the polling firm provided data indicating which countries are most likley to suffer from a wheat supply disruption topping the list is turkey which received 75 of its wheat imports from russia and ukraine in 2019 second is egypt which imported 70 of its grain from russia and ukraine in 2019 note that russia s low wheat harvest in 2010 due to drought was a major factor in the arab spring that broke out in egypt egyptians are worried that prices for the subsidized loaves of bread they depend on could rise for the first time in four decades adding to current supply concerns for agricultural commodities some countries are hoarding stockpiles while others are restricting exports hungary is banning grain exports and serbia announced it will halt exports of wheat corn flour and cooking oil indonesia tightened curbs on exports of palm oil used in a range of food products including biscuits margarine laundry detergents and chocolate over the weekend argentina announced plans to increase control over local farm goods by suspending soybean meal and oil for export the move caused soy meal futures to jump more than 2 2 countries that could normally fill the void are themselves having production problems a drought in brazil a major supplier of corn and soybeans has ruined crops while in canada and the us a prolonged period of hot and dry weather in 2021 also wilted fields globally wheat farmers are already running at full tilt and most northern hemisphere nations have limited ability to grow more because the crop has already been planted hardship will fall on countries most dependent on russia and ukraine for food imports the number of people facing starvation worldwide spiked from 80 million to 276 million before the invasion due mostly to covid lockdowns that figure is set to rise again fertilizer is an often underestimated aspect of the food supply chain that modern farming simply cannot do without its higher cost must be borne by producers and so higher food prices are likely going to be baked in the cake for several years before the war the fertilizer market was pummeled by extreme weather plant shutdowns and rising energy costs in particular natural gas the main feedstock for nitrogen fertilizer then came the invasion of ukraine on march 7 european natural gas hit an all time high briefly touching 345 per megawatt hour the equivalent us 600 oil on concerns over the availability of the fossil fuel used for heating and electricity russia supplies about a third of european gas demand and has threatened to cut flows via the existing nord stream 1 pipeline to germany as retaliation over western sanctions russia s efforts to halt fertilizer exports are pushing the prices of crop nutrients to record levels the country is the world s largest exporter of urea and no 2 for potash the green markets north american fertilizer index farmers are having to reduce their plantings due to urea shortages any reduction in nitrogen which must be applied annually will immediately impact crop yields severely impacting food staples like corn and wheat for most growers they have no choice but to pass on the added costs to their customers data from the united nations show world food prices reached an all time high in february a year on year increase of 20 7 driven by an 8 5 increase in the fao vegetable oils price index which also hit a new pinnacle the dairy cereal and meat price indices all punched higher united states inflation rose 7 9 in february with food and energy costs pushing prices to their highest in 40 years gasoline groceries and shelter were the biggest contributors to the cpi gains energy inflation economists pay close attention to energy prices because energy is the biggest contributor to the consumer price index oil and inflation are linked because oil is such a major input of the global economy despite billions being spent on new solar and wind farms the world still largely runs on fossil fuels if energy costs rise so do the prices of end products for example plastic a lot of manufacturers package and sell their products in plastic but plastic is made from petroleum when oil prices go up plastic costs more and this must be absorbed by companies that use it for packaging to preserve their profit margins they charge customers more for their products the same thing happens with transportation costs intermodal transportation is fueled by oil and gas so when oil goes up companies that ship their products pay more for freight then pass these costs onto their customers as energy prices rise each stage of the supply chain ends up costing more causing an inflationary spiral even before russia invaded ukraine thus roiling energy markets over potential supply disruptions oil and gas prices were rising due to demand outstripping supply the coronavirus caught the oil market off guard unlike in 2014 when a wave of supply swamped prices in early 2020 a sudden demand shock due to the onset of covid 19 pushed crude as low as 40 bbl briefly and unthinkably oil became like a waste product something you had to pay people to take away since that historic plunge crude oil prices have soared more than 700 for the first time since 2014 oil went above us 100 bbl despite the push to green energy demand for oil has stayed strong during the pandemic consumer and business spending has focused more on manufactured items which are oil intensive to produce and transport than in person services where infection risks are higher whereas previously high oil consumption cycles were matched by increased production by some of the world s top oil producers including saudi arabia russia the united states and canada this time is different the opec group of major oil exporters have refused to boost output faster citing the risk to prices of another drop in oil consumption should a new wave of infections materialize this has left the market chronically under supplied with prices ratcheting higher when tanks rolled into ukraine the oil market went bonkers crude prices climbed to 14 year highs and briefly topped us 130 per barrel gasoline pump prices have hit records too the us nationwide average for regular gas is now us 4 32 a gallon according to aaa the average gas price in canada as of march 7 was us 1 90 per liter says globalpetrolprices com vancouver motorists have the most expensive gas in north america with prices marching up to us 2 09 a liter on march 6 a record for the region commodities inflation accompanying food and energy inflation is a growing crisis of unaffordability consumers everywhere are getting squeezed on housing costs fuel inflation and a loss of purchasing power combined it adds up to a perfect storm that if nothing changes will lead to a breaking point when people have nothing left to lose and revolution is seen as the only means of forcing social and economic change inflation is rampaging across much of the globe including in the united states and canada where it has hit multi decade highs on march 7 bloomberg wrote the rally from oil to wheat and natural gas to nickel is threatening a still fragile economic recovery from the pandemic exacerbating an inflationary surge for energy consuming nations and worsening a cost of living crisis for millions the higher cost of living would be manageable if a worker s wages were keeping up with inflation unfortunately they are not we know the purchasing power of most americans earning wages or collecting a salary has stagnated this is all down to inflation and the inability of fiat currencies to protect against it indeed us wages have failed to keep up with rapidly climbing prices wages average hourly earnings in february dropped on a year on year basis for the 11th straight month regarding inflation note that the data released for february does not include the crazy commodity price hikes we have seen lately including wheat oil natural gas and nickel the latter rallying 250 in two days nor does it reflect soaring house inflation the march cpi is therefore bound to be worse likely much higher than 7 9 as inflation eats away disposable income nearly two thirds of americans are living paycheck to paycheck covid exposed the weaknesses in supply chains the war has revealed how some of the countries most vulnerable to food price hikes and social unrest are dependent on the russian ukrainian bread basket of course it s not only those countries north americans too are getting whacked by higher food energy and housing costs higher prices for agricultural commodities find their way into higher grocery bills farmers and ranchers are paying record high input costs including fuel fertilizer and feed to preserve his profit margin the farmer must increase his prices which are passed onto the grocery buyer it s the same principle for lumber electronics and evs to take three examples skyrocketing lumber prices last summer were passed onto developers and home builders while ev battery prices have declined the past few years higher material costs including nickel and lithium exacerbated by russia s invasion of ukraine could reverse that trend according to a recent reuters report quoted by green car reports ihs markit predicts that surging raw material prices will put further ev battery price declines on hold until 2024 an october 2021 survey of electronics industry executives found that 7 out of 10 manufacturers intend to raise prices in 2022 due to higher material and labor costs including steel nickel copper and aluminum when i say we re heading for a breaking point a kind of global economic reckoning it s not only inflation due to covid related supply chain issues so called transitory inflation and commodity price increases that have been accelerated by the war in ukraine we have to remember that the climate on planet earth is changing and a lot faster than many had anticipated in north america the manifestations of global warming can be seen in near opposite weather and climate patterns on the west versus the east side of the continent as western and southern north america bake in a prolonged drought the east coast is getting hit by an increasing number of freak storms unusually harsh winter weather and a shocking sea level rise that could see some of its major cities underwater within the next 35 years that i hasten to remind readers is within most of our lifetimes drought in 2021 a prolonged stretch of hot weather in western canada and the united states smashed temperature records and killed over a thousand people mostly in british columbia and alberta june was exceptionally hot with temperatures hitting 49 6 degrees celsius in lytton bc a national record state side the city of portland reached an all time high of 46 6 c breaking the previous record of 41 6 set in 1965 climate scientists at the un warn that extreme heat waves which previously struck once every 50 years are now expected once per decade us government scientists reported that 2021 was the sixth warmest year on record an extended drought since 2000 in the colorado river basin which includes bits of seven western states and a part of mexico has made it impossible for the country s biggest reservoirs lake mead in nevada and lake powell straddling the border of utah and arizona to recharge fully this is a huge problem considering that the colorado river provides water for more than 40 million people including major us cities las vegas and los angeles according to the cbc the dramatic drying in 2021 deepened the american west s 22 year megadrought so much that it is now the driest in 1 200 years the previous megadrought was in the late 1500s a study in nature climate change journal says the current drought shows no signs of easing us drought monitor reveals 55 of the us west is currently dry with 13 experiencing the two highest drought levels shown on the map below as dark purple and red a second map shows much of the canadian prairies in drought as of the end of january with the driest areas severe drought in brown and extreme drought in red straddling most of southern alberta saskatchewan and manitoba abnormally dry areas depicted in yellow extend into british columbia northern manitoba ontario quebec and as far east as new brunswick in fact drought conditions in western canada and the united states extend all the way down the west coasts of north and south america as far as chile and paraguay last summer in chile the continuation of a decade long drought with a lack of precipitation in the andes kept reservoir levels low and farm fields parched there was only 78 mm of rainfall from last january to august compared to the average 252 mm the mapocho and the maipo rivers that provide santiago with water last august were lower than they were in 2019 the driest year in chile s history rueters said more recently dry conditions in south america are leading to forest fires plummeting water levels and ruined crops in paraguay a drought that started late last year has badly damaged crop yields and caused navigation problems in a key waterway pushing up the costs of transporting grains the landlocked country and major soybean exporter is facing its worst harvest in a decade low water levels are also impacting paraguay s production of hydroelectricity last year s amount was the least in 25 years government officials climate scientists and businesses who depend on the waterways say the california sized country hasn t suffered through a drought this extreme since the 1940s neighboring argentina the world s top exporter of processed soy is also facing the risk of drought hitting soy and corn harvests a lack of rainfall has resulted in eight separate forest fires that devastated almost 800 000 hectares al jazeera reports that strong winds low humidity and dryness fueled the fires which started in mid january they were especially intense consuming about 30 000 hectares a day and flattening up to 9 of a region dependent on agriculture that normally sees abundant rain losses could top more than 26 billion argentine pesos equivalent to more than us 240 million al jazeera says argentina has limited exports of beef this year because of the lack of rain climate scientists say that deforestation in the amazon rainforest is altering weather patterns with less rain in the rainy season causing the dry season to become hotter and drier trees that produce much of the rainwater through evaporation are being replaced by farmland last october the beginning of brazil s six month rainy season the wall street journal said a sustained drought going on its third year is unlikely to ebb according to climate scientists government officials and agro businessmen who track weather patterns regarding the megadrought in north america scientists point the finger at climate change park williams lead author of the above mentioned study and a climate hydrologist at ucla studied moisture levels within a box shaped area that included 12 states using modern measurements and tree rings williams found that without climate change the megadrought would ve ended in the mid 2000s because 2005 and 2006 would have been wet enough to break it the cbc quotes jonathan overpeck dean of environment at the university of michigan saying the study is an important wake up call climate change is literally baking the water supply and forests of the southwest and it could get a whole lot worse if we don t halt climate change soon according to the center for energy and climate solutions higher temperatures can increase the rate of soil evaporation further suppress rainfall in already dry areas and alter narrow bands of moisture in the atmosphere thereby disrupting precipitation patterns inside climate news reportsthat dry spells are getting longer between downpours and blizzards and that the snowpack is melting during the winter a warming atmosphere may also be suppressing critical summer rains as western canadian and americans brace for another summer of droughts fires withered crops and higher food prices that are already toppy due to 40 year high inflation conditions are entirely different on the other side of the continent flooding according to the hill in late january a major winter storm pummeled the east coast with near hurricane strength winds snow and coastal flooding causing widespread power outages travel challenges economic impacts and unfortunately even some fatalities as snow piled up along the east coast from the mid atlantic states to the canadian border the winter wallop followed a particularly bad jag of storms last summer and fall with more than 50 hurricanes cyclones and tropical storms they included hurricane elsa that hit barbados tropical storm grace which brought damage and flooding to haiti just days after an earthquake then went on to kill eight people in mexico hurricane henri which made landfall in rhode island usa and hurricane ida the second worst hurricane to hit louisiana behind katrina in 2005 the remnants of the category 4 hurricane caused flash flooding in the northeastern united states inundated subways and drowned 11 new yorkers in their own homes jonathan overpeck the same climate scientist quoted in the above mentioned cbc story says global warming is making these east coast winter storms often called bomb cyclones because they move so fast and their quick drops in atmospheric pressure more likely and more destructive the storms are becoming more frequent and severe because the arctic is warming faster than the rest of the globe polar warming has been associated with the loss of snow and ice this also makes the jet stream more wavy allowing cold air to plunge southward these polar vortex events often result in extreme winter weather especially in the northeastern us the hill article notes two more ways that global warming is making east coast winter storms more dangerous first because the atmosphere is warmer it can hold and release moisture faster than previously the second factor is rising sea levels dr overpeck writes sea level rise has been non stop over the last century due to global warming and this serves to amplify coastal flooding due to storm surges as the climate continues to warm we can expect to see even more extreme winter storms but with time they won t all be snowstorms as temperatures rise major winter storms will shift to producing mixed snow and rain freezing rain or simply intense rain creating a different range of hazards particularly more extensive flooding this increasingly severe winter weather will have devastating economic impacts with property damage business closures lost wages and of course shipping and supply chain challenges although it is virtually undetectable on an annual basis us sea level rise is getting worse according to the national oceanic and atmospheric association noaa via reuters the seas lapping us coasts are expected to rise at a faster pace than in the past 100 years a one foot rise by 2050 threatens coastal cities including new york boston and miami the multi agency report says the inundation will lead to more coastal flooding and make tidal and storm surges more severe with nearly 8 million homes at a reconstruction cost of 1 9 trillion at risk among the other findings sea levels in manhattan could rise by two feet as early as 2055 rising waters are threatening coastal cities including new york boston and miami which already commonly experience flooding during high tides high tide flooding has more than doubled in new york since 2000 and now occurs 10 to 15 times a year the science behind it as for why western north america is trapped in a decade plus long drought while the east coast is prone to hurricanes bomb cyclones flooding and sea level rise the answer just might be found in an environmental defense fund blog post written in 2014 unsurprisingly it has to do with rising temperatures according to the piece by edf climate scientist ilissa ocko in the northeastern us the combination of more moisture in the atmosphere due to warming and changes in circulation patterns are bringing more rain in the southwest of the country rainfall is suppressed by a northward expansion of high pressure in the sub tropics the crippling drought now plaguing california is due to a persistent high pressure system off of the coast that is deflecting storms away from the region rains are also more intense in a warmer atmosphere where there is more evaporation going on the third factor has to do with soil moisture the higher the moisture content the more runoff there will be from rainfall because soil moisture is increasing in the northeast flooding events are on the rise this is made worse by rising sea levels which have moved higher by about a foot since the 1900s however in the us southwest ocko writes the drop in overall precipitation brings drier conditions that spawn or magnify drought as the soil there dries out the incoming sunlight will heat the ground instead of evaporating water from the soil this creates a vicious cycle of more heat and less rain droughts floods and food droughts are impacting food production in canada and the united states lowering crop yields and causing ranchers to cull part of their herds stubbornly high natural gas prices are being reflected in record high fertilizer prices other farm inputs like feed and barley are going through the roof a 2017 research paper found that each degree celsius increase would on average reduce global yields of wheat by 6 rice by 3 2 maize by 7 4 and soybeans by 3 1 these foods provide two thirds of human caloric intake a new study showed more than a fifth of global food output growth has been lost to climate change since the 1960s putting an estimated 34 million people on the brink of famine according to bnn bloomberg heat related drops in crop yields affecting the supply of food could be with us for decades atmospheric river floods in southern bc last november killed thousands of cows pigs chickens and bees not to mention fouling supply lines already stretched thin because of covid 19 they showed that without smooth road and rail access to key markets delays and goods shortages are inevitable availability of fresh water is also becoming a growing concern fresh water aquifers are one of the most important natural resources in the world but in recent decades the rate at which we re pumping them dry has more than doubled of the world s major aquifers 21 out of 37 are receding in north america the major concern is over water levels in the ogallala aquifer under the us great plains the ogallala is the world s largest known aquifer with an approximate area of 450 600 square kilometers it stretches from southern south dakota through parts of nebraska wyoming colorado kansas oklahoma new mexico and northern texas the ogallala aquifer was formed roughly 10 million years ago when water flowed onto the plains from retreating glaciers and streams of the rocky mountains the ogallala is no longer being recharged by the rockies and precipitation in the region is only 30 60 cm per year in three leading grain producing states texas oklahoma and kansas the underground water table has dropped by more than 30 meters much of the reason for declining groundwater is due to over use for example the ogallala aquifer is being sucked dry at an annual volume equivalent to 18 colorado rivers streams rivers and lakes are almost always closely connected with an aquifer the depletion of aquifers doesn t allow these surface waters to be recharged lower water levels in aquifers are reflected in reduced amounts of water flowing at the surface this is happening along the atlantic coastal plain groundwater depletion is also responsible for the yellow river in china not reaching the ocean for months at a time the failure of the colorado river in the us and the indus river in pakistan failing to reach the ocean every day last summer the federal government declared a water shortage on the colorado for the first time triggering mandatory water consumption cuts lake mead the largest reservoir in the us last august hit its lowest level since it was filled in the 1930s lake powell also fed by the colorado river also hit a record low and last summer was just 32 full if too much groundwater is pumped out from coastal aquifers saltwater may flow into them causing contamination of the aquifer many coastal aquifers the biscayne aquifer near miami and the new jersey coastal plain aquifer for example have problems with saltwater intrusion saltwater intrusion is also caused by rising sea levels caused by melting ice the warming of the earth s surface has caused a widespread retreat of the glaciers at both poles according to nasa greenland and antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass with greenland losing an average 269 billion tons per year between 1993 and 2019 and antarctica losing about 148 billion tons a year in florida the ocean is already starting to seep into swamp land which weakens the plants from their peat bedding when we start to lose the structure of the plants essentially this peat which is otherwise held together by roots becomes a soupy pond explains a university of florida researcher in an npr article millions of people in south florida get their fresh water from the biscayne aquifer in the everglades the problem is also occurring in china the philippines and australia salt water from the bay of bangladesh has penetrated over 100 kilometers inland due to sea levels rising higher than elsewhere thereby increasing the risk of water contamination and hypertension caused by drinking high salinity water high river and soil salinity in bangladesh is also predicted to reduce rice crop yields affect the productivity of fisheries crack road surfaces and increase poverty conclusion the impacts of droughts and floods climate change and covid 19 are all being passed up the food supply chain to the consumer who is seeing double digit inflation in some products such as meat the invasion of ukraine by russia a major oil and gas producer and the world s largest exporter of wheat is adding to higher grocery bills as extreme weather continues to hit us from both sides of the continent we best get used to it climate change has a major impact on agricultural commodities that are affected by droughts and flooding paraguay was hit by a drought late last year that has badly damaged crop yields and caused navigation problems in the paraguay panama waterway pushing up the costs of transporting grains for export neighboring argentina the world s top exporter of processed soy is also facing the risk of drought diminishing soy and corn harvests dry conditions often cause forest fires that can ruin crops and kill livestock flooding and saltwater intrusion are also threats to farming especially in coastal areas vulnerable to rising sea levels the latest projections by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa have have levels increasing by a foot by 2050 threatening to inundate cities including miami and new york last fall s atmospheric rivers in southern british columbia caused nearly half a billion dollars in flood damage to one of the province s most important regions for fruits vegetables eggs and dairy products the b c agriculture council says the freak weather events will cost farmrs millions of dollars the b c dairy association estimates 500 cattle died from fraser valley flooding higher food energy and housing prices tie into a growing crisis of affordability wages haven t kept up with historically high inflation two in three americans currently live paycheck to paycheck unable to save or invest their earnings the us federal reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates the last time the fed tried to raise rates it only got to 2 5 before it crashed the stock market and rates began falling again higher us treasury yields are already throttling the us economy and growth is set to slow sharply this year zero hedge reports rising rates are causing lending standards to tighten and banks are becoming less willing to extend consumer loans consumption will face growing headwinds as credit is squeezed remember the american consumer makes up nearly 70 of us gdp if consumer spending slows it will definitely put a damper on economic growth the war in ukraine and western sanctions against russia are driving up the costs of energy and agricultural metal commodities the conflict threatens to raise the costs of transporting and manufacturing a range of goods while further disrupting global shipping networks all of this has complicated the fed s efforts to tame inflation through a series of rate hikes this year and next the wall street journal says the inflation threat for the fed is two fold the first risk is that the surge in prices could become intense enough or last long enough to change consumers and businesses inflation psychology making those expectations self fulling if workers anticipate a robust inflation rate in a year s time they will be more likely to push for higher wages now the second risk is that a tight labor market with demand for workers far outstripping the supply generates wage growth that keeps inflation above the fed s 2 target those two forces threaten to ignite an inflationary spiral where workers face higher prices and demand more pay leading businesses to continue raising prices i see the war in ukraine covid supply chain interruptions inflation and climate change coalescing into a perfect storm of unaffordability that could eventually erupt into mass social unrest when people can t afford the basic necessities of life and prices keep rising to quote karl marx proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains they

from the grain of facts and narrative truth but are they the guardians of truth and accountability as they claim or are they the enforcers of the reigning political narrative are they the arbiters of consensus science an oxymoron that allegedly encompasses truths about climate change or the covid pandemic are they the stalwarts of partisan politics purveyors themselves of fakery and hype that they claim to combat in american society beset by the culture wars and an increasing politicization of life at all levels it may not come as a surprise that we are witnessing the downward spiral of the fact checking profession that is primarily run by politically engaged reporters not expert specialists in the subjects they assess by any sense of the imagination covid 19 pandemic some very basic questions over two years into the pandemic some of the most basic questions remain contentious and even questions of data integrity remain mired in controversy are covid deaths over reported since many may have died with covid rather than of covid did lockdowns and masks make any discernible difference to public health are there viable early treatments for the disease available or are vaccines approved under emergency use authorization by the u s food and drug administration fda the only way to go are covid vaccines safe and effective to each of these questions the overwhelming majority of the fact checking sites or fact checking departments of the legacy media support the reigning narrative articulated by big pharmaceutical companies government agencies such as the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the fda and key government officials such as dr anthony fauci the biden administration welcomes this and goes further in calling social media companies such as facebook to partner with the white house to fight misinformation about covid 19 experts with impeccable credentials who do not subscribe to the reigning covid narrative are typically marginalized or cancelled outright from the media by its fact checking gatekeepers there are many such examples here and here but perhaps the most reported recent case relates to three distinguished authors of the great barrington declaration dr martin kulldorff professor of medicine at harvard university a biostatistician and epidemiologist dr sunetra gupta professor at oxford university an epidemiologist and dr jay bhattacharya professor at stanford university medical school epidemiologist and health economist from emails obtained through the freedom of information act by the american institute for economic research it became apparent that the u s government s two top public health officials anthony fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious disease and francis collins the then director of the national institutes of health had no intentions to communicate or publicly debate with the authors of the declaration instead as an editorial opinion of a major newspaper put it the two sainted public health officials schemed to quash dissenting views in what would seem to be a shocking statement by a government official whose mantra is follow the science dr collins wrote in an email this proposal from the three fringe epidemiologists seems to be getting a lot of attention and even a co signature from nobel prize winner mike leavitt at stanford there needs to be a quick and devastating published take down of its premises is it underway calling three highly published experts from the world s leading universities fringe epidemiologists is more a reflection of the accuser than the accused collins then spoke with the washington post and charged that the declaration is not mainstream science its dangerous according to the emails dr fauci who argues that his detractors are anti science because in his words i represent science replied that the takedown was underway in an article by wired a tech magazine the author of the article is senior writer climate for the magazine with an oxford university degree in the english language and literature climate change a decades old debate like the media coverage of covid 19 climate change headlines in the mainstream media for the past three decades have been overwhelmingly one sided the basic premise is that the science is settled as in a tweet by then u s president barack obama in 2013 ninety seven percent of scientists agree climate change is real man made and dangerous with the obvious subtext who are you to challenge this and as in the covid 19 context the marginalization of climate sceptics has a long track record two examples suffice how fact checks and editorializing serve to ensure that sceptics need not apply for access to the wider public the first relates to the london based bbc fondly known as beebs for its authoritative news broadcasts around the world as it emerged from the ashes of world war ii the british media giant was known and praised not only for its balanced news features but also for its nature documentaries and in this space two celebrities with the same first name david bellamy and david attenborough emerged in the 1970s directing fascinating tv programs on nature and the environment from every corner of the globe into tens of millions of homes as british commentator james dellingpole wrote in his eulogy to bellamy who died in 2019 both were superstars both were well on their way to becoming national treasures yet while one attenborough basks in the glow of international fame and is invited to many of the climate conferences as star speaker and delegate the other claimed he had become a pariah as soon as he rejected group think on global warming describing climate change as poppycock though his climate scepticism killed his media career he remained utterly unrepentant the bbc itself has made it clear to its staff that it will not invite climate sceptics to its interviews and panel discussions to balance debates because the science is settled more recently fact checkers have been busy at their craft with yet another outlier prominent physicist steven koonin previously under secretary for science under the obama administration provost of caltech and chief scientist of bp he published a book titled unsettled what climate science tells us what it doesn t and why it matters in 2021 which argued against the prevailing climate alarmist narrative prior to its release the wall street journal wsj published a review of the book and this was followed shortly by a fact check by a site called climate feedback on its website climate feedback describes itself as a worldwide network of scientists sorting fact from fiction in climate change media coverage our goal is to help readers know which news to trust this fact check was cited by facebook in discrediting the wsj review and the book itself in all user posts which linked to the book review this was then followed by an editorial by the wsj which pointed out that while disagreement with the book s author is par for the course as all science progresses with disputation calling such disagreement a fact check was a false claim dr koonin himself then provided a rebuttal in the wsj factchecks are just mainstream opinions without getting into details about the claims of the so called factchecker the key point here is to note the perversions of truth in representing the arguments critiqued in such fact checks perhaps this is best revealed by the fact that facebook argued in its legal defence that its cited fact check was just opinion when faced by a lawsuit brought by celebrated journalist john stossel who had posted two climate change videos readers and viewers beware of this peculiar twist to the caveat emptor clause the fact checks used by the mainstream news outlets and social media to police what you read and watch are just opinions full disclosure this contributor also published a review of steven koonin s book

u s lawmakers are investigating whether the chinese government is attempting to control one of america s beacons of free market capitalism forbes global media holdings republicans on the house permanent select committee on intelligence began investigating the issue late last year according to government documents obtained by the washington times forbes global media holdings denies the intelligence committee has singled it out a spokesman for the company told the times that any suggestion of chinese government influence over forbes operations is completely unfounded some committee republicans grew concerned last year over the prospect of such influence as executives at the new jersey based publisher of forbes magazine worked on a deal with a china based special acquisition firm or spac that company magnum opus acquisition ltd reportedly received funding from an entity run by the chinese communist party in a nov 23 letter to forbes ceo mike federle republicans on the intelligence committee asked the company to assist in an investigation related to china s malign influence activities against u s corporations it is essential for you to be informed of any malign influence efforts related to your company and how such efforts impact american economic and security interests rep devin nunes california republican wrote in the letter a copy of which was obtained by the times mr nunes the intelligence committee s ranking republican at the time has since retired from congress a committee source who confirmed the authenticity of the letter told the times that the investigation is continuing under rep michael turner of ohio the current ranking republican the november letter and a lengthy response that forbes global media holdings provided to the committee in december have not previously been reported an examination of documents by the times gave no indication that the securities and exchange commission which is reviewing the proposed magnum opus deal with forbes has been formally notified about the intelligence committee investigation under the 630 million deal which forbes announced in august the iconic business media brand would transition into a publicly traded company on the new york stock exchange as part of a merger with the hong kong based magnum opus see also china competition bill set to advance to final negotiations in congress after months of delays spacs which have been in vogue on wall street are companies that have no operations of their own but are formed to raise money through initial public offerings expressly for the purpose of buying or merging with existing companies magnum opus is identified as a spac that received some of its initial financing from the chinese government according to sec filings china s sovereign wealth fund china investment corp provided institutional seed money for the company a march 2021 sec filing described china investment corp as a wholly state owned company incorporated under the laws of the people s republic of china with total assets worth more than 1 trillion china investment corp is one of the world s largest sovereign wealth funds some in the national security community question whether the entity is a conduit through which the ruling communist party seeks to wield influence over chinese financial firms investing in public and private companies around the globe such influence appears to be increasing in hong kong china s ruling communists in recent years have imposed political crackdowns and harsh media restrictions on the formerly autonomous pro democracy city state sec filings show that china investment corp owned a roughly 5 8 stake in magnum opus when the deal with forbes global media holdings was announced although the filings also show that china investment corp has since disposed of its shares reports maintain that magnum opus has since raised funding for the forbes deal from more than a dozen other investors dailymail com reported last month that magnum opus had raised 400 million for the deal from 19 investors most of whom are based in hong kong or elsewhere in china the prize of forbes forbes has an average of nearly 115 million monthly users of its various internet platforms and publishes a printed magazine with an audience of at least 6 million the magazine is known for its promotion of free market capitalism its ad campaigns for many years jokingly described the publication as a capitalist tool the publication was founded more than a century ago by scottish immigrant newspaperman b c forbes it is perhaps best known today for its pro capitalist rankings such as the 30 under 30 list of richest young americans steve forbes a grandson of the company s founder and a former republican presidential contender is listed as the editor in chief of forbes media on the website of forbes magazine randall lane is listed as the chief content officer mr forbes did not respond to a request for comment for this article forbes global media holdings announced the pending magnum opus deal on the magazine s website in august as a transaction that will enable forbes to further capitalize on its successful digital transformation using technology and data driven insights to create more deeply engaged audiences and associated high quality and recurring revenue streams others have questioned the transaction this deal raises serious and grave concerns about forbes which is truly the mouthpiece of democracy and capitalism and is effectively being taken over by the chinese a senior source at forbes told dailymail com last month forbes chief communications officer bill hankes sharply disputed that sentiment when the times asked for comment forbes is and always will be fiercely independent and any suggestion that the chinese or any other government would have any influence is completely unfounded said mr hankes who also dismissed the view that republicans on the house intelligence committee have targeted forbes for investigation mr nunes november letter was merely a general inquiry mr hanks said in an email to the times and forbes global media holdings has had no correspondence with the committee since it responded to the letter in december in announcing the magnum opus deal forbes global media holdings said the entire management team of forbes would run the company concern about chinese influence over forbes began as far back as 2014 when a hong kong based investment group called integrated whale media investments bought a majority stake in forbes a december 2017 op ed in the washington post by china expert and author isaac stone fish said the purchase was followed by several instances of editorial meddling on stories involving china mr fish pointed specifically to forbes decision that year to discontinue publishing articles by communist party critic gordon chang mr fish also noted the case of former forbes contributor anders corr who said a forbes editor emailed him in 2016 saying it was not accurate to say china impoverishes its people or to label xi jinping a dictator intelligence committee probe the accusations of influence at forbes have factored into the house republicans investigation into the publication s dealings with chinese companies mr nunes raised the issue specifically in his nov 23 letter which included more than two dozen questions about forbes policies for protecting against chinese government influence since the 2014 purchase of forbes by integrated whale media there have been accusations of censorship against china critical narratives and retaliation against employees who produce them mr nunes wrote have you investigated these accusations on dec 16 forbes legal team at holland knight responded to the intelligence committee by saying such accusations have been investigated and are not based in fact according to a copy of the document obtained by the times the response marked confidential says forbes decided to phase out its opinion channel to focus more on fact based policy reporting in 2017 it said a contributor named gordon chang was cut as part of this process it also said forbes removed a post by mr corr in 2017 because it was poorly executed and that his term as a contributor ended due to a history of reporting that did not meet forbes standards mr hankes the chief communications officer at forbes told the times that the magazine continues to publish articles critical of china that are readily available online he pointed to the example of a forbes article in january that highlighted abuses of press freedom in china the article focused on a list of abuses presented by the one free press coalition ahead of the winter olympics in china topping the list was the case of hong kong media entrepreneur and democracy advocate jimmy lai chee ying who was arrested and jailed as part of a chinese crackdown on political and media freedoms in hong kong in addition to questions about forbes articles on china the nunes letter sought information about whether anyone from forbes had interacted with chinese government officials most notably from the state council in beijing the council oversees china investment corp which provided initial funding for magnum opus has anyone from forbes ever had a meeting with anyone from the chinese state council information office if so who and what was the context mr nunes asked forbes responded through holland knight s letter that to the best of the company s knowledge no person at forbes has met with anyone from the chinese state council information office a source familiar with the correspondence said it has been shared with the treasury department s committee on foreign investment in the united states a multiagency executive branch investigative arm that examines foreign entities takeovers or purchases of u s companies for national security questions the treasury committee did not respond to a request for comment from the times the sec declined to comment although sec chairman gary gensler recently raised concern about chinese companies trading in u s capital markets in general mr gensler suggested in a september op ed published by the wall street journal that his primary concern is less about chinese government influence than a potential lack of transparency in chinese companies that engage in deals with u s companies and investors i don t believe china related companies currently are providing adequate information about the risks they face and thus the risks that american investors in these businesses face mr gensler wrote he added that many chinese companies establish contractual relationships with shell companies in foreign jurisdictions like the cayman islands which in turn raise capital on u s stock exchanges without actually confer ownership of the operating company to american investors i worry that some investors don t realize they re putting their money into a cayman shell rather than a company operating in china he wrote whether the sec approves the magnum opus deal with forbes remains to be seen filings indicate that a late march deadline for magnum opus to complete the acquisition and take forbes public could be extended if the sec has not approved the deal by then magnum opus did not respond to a request for comment joseph clark contributed to this report guy taylor can be

washington d c in an open letter delivered to the white house last week the ceos of major u s airlines urged president biden to drop his outdated federal mask mandate for those flying on airplanes as well as for inside airports the letter was signed by the ceos of alaska air american airlines atlas air worldwide aviation fedex express hawaiian airlines delta air lines jetblue airways southwest airlines united airlines ups airlines and airlines for america the ceo s called upon biden to end the federal mask mandate after it expires on 18th april as well as covid 19 testing requirements for incoming international travelers stating now is the time for the administration to sunset federal transportation travel restrictions while other countries such as the uk and france no longer imposes testing on vaccinated travelers the u s still requires incoming international travelers to show proof of a negative covid test before boarding their flights the ceos said they had supported and cooperated with the federal government s measures throughout the pandemic but the burden to enforce the now outdated regulations fell on their employees it is critical to recognize that the burden of enforcing both the mask and pre departure testing requirements has fallen on our employees for two years now this is not a function they are trained to perform and subjects them to daily challenges by frustrated customers this in turn takes a toll on their own well being the letter added the ceos also said that since the measures were introduced early in the pandemic the situation has changed considerably stressing they no longer make sense in the current public health context the persistent and steady decline of hospitalization and death rates are the most compelling indicators that our country is well protected against severe disease from covid 19 the letter noted given that we have entered a different phase of dealing with this virus we strongly support your view that covid 19 need no longer control our lives we are encouraged by the current data and the lifting of covid 19 restrictions from coast to coast which indicate it is past time to eliminate covid era transportation policies the ceos added the white house has yet to comment about the letter

by david shepardson washington reuters the u s national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa on sunday reinstated a sharp increase in penalties for automakers whose vehicles do not meet fuel efficiency requirements for model years 2019 and beyond the decision was a win for tesla nasdaq that could cost other automakers hundreds of millions of dollars or more confirming an earlier report by reuters nhtsa said the decision increases the accountability of manufacturers for violating the nation s fuel economy standards and the penalty increase incentivizes manufacturers to make fuel economy improvements president donald trump s administration in its final days in january 2021 delayed a 2016 regulation that more than doubled penalties for automakers failing to meet corporate average fuel economy cafe requirements starting in the 2019 model year nhtsa s final rule which takes effect 60 days after it is published reinstated the higher penalties and boosted them further for the 2022 model year the agency has not collected penalties for 2019 to 2021 model years while the issue was under review and is the subject of court challenges the final rule was signed on thursday by nhtsa s top official steven cliff ahead of its formal publication for the 2019 to 2021 model years the fine is 14 up from 5 50 for every 0 1 mile per gallon new vehicles fall short of required fuel economy standards multiplied by the number of noncomplying vehicles sold for the 2022 model year this rises to 15 automakers protested the penalty hike in 2016 warning it could raise industry costs by at least 1 billion annually the decision is expected to cost chrysler parent stellantis for instance as much as 572 million by the company s prior estimates while boosting the value of compliance credits sold by tesla automakers whose vehicles achieve higher fuel economy than required can sell credits to automakers that do not meet cafe rules under president barack obama the higher penalties were set to start with the 2019 model year but the trump administration set the effective date as the 2022 model year following a court decision nhtsa estimated that for the 2019 model year automakers would owe 294 million at the new rate up from 115 4 million under the prior rate nhtsa added automakers that made plans for 2019 through 2021 thinking that penalties would not increase did so at their own risk the head of a trade group representing nearly all major automakers except tesla said sunday it would be a better outcome if the penalties were invested in electric vehicles batteries and charging infrastructure instead of disappearing into the general fund of the treasury in august nhtsa proposed hiking cafe requirements by 8 annually for 2024 through 2026 reversing a trump era regulation that rolled back higher requirements starting in the 2021 model year nhtsa is expected to issue its final cafe rules through 2026 this week on sunday stellantis said it would like to work with the administration and congress to allow the agencies to use the proceeds from penalties to bolster investments in the technologies and infrastructure required to accelerate a robust u s market for evs tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment congress in 2015 ordered federal agencies to adjust civil penalties to account for inflation u s fuel economy fines lost 75 of their original value having risen only once since 1975 from 5 to 5 50 in 1997

singapore japan s sovereign credit rating could fall one to three notches in the coming decade if the government does not implement a credible fiscal consolidation plan this risk which the asean 3 macroeconomic research office highlighted in its recent annual consultation report on the country underlines the challenges facing japanese policymakers at a time of mounting global economic turmoil even before the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic japan was struggling to maintain fiscal discipline in order to contain its government debt which was and remains the highest in the world as a percentage of gdp but the government s strong efforts combined with sustained economic recovery following the global financial crisis reduced the fiscal deficit from 8 7 per cent of gdp in 2009 to 3 1 per cent of gdp in 2019 as a result japan s government debt plateaued at around 230 per cent of gdp from 2015 19 after rising continuously for about a decade in comparison government debt in the united states and the eurozone in 2019 stood at about 107 per cent of gdp and 84 per cent of gdp respectively the covid 19 pandemic stalled the government s debt control efforts by forcing it to roll out massive stimulus packages in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to mitigate the economic fallout and fund public health measures for fy2022 which starts on april 1 the government has proposed a record initial budget of 107 6 trillion 892 billion implying that the fiscal deficit will remain substantial at about 6 per cent of gdp despite japan s large public debt the country s credit rating remains strong at a or a this could be mainly because ratings agencies recognise the strength of japan s institutions its advanced economic development and high per capita income exceptionally strong external position large domestic investor base and full access to capital markets these factors have partly mitigated japan s economic weaknesses including its high debt to gdp ratio sustained fiscal deficits and limited growth prospects although the country s rating outlook worsened in 2020 when the pandemic began to gauge japan s long term fiscal prospects and their implications for the country s sovereign rating we created three scenarios reform baseline and adverse with different assumptions regarding key macroeconomic and financial variables through fy2030 a pivotal consideration in our scenarios is the economic fallout from the covid 19 crisis which may temporarily or permanently reduce japan s long term growth potential depending on the duration of the crisis and degree of policy support all three scenarios project that japan will continue to run fiscal deficits after the pandemic mainly because of ballooning social security expenditure the country s unfavourable demographic profile has led to a steady increase in government spending to fill the growing gap between social security benefits and contributions and this structural mismatch will continue to weigh on public finances under the baseline and adverse scenarios government debt is projected to increase to more than 280 per cent of gdp by fy2030 but the reform scenario envisages that the debt to gdp ratio will peak at 258 per cent in fy2021 and then decline to 236 per cent by fy2030 our model projects that under the baseline scenario japan s sovereign rating will fall two notches to a by fy2024 because of slower growth momentum and rising government debt the reform scenario on the other hand suggests only a one notch downgrade to a during the next decade mainly owing to the lagged impact of debt accumulation during the pandemic finally under the adverse scenario we forecast that much slower growth and faster debt accumulation will cause japan s sovereign rating to decline by three notches to bbb that said credit ratings agencies may follow past practices and attach a positive bias to japan s sovereign rating if the country maintains its traditional economic strengths moreover if the bank of japan maintains its ultra loose monetary policy even a drastic rating downgrade may not significantly increase the interest rates on japanese government bonds nevertheless sovereign downgrades could result in lower credit ratings and higher foreign currency funding costs for japanese private firms as well as further reduction of foreign holdings of japanese sovereign debt our rating analysis highlights the need for the japanese government to get fiscal consolidation back on track and boost the country s long term growth potential through structural reforms including accelerated efforts to promote digitalisation and the green economy to help limit any further increases in the debt to gdp ratio and ensure long term fiscal sustainability the japanese authorities could consider setting up an independent institution with a mandate to monitor fiscal policy and performance the country s medium term fiscal consolidation plan should emphasise containing social security expenditure while increasing tax revenues after the pandemic all this would help to reduce the risk of future sovereign downgrades the covid 19 pandemic and now russia s invasion of ukraine have greatly increased the risks to the global economy the task for japanese policymakers is to navigate these challenges while keeping their own country s fiscal house in order jinho choi is deputy group

by limache chile howard richards first premise there is nothing new about poverty what is new is that we now have the techniques and the resources to get rid of poverty the real question is whether we have the will martin luther king jr second premise i regard any considerable increase in human happiness unaccompanied by changes in the state of desires as hopeless john stuart mill my general idea is simple we should all be working together to make sure everyone s needs are met if not one way then some other way nonetheless this unbounded realistic ethical approach is so different from orthodoxy that when you try to fit any of the proposals below into the framework of now standard rationality the common sense of an economic society pareto optimality maximizing the bottom line the requirements of sustained growth etc you will find that my proposals require rethinking thinking we are in a civilizational crisis because we are dominated by irrational rationalities that paralyze our ability to use existing and in the pipeline techniques and resources to welcome every sister and every brother into what dr king called the human family living in a world house i will sketch an unbounded critical realist ethicalopen ended and always subject to revision plan to end poverty be warned however that it does not fit the bogus economic logic that currently defines what is accepted as making sense in policy making circles unbounded ethics calls for a long critical process separating the wheat from the chaff in currently dominant thinking and in currently widespread emotions as mill intimates in the quote above without changes of heart without healthy desires curing the current epidemics of rage fear and sick desires no improvements in logic or in science will save us don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free a beginning point for my plan is to focus on converting free riders i refer to people who possess surpluses they could share with the poor who are happy to benefit from the social peace the lower rates of crime and disease and all the other benefits the non poor derive from the absence of poverty see the studies by wilkinson and pickett that document the benefits the non poor derive from living in more equal societies but the free riders do not contribute to paying for ending poverty free riders often stash money they do not really need in secret trusts in tax havens instead of using the same money to buy food and subsidize child care for the single mom across town struggling to survive balancing caring for her kids with working twenty hours a week at mcdonalds karl marx and milton friedman speaking from different perspectives argue that the free riders will inevitably dominate the prosperous people who care and share the essence of their arguments is that businesses like google and donors like bill and melinda gates who donate large sums to poverty alleviation will inevitably be driven to the wall by free riding competitors like apple some free riders accumulate enormous stashes of cash skillfully protected from taxation they are positioned to drive their nice guy competitors out of business as marx puts it whatever higher ethical level individual capitalists may subjectively achieve they are prisoners of objective social relations beyond their control given today s huge surge in philanthropic giving and given that a substantial portion of the corporate shares traded on stock exchanges is held by non profits whose income flows serve one or another aspect of the common good there must be something wrong or something inapplicable to today s realities in the abstract reasoning of marx and friedman the free riders intimidate the givers prudent givers are trying to follow cicero s advice to be generous although not so generous that they impoverish themselves to the point where they are no longer are able to generate surplus to share they are naturally intimidated by the fear of being gobbled up by less idealistic competitors aplan to help the free riders to see the light and to cooperate for the common good is a giant step toward encouraging more sharing by prudent givers who are already motivated to share the point marx and friedman make is while not the whole truth not to be dismissed as friedman put it anybody in business who does not concentrate single mindedly on maximizing profit and accumulating reserves to fight off future challenges from future competitors will not be in business for long friedman is not entirely wrong savage capitalism to a large extent in the form of the british empire later followed by the american empire came to dominate the earth largely by accumulating wealth far beyond the money cost of enabling the owners of wealth to climb the lower rungs of maslow s hierarchy of needs and graduate to pursuing higher needs for meaningful self realization accumulated wealth made it possible to accumulate military power military power made it possible to accumulate more wealth and so on one might draw from history the conclusion that savage capitalism or savage any ism has an inherent tendency to win while peace and love have an inherent tendency to lose ending poverty would remove a major obstacle to ending crime racism sexism massive drug addiction and drug gang turf wars it woulddeflate bogus anti ecological arguments alleging that the human population must continue to multiply beyond the carrying capacity of the earth in order to stimulate economic growth and to have enough young people working to pay the pensions of retired old people despite the historical tendency of accumulators to win and sharers to lose today ending poverty is not hard to achieve today is not yesterday being aware of the inherent historical advantage of the free riding accumulators we can take steps to neutralize their advantage as advocated above we are at a point in history where the accumulators have won the class struggle not because they are so smart or so strong but because the dominant social structures require regimes of accumulation that make investment profitable having won through no merit of their own warren buffet s classfinds itself in a world nobody wants to live in it is a world nobody can live in much longer because it is unsustainable ending poverty would benefit everyone it would be relatively inexpensive it would open paths to sustainability rethinking thinking is needed to see why ending poverty is feasible funding is feasible the amount of funds required counting both enhanced private sector and substantial public sector contributions and adding crowdfunding among the many millions who are already not poor and then adding approaches like abcd mentioned below that mobilize resources the poor already have adds up to doable don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free given funding meaningful work that leads to dignity and self discipline is not hard to find dr king suggested that any number of people could be employed caring for the young the old and the sick any number of people could also be employed greening the planet the ocean will not pay you for cleaning up the plastic that is poisoning it but work with dignity can be organized to clean the ocean the same can be said for reforestation and any number of essential tasks that are now neglected we should also include funding the arts and sciences and any activity that develops intrinsically valuable human talents meeting human needs is not expensive admittedly the magic word need is just a good place to start conversations about how to allocate time talents and treasure an appeal to needs is not a cookie cutter shortcut to specifying objectives and drafting budgets without oversimplifying we can rely on the general principle that meeting human material needs so people can move on to satisfying emotional and spiritual needs is comparativelyinexpensive compared to other ways to spend the same money wars are expensive persuading big investors to invest in markets already well supplied with quality goods at affordable prices produced by firms that got there first and already occupy all known profitableniches is expensive creating good jobs by enticing big investors typically requires government subsidies tax breaks public spending on security infrastructure and skills training public private partnerships where the public takes most of the risk and the private investors get most of the profits as in the case of the santiago metro and so on paying interest on astronomical unpayable debts is expensive creating employment at good wages to be paid from funds generated by projected future sales is expensive see the world bank statistics on how much money must be invested up front to create a good traditional job ending poverty intelligently at an affordable cost often begins by mobilizing the resources poor people already have as in the abcd asset based community development approach that barack and michelle obama were trained to apply community development is mainly about dignity it is mainly about building positive human relationships amid the massive trauma induced emotional wreckage that is mass produced by today s dysfunctional societies however it requires money too it requires steady flows of money from property income from haves to have nots it is a great illusion to think all the poor can become mini entrepreneursusing subsidies to get started and thereafter be self supporting selling merchandise to willing buyers an ethical shift is required a shift to caring and sharing a shift to mission driven vocations of service the resources already exist the freetime the expertise for example doctors without borders and the material resources it is a simple matter of working together to make sure everyone s needs are met if not one way then some other way the money required to end poverty is dwarfed by the trillions traded every day in the global casino of speculative investments it is dwarfed by the trillions devoted to fire fire refers to finance insurance and real estate the re parts speculative real estate investments arenormally counter productive they drive up the cost of buying a house they drive up the cost of renting many people end up sleeping on the sidewalk or in the back seats of their cars while others work overtime at low paying jobs just to pay the rent don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free ending poverty is not expensive but it requires curbing speculation that drives up prices without serving any ethically valid purpose big ticket items like hernia operations and cancer treatments are best handled by single payer health care funded by nation states that do not have to depend exclusively on taxes for income a nation state dependent on taxes for income is what joseph schumpeter called a tax state ein steuerstaat schumpeter correctly predicted in 1918 that tax states attempting to be welfare states would be unsustainable an example of a nation state that is a sustainable welfare state and not a tax state is norway its government can count on the backstop of publicly owned north sea oilthat makes possible an enormousdiversified sovereign wealth fund the norwegians are aware thatwhile their model solves the problem of the high cost of hernia operations and cancer treatments it does not solve the problem of ending dependence on fossil fuels the rethinking of thinking that can end poverty welcomes what shiv visvanathan calls the defeated epistemologies they are the epistemologies that were demoted to being cultures as opposed to civilization when the weapons possessed by the indigenous peoples of america africa and asia proved to be no match for european fire power rethinking thinking must forget the civilized european doctrine of john locke that a person is entitled to all and only the value of what the person produces locke s notion of entitlement was the starting point for adam smith s theory of the natural level of wages andfor david ricardo s more mathematical doctrine that the supply of labour a

suddenly find themselves wrapped up in one when a grisly death occurs inside their exclusive upper west side apartment building the trio suspects murder and employs their precise knowledge of true crime to investigate the truth as they record a podcast of their own to document the case the three unravel the complex secrets of the building which stretch back years perhaps even more explosive are the lies they tell one another soon the endangered trio comes to realise a killer might be living amongst them as they race to decipher the mounting clues before it s too late what do we know about

mora selena gomez solved the mystery of tim kono s murder they wound up as the prime suspects of another murder right after advertisement bunny the grumpy building manager who tried to get our beloved podcasters evicted wound up dead at the end of the season 1 finale of only murders in the building and seeing as charles oliver and mabel were found with her body things don t look great season 2 of only murders in the building will likely explore the case of bunny s death and our podcasters involvement we can assume this will be bad news for mabel in particular as she was caught covered in blood with her knitting needle in bunny s chest after telling the building manager she was the most hated person in the building cinda canning tina fey will also presumably be a central character in season 2 as she will be running her new podcast only murderers in the building in the background co creator and executive producer john hoffman said of the season 2 confirmation that everyone in our amazing building worked with such love and expertise through extraordinary times and with incredible support from disney hulu and 20th tv to create a first season that might live up to our legendary cast our beloved new york city and to make a show about connection to feel we ve connected with our audience and hit the mark enough already to have the chance to continue and to carry on our show s wild ride of mystery comedy empathy is too exciting for words so i ll shut up now and just say a huge thanks to all and i can t wait for more hoffman also mentioned in an interview with queerty that season 2 will take a closer look at oliver s relationship with his family most recently we ve been treated to a season synopsis from disney here s what it says following the shocking death of arconia board

why you will see them again they are coming back season 2 is bigger and better than ever the remainder of the cast hasn t been officially announced yet but drawing from the close of season 1 we can assume season 2 of only murders in the building will see aaron dominguez oscar or tie dye tina fey and da vine joy randolph detective williams return also who knows though we know from season 1 that dead characters have a pretty prominent role in the show so we may see more familiar faces still in addition to that we know that cara delevingne suicide squad has been cast in season 2 of only murders in the building as variety reports delevingne will take on the role of alice who comes from the art world and gets wrapped up in this murder business apparently it s also been reported that

parents these days in busy bee toys a sea of several other brown beige peach and tan faced boy and girl dolls keep those barbies company it s not by accident i m selling dolls of various skin tones

i want my child to play with dolls of all colors the population is growing but she knows there are not many black people living in doylestown bucks county s ethnic makeup as a whole includes 82 white and 4 1 black residents according to 2020 census data still kendter takes extra care not to exclude diversity and inclusion from her toy selection process we want children to be able to come into a

in the industry literally zero representation few black women serve on u s courts none on bucks county bench for subscribers north penn bowler thanks late grandpa on eve of state event play is so critical to the formation of who these little beings are she said busy bee toys sells all kinds of items but when it comes to her stock of dolls kendter makes a point of choosing brands that reflect a range of ethnic backgrounds one example is bonikka a small sri lankan toy line that uses mostly organic materials they re recognizing the world comes in different shapes kendter said gesturing to the stuffed multi ethnic toys they could have stuck to an asian market and they didn t throughout kendter s toy selling years cultural awareness has blossomed in the industry sure she could find a dark skinned doll 15 years ago she explained but it was tough to easily find culturally diverse lines and manufacturers back then the representation is much richer and we re all so thrilled to see it the business owner said racial representation in toys and books going back even further during the united states segregation era dolls proved to be far more than mere playthings a psychological self esteem experiment from the 1940s which later helped influence the landmark brown v board of education decision demonstrated how black kids at the time negatively viewed themselves compared to their caucasian peers usa today s women of the year dr ala stanford tackles disparities brought to light by covid kenneth and mamie clark s doll test involved asking 253 black children aged 3 7 to identify the races of two black dolls and two white dolls they also had to choose which one they liked best most of the kids preferred the white doll and gave it positive characteristics while 59 said they thought the black doll looked bad and when asked to pick the doll that most resembled their own faces the psychologists reported that some children became so upset that they cried and ran from the room according to the study countless versions of the original doll test study have been conducted in the decades since some of these studies being done have really motivated women of color to enter this industry and create beautiful dolls with various skin tones kendter said dolls these days have become increasingly representative but what about the fairytale princesses adorning the pages of a

was just 5 years old marea claybourne napier struggled to find princess stories featuring empowered girls of color now 10 she and her mom laura napier created a fairytale of their own with a twist we would tell stories at night and marea liked changing the fairytales you know there s the three little pigs and then there would be five pigs said napier a writer director and philadelphia native who moved her family from brooklyn to bucks county she and her husband hollywood film producer doug claybourne adopted marea as a baby with this one it was the princess looks like me and we change the story napier recalled of her conversation with her only child she wrote the story and marea who s a budding playwright herself drew and colored the illustrations check please after 35 years golden eagle owner is set to retire here s what next for bristol diner they describe their book the rainbow prince as a modern fairytale promoting representation of kids of color the main characters are both black and this time princess marea saves the prince we were like there has to be a heroine and she s got to save the prince no more of this helpless women stuff napier said they came up with the idea that the prince s skin color would change with his mood when he s happy he s brown napier said oftentimes films especially fairytales would portray the bad characters as having darker skin they wanted to flip that and other fairytale stereotypes the brown was going to be good and happy and also that prince rainbow was happy and comfortable in that skin that s his true self that s when he feels loved and accepted napier said marea s parents who are white had a hard time finding diverse dolls for her to play with when she was younger that s since changed napier said but she added that the challenge has always been tougher with children s books we really look for that the mother said marea s got a lot of books with brown heroines five years after they created their book their 35 minute short film of the same name premiered to families in doylestown in february according to research from the children s television project at tufts university out of 1 500 television characters 5 6 percent 84 of them were black or african american fifteen percent of the u s children s population are black i helped choose the actors and costumes said marea who s in fourth grade at buckingham elementary in the central bucks school district her valuable input earned her a director s creative consultant credit on the film her parents produced the family hopes by bringing the rainbow prince to the silver screen and to classrooms across bucks county they ll help foster conversations among all kids about their heroes differences and commonalities they could talk about how they re similar and that is how you fight prejudice and honor the differences napier said the schools seem the place to be to both have a pure audience and also reach a lot of children
question you do not think that putin is losing ph answer forgive me if i have studied ancient history too much in detail this reminds me of when socrates asked the then most illustrious military commander would you ever retreat he replies no that was cowardly then he gave as an example a pretend defeat causing the case of the opponent which only led to a trap but it also reminds me of alexander the great things are not always what they appear and reliable sources confirm that the claims that putin is on the ropes are coming from the state department and the pentagon disagrees for this appears to be propaganda to try to support a nato invasion the most celebrated battle during the punic war was when hannibal defeated a roman army twice his size it was the battle of cannae where 16 roman legions of about 100 00o confronted hannibal of about 50 000 hannibal used a very clever move to understand how the romans fought wars when the roman legions began their attack hannibal allowed the center of his initially crescent shaped formation to yield pretending the romans would easily win the advancing romans were then pinched by the carthaginian troops stationed on the flanks the romans were slowed and then finally stalled unable to break through hannibal s formation the vastly larger roman army was encircled and the carnage began according to the historian polybius of the 80 000 roman soldiers the carthaginians killed 70 000 the word carnage refers to the slaughtering of a great number of people the root of it in medieval latin carnaticum flesh from latin carnaticum slaughter of animals from carnem nominative caro flesh originally a piece of flesh however there are some who believe that this originated after the battle of cannae on august 2nd 216bc putin has said that he regards ukrainians as the same stock as russians distinct from other eastern europeans he initially asked the ukrainian army to stay in their barracks and not to fight alexander the great would conquer a region but not destroy everything as americans do instead he sought to assimilate the armies of conquered states those building his forces with every victory putin may not be trying to wipe out the ukrainian army but just maybe holding out hope that they will see that they have been merely a tool of the west and then join forces with russia after executing zelensky as was the case with mussolini by italian opponents the ukrainians have adopted a tactic of trying to assassinate all the russian generals some suspect that these are american snipers nevertheless this is a very novel tactic but this may not be that successful for it assumes a general in the field is calling all the shots rather than following orders from central command ukrainian snipers just killed the deputy commander of the russian black sea fleet earlier the ukrainians had killed five generals and a number of other high ranking officers by these types of tactics they are not defeating them in battle but trying to create that image the pentagon is objective to the propaganda coming from the state department my concern has been that if ukrainian troops are pushed toward a loss someone in zelensky s camp will claim a chemical attack by the russians to then give the excuse for nato to join that is when nuclear tactical weapons may begin to fly the logical response will then be to just nuke kyiv before it is embraced by nato this is why i believe the pentagon arguing against the neocons who now control the state department

mysterious agenda lightyear trailer if you d like a better idea of what buzz did to become this well known check out the collection of lightyear trailers below first we got shots of buzz travelling

adorable robot cat named sox if you re curious about sox who will definitely be in toy stores everywhere and buzz s partnership chris evans gave some insight at a global press conference i like the

sox the third trailer gives an even longer and more in depth look at lightyear including a glimpse at the evil emperor zurg if you re still confused about where this whole thing fits in toy story canon we asked the director angus maclane and producer galyn susman a few questions i think i ve always liked buzz as a toy but i ve always been inspired by the idea that if buzz was this amalgam of reacting to the sci fi movies of our youth what is his movie what is his story what is that mythology why don t we explore that maclane told us if you re wondering why there s a lack of zurg in the trailers we tried to find out but unfortunately pixar is keeping that one close to the chest who is in the cast tim allen may have voiced buzz in four toy story movies but he won t be the voice of the titular hero this time chris evans aka captain america is voicing the human buzz lightyear and he s kind of perfect for the role if you ask us advertisement evans is clearly stoked for the gig saying in a press release the phrase a dream come true gets thrown around a lot but i ve never meant it more in my life anyone who knows me knows that my love for animated films runs deep i can t believe that i get to be a part of the pixar family and work with these truly brilliant artists who tell stories unlike anyone else watching them work is nothing short of magic i pinch myself every day if you re wondering why the team went with evans over allen for the role producer galyn susman shared some insight at the global press conference tim allen is buzz lightyear the toy and he s the embodiment of buzz lightyear the toy we weren t making a toy story movie we re making buzz lightyear s movie the lightyear movie and so first and foremost we just needed to have a different person playing that lightyear separate from the toy as you ll notice in the second official trailer there are more space cadets to get to know the rest of the voice cast includes keke palmer taika waititi james brolin

washington d c in an open letter delivered to the white house last week the ceos of major u s airlines urged president biden to drop his outdated federal mask mandate for those flying on airplanes as well as for inside airports the letter was signed by the ceos of alaska air american airlines atlas air worldwide aviation fedex express hawaiian airlines delta air lines jetblue airways southwest airlines united airlines ups airlines and airlines for america the ceo s called upon biden to end the federal mask mandate after it expires on 18th april as well as covid 19 testing requirements for incoming international travelers stating now is the time for the administration to sunset federal transportation travel restrictions while other countries such as the uk and france no longer imposes testing on vaccinated travelers the u s still requires incoming international travelers to show proof of a negative covid test before boarding their flights the ceos said they had supported and cooperated with the federal government s measures throughout the pandemic but the burden to enforce the now outdated regulations fell on their employees it is critical to recognize that the burden of enforcing both the mask and pre departure testing requirements has fallen on our employees for two years now this is not a function they are trained to perform and subjects them to daily challenges by frustrated customers this in turn takes a toll on their own well being the letter added the ceos also said that since the measures were introduced early in the pandemic the situation has changed considerably stressing they no longer make sense in the current public health context the persistent and steady decline of hospitalization and death rates are the most compelling indicators that our country is well protected against severe disease from covid 19 the letter noted given that we have entered a different phase of dealing with this virus we strongly support your view that covid 19 need no longer control our lives we are encouraged by the current data and the lifting of covid 19 restrictions from coast to coast which indicate it is past time to eliminate covid era transportation policies the ceos added the white house has yet to comment about the letter

how big is the impact of the russian ukrainian crisis on the automobile industry the japanese automaker made an account what is the cost of global supply chain disruption under the russian ukrainian crisis for toyota the figure is about 520 the world s largest carmaker s estimate of an increase in production costs per car the recent conflict between russia and ukraine has thrown the supply chain into chaos which has led to a sharp rise in the price of raw materials and if the above figure is multiplied by the 10 million cars planned to be produced this year it will undoubtedly be a huge blow to toyota compared with the previous fiscal year seven japanese passenger car manufacturers will face an increase in raw material costs of about 1 4 trillion yen 11 5 billion in the year to march said seiji sugiura an analyst at tokyo research institute in tokai companies such as toyota and nissan have struggled recently to increase production because of global chip shortages and a super strong earthquake in northeastern japan in mid march he said carmakers are expected to absorb some of the rise in raw material costs by cutting costs but it is clearly difficult to absorb all the increases what is even more distressing for these japanese carmakers is that the current crisis is not limited to the rising cost of raw materials it has even hit the lifeline of the global auto industry an ultra efficient just in time procurement system that could have ensured that when needed the 30 000 parts needed to assemble a passenger car can be put in place without even a minute s advance in the past as long as you place an order the premise that parts will be delivered immediately is disintegrating warned sanshiro fukao a senior researcher at itochu research institute previously the core shortage crisis that occurred at the end of 2020 has made companies question whether they need to start to increase semiconductor inventory in order to break the just in time production model with the outbreak of the conflict between russia and ukraine and the intensification of sanctions against western russia people s attention is now more focused on metals palladium nickel and aluminum are all urgent the prices of palladium nickel and aluminium have all soared to record highs this month palladium is used in automotive catalytic converters nickel is used in electric vehicle batteries and aluminum is used in automotive parts about 40 of the world s palladium is produced in russia especially norilsk nickel a russian mining giant south africa accounts for another 40 of production with the rest from canada the united states and zimbabwe the automotive industry s demand for catalysts accounts for more than 80 of global palladium demand as it becomes increasingly difficult to buy palladium from russian exporters facing sanctions many buyers are looking for alternative sources hiroo suzaki president of south african metal producer impala platinum impala platinum japan said he had responded to a large number of inquiries about palladium however suzaki has also given buyers a shot the loss of russian supply will have a significant impact on the palladium market carmakers and other buyers usually sign off take agreements every year so it is difficult to suddenly increase production to meet the needs of new customers if you continue to buy goods from russia buyers may face the risk of reputation damage a metals trader in tokyo said the company usually buys palladium from russia but is carefully assessing the situation and negotiating with banks to see how sanctions will affect procurement and whether they will target palladium our concerns are growing especially after we see shell being severely criticised the trader added referring to western criticism of the uk energy company s continued buying of oil from russia in the early stages of the conflict the overall trend in the automotive industry is also exacerbating the current urgent situation in the palladium sector ironically despite recent price increases palladium production is unlikely to increase significantly because the auto industry is already abandoning palladium said mikio fujita a senior market analyst at johnson matthey demand for palladium catalysts is expected to shrink in the long run as the automotive industry shifts to electric vehicles fujita said the case of nickel is different russia s norilsk nickel norilsk nickel is the world s fifth largest nickel producer accounting for about 6 per cent of global production according to wood mackenzie about half of that production goes to european customers and most of the rest goes to china demand for nickel is expected to grow sharply as sales of electric vehicles accelerate now nickel stocks are on the verge of drying up with nickel stocks on the london metal exchange lme falling to about 73000 tonnes from about 260000 tonnes a year ago equivalent to only about a month of global demand a nickel trader at a japanese trading company said his european counterparts and buyers had begun to buy less nickel from russia this has tightened the market even more and the premium in europe has soared to record levels the trader said the premium is the difference between the price paid by the buyer for the metal and the global reference price buyers and sellers usually negotiate quarterly to determine a premium or discount according to market conditions at the same time the surge in aluminium prices reflects buyers fears of a repeat of 2018 when the us imposed sanctions on rusal russia s main aluminium supplier russia is the world s second largest producer of aluminium accounting for 5 per cent of global aluminium production these metals are not as important as oil so they are more likely to face supply risks or be targeted by sanctions said takayuki honma chief economist at sumitomo corporation global research for sumitomo global research the increase in car prices has become the trend of the times even before the conflict between russia and ukraine some japanese automakers warned that rising raw material prices were affecting their finances toyota said on feb 9 that the increase in such costs had a negative impact of 630 billion yen in the fiscal year ending in march while nissan said the day before that the rise in the price of key raw materials had a negative impact of 81 billion yen in the nine months to december in any case for consumers this may mean that their car prices may be higher in the future in march tesla raised prices in china and the us twice in less than a week because of surging raw materials and logistics costs now the wave of price increases is likely to spread to japanese car companies honda said in february that it expected costs to increase by 290 billion yen this fiscal year because of soaring raw material prices we usually try to absorb costs by cutting costs internally but now the increase is too big to absorb at all said takeuchi honda s chief financial officer he said the company plans to raise car prices in north america if necessary similar actions in the japanese market may be considered foreign carmakers in japan have already taken the move and volkswagen and audi have now said they will raise the price of their cars in japan by about 2 per cent from april given japan s long history of low inflation and fierce price competition it would be significant for domestic car companies to follow suit it is worth mentioning that the supply chain crises such as the conflict between russia and ukraine the chip shortage and the novel coronavirus epidemic all took place in the critical period of the transformation of the automobile industry which further aggravated the test faced by japanese car companies the shift to electric vehicles has brought new market competitors which means the balance of power between suppliers and traditional carmakers is changing said sanshiro fukao of itochu co ltd carmakers are no longer the primary customers of suppliers these new market competitors do not always follow the same procurement rules as their predecessors tesla for example has been trying to ensure the supply of key raw materials for electric vehicles in the future in 2021 the american company signed a three year supply contract with ganfeng lithium a chinese battery grade lithium producer in the same year the company also signed a four year supply agreement with australia s syrah resources for graphite anode materials japanese carmakers are also looking for any solution they can find the nissan renault mitsubishi alliance has said that reducing raw material costs is an ongoing process and that key materials such as nickel and lithium will be shared within the alliance other companies are investing more in research to find alternatives to raw materials that are difficult to obtain or carry other risks such as cobalt naohiro niimura a partner at market risk advisory a japanese commodities consultancy says japanese carmakers need to make more fundamental changes in strategy the premise of a just in time system is that automakers can purchase the necessary materials at any time and anywhere niimura said but in fact this is just to let their suppliers bear the procurement risk while they do not manage the risk

bremen for the past decade the irish photographer richard mosse b 1980 has been documenting global political and economic crises including the civil war in the democratic republic of congo european refugee and migration policy and the destruction of the tropical rainforest in his large scale photographs mosse uses imaging technology originally designed for military and scientific use to make objects visible that cannot ordinarily be perceived by the human eye with over seventy photographs and a new video installation this show at the the heightened aesthetic of richard mosse s photographs and videos simultaneously grapple with political and ethical issues he utilizes imaging technology that was originally developed for military and scientific purposes employing it on the one hand to investigate and reveal the history and effects of global crises but also to question the potential and limitations of photography itself mosse thereby operates in the interface between politically motivated documentary photography and contemporary conceptual art this methodology is based on his conviction that conventional documentary photography simply cannot depict the complicated and often obscure contexts behind global crises and wars developed in close collaboration with the artist this exhibition is the first comprehensive show of mosse s work in germany and one of the largest to date internationally over seventy photographs have been selected from his four major series to date including infra 2010 2014 from the congo heat maps 2016 2018 with images of european refugee camps his current projects ultra 2019 20 and tristes tropiques since 2020 in which he explores the systematic destruction of the amazon rainforest a new large scale video installation from his tristes tropiques series complements the selection of photographs richard mosse lives in new york in 2013 he represented his native ireland at the venice biennale he was awarded the deutsche b√∂rse photography prize in 2014 and the prix pictet in 2017 his work has been presented at numerous international exhibitions including mast bologna 2021 the san francisco museum of modern art 2019 the barbican art gallery london 2017 the louisiana museum of modern art humleb√¶k 2015 and the national gallery of victoria melbourne 2014 infra 2010 2014 for his infra series mosse travelled through north kivu province in the eastern democratic republic of congo in 2010 and captured landscapes abandoned homes refugee camps and powerful portraits for decades north kivu has been the site of ongoing violence between various rebel groups and the congolese army military ambushes massacres of the civilian population and systemic sexual violence have made their mark on entire generations the confusing conflict between the various rebel groups and the government is ultimately the result of colonial exploitation by belgian king leopold ii 1888 1908 belgium 1910 1960 and thirty plus years of rule by the dictator mobutu 1965 1997 today the conflict remains closely intertwined with foreign countries interests in the congo s rich natural resources for his photographic research mosse used kodak aerochrome a type of infrared colour film discontinued in 2009 which was originally developed during world war ii for military aerial reconnaissance it records a spectrum of infrared light that is invisible to the human eye and renders green landscapes in intense shades of lavender purple and pink the military employed this technology to detect people and objects camouflaged in natural settings in his work mosse uses the infrared film to uncover and analyse the complex web of entanglements behind these unresolved conflicts heat maps 2016 2018 since 2016 mosse has explored in depth the impact of refugees in north africa the middle east and europe photographing numerous provisional camps that were established along the routes taken by many of them on their way to europe for his large scale series heat maps mosse utilized a camera developed for military purposes that can measure thermal radiation from a distance of thirty kilometres this highly complex camera is registered as a weapon and is generally used by governments to surveil and defend their borders mosse s black and white photographs are constructed from a multitude of smaller high resolution frames taken from a great distance and reveal life in the refugee camps down to the smallest detail the images of these frequently inaccessible and secured sites look like historic cityscapes and are reminiscent of camps where asylum seekers are detained the thermal imaging camera captures the people only through traces of their body heat faces are rendered as schematic shapes the camera s dehumanizing viewpoint unsettlingly conveys the reservations with which the world regards the situation of these refugees by using a thermal imaging camera a military instrument used to secure borders mosse draws attention to the refugee policy of the respective governments during a period in which migration has long since become a conflict countered by military means ultra 2019 20 since 2019 mosse has focused on exploring the destruction of the amazon rainforest his series ultra captures the precious and irreplaceable beauty of the rainforest ecosystem in peru and ecuador through minutely detailed images of plants and insects the rainforest is a place for hunters and prey the natural world here is in a perpetual cycle of kill or be killed ultra examines how plants and insects have evolved over millions of years for survival frequently developing forms of camouflage to make this series mosse used a scientific photography technique to capture ultraviolet fluorescence through the fluorescence of uv light in the visible spectrum plants and animals take on an unfamiliar almost alien aspect without technological support the irritating colour portrayed cannot be perceived by the human eye the artworks have been composited from numerous separate images typically fifty or more to create large scale hyper detailed aesthetic landscapes in the face of the ever greater threat and irrecoverable destruction of the rainforest mosse points out the limitations of human skill and knowledge tristes tropiques since 2020 in his most recent project tristes tropiques since 2020 mosse continues to focus on the amazon rainforest by drawing our attention to environmental crimes and the systematic destruction of nature through large scale clearing and deforestation stock farming palm oil plantations illegal gold mines and other man made infrastructure for these large scale works mosse processes hundreds of thousands of multispectral images captured above the affected area by special cameras mounted on drones following this the individual frames are consolidated in a complicated process and interpreted using geographic information system software which was developed to record and analyse spatial data the technology mosse borrowed is commonly used by scientists to detect deforestation the concentrated release of co2 toxic pollution and other ecological damage however the same technology is also employed in agribusiness and geology to exploit the land more profitably and selectively these images oscillate between scientific maps and garishly coloured photographs from a distance the colourful works look like colour field paintings but from a closer vantage point they reveal the smallest details every image in the tristes tropiques series contains a multitude of data that tracks the continuing spread of radical deforestation the dominance of agribusiness illegal mining and other environmental crimes along with the tristes tropiques photographs mosse has added untitled rond√¥nia 2021 a compelling new video installation that shows aerial film footage from the rainforest in the brazilian state of rond√¥nia the powerful images of this recently incinerated jungle area are accompanied by audio recorded on site this video continues an important collaboration between mosse and the american cameraman trevor tweeten b 1983 and the australian islandic composer ben frost b 1980 with whom he developed earlier highly regarded video installations the title of this project tristes tropiques alludes to a travelogue of the same name published in 1955 by the french anthropologist claude l√©vi strauss which describes his travels through the amazon for the past decade the irish photographer richard mosse b 1980 has been documenting global political and economic crises including the civil war in the democratic republic of congo european refugee and migration policy and the destruction of the tropical rainforest in his large scale photographs mosse uses imaging technology originally designed for military and scientific use to make objects visible that cannot ordinarily be perceived by the human eye with over seventy photographs and a new video

documentary photography and contemporary conceptual art this methodology is based on his conviction that conventional documentary photography simply cannot depict the complicated and often obscure contexts behind global crises and wars developed in close collaboration with the artist this exhibition is the first comprehensive show of mosse s work in germany and one of the largest to date internationally over seventy photographs have been selected from his four major series to date including infra 2010 2014 from the congo heat maps 2016 2018 with images of european refugee camps his current projects ultra 2019 20 and tristes tropiques since 2020 in which he explores the systematic destruction of the amazon rainforest a new large scale video installation from his tristes tropiques series complements the selection of photographs richard mosse lives in new york in 2013 he represented his native ireland at the venice biennale he was awarded the deutsche b√∂rse photography prize in 2014 and the prix pictet in 2017 his work has been presented at numerous international exhibitions including mast bologna 2021 the san francisco museum of modern art 2019 the barbican art gallery london 2017 the louisiana museum of modern art humleb√¶k 2015 and the national gallery of victoria melbourne 2014 for his infra series mosse travelled through north kivu province in the eastern democratic republic of congo in 2010 and captured landscapes abandoned homes refugee camps and powerful portraits for decades north kivu has been the site of ongoing violence between various rebel groups and the congolese army military ambushes massacres of the civilian population and systemic sexual violence have made their mark on entire generations the confusing conflict between the various rebel groups and the government is ultimately the result of colonial exploitation by belgian king leopold ii 1888 1908 belgium 1910 1960 and thirty plus years of rule by the dictator mobutu 1965 1997 today the conflict remains closely intertwined with foreign countries interests in the congo s rich natural resources for his photographic research mosse used kodak aerochrome a type of infrared colour film discontinued in 2009 which was originally developed during world war ii for military aerial reconnaissance it records a spectrum of infrared light that is invisible to the human eye and renders green landscapes in intense shades of lavender purple and pink the military employed this technology to detect people and objects camouflaged in natural settings in his work mosse uses the infrared film to uncover and analyse the complex web of entanglements behind these unresolved conflicts since 2016 mosse has explored in depth the impact of refugees in north africa the middle east and europe photographing numerous provisional camps that were established along the routes taken by many of them on their way to europe for his large scale series heat maps mosse utilized a camera developed for military purposes that can measure thermal radiation from a distance of thirty kilometres this highly complex camera is registered as a weapon and is generally used by governments to surveil and defend their borders mosse s black and white photographs are constructed from a multitude of smaller high resolution frames taken from a great distance and reveal life in the refugee camps down to the smallest detail the images of these frequently inaccessible and secured sites look like historic cityscapes and are reminiscent of camps where asylum seekers are detained the thermal imaging camera captures the people only through traces of their body heat faces are rendered as schematic shapes the camera s dehumanizing viewpoint unsettlingly conveys the reservations with which the world regards the situation of these refugees by using a thermal imaging camera a military instrument used to secure borders mosse draws attention to the refugee policy of the respective governments during a period in which migration has long since become a conflict countered by military means since 2019 mosse has focused on exploring the destruction of the amazon rainforest his series ultra captures the precious and irreplaceable beauty of the rainforest ecosystem in peru and ecuador through minutely detailed images of plants and insects the rainforest is a place for hunters and prey the natural world here is in a perpetual cycle of kill or be killed ultra examines how plants and insects have evolved over millions of years for survival frequently developing forms of camouflage to make this series mosse used a scientific photography technique to capture ultraviolet fluorescence through the fluorescence of uv light in the visible spectrum plants and animals take on an unfamiliar almost alien aspect without technological support the irritating colour portrayed cannot be perceived by the human eye the artworks have been composited from numerous separate images typically fifty or more to create large scale hyper detailed aesthetic landscapes in the face of the ever greater threat and irrecoverable destruction of the rainforest mosse points out the limitations of human skill and knowledge in his most recent project tristes tropiques since 2020 mosse continues to focus on the amazon rainforest by drawing our attention to environmental crimes and the systematic destruction of nature through large scale clearing and deforestation stock farming palm oil plantations illegal gold mines and other man made infrastructure for these large scale works mosse processes hundreds of thousands of multispectral images captured above the affected area by special cameras mounted on drones following this the individual frames are consolidated in a complicated process and interpreted using geographic information system software which was developed to record and analyse spatial data the technology mosse borrowed is commonly used by scientists to detect deforestation the concentrated release of co2 toxic pollution and other ecological damage however the same technology is also employed in agribusiness and geology to exploit the land more profitably and selectively these images oscillate between scientific maps and garishly coloured photographs from a distance the colourful works look like colour field paintings but from a closer vantage point they reveal the smallest details every image in the tristes tropiques series contains a multitude of data that tracks the continuing spread of radical deforestation the dominance of agribusiness illegal mining and other environmental crimes along with the tristes tropiques photographs mosse has added untitled rond√¥nia 2021 a compelling new video installation that shows aerial film footage from the rainforest in the brazilian state of rond√¥nia the powerful images of this recently incinerated jungle area are accompanied by audio recorded on site this video continues an important collaboration between mosse and the american cameraman trevor tweeten b 1983 and the australian islandic composer ben frost b 1980 with whom he developed earlier highly regarded video installations the title of this project tristes tropiques alludes to a travelogue of the same name published in 1955 by the french anthropologist claude l√©vi strauss which describes his travels through the amazon

contract negotiations opened on march 15 between the university of michigan professional nurse council umpnc and michigan medicine the current contract expires june 30 over 5 000 university employed nursing staff are represented by the umpnc the largest local affiliate of the michigan nurses association like nurses in hospitals across the country michigan medicine nurses have been understaffed underpaid overworked and emotionally devastated during the pandemic as covid 19 surged in michigan 35 572 people have died of the disease michigan medicine reports that over 6 300 employees have tested positive during the pandemic the high quality rating of the university hospital system it was ranked number one in michigan by u s news and world report for 2021 2022 only shows that the mistreatment of nurses and other frontline workers is not an aberration due to mismanagement or abuse by a specific boss or financially strapped hospital system it is an intrinsic feature of capitalist medicine as a whole michigan medicine the health care system established by the university of michigan and subject to its board of regents is the fourth largest hospital system in michigan with over 26 000 employees the hospital chain officially titled the university of michigan health system umhs includes five hospitals 125 clinics and the u m medical group it is nominally non profit but it has enormous financial resources out of the 10 031 billion in total operating revenue for the university the health care system and its other clinical activities are the single largest revenue source bringing in 5 351 billion michigan medicine reported a 6 5 percent 339 8 million operating margin for fiscal year 2021 the financial position of the university of michigan itself also a public institution improved by 5 billion in fy 2021 to 19 5 billion primarily due to substantial investment returns as financial markets experienced tremendous growth offsetting the impact of the pandemic induced slowdown from the prior year despite the pandemic related challenges umhs experienced positive fy 2021 results attacks on michigan medicine employees helped the university improve its financial position and exceed its target in 2021 according to its annual financial report many of the stabilization measures that were implemented when the pandemic began such as suspending nonessential expenditures and implementing a hiring freeze for all but essential positions continued throughout the year in addition employee base salaries were not increased in fy 2021 these measures helped contribute to an improved operating performance in fy 2021 in this report geoffrey s chatas executive vice president and chief financial officer praises michigan medical employees for their work during the pandemic through it all however we were resilient while preserving the highest standards of quality and safety for both our patients and our staff michigan medicine successfully worked to efficiently use its capacity for surges of covid 19 patients while balancing the needs of non covid 19 patients teamwork access safety and quality were continuous priorities for our patients and employees this flattering language has not been translated into anything beneficial to the thousands of nurses who have played such a central role in the ongoing struggle against the pandemic instead umhs proposes to reward the dedicated service of members of the michigan nurses association mna with a four year contract loaded with concessions including increasing wages by 3 percent each year well below current inflation waiving overtime premium pay if mna members volunteer to work additional hours reducing staffing guarantees in many departments making on call apply to all nurses in unlimited amounts the university is also taking a hard line on negotiating overtime and over appointment incentive payments most of which expired february 19 michigan medicine has refused to expand the incentives or to extend the current incentives that expired by offering different incentives to different units the administration is encouraging conflicts among employees a nurse posting on the nurses of michigan medicine facebook page shared her experience our jobs do not end at the end of our 8 hr day our day is generally a 12 or 16 hour day it s often 14 18 hours before we get back home to our families 6 hours are left to live our lives this doesn t give us enough time or energy to unpack the emotional baggage we carry with us after caring for others bloomberg news reported that it expected many nurses will strike this year as their contracts expire during 2022 michigan medicine nurses will be joined by nurses in other large health care facilities including the university of california 14 600 and new york city hospital alliance 10 000 bloomberg wrote hospitals have little incentive to hire more nurses during a shortage since they don t generate the kind of lucrative payments from insurance companies that other clinicians do said david coppins ceo of intelycare a staffing platform that directly employs 30 000 nurses that s been compounded by the fact hospital executives have been slow to listen to staffing complaints he said the mna and umpnc have done nothing to prepare a struggle against the attacks of hospital management or to link up with the struggles of other nurses across the country the union officials have been engaged in a sordid struggle over control of the resources of the mna which was an independent union until 2020 with rival factions affiliated with the national nurses united and the american federation of teachers longtime mna executive director john karebian was forced out in 2019 after numerous members of the mna staff filed charges of bullying and creating a hostile work environment then in 2020 a karebian supporter karen oppenheim the president of the umpnc was brought up on charges of dual unionism after she and karebian entered into a deal with the aft the mna executive instead voted to affiliate with the nnu the bureaucratic infighting was also tied in with the political clash between the nnu and the aft which backed rival candidates for the democratic presidential nomination in 2020 with the nnu supporting bernie sanders and the aft joe biden the conflict came to a head when the faction led by karebian and oppenheim forced a representation election in september 2021 in which u m nurses voted to remain affiliated to the mna rather than join a new local that would be attached to the aft no questions of principle were involved in the protracted internecine warfare it was a fight over control of financial resources and positions within the bureaucracy as well as a dispute over which faction of the democratic party to align with neither faction represents a genuine defense of the interests of nurses more broadly nurses can place no confidence in the national nurses united and mna which have allowed the current abysmal conditions to persist and get worse each year as nurses continue to leave the profession in droves in the last six months nurses in worcester massachusetts buffalo new york and kaiser nurses across southern california saw their struggles betrayed by the unions who enforced sellout contracts through campaigns of lying censorship and intimidation nurses must form independent rank and file committees to set specific nonnegotiable demands carry out their struggle and reach out to workers beyond michigan medicine for support and to expand the struggle

malik rahman got the drugs that killed him in the last place you d expect a bronx nypd holding cell at the hands of a fentanyl dealing drug gang raking in fistfuls of cash court records say rahman 54 overdosed aug 25 after another arrested suspect slipped a baggie of the highly toxic drug past three patdown searches by cops in the south bronx s 40th precinct stationhouse rahman s death came as cops and federal agents were in the midst of linking a series of overdoses to the drug ring which peddled its wares at the intersection of e 142nd st and brook ave six blocks from the stationhouse malik rahman in february the investigation led to six arrests including alleged ring leaders jesus cabrera 42 and michael amaya 40 federal prosecutors tied rahman s death and eight other fatal overdoses in the bronx to the gang court records show eight of the overdoses took place between march and december 2021 and were linked to packages of the drug stamped with the brand supreme court filings show the ninth overdose in january 2022 was linked to another of the gang s brands thriller the scope and impact of the narcotics trafficking operation cannot be overstated manhattan federal prosecutors david robles and kaylan lasky wrote in a court filing the persistent distribution of fentanyl has wreaked havoc throughout the bronx over the past year after rahman s death the drug ring didn t pause its operations text messages seized from amaya s phone aug 31 six days later contain urgent requests to resupply the fentanyl stock for more street deals the court filings show rahman s family learned of the busts from a daily news reporter i was really relieved that my dad finally got justice what they did to him he did not deserve said his daughter moesha rahman but i still have a lot of questions the same ones i had before she said how did they let the drugs get into the cell an internal nypd investigation is continuing into what happened in the stationhouse court documents and law enforcement sources helped the news piece together some of the story malik rahman died aug 25 in a cell at the 40th precinct stationhouse in the bronx after using fentanyl a potent synthetic opioid smuggled in by another prisoner the investigation of the ring was sparked on nov 20 2020 when cops stopped a 2015 audi q7 with tinted windows in the south bronx inside officers found a jar of marijuana 50 000 in cash and a bag of 2 180 heroin baggies mixed with rice used to keep the drugs dry court records show amaya the driver was arrested on possession charges federal court documents show drugs cash and a gun seized as part of a bronx drug crackdown after he got out of jail the circumstances of his release are not clear investigators saw amaya conduct drug deals court documents say the drug packets he sold were variously branded anonymous off white and thriller investigators then began focusing on cabrera who they believe led the ring cabrera had been selling heroin in bulk for more than a decade and was hooked up with amaya since 2019 the feds say their business boomed the day before rahman died on aug 24 2021 cabrera texted amaya a ledger of sales showing proceeds of 111 150 in just a few days court records show the south bronx where the ring plied its trade routinely leads the city in overdose deaths the city health department says fentanyl 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine has been the top substance involved in overdose deaths citywide for each of the past four years the drug was present in 1 580 of new york s 2 062 overdose deaths in 2020 77 of the total fentanyl is often mixed with varying amounts of heroin or cocaine making the strength of a given dose unpredictable and dangerous alberto concepcion was working for a drug ring that was making hundreds of thousands of dollars dealing cocaine fentanyl and heroin from that non descript intersection in the south bronx the feds have alleged some of the drugs sold by cabrera and amaya allegedly were put on the street by alberto concepcion on aug 25 conception allegedly sold drugs to a man who was taken to the 40th precinct stationhouse right around the same time rahman was being arrested following a fight with a girlfriend in the bronx transitional housing facility where he lived rahman was stabbed in the fight but arrested anyway cops frisked concepcion s customer three times and found contraband each time sources familiar with the case said then the customer was put in the holding cell with rahman said the sources neither the nypd nor federal officials would provide the customer s name or other details about him in the cell concepcion s customer pulled a glassine baggie from his rectum and he and rahman snorted the drugs it held the sources said rahman began to feel ill and went into convulsions officers used a defibrillator to try to revive him before taking him to a local hospital themselves the sources said nypd guidelines state that the desk officer is supposed to direct a cop to watch the holding cell at all times questions remain about how much time elapsed before police noticed rahman s condition early reports that rahman was unattended for as long as two hours remain unconfirmed by authorities the police should have been more aware of the inmates in the holding cell checking on them every 15 minutes jamilla rahman malik s niece told the news someone wasn t doing their job malik rahman the city medical examiner concluded that rahman overdosed from a mixture of fentanyl and benzodiazepine an anti anxiety drug which acts as a sedative and increases the danger when used with opioids rahman s daughter bianca harris 32 said her dad was a drinker but not a regular drug user he was many things but he was not a drug addict harris said he would never have been like i m going to do it just to do it law enforcement officials declined to reveal any details about the other eight overdose deaths blamed on the drug ring allegedly run by

as actor troy kotsur remembers it receiving his first academy award nomination in february for his supporting role in apple tv s coda was an utterly thrilling moment he was with his wife on facetime and they reacted together but as a now veteran of the awards season kotsur has already won a screen actors guild award for his coda performance and been nominated for a bafta award too he has learned to play it a bit cooler i jumped for joy he told today but i controlled myself kotsur learned the hard way what happens when you get overenthusiastic in front of a camera in early february a video showing the moment when he learned he d been nominated for that bafta award went viral because the 53 year old actor literally fell out of his chair coda director sian heder posted the video on twitter writing ahhh troy kotsur s reaction to his bafta nomination this morning is hilarious i can t stop watching chagrin led to acceptance and now kotsur just laughs at the memory i forgot that my chair had wheels he explains so i slipped and lost my balance i didn t realize how viral that fall would go all over social media i couldn t stop the momentum so yes so be it i have to accept that that video is out there consider the chair fall kotsur s second best performance of the year his first well that s nothing less than milestone making why because kotsur is now the first solo male actor to win the sag award and the first deaf male actor to receive an oscar nomination kotsur s conversation with today was done via zoom interpreted by justin maurer coda which stands for child of deaf adults itself is the story of a largely deaf family headed up by kotsur s character frank in the film his hearing daughter emilia jones is starting to forge a career in music rather than going into the family fishing business conflict ensues and emotional heartstrings are tugged but kotsur was just one of two award winning deaf actors on camera marlee matlin who became the first deaf actor to win an oscar in 1987 for children of a lesser god plays his wife emilia jones and kotsur in coda apple tv alamy stock photo matlin has given him advice about how to behave now that the paparazzi lights and literal spotlights have turned his way she warned me that there was going to be so many flashbulbs on the red carpet he recalls my eyes have to get used to it it s not easy for me being deaf and being a visual communicator to feel like my eyes are burning now i realize i might need sunglasses everything is new to me which all by itself must be a strange sensation as kotsur is no newcomer to acting he studied the performing arts at gallaudet university in the late 1980s then began touring with companies like the national theater for the deaf in theatrical productions like a streetcar named desire over the years he s had guest roles on tv series like scrubs and csi ny but his movie career has largely been focused on small independent films kotsur as stanley kowalski suanne spoke as blanche in deaf west theatre s performance of a streetcar named desire circa 2000 lawrence k ho los angeles times via getty images in tv and film they tend to have deaf characters as victims or sympathy characters he explains unless it was based on a true story in coda frank was a hardworking man who was successful and protected his family also he has a vulgar sense of humor so i was thrilled to show what deaf vulgarities in american sign language looked like on the big screen kotsur spent time in gloucester massachusetts the setting of the film to get a sense of the place and what fishing life might be like they told me not to shave or cut my hair for five months before the first day of shooting he recalls but it wasn t just about physicality as he explains asl has its own regional dialects just like verbal language the sign for truck has five different signs he says gesturing in a number of ways being in gloucester on the fishing boat for two weeks really influenced the way i signed because they wear heavy rubber gloves which influence the way i communicate it s their specific culture language and accent it s a myth that asl is monotone l r amy forsyth daniel durant marlee matlin and kotsur in coda apple tv alamy stock photo kotsur is also hitting the mainstream at a fortuitous time movies featuring deaf actors in more than victim or sympathy roles are becoming more common including sound of metal eternals and a quiet place but remember he says those films had just one deaf character apiece coda was one of the first times there was a deaf ensemble cast with three deaf actors our film is a big step forward nor does he think this is some kind of passing fad it s the first time i ve really seen hollywood this motivated he says deafness is almost a hot topic this year i m getting offers and i might consider to direct one or two projects i m curious to see where i can fit in kotsur in coda apple tv courtesy everett collection in the past he adds i worked so hard trying to make a living this time it s the other way around the tables are turned and they re giving me offers rather than me scrambling for jobs the most important thing i d like to tell hollywood is to get rid of their fear don t be afraid of being creative it s ok to be afraid but it ll help you improve discomfort will help you grow
how are municipal broadband and cooperative networks funded according to the pew charitable trusts municipal isps are typically funded entirely with municipal bonds in most cases municipalities seek to use revenue bonds bonds supported by specific revenue sources serviced by revenues from the broadband service rather than general obligation bonds bonds supported by general revenue sources it is uncommon for municipalities to fund broadband projects with municipal cash or equity in rare cases such as with epb in chattanooga tennessee the cost of building out a municipal network has been subsidized by federal or state grants but this could become more common as the iija broadband funds are distributed cooperatives typically finance new broadband projects with loans from banks that cater specifically to co ops such as cobank and the rural telephone financing cooperative rtfc but occasionally borrow from the rural utility service rus an agency within the us department of agriculture that assists rural communities with utility infrastructure improvement unlike municipal networks it is not uncommon for cooperatives to use equity to fund broadband projects additionally it is more common for cooperatives to receive government funding than it is for municipal networks

our models have confirmed that biden s sanctions against all russians have undeniably destroyed the global economy unfortunately precisely on time from its birth in 1950 our capital flow models have confirmed that there has been an unprecedented cash outflow from china following biden s sanctions not only are we witnessing a withdrawal of western capital from china realizing that the us has no interest in peace and china will be next but we are also looking at collapsing confidence in globalization continuing from here on out our models have confirmed a highly unusual change in direction of the global capital flows which is even showing up in the emerging markets china saw investors pull out from its share markets over concerns that we are clearly headed into world war iii historically the capital flows to the dollar during world war under the assumption that tanks will not be landing on the beaches of virginia or california this will tend to support the dollar but not long term biden s sanctions attacking individual russians have turned into a nightmare besides the czech republic seizing all assets of any russian based upon their ethnicity as they were doing to the japanese during world war ii in the united states now even switzerland is doing the same thing these sanctions are not going to cause regime change and the overthrow of putin with russians running into the arms of the west this is outright hatred of russians as a people and they will have no choice but bond with china in an all out war against this outrageous tyranny i seriously doubt that biden even understands what he is doing at the directions of these neocons who have infiltrated the white house these neocons are bringing the entire world to destruction which some argue is all part of their plan to enable the world to build back better which necessitates the destruction of the current energy system and reduction of population to make bill gates sleep easy at night so the next season of build back better may be the climax our model has always picked up the shifts in capital flows that precede war this time we are witnessing outflows not just from china but also from all emerging markets on a scale that is simply unprecedented the timing of outflows is clearly linked to biden s unprecedented sanctions against the russian people not just russia itself as a political state this has never taken place in history before with the single exception of the us sanctions imposed on japan and the freezing of all their assets in the united states which preceded pearl harbor it pains me to have to even write this today but clearly those who understand where this is going is to world war iii and make no mistake about it this is intentional even the official data has revealed that foreign investors have sold a net 5 5 billion of chinese government bonds in the last few weeks biden stupidly threatened china that if they support russia they will suffer the same sanctions this is just insane and it is deliberately trying to destroy the entire world economy even from nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said at a press conference on march 24 china must not provide economic or military support for the russian invasion the previous day he accused beijing of spreading blatant lies and misinformation what they are calling misinformation is anything that challenges the west s own propaganda they want war for the demands of putin are reasonable ukraine remains neutral surrender donbas and crimea which are all ethnic russians when zelensky passed the language law that russian is no longer to be an official language in ukraine that is the same as telling all spanish if you do not speak english get out all we can do is write to every political leader and demand accountability for the biden administration is out to build back better but that requires total destruction first reprinted with permission from armstrong economics the best of martin armstrong
