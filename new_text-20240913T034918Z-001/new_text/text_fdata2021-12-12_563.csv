how are anglo irish relations going separate from discussions about peace in northern ireland and membership of the eu though some in the irish government have suggested that relations between ireland and westminster are worse now than they were during the four years of brexit negotiations others point to regular bilateral meetings and visits across the waters in recent months we have good days and bad days a source close to the government told the journal a shift has also taken place in the irish state s view of the united kingdom instead of focusing on relations with westminster direct links are being built up with wales scotland and the north of england despite acknowledgements that brexit has made things difficult for anglo irish relations ireland is aiming to work on areas where cooperation is possible in a tripartite way sources say this could include situations where the government works directly with the uk on understanding what it is trying to achieve and then checking back to ensure eu positions aren t compromised some areas where anglo irish cooperation could develop include climate and energy culture tourism and education from the eu side security defence and data transfers have been mentioned it s also been suggested that the irish government is willing to beef up two diplomatic forums set up as part of the good friday agreement the british irish council and the british irish intergovernmental conference but any desire to do so at the moment is seen as being one way only the british irish council summit in lough erne resort in enniskillen co fermanagh 11 june 2021 alamy stock photo alamy stock photo the idea that there is minimal co operation on british irish talks has been disputed by other arms of the irish government who say that there have been 54 high level meetings this year already most at political level the taoiseach and the british prime minister are said to have regular discussions and there have been extensive ministerial exchanges in addition to these both bilaterally and at set piece events such as last month s british irish council summit sucking the oxygen out of relations the idea to enhance more formal british irish forums precedes brexit s official start date in september 2019 fianna fáil td niall collins told the dáil that ireland cannot allow brexit suck all of the oxygen from anglo irish relations saying that it needs to actively nurture this relationship outside of brexit but minister for foreign affairs simon coveney responded that because of brexit things will change saying we are simply not going to see british ministers as often because they will not be around the eu negotiating tables with us coveney added that the british irish intergovernmental conference biigc and the british irish council bic would therefore need to be utilised to the fullest extent possible to maintain those relationships the relationship between ireland and the uk is and will continue to be a unique vital and complex one it is a relationship which requires great care close attention and ongoing engagement at every level these forums are hoped to be used to develop direct relations with scotland wales and the north of england rather than directly with westminster this year an irish consulate has been opened in manchester and another reopened in cardiff minister simon coveney wendy morton mp and consul general sarah mangan at the opening of the irish consulate for the north of england october 2021 alamy stock photo alamy stock photo it s also understood that since brexit the uk government has a team within the cabinet office that is working on the uk s relationship with ireland ireland s uk strategy has stretched beyond london post brexit and that the british irish council and intergovernmental conference will be for developing relations with devolved administrations next year the mayors of manchester and liverpool will travel to ireland at the end of march where tourism and trade will be a key focus the british irish council the british irish council has been attended by the taoiseach of the day since its inception after the good friday agreement bar one summit in june 2006 advertisement a sitting british prime minister hasn t attended the british irish council since july 2007 and november 2003 before that no tory prime minister has ever attended a british irish council summit but the british irish council is not just about ireland a source close to the government suggested that the uk prime minister s absences could be more to do with not wanting the uk to appear on equal footing as scotland and wales rather than neglected relations with ireland the source also pointed out that former british prime minister david cameron launched an ambitious ten year bilateral agreement with former taoiseach enda kenny in 2012 but that he didn t attend the british irish council david cameron meets enda kenny outside 10 downing street november 2015 alamy stock photo alamy stock photo post brexit however the absence of the british prime minister from these meetings is more striking certainly if the british government were serious about beefing up relationships would be a good symbolic start fine gael td neale richmond said in the early years of the british irish council the deputy british pm would attend on behalf of the uk from 2008 onwards the northern ireland secretary has been leading the uk delegation but this changed recently when david lidington and michael gove held the role of the duchy of lancaster effectively the deputy prime minister taoiseach micheál martin and chancellor of the duchy of lancaster michael gove at the british irish council in fermanagh alamy stock photo alamy stock photo lidington suggested in conversation with neale richmond earlier this year that ireland and the uk could swap civil servants as part of trying to build up anglo irish relations post brexit he also said both sides could celebrate each others culture as a non political way of creating ties which may also tie into the irish government s plan to appeal more to unionists as part of a shared island there is currently an irish secondment a temporary transfer to another position to the uk government s treasury a welsh secondment to the irish government s diaspora unit was recently confirmed the british irish parliamentary assembly brexit s influence on uk politics has changed the areas where cooperation between ireland and britain is possible but has it affected relationships between elected politicians in both countries the british irish parliamentary assembly visit the irish national war memorial gardens in islandbridge dublin march 2014 alamy stock photo alamy stock photo the british irish parliamentary assembly bipa was set up in 1990 and updated in 2001 to include members of the scottish parliament and the welsh assembly the senedd as well as the northern ireland assembly the british co chair of that assembly andrew rosindell is an ardent brexiteer and was among the 28 rebel tory mps who voted against theresa may s brexit deal three times in 2019 over what he referred to as the ghastly backstop which if used would have kept northern ireland in the european union to avoid a hard border on the island of ireland the backstop was defended by the taoiseach the tánaiste and the minister for european affairs at the time as integral to the withdrawal agreement and ireland s interests this group of tory rebels recently met up to mark the protest vote against the backstop rosindell said he never waivered over the decision to vote against it rosindell also recently urged the prime minister to take back control of its borders after 27 migrants died while attempting to cross the channel from france to england he told the house of commons this week that the uk wouldn t be able to stop the endless waves of illegal migrants crossing the english channel until we break free of the constraints of the european convention on human rights when the irish co chair of the same assembly fianna fáil td brendan smith was asked by the journal whether it s difficult to maintain anglo irish relations when the uk government is taking such opposing views to ireland s on northern ireland and its place in the world he said on a personal and political basis it s not difficult but acknowledged that more work would be needed on the assembly post brexit and that the assembly has a more tasking role than previously smith said that as members of the european union ireland and the uk were bound together and had a forum for discussions we would be supporting the british and they would be supporting us we were close working colleagues at the council of ministers we built up a great friendship and a great knowledge of one another he said that the taoiseach micheál martin addressed a virtual plenary session of the assembly in february last year and said the assembly should play a greater role than it had in recent years which smith said was warmly welcomed by the british delegation and showed a common desire in promoting the relationship post brexit read next related reads post brexit who are ireland s biggest allies in europe poll will brexit bring northern ireland and the republic closer together or further apart a year into ireland s post brexit relationship with britain what can we expect in 2022 smith gives one way in which cooperation is possible one of the four committees of the assembly is working on a report on the distribution of covid 19 vaccines across britain and ireland and lessons to be learned from both vaccine rollouts another will look at opportunities to increase trade relations when asked whether an upcoming discussion on the protocol would result in flared tensions smith said people can get their point across in a respectful manner we will differ from each other on different matters but our job is to reach a consensus if possible but many of the british assembly delegation were anti brexit members of the labour party and scottish and welsh assemblies and even members of the conservative party were not all in favour of brexit plenty of conservative voices would have opposed brexit i was on the assembly in the early days of the 1990s and it was all about politics resolution to violence after the good friday agreement it moved to maximising the benefits the two countries were getting from the gfa and now its by and large bread and butter issues and brexit issues brexit brought back a more political element to the assembly i ve seen over the years that views don t break down in a british irish context but often views can be different within the british delegation or the irish delegation and there can be a variety of views in the british delegation as it s made up of wales scotland and england we want to see the issues there resolved it s in the best interest of both ireland and britain the uk is more than just david frost s view over in europe a similar parliamentary liaison group has been set up by the eu with the aim of maintaining relations between the european union and its recently departed member state fine gael mep seán kelly was appointed first vice chair of the european parliament s half of the eu uk parliamentary partnership assembly this week and hopes that the group will be able to get a more nuanced diverse view of the uk s aims than the top leaders can boris johnson and ursula von der leyen share an elbow bump 2021 alamy stock photo alamy stock photo though westminster s 35 members have not yet been appointed kelly has stressed that if it is a cross party group and includes representation from northern ireland it could make a difference when asked if the group could smooth out the paths between the leaders kelly said very much so because if we get a similar cross party group in the uk you re not depending on david frost to get the united kingdom s view i can see why in some respects why because i would say johnson wants to own this if you have a broader political group from the uk it would allow for far greater cooperation when asked whether the rest of europe is sick of brexit as has been suggested kelly said i would say its true of the general population and that s very understandable but not for parliament there s a long way to go yet with relations with the uk if they re willing to play ball there are plans that the assembly would meet in brussels london and possibly northern ireland and that it would help guide post brexit relations from the top table kelly mentions that security defence and data transfers and probably relations with the united states would be areas for future eu uk cooperation also where trade is working out where we can improve and try to be flexibile we all have obligations to find areas of cooperation where it s possible relationships will continue to be vital a british government spokesperson said in a statement to the journal maintaining the long standing historical relationship with our closest neighbour remains of the utmost importance to the prime minister and wider government in a 12 paragraph statement a dfa spokesperson said that ireland s relationship with the uk will continue to be vital as both populations are profoundly intertwined and we will always be close neighbours trading partners and co guarantors of the good friday agreement the government remains committed to strengthening our relationship with the uk post brexit our actions have demonstrated this we have invested in our footprint and relationships across the uk and prioritised political engagement the statement references the new consulates in manchester and cardiff and deepening ties with the devolved administrations in edinburgh and cardiff the statement also said that government visits to the uk have increased sharply since the summer the taoiseach ministers and parliamentarians have been prioritising east west and north south engagement the taoiseach and prime minister are in regular contact ministers and senior officials from across government have continued to meet with their uk counterparts frequently with the number of visits to the uk increasing

washington ap government reports on rising inflation and the potential costs of president joe biden s social and environment legislation raised fresh questions friday about the bill s fate with both sides hoping the new numbers would influence pivotal sen joe manchin the moderate manchin d w va has spent months forcing democrats to trim the 10 year 2 trillion package arguing it s too expensive and at times citing growing inflation as a reason to slow work on the bill on friday the labor department said consumer prices grew last month at an annual rate of 6 8 the highest in 39 years a separate report from the nonpartisan congressional budget office said that if many of the bill s temporary spending boosts and tax cuts were made permanent it would add 3 trillion to the price tag that would more than double its 10 year cost to around 5 trillion democrats called the projections from the republican requested report fictitious manchin aides did not respond to requests for comment manchin said in a brief interview thursday that he wanted to know where we are in inflation and where we are on the true price of the bill adding he was very concerned the latest inflation figures prompted biden to use some of his strongest language yet telling reporters at the white house on friday i think this is the peak of the crisis while the numbers illustrate a clear political danger for the administration the recent performance of financial markets suggests investors don t see inflation as a long term problem friday s reports popped out two weeks before christmas by when senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y hopes to end months of talks among democrats and finally push a compromise bill through the senate the house approved an initial version last month with manchin still seeking cuts in a measure that originally cost 3 5 trillion the day s reports at the least increased his leverage in a tortuous process that s already seen several near death moments caused by democratic infighting at worst the numbers fueled worries that manchin might abandon the package sinking it i don t know the answer to that biden said at the white house when asked if he could win manchin s support he said he d talk to the lawmaker early next week every democrat in the 50 50 chamber will have to back the bill so vice president kamala harris can cast a tie breaking vote to approve it the political sensitivity of inflation and its impact on the democratic bill a collection of family services health care and climate change priorities was illustrated as leaders of both parties tried to spin the numbers to their advantage democrats argued that the inflation report intensified the need to approve the measure they said the legislation s spending and tax credits for health care children s costs education and other programs would help families cope with rising prices most of the bill is paid for with tax boosts on the wealthy and big corporations the legislation s impact will be reducing costs for ordinary people biden said republicans said the legislation s expenditures would further feed inflation which has been driven by supply chain delays making products less available and spending prompted by a strong underlying economy senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said inflation means the average american has gotten a pay cut adding it is unthinkable that senate democrats would try to respond to this inflation report by ramming through another massive socialist spending package in a matter of days possibly mitigating the political impact of friday s inflation numbers was that they were expected and represented a modest rise from october s 6 2 adding any additional juice to the economy might worsen inflation but the extra fiscal stimulus over the next several years in democrats bill would be less than 1 the size of the entire u s economy making its likely inflationary impact mild said the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget democrats limited the duration of many initiatives in their package to help contain the bill s price tag that includes extending enhancements to the child tax credit for just one year and free universal pre school for only six years it s an accounting move both parties have used to make their budget plans seem more affordable even though they would like their proposals to be permanent and some may be extended because they are popular republicans used such phaseouts robustly for their big tax cuts in 2001 and 2017 if you believe these programs go away after one two or three years you shouldn t have a driver s license said sen lindsey graham of south carolina top republican on the senate budget committee who requested the cbo estimates he said the bill s higher price tag and rising inflation meant democrats legislation would be lethal to the economy and lethal to your paycheck democrats argued the estimated added 3 trillion cost was bogus because if they decided to seek any future extensions of their initiatives they would propose savings to pay for them as if sharing a script psaki called the gop claims fundamentally dishonest and senate majority leader chuck schumer d

by stephen nellis reuters research teams at intel corp nasdaq on saturday unveiled work that the company believes will help it keep speeding up and shrinking computing chips over the next ten years with several technologies aimed at stacking parts of chips on top of each other intel s research components group introduced the work in papers at an international conference being held in san francisco the silicon valley company is working to regain a lead in making the smallest fastest chips that it has lost in recent years to rivals like taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co and samsung electronics otc co ltd while intel ceo pat gelsinger has laid out commercial plans aimed at regaining that lead by 2025 the research work unveiled saturday gives a look into how intel plans to compete beyond 2025 one of the ways intel is packing more computing power into chips by stacking up tiles or chiplets in three dimensions rather than making chips all as one two dimension piece intel showed work saturday that could allow for 10 times as many connections between stacked tiles meaning that more complex tiles can be stacked on top of one another but perhaps the biggest advance showed saturday was a research paper demonstrating a way to stack transistors tiny switches that form the most basic building bocks of chips by representing the 1s and 0s of digital logic on top of one another intel believes the technology will yield a 30 to 50 increase in the number of transistors it can pack into a given area on a chip raising the number of transistors is the main reason chips have consistently gotten faster over the past 50 years by stacking the devices directly on top of each other we re clearly saving area paul fischer director and senior principal engineer of intel s components research group told reuters in an interview we re reducing interconnect lengths and really saving energy making this not only more cost efficient but also better performing
washington government reports on rising inflation and the potential costs of president joe biden s social and environment legislation raised fresh questions friday about the bill s fate with both sides hoping the new numbers would influence pivotal sen joe manchin the moderate manchin d w va has spent months forcing democrats to trim the 10 year 2 trillion package arguing it s too expensive and at times citing growing inflation as a reason to slow work on the bill on friday the labor department said consumer prices grew last month at an annual rate of 6 8 the highest in 39 years a separate report from the nonpartisan congressional budget office said that if many of the bill s temporary spending boosts and tax cuts were made permanent it would add 3 trillion to the price tag that would more than double its 10 year cost to around 5 trillion democrats called the projections from the republican requested report fictitious manchin aides did not respond to requests for comment manchin said in a brief interview thursday that he wanted to know where we are in inflation and where we are on the true price of the bill adding he was very concerned

adrian florido host it was almost five years ago that the u s territory of puerto rico declared bankruptcy the island was buckling under more than 70 billion of public debt plus 50 billion in pension obligations it didn t have the money for since then a fiscal oversight board appointed by the u s congress has been negotiating to try to get puerto rico s creditors to accept less money than they re owed now a major deal has been reached and a federal bankruptcy judge is considering whether to approve it puerto rico s governor and legislature support the deal saying it s the territory s only chance to emerge from bankruptcy but the deal also has many critics who say it doesn t do enough to make puerto rico s debt affordable to discuss this deal we re joined by the woman who negotiated it natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico ms jaresko welcome natalie jaresko thank you florido i d like to start by asking you to give me just a sort of very brief sense of the magnitude of puerto rico s debt jaresko so as you said earlier adrian when the financial oversight board was established in 2016 it was a result of having accumulated over 70 billion of debt across a dozen or more issuers and an incremental 50 55 billion in unfunded pension liabilities and compare that to gnp of about 80 billion a year that is an overwhelming debt level for this island florido and so why do you consider this deal that you ve reached with puerto rico s creditors now a good one what does it achieve jaresko so this plan takes us out of bankruptcy and it does it in a affordable sustainable way it resolves about half of that debt that i described so about 30 35 billion of claims against the commonwealth against the territorial government and a large portion about 50 billion of the pension unfunded liabilities and so it accomplishes everything i think the promesa s set out to accomplish it ensures that the debt is reduced it ensures that the lawsuits are resolved it provides stability so that investment can return to the island and it provides confidence that because it is a sustainable level of debt that the government will be able to use all incremental revenues all incremental funds going forward to improve the situation on the island whether it s education public safety or other florido you mentioned promesa i should just note that that is the federal law that essentially established puerto rico rico s ability to declare bankruptcy and also created the board that you now lead as i mentioned puerto rico s governor pedro pierluisi and its legislature both support this deal but the deal has faced many criticisms from some prominent economists from a lot of everyday puerto ricans i want to ask you about a couple of those criticisms and the first is this argument that this deal is actually not affordable for the island because when you add other obligations like its pension obligations and the rest of its debt that is not part of this deal the government is still going to be devoting a really large chunk of its annual budget to paying off its creditors rather than on essential public services what do you say to that jaresko it s not true people are misunderstanding the numbers if you look at what it was prior to bankruptcy the government was spending approximately 25 cents of every dollar of taxpayer revenues on debt after this bankruptcy is finished it will be paying 7 cents of every dollar it s a substantial reduction in debt service it s a reduction of 50 billion over the life of the debt i think the other thing people don t recognize is that we limited the debt to less than 8 of revenues and that is something that is a very reasonable level it is an affordable level to pay approximately 8 of your less than 8 of your revenues towards debt florido another criticism of this deal is that you know some of puerto rico s richest and most powerful creditors like banks and hedge funds that own a lot of puerto rico s debt are making off with a profit whereas others like retired teachers for example will never see another cost of living increase to their pensions again i d like you to listen to daniel santamaria ots an economist who spoke to me about the fact that a lot of the territory s debt is owned by banks and hedge funds that scooped up government bonds after their value had tanked listen to what he said daniel santamaria ots so a very cheap price for them and they are going to have returns of investment right now of three four five times what they invested and those returns are at the expense of people of puerto rico the behavior of the hedge funds it s legal so far but it s an unethical and unfair and unjust outcome florido legal but unethical and unfair do you agree with his assessment and if so why could you not have pushed these creditors to give up a little bit more jaresko we have done everything within the law within federal bankruptcy law and i think that s really an important element to understand here this isn t a sovereign debt negotiation without rules this is something promesa put us into the u s federal court system and u s bankruptcy rules promesa and bankruptcy rules one thing that those rules do is they don t allow you to discriminate between holders you don t know who the ultimate holder is when you re making this when you re having this negotiation what their cost basis is which is what daniel is referring to is not an issue not a relevant issue in bankruptcy so it s unfair and unjust i don t believe applies because it is the fairness the justness of it is exactly what the judge is going to be determining when she confirms or when she issues her decision florido natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico natalie thanks for joining us jaresko thank you soundbite of the marias song spin me around transcript provided by npr copyright npr

waltham mass business wire allovir nasdaq alvr a late clinical stage allogeneic t cell immunotherapy company today announced preliminary data from the ongoing open label portion of a phase 2 study assessing the safety and efficacy of posoleucel viralym m alvr105 for the prevention of clinically significant infections and end organ diseases from six potentially life threatening viruses in high risk patients following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation allo hct out of 23 patients who received at least one dose of posoleucel in the ongoing study including those who completed discontinued or are continuing posoleucel only three clinically significant infections were observed through week 14 and no patients developed end organ viral disease as of the data cut off for this preliminary analysis of the 13 patients who completed through the week 14 primary endpoint 11 remained free of clinically significant infection these initial results represent a substantial reduction in the expected rate of clinically significant viral infections or diseases in this high risk patient population repeat dosing of posoleucel was generally well tolerated these data were presented today at the 63rd american society of hematology ash annual meeting and exposition based on preliminary data from this phase 2 study the u s food and drug administration fda has agreed in principle with the company s plan to advance from this phase 2 open label study into a phase 3 registrational trial the company plans to initiate this study in the first half of 2022 following fda review of the final protocol posoleucel the company s lead investigational product is an allogeneic off the shelf virus specific t cell vst therapy being evaluated for the prevention of six potentially life threatening viruses that commonly impact allo hct patients adenovirus adv bk virus bkv cytomegalovirus cmv epstein barr virus ebv human herpesvirus 6 hhv 6 and jc virus jcv nearly 90 of all allo hct patients will reactivate at least one of these viruses following allo hct and approximately two thirds of these patients reactivate multiple viruses based on an analysis of peer reviewed published data and electronic medical record reviews approximately 70 of high risk allo hct patients develop clinically significant infection or end organ disease from one or more of these viruses following allo hct there are currently no effective preventive therapies that can target these multiple viruses simultaneously resulting in significant and prolonged morbidity hospitalization and premature death viral infections frequently occur after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant and commonly lead to serious complications that can be life threatening and negatively impact patient survival treatment is often complicated by adverse effects of antiviral medications that do not address the underlying issue the immune deficient state said sanjeet dadwal m d chief division of infectious diseases and professor of medicine city of hope and posoleucel study investigator posoleucel has the potential to address the underlying immune deficit that leaves these patients vulnerable to viral infections and aims to work as a bridge to eventual immune reconstitution of the patient the ability to prevent six serious viral infections or diseases in high risk situations such as soon after allo hct would be a significant advancement minimizing the downstream effects of these viral infections we are encouraged and excited by these positive data that support the potential for posoleucel to change the treatment paradigm for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients moving upstream to prevent viral infections or diseases before they occur said diana brainard m d chief executive officer allovir based on the strength of these data and the tremendous unmet medical need we look forward to working with urgency with regulators and the transplant community to initiate a global phase 3 multi virus prevention study in the coming months which in combination with our other posoleucel phase 3 treatment studies for virus associated hemorrhagic cystitis and adenovirus present a critically important opportunity to better serve allo hct patients overview of the multi virus prevention study open label preliminary data this two part multicenter randomized double blind placebo controlled study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of posoleucel for the prevention of six viral infections adv bkv cmv ebv hhv 6 and jcv the phase 2 open label portion of this study is enrolling 25 high risk allo hct patients patients receive up to seven biweekly posoleucel infusions and are tested for viremia by polymerase chain reaction pcr on a weekly basis against all six viruses over a period of 14 weeks following this dosing period patients receive follow up through week 26 at the time of the data cut off for this preliminary analysis 23 high risk allo hct patients received at least a single dose of posoleucel including 13 patients who had completed through week 14 one patient who discontinued the study and nine patients whose evaluation for the primary endpoint is ongoing of these patients 14 61 received cells from haploidentical donors six 26 from mismatched unrelated donors two 9 from matched unrelated donors with t cell depletion or with lymphopenia and one 4 from umbilical cord blood in this preliminary analysis high risk allo hct patients receiving posoleucel experienced no end organ disease and had rates of clinically significant viral infections substantially lower than the expected rate estimated through an analysis of peer reviewed published data and electronic medical record reviews the primary study endpoint is the number of new onset clinically significant infections or end organ disease through week 14 among the 23 patients who received at least a single dose of posoleucel only three of 138 possible clinically significant infections from these six common and life threatening viruses were observed through 14 weeks three out of 23 patients experienced one clinically significant viral infection each specifically two patients initiated preemptive cmv treatment with valganciclovir following withdrawal of letermovir and one patient started rituximab for ebv in the setting of receiving high dose steroids repeat posoleucel dosing has been generally well tolerated with no unanticipated safety signals the observed rates and severity of graft versus host disease did not exceed those expected in this high risk

we know that hedge funds generate strong risk adjusted returns over the long run therefore imitating the picks that they are collectively bullish on can be a profitable strategy for retail investors with billions of dollars in assets smart money investors have to conduct complex analyses spend many resources and use tools that are not always available for the general crowd this doesn t mean that they don t have occasional colossal losses they do like melvin capital s recent gamestop losses however it is still a good idea to keep an eye on hedge fund activity with this in mind as the current

adrian florido host it was almost five years ago that the u s territory of puerto rico declared bankruptcy the island was buckling under more than 70 billion of public debt plus 50 billion in pension obligations it didn t have the money for since then a fiscal oversight board appointed by the u s congress has been negotiating to try to get puerto rico s creditors to accept less money than they re owed now a major deal has been reached and a federal bankruptcy judge is considering whether to approve it puerto rico s governor and legislature support the deal saying it s the territory s only chance to emerge from bankruptcy but the deal also has many critics who say it doesn t do enough to make puerto rico s debt affordable to discuss this deal we re joined by the woman who negotiated it natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico ms jaresko welcome natalie jaresko thank you florido i d like to start by asking you to give me just a sort of very brief sense of the magnitude of puerto rico s debt jaresko so as you said earlier adrian when the financial oversight board was established in 2016 it was a result of having accumulated over 70 billion of debt across a dozen or more issuers and an incremental 50 55 billion in unfunded pension liabilities and compare that to gnp of about 80 billion a year that is an overwhelming debt level for this island florido and so why do you consider this deal that you ve reached with puerto rico s creditors now a good one what does it achieve jaresko so this plan takes us out of bankruptcy and it does it in a affordable sustainable way it resolves about half of that debt that i described so about 30 35 billion of claims against the commonwealth against the territorial government and a large portion about 50 billion of the pension unfunded liabilities and so it accomplishes everything i think the promesa s set out to accomplish it ensures that the debt is reduced it ensures that the lawsuits are resolved it provides stability so that investment can return to the island and it provides confidence that because it is a sustainable level of debt that the government will be able to use all incremental revenues all incremental funds going forward to improve the situation on the island whether it s education public safety or other florido you mentioned promesa i should just note that that is the federal law that essentially established puerto rico rico s ability to declare bankruptcy and also created the board that you now lead as i mentioned puerto rico s governor pedro pierluisi and its legislature both support this deal but the deal has faced many criticisms from some prominent economists from a lot of everyday puerto ricans i want to ask you about a couple of those criticisms and the first is this argument that this deal is actually not affordable for the island because when you add other obligations like its pension obligations and the rest of its debt that is not part of this deal the government is still going to be devoting a really large chunk of its annual budget to paying off its creditors rather than on essential public services what do you say to that jaresko it s not true people are misunderstanding the numbers if you look at what it was prior to bankruptcy the government was spending approximately 25 cents of every dollar of taxpayer revenues on debt after this bankruptcy is finished it will be paying 7 cents of every dollar it s a substantial reduction in debt service it s a reduction of 50 billion over the life of the debt i think the other thing people don t recognize is that we limited the debt to less than 8 of revenues and that is something that is a very reasonable level it is an affordable level to pay approximately 8 of your less than 8 of your revenues towards debt florido another criticism of this deal is that you know some of puerto rico s richest and most powerful creditors like banks and hedge funds that own a lot of puerto rico s debt are making off with a profit whereas others like retired teachers for example will never see another cost of living increase to their pensions again i d like you to listen to daniel santamaria ots an economist who spoke to me about the fact that a lot of the territory s debt is owned by banks and hedge funds that scooped up government bonds after their value had tanked listen to what he said daniel santamaria ots so a very cheap price for them and they are going to have returns of investment right now of three four five times what they invested and those returns are at the expense of people of puerto rico the behavior of the hedge funds it s legal so far but it s an unethical and unfair and unjust outcome florido legal but unethical and unfair do you agree with his assessment and if so why could you not have pushed these creditors to give up a little bit more jaresko we have done everything within the law within federal bankruptcy law and i think that s really an important element to understand here this isn t a sovereign debt negotiation without rules this is something promesa put us into the u s federal court system and u s bankruptcy rules promesa and bankruptcy rules one thing that those rules do is they don t allow you to discriminate between holders you don t know who the ultimate holder is when you re making this when you re having this negotiation what their cost basis is which is what daniel is referring to is not an issue not a relevant issue in bankruptcy so it s unfair and unjust i don t believe applies because it is the fairness the justness of it is exactly what the judge is going to be determining when she confirms or when she issues her decision florido natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico natalie thanks for joining us jaresko thank you soundbite of the marias song spin me around transcript provided by npr copyright npr

are continuing to advance pbcar19b our immune evading stealth cell candidate in a relapsed and or refractory r r patient population with non hodgkin s lymphoma nhl in pursuit of a potential best in class cd19 targeting allogeneic product candidate first in class approach pbcar0191 the updated data from the pbcar0191 phase 1 2a study included 22 17 nhl 5 b all heavily pre treated r r subjects with predominantly advanced or aggressive b cell malignancies who were evaluable as of november 16 2021 evaluable subjects received a median 5 lines of prior treatment including 27 6 22 who previously received a cd19 directed autologous car t for patients that received treatment of pbcar0191 following eld as of november 16 2021 pbcar0191 showed no grade 3 cytokine release syndrome crs one grade 3 immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome icans with resolution to grade 2 in 72 hours no evidence of graft versus host disease and one infectious death at day 54 deemed possibly related to treatment 2 pbcar0191 yielded an overall response rate of 73 and a complete response rate of 59 using a 3 x 10 6 cells kg cell dose cells kg cell dose four responders among the 17 evaluable nhl subjects reached day 180 durability assessment most notably a potential signal for pbcar0191 was observed among six subjects that previously received an autologous car t 100 of these patients responded and 66 experienced a complete response at day 28 more than half of these patients had a longer duration of response on pbcar0191 than with the prior autologous car t treatment today there are no fda approved therapeutics for lymphoma patients who have relapsed following auto car t therapy pbcar0191 has the potential to be developed as a salvage treatment for this growing population with high unmet need and we are actively enrolling additional patients in this relapse setting to further validate this observed activity said bijal shah m d associate professor malignant hematology department h lee moffitt cancer center and research institute best in class approach pbcar19b immune evading stealth cell the phase 1 clinical study of pbcar19b is actively enrolling subjects with r r nhl flat doses of pbcar19b car t cells following standard lymphodepletion sld 3 are administered starting at dose level 1 2 7 108 car t cells the company has dosed the first three subjects at dose level 1 in parallel to our development with pbcar0191 we are continuing to enroll patients in the pbcar19b clinical trial and expect to share initial results for this program in mid 2022 said alan list m d chief medical officer of precision biosciences unique attributes of arcus designed to make complex gene edits in a single step may allow pbcar19b to achieve a best in class allogeneic product profile to potentially displace cd19 directed autologous car t pbcar19b is a novel immune evading stealth cell candidate employing a single gene edit to knock down beta 2 microglobulin designed for evading t cell rejection while also inserting an hla e transgene to further evade rejection from natural killer cells precision biosciences car t cells are the only allogeneic car t cells in human clinical trials made with a single gene editing step designed to specifically avoid the potentially deleterious effects of making multiple edits to t cells pbcar269a phase 1 2a program update pbcar269a is an investigational allogeneic car t immunotherapy targeting b cell maturation antigen for the treatment of r r multiple myeloma the following has been observed among 14 patients that have been evaluated for clinical activity and safety across four dose levels of pbcar269a4 monotherapy following sld no grade 3 crs or icans dose dependent increase in pbcar269a peak expansion overall pbcar269a monotherapy response observed in the phase 1 2a trial was not comparable with autologous car t profiles therefore precision is continuing to enroll subjects with pbcar269a in combination with nirogacestat a gamma secretase inhibitor developed by springworks therapeutics in pursuit of a potential therapeutic index comparable with or better than autologous car t initial clinical data from the combination cohort is expected to be presented in mid 2022 the company s balance of cash and cash equivalents was approximately 152 million as of november 30 2021 the company continues to expect that existing cash and cash equivalents expected operational receipts and available credit will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2023

david mark columnist maynard s various histories futures name nine co operative associations or societies the oldest was riverside the newest assabet co op market the longest duration and largest was the united co operative society a department of labor report for 1947 mentioned that united was one of the top 10 co ops in the country for membership and annual sales more than half the households in maynard were members the backstory of co operatives began in 1844 when a group of 28 weavers in rochdale england organized the rochdale society of equitable pioneers and opened their first store with a small stock of flour oatmeal butter and sugar they soon added tea tobacco and candles their guidelines formed the basis for the principles on which co operatives around the world continue to operate the rochdale pioneers became highly successful with 1 400 members by 1855 and 5 560 members by 1870 able to shop at many stores there had been earlier attempts to establish co operatives that were basically buyer s clubs which by pooling their purchases were able to buy at wholesale prices and sell to members at below retail prices the rochdale pioneers innovated by adding profit sharing to members based on a percentage of the cost of the goods the members purchased i e a patronage dividend the seven rochdale principles open membership democratic control distribution of surplus money limited interest on capital political and religious neutrality no buying on credit and promotion via education here in maynard riverside was started in 1875 by english and scottish immigrants many of them may have been familiar with the co operative movement in great britain riverside began as a chapter in an american movement the order of the sovereigns of industry this was an urban workers organization modelled on the grange a farmers organization formally known as the order of patrons of husbandry sovereigns was in effect a buyers club nationally the sovereigns organization faltered under financial mismanagement but in 1878 the local chapter reformed itself as the riverside co operative association incorporating rochdale principles shares were 5 each equivalent to about 125 in today s dollars members limited to 60 shares the total capital investment was 1 500 per the by laws regardless of how many shares owned each shareholder had one vote the operation started in the basement of the darling block building moved to the riverside block later gruber bros furniture and then in 1882 built its own building at the southwest corner of summer and nason the building was a four story wooden edifice with the store entrance on nason street the other floors were rented out by 1909 riverside had more than 600 member families in addition to quality of goods and competitive prices members were paid a yearly cash refund ranging from 2 to 10 based on how good a year the co op was having additionally shares earned 5 interest a decline started with the recession of 1920 compounded by cost of repair after a fire same year in 1929 the store business was sold to the store manager while the co op continued to own the building a large fire in january 1936 led to dissolution of the association and sale of the site to knights of columbus which had been a longtime tenant proceeds were divided amongst the remaining shareholders contributing factors to the end of riverside were that the children of the founders were moving up the socioeconomic ladder at same time as immigration from england and scotland was declining a front page newspaper article from 1913 had noted that prior to 1900 the town was mostly english origin but expansion of the mill under new ownership had doubled the town s population by bringing in large numbers of immigrants from finland poland lithuania and italy of the smaller and shorter lived efforts suomalainen osuuskauppa was started 1899 by finnish immigrants capitalized at only 800 it lasted a year before dissolving and selling its store to a private owner the maynard co operative milk association was formed in 1914 three years later it become the diary operations of kaleva co operative association finnish members of the milk co op who had not wanted to affiliate with the socialist communist atheist kaleva had previously split off and formed the first national association in late 1915 it owned and operated out of a building on the west corner of main and river streets until its demise in 1941 the international co operative association was started in 1911 by immigrants from poland and lasted 20 years it began in a building near the methodist church later moved to space in the masonic building 100 main st membership numbered 200 to 400 over the years first national and international failed in part because of extending credit to members during the great depression the historical society has a share certificate for the proposed russian co operative association dated 1917 the group did not reach its capitalization goal instead operating briefly as a store co owned by six russian men as for the largest and longest lasting kaleva refers to an ancient mythological finnish ruler known from a 19th century work of epic poetry and storytelling compiled by folklorist researcher elias lonnrot the work the kalevala is regarded as the national epic of finland instrumental in fostering a sense of finnish national identity that culminated in the finnish declaration of independence from russian rule in 1917 locally immigrants had formed the finnish workingmen s socialist society in 1903 from whom the 187 founders of the co operative were drawn according to a book the finnish imprint a delegation of finnish immigrants had initially approached the riverside co operative association with the idea of becoming members because many of the recent immigrants did not speak english they asked that the co operative hire finnish store clerks this suggestion was rebuffed with a reply that if they did not like the service they received they should start their own store they did the business was initially capitalized at 1 600 from sale of 320 shares at 5 per share the initial location was a rented storefront at 56 main st by 1912 the co operative had bought the entire two story building soon after added a bakery operation a dairy with home delivery and a restaurant on the second floor serving meals to hundreds of workers living in neighboring boarding houses maynard was not the only home to a finnish organized co operative fitchburg has the into co operative and quincy the turva co operative in 1919 maynard and these and others merged to create the united co operative society of new england this was short lived due to financial and political disagreements the end result being that maynard s kaleva group reorganized as the united co operative society of maynard united s by laws had added an eighth principle to the previously describe rochdale seven continuous expansion over the initial 50 years membership grew from 184 to 2 960 members as coal and firewood 1924 fuel oil 1933 and ice 1934 delivery were added in addition to the main street store a branch store was opened on the northeast corner of waltham and powdermill roads 1926 superseded by moving the branch store operations to a new building at the northwest corner of the same intersection 1936 this remained active until it was sold to murphy and snyder printers in 1957 next door now the seven eleven dunkin store was an automobile gas and service station 1934 a credit union was added in 1948 a report by the u s bureau of labor at that time stated that the united co operative society of maynard was one of the 10 largest in the country calculated either by number of members or annual sales and was also one of the 10 oldest more than half the households in maynard belonged to united at its peak the co operative had more than 50 full time employees with medical benefits and life insurance unusual for that era united survived the competition from an a p supermarket operating on nason street in the building now housing the outdoor store but the presence of victory supermarket on powder mill road combined with the freedom to shop elsewhere provided by increasing car ownership put pressure on the co operative in june 1973 that was a near unanimous vote to dissolve united s by laws had an interesting clause on the occasion of dissolution the assets would be used to pay the purchase value of the outstanding shares any surplus would go to the co operative league of the united states rather than to members and now there is an effort underway to launch assabet co op market our mission is to support the regional food system strengthen the local economy promote the well being of our members our community and the environment and be a center of community activity the beginnings date to february 2012 when a small group of people met to discuss forming a co op the cost of membership was set at 200 to date more than 1 700 people have joined the co op has achieved its capitalization goal of 2 million in the form of interest paying owner investment which in combination with traditional bank financing will be sufficient to lease space at victory plaza 86 powder mill road maynard and then convert it into a store with approximately 6 000 square feet of retail space with free parking once launched assabet co op market intends to make a point of sourcing food from local farms and if all goes as planned maynard will once again be a co operative town 145 years after the start of the first on dec 14 at 7 p m the maynard public library will present a zoom talk titled maynard s many co operatives register at

adrian florido host it was almost five years ago that the u s territory of puerto rico declared bankruptcy the island was buckling under more than 70 billion of public debt plus 50 billion in pension obligations it didn t have the money for since then a fiscal oversight board appointed by the u s congress has been negotiating to try to get puerto rico s creditors to accept less money than they re owed now a major deal has been reached and a federal bankruptcy judge is considering whether to approve it puerto rico s governor and legislature support the deal saying it s the territory s only chance to emerge from bankruptcy but the deal also has many critics who say it doesn t do enough to make puerto rico s debt affordable to discuss this deal we re joined by the woman who negotiated it natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico ms jaresko welcome natalie jaresko thank you florido i d like to start by asking you to give me just a sort of very brief sense of the magnitude of puerto rico s debt jaresko so as you said earlier adrian when the financial oversight board was established in 2016 it was a result of having accumulated over 70 billion of debt across a dozen or more issuers and an incremental 50 55 billion in unfunded pension liabilities and compare that to gnp of about 80 billion a year that is an overwhelming debt level for this island florido and so why do you consider this deal that you ve reached with puerto rico s creditors now a good one what does it achieve jaresko so this plan takes us out of bankruptcy and it does it in a affordable sustainable way it resolves about half of that debt that i described so about 30 35 billion of claims against the commonwealth against the territorial government and a large portion about 50 billion of the pension unfunded liabilities and so it accomplishes everything i think the promesa s set out to accomplish it ensures that the debt is reduced it ensures that the lawsuits are resolved it provides stability so that investment can return to the island and it provides confidence that because it is a sustainable level of debt that the government will be able to use all incremental revenues all incremental funds going forward to improve the situation on the island whether it s education public safety or other florido you mentioned promesa i should just note that that is the federal law that essentially established puerto rico rico s ability to declare bankruptcy and also created the board that you now lead as i mentioned puerto rico s governor pedro pierluisi and its legislature both support this deal but the deal has faced many criticisms from some prominent economists from a lot of everyday puerto ricans i want to ask you about a couple of those criticisms and the first is this argument that this deal is actually not affordable for the island because when you add other obligations like its pension obligations and the rest of its debt that is not part of this deal the government is still going to be devoting a really large chunk of its annual budget to paying off its creditors rather than on essential public services what do you say to that jaresko it s not true people are misunderstanding the numbers if you look at what it was prior to bankruptcy the government was spending approximately 25 cents of every dollar of taxpayer revenues on debt after this bankruptcy is finished it will be paying 7 cents of every dollar it s a substantial reduction in debt service it s a reduction of 50 billion over the life of the debt i think the other thing people don t recognize is that we limited the debt to less than 8 of revenues and that is something that is a very reasonable level it is an affordable level to pay approximately 8 of your less than 8 of your revenues towards debt florido another criticism of this deal is that you know some of puerto rico s richest and most powerful creditors like banks and hedge funds that own a lot of puerto rico s debt are making off with a profit whereas others like retired teachers for example will never see another cost of living increase to their pensions again i d like you to listen to daniel santamaria ots an economist who spoke to me about the fact that a lot of the territory s debt is owned by banks and hedge funds that scooped up government bonds after their value had tanked listen to what he said daniel santamaria ots so a very cheap price for them and they are going to have returns of investment right now of three four five times what they invested and those returns are at the expense of people of puerto rico the behavior of the hedge funds it s legal so far but it s an unethical and unfair and unjust outcome florido legal but unethical and unfair do you agree with his assessment and if so why could you not have pushed these creditors to give up a little bit more jaresko we have done everything within the law within federal bankruptcy law and i think that s really an important element to understand here this isn t a sovereign debt negotiation without rules this is something promesa put us into the u s federal court system and u s bankruptcy rules promesa and bankruptcy rules one thing that those rules do is they don t allow you to discriminate between holders you don t know who the ultimate holder is when you re making this when you re having this negotiation what their cost basis is which is what daniel is referring to is not an issue not a relevant issue in bankruptcy so it s unfair and unjust i don t believe applies because it is the fairness the justness of it is exactly what the judge is going to be determining when she confirms or when she issues her decision florido natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial

medics have been told to start preparing for the mass vaccination of children as young as five years old leaked documents have revealed the nhs england papers are believed to say that parental consent will be needed to vaccinate five to 11 year olds once plans are approved by regulators they also state that the environment in which primary school children are given the covid 19 jab must be age appropriate according to the times the documents reportedly said the vaccination process should be plotted through the eyes of a child in a bid to reassure younger patients it comes after sage experts have warned that britain s recent surge in covid cases is now being driven by children there have been at least two confirmed outbreaks of the new super mutant omicron strain in english primary schools the mass rollout of the covid jab for 12 to 15 year olds began in england in september with just 44 per cent having been vaccinated since children aged 12 17 are being offered two pfizer doses 12 weeks apart britain has been slower than other countries in vaccinating children as the european medicines agency approved use of the pfizer jab at one third strength for five to 11 year olds on november 25 the us also approved the vaccine for use in primary school children last month but a mere 17 per cent have so far been given the jab the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra is currently moving at pace to approve vaccines in the age group with a decision expected next week and the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation jcvi won t hang around on recommending no10 starts dishing them out across the country one member claimed vaccinating very young children still makes many scientists uneasy due to the vanishingly low risk posed to them their concerns are amplified due to the slight risk of myocarditis an ultra rare form of heart inflammation spotted in some young people after they are jabbed it comes after professor john edmunds an epidemiologist at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine called for jabs for five to 11 year olds as soon as possible speaking at royal society of medicine event today professor edmunds said we ve had a large number of cases over the last few months and unfortunately high numbers of hospitalisations and 100 to 150 deaths a day i m not saying all of that has been driven by children but much of it unfortunately has so from taking a population perspective i think it s it s pretty clear we do need to vaccinate our children as well as everybody else cases have been highest in under 18s since early november with more than 32 000 recorded per day last week compared to less than 2 000 in over 75s according to zoe data published what are the risks of covid and vaccines to five year olds covid most children only experience mild symptoms after being infected with covid just one in 300 000 children who test positive for covid die according to uk government data and the risk of being hospitalised and getting admitted to icu is similarly low but the risk is higher to children with serious underlying conditions the jcvi has yet to release its updated guidance on vaccinating children aged 11 and under but its latest advice on recommending first jabs to over 12s suggested one pfizer dose only prevents 131 hospital admissions per million 12 15 year olds and second doses only prevent nine hospital admissions for every million dished out to the age group the figures are likely to be less for five to eleven year old who are less vulnerable to the virus vaccines myocarditis an ultrarare form of heart inflammation is the main side effect of the pfizer vaccine that concerns experts data shows the risk is slightly higher in adolescents than adults particularly in boys the jcvi has not released data on how many cases are expected in children aged five to 11 but studies show children in younger age groups are less at risk than teenagers it found myocarditis cases in between 2 6 to 17 7 million first vaccine doses in children aged 12 to 15 and the condition was found in between 20 9 to 42 2 children in the age group per million second doses dished out advertisement in the uk on saturday another 54 073 daily covid cases were recorded some 663 of which were the omicron strain the uk health security agency ukhsa said up from the 448 recorded yesterday it takes the country s total of the new highly transmissible variant up to 1 898 although experts suggest the true number is much higher the jcvi which advises government on vaccine policy was reluctant to recommend jabs in over 12s previously with the decision to extend the rollout taken by britain s four chief medical officers jabs have already been licensed for all over fives in the us australia and the eu but no under 12s are currently able to get a vaccine in the uk yet ireland announced yesterday that it s going ahead with the move in the coming days asked if the roll out should be extended to five year olds in britain professor edmunds said i think so i think if the vaccine is licensed i don t see a strong reason why it shouldn t be used it s licensed in europe for use in children i think also in north america epidemiologically i think there s a strong reason for it overall my view is if it s licensed by the mhra i think that the benefits to risk ratio is is worth it then we should we should introduce it as soon as possible omicron cases are could be spreading even faster in england than in south africa he added he said it is extremely likely there are more cases of the mutant variant in the community than have already been confirmed by testing professor edmunds with the speed of spread of this virus we may well have really significant numbers of cases by christmas i suspect that whatever we do now we are unlikely to overreact the jcvi which holds the final say on recommending the jabs is also thought to be keen on getting vaccines into young children as quickly as possible a jcvi member told the independent i do think that public opinion is shifting about vaccination of younger children which could widen our discussions the us and israel were two of the first countries to begin vaccinating 12 to 15 year olds with the jcvi holding back jabs were approved in 12 to 15 year olds in the uk after experts noticed myocarditis in all age groups was lower than in other countries they believe the 12 week gap in vaccinations in britain helped keep numbers low with a slightly higher risk found in second jabs which were being given out after a three to four week gap in other countries experts also believe the risk of myocarditis is lower in younger children than adolescents pfizer s vaccine is found to prevent two cases of intensive care admission per million healthy children and 100 per million in those with chronic health issues although children mostly only get mild symptoms of covid some public health experts believe immunising them should be a priority to reduce the virus continued spread which could theoretically lead to the emergence of a dangerous new variant it comes after professor john edmunds pictured an epidemiologist at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine called for jabs for five to 11 year olds as soon as possible researchers disagree on the extent to which children have influenced the course of the pandemic early research suggested they did not contribute much to viral spread but some experts say children played a significant role this year spreading the alpha and delta variants and emerging evidence in south africa suggests the omicron strain could be more transmissible in children south african officials warned higher hospital admissions among children during the fourth wave of infections in the country should prompt vigilance but not panic will infections so far being mild a large number of infants admitted with covid last month in tshwane the metropolitan area that includes the capital pretoria raised concerns that the omicron variant could pose greater risks for young children than other coronavirus variants scientists have yet to confirm any link and have cautioned that other factors could be at play ntsakisi maluleke a public health specialist in the gauteng ground zero province said that out of the 1 511 covid positive patients in hospitals in the province 113 were under nine years old a greater proportion than during previous waves of infection we are comforted by clinicians reports that the children have mild disease she said health officials and scientists are investigating what was driving the increased admissions in younger ages and were hoping to provide more clarity in the coming two weeks she said since only a small percentage of south africa s positive covid tests

puerto rico bankruptcy deal negotiator says it will give island long term stability adrian florido host it was almost five years ago that the u s territory of puerto rico declared bankruptcy the island was buckling under more than 70 billion of public debt plus 50 billion in pension obligations it didn t have the money for since then a fiscal oversight board appointed by the u s congress has been negotiating to try to get puerto rico s creditors to accept less money than they re owed now a major deal has been reached and a federal bankruptcy judge is considering whether to approve it puerto rico s governor and legislature support the deal saying it s the territory s only chance to emerge from bankruptcy but the deal also has many critics who say it doesn t do enough to make puerto rico s debt affordable to discuss this deal we re joined by the woman who negotiated it natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico ms jaresko welcome natalie jaresko thank you florido i d like to start by asking you to give me just a sort of very brief sense of the magnitude of puerto rico s debt jaresko so as you said earlier adrian when the financial oversight board was established in 2016 it was a result of having accumulated over 70 billion of debt across a dozen or more issuers and an incremental 50 55 billion in unfunded pension liabilities and compare that to gnp of about 80 billion a year that is an overwhelming debt level for this island florido and so why do you consider this deal that you ve reached with puerto rico s creditors now a good one what does it achieve jaresko so this plan takes us out of bankruptcy and it does it in a affordable sustainable way it resolves about half of that debt that i described so about 30 35 billion of claims against the commonwealth against the territorial government and a large portion about 50 billion of the pension unfunded liabilities and so it accomplishes everything i think the promesa s set out to accomplish it ensures that the debt is reduced it ensures that the lawsuits are resolved it provides stability so that investment can return to the island and it provides confidence that because it is a sustainable level of debt that the government will be able to use all incremental revenues all incremental funds going forward to improve the situation on the island whether it s education public safety or other florido you mentioned promesa i should just note that that is the federal law that essentially established puerto rico rico s ability to declare bankruptcy and also created the board that you now lead as i mentioned puerto rico s governor pedro pierluisi and its legislature both support this deal but the deal has faced many criticisms from some prominent economists from a lot of everyday puerto ricans i want to ask you about a couple of those criticisms and the first is this argument that this deal is actually not affordable for the island because when you add other obligations like its pension obligations and the rest of its debt that is not part of this deal the government is still going to be devoting a really large chunk of its annual budget to paying off its creditors rather than on essential public services what do you say to that jaresko it s not true people are misunderstanding the numbers if you look at what it was prior to bankruptcy the government was spending approximately 25 cents of every dollar of taxpayer revenues on debt after this bankruptcy is finished it will be paying 7 cents of every dollar it s a substantial reduction in debt service it s a reduction of 50 billion over the life of the debt i think the other thing people don t recognize is that we limited the debt to less than 8 of revenues and that is something that is a very reasonable level it is an affordable level to pay approximately 8 of your less than 8 of your revenues towards debt florido another criticism of this deal is that you know some of puerto rico s richest and most powerful creditors like banks and hedge funds that own a lot of puerto rico s debt are making off with a profit whereas others like retired teachers for example will never see another cost of living increase to their pensions again i d like you to listen to daniel santamaria ots an economist who spoke to me about the fact that a lot of the territory s debt is owned by banks and hedge funds that scooped up government bonds after their value had tanked listen to what he said daniel santamaria ots so a very cheap price for them and they are going to have returns of investment right now of three four five times what they invested and those returns are at the expense of people of puerto rico the behavior of the hedge funds it s legal so far but it s an unethical and unfair and unjust outcome florido legal but unethical and unfair do you agree with his assessment and if so why could you not have pushed these creditors to give up a little bit more jaresko we have done everything within the law within federal bankruptcy law and i think that s really an important element to understand here this isn t a sovereign debt negotiation without rules this is something promesa put us into the u s federal court system and u s bankruptcy rules promesa and bankruptcy rules one thing that those rules do is they don t allow you to discriminate between holders you don t know who the ultimate holder is when you re making this when you re having this negotiation what their cost basis is which is what daniel is referring to is not an issue not a relevant issue in bankruptcy so it s unfair and unjust i don t believe applies because it is the fairness the justness of it is exactly what the judge is going to be determining when she confirms or when she issues her decision florido natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico natalie thanks for joining us jaresko thank you soundbite of

hamish mcrae fear inflation s effects on the economy not the impact of the coronavirus variant there is going to be a hit to the world economy from the omicron variant there is no doubt about that here in the uk whatever the government does or doesn t do people are going to cut back on their christmas plans personal prudence not government edict will see to that pretty much the same is happening in every developed country with the result that there will be some sort of pause in the recovery so what will that mean for us in our daily lives there will be a bit of a shift in the way we spend our money instead of spending more on services meals out maybe a foreign trip we will spend more on things that is what happened during previous curbs and it will happen again but overall we will spend less that won t be a catastrophe but it may mean that instead of the uk economy being back up to its pre covid size by now that will take another couple of months where we may see some lasting effect is on inflation the more disruption there is the more prices will climb that is happening on a massive scale in the us where annual consumer price inflation is now 6 8 per cent that is the highest since the early 1980s something that has not happened in most people s working lives we get the uk numbers this week and while i can t see the consumer prices index getting there last month s retail price index was 6 per cent which is pretty shocking quite what the federal reserve and the bank of england think about all this we will learn this week when both have policy meetings they have of course goofed neither of them nor indeed the european central bank which also meets this week had any inkling earlier this year of the way in which inflation would race upwards eventually they will have to stop pumping money into the system and increase interest rates but not yet it is even possible that the bank of england will relax its mortgage lending rules lowering its so called reversion rate the way lenders have to check on whether borrowers could keep up their repayments should interest rates rise we already have a huge problem on home affordability in the uk with the highest ratio of house prices to incomes for more than a century so what impact would making mortgages easier have on house prices it would push prices up even more oh dear so what will happen the impact of omicron or whatever variants follow it will eventually subside global supply chains will scramble their way back into better order and we will all get used to not being able to buy everything we want when we want to inflation will subside too eventually house prices will plateau or at least i hope they will plateau rather than crash but when some sort of normality returns will inflation settle around 2 per cent the target of most central banks or 3 per cent or 4 per cent or what think of the social damage caused by cutting the living standards of people on fixed incomes by 4 per cent a year or whittling away the value of their savings in a bank by a similar amount as for home ownership over the past 12 months the average house price in the uk has risen by 20 000 so a first time buyer has to borrow that much more or save it from taxed income just to get into the same place as they could have bought last autumn so what should we expect to happen the financial markets have taken the omicron variant in their stride despite the troubling news on the virus not to mention the political rumpus surrounding the prime minister the footsie has ended up 2 4 per cent on the week the s p 500 in new york and the dax in frankfurt were up 3 4 per cent and 3 0 per cent respectively insofar as the markets are worried their concerns are about the pace at which the central banks will increase interest rates rather than the speed at which omicron spreads it is easy to see why if the spread of the virus delays the rise in interest rates that will help support asset values worldwide shares homes the lot the financial markets will continue to party even if the office parties for the traders get cancelled as for the global economy remember that money not spent now will be money that can be spent later right now inflation looks a bigger threat than the virus
the bones of an extinct reptile tell a story of how this ancient creature took an 2 4 metre leap of faith in the air to take flight new research has revealed the pterosaur quetzalcoatlus the largest known flying animal that ever lived boasted a 12 metre wingspan that would allow it to soar through the sky according to a research collection published wednesday by the society of vertebrate paleontology scientists were puzzled for decades at how such a large creature could fly said coauthor matthew brown director of vertebrate paleontology collections at the university of texas in austin read more more than 30 tornadoes carve path of destruction across us that s one giant reptile the pterosaur quetzalcoatlus is depicted in this artist s illustration the university of texas at austin jackson school of geosciences supplied after years of research mr brown s team discovered quetzalcoatlus likely took to the sky like a fighter jet off an aircraft carrier punching 2 4 metres off the ground before flapping huge wings it took nearly 50 years between the time the bones were discovered in big bend national park in brewster county texas and when scientists could determine how the creature flew mr brown attributes that to the painstakingly slow process of unearthing the bones like many other flying species during that time this pterosaur had bones that were hollow to aid in flight mr brown said you have these sort of potato chip like bones preserved in very hard rock and you ve got to remove the bones from the rock without destroying them he said an artist s impression of the pterosaur adobe stock via cnn two new species are discovered over the last half century two new smaller species of pterosaurs were discovered in the national park as well at first the scientists weren t sure if the animals were juvenile versions of the quetzalcoatlus or a different species altogether the researchers took precise measurements of the fossils and ran them through a computer algorithm if they didn t come back as near matches to the other animal it was mostly likely another species mr brown said read more south african doctors see signs omicron is milder than delta the field museum in chicago has a life size pterosaur on display supplied the smaller of the two new species has a blunt beak while the larger species has a long thin beak that comes to a point the animals lived in a forest oasis over 70 million years ago in what is now texas which was home to many bodies of water the larger quetzalcoatlus would have likely used its narrow beak to forage for crabs and worms along the water according to the research collection this reptile species also tended to hunt alone the smaller quetzalcoatlus was much more social and would spend time in large groups researchers found about 30 of the flying animals together at a fossil excavation church roof ripped off as tornado death toll rises to over 100 view gallery missing pieces of the fossil scientists have fairly complete skeletons of the smaller species but only a portion of the original quetzalcoatlus body mr brown said he wants to pick up where douglas lawson a former geology graduate student at the university of texas who discovered the original bones in 1971 left off one of brown s personal goals is to obtain a permit and go out into the national park to find the rest of the animal and collect it sharks spotted metres from the shore at beach in queensland view gallery

taxpayer revenues on debt after this bankruptcy is finished it will be paying 7 cents of every dollar it s a substantial reduction in debt service it s a reduction of 50 billion over the life of the debt i think the other thing people don t recognize is that we limited the debt to less than 8 of revenues and that is something that is a very reasonable level it is an affordable level to pay approximately 8 of your less than 8 of your revenues towards debt florido another criticism of this deal is that you know some of puerto rico s richest and most powerful creditors like banks and hedge funds that own a lot of puerto rico s debt are making off with a profit whereas others like retired teachers for example will never see another cost of living increase to their pensions again i d like you to listen to daniel santamaria ots an economist who spoke to me about the fact that a lot of the territory s debt is owned by banks and hedge funds that scooped up government bonds after their value had tanked listen to what he said daniel santamaria ots so a very cheap price for them and they are going to have returns of investment right now of three four five times what they invested and those returns are at the expense of people of puerto rico the behavior of the hedge funds it s legal so far but it s an unethical and unfair and unjust outcome florido legal but unethical and unfair do you agree with his assessment and if so why could you not have pushed these creditors to give up a little bit more jaresko we have done everything within the law within federal bankruptcy law and i think that s really an important element to understand here this isn t a sovereign debt negotiation without rules this is something promesa put us into the u s federal court system and u s bankruptcy rules promesa and bankruptcy rules one thing that those rules do is they don t allow you to discriminate between holders you don t know who the ultimate holder is when you re making this when you re having this negotiation what their cost basis is which is what daniel is referring to is not an issue not a relevant issue in bankruptcy so it s unfair and unjust i don t believe applies because it is the fairness the justness of it is exactly what the judge is going to be determining when she confirms or when she issues her decision florido natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico natalie thanks for joining us jaresko thank you soundbite of the marias song spin me around transcript provided by npr copyright npr

washington prices rose at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years last month increasing 6 8 over the same period a year ago as inflation continues to squeeze households and businesses nationwide and complicates the political environment for congress and the white house consumer price index data released friday by the bureau of labor statistics showed that prices rose 0 8 in november compared with october with inflation spreading further throughout the economy including to areas that had not been as affected by the coronavirus pandemic the november data marked the largest 12 month increase since june 1982 during a period when inflation was more of a scourge on daily life than most millennials have ever known current inflation dynamics have been spurred by a devastating pandemic that roiled the global economy upsetting the workforce and supply chains while stimulus measures helped unleash high demand for goods the broad based increases span just about every sector from pork poultry and produce to housing and sporting goods companies large and small are raising prices or making tough decisions to make up for the rising costs of hiring transportation and basic goods even dollar tree which has long sold items for 1 is hiking prices to 1 25 in time it is possible that lower gas and energy prices or unclogged supply chains will help steer prices back down to more sustainable levels but it is unclear when that will happen and in the meantime businesses and consumers could start to change their expectations of what is still to come plus the more persistent and embedded high prices become the harder it will be for policymakers to rein them in yes inflation can abate but what care about is is it significant or insignificant to peoples lives and decision making said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton this is inflation that s not likely to be insignificant anytime soon and that s a problem inflation has emerged as a top political concern ahead of the 2022 midterms with the cost of food or gas often a test for how people perceive the economy republicans criticized the high inflation numbers blaming democrats stimulus as the culprit and warning against future legislative packages today s jaw dropping inflation report should alarm every single american but especially policymakers sen pat toomey r pa said in a statement friday morning hard working american families are suffering as a direct result of the biden administration s reckless borrowing and spending and anti energy policies democrats rallied behind a different message saying their build back better spending proposals are key to lowering costs including for child care and health care we ve never had this kind of growth in 60 years but inflation is affecting people s lives president joe biden said friday at his summit for democracy the reason why economists think is going to in fact diminish the impact on inflation is because it s reducing costs for ordinary people biden added the november increases were driven by broad based price hikes in most of the categories tracked similar to october inflation indexes for gasoline shelter food used cars and trucks and new vehicles were among the larger contributors airline fares also increased in november rising 4 7 from october after declining over the previous few months as people geared up for holiday travel roughly half of the month over month increase in the consumer price index was due to price increases in cars and energy the energy index was up 3 5 in november and measures of gasoline were up 6 1 recent moves by the biden administration intended to bring prices down at the pump are not reflected in friday s data the cost of medical care has risen in four of the past five months although it grew at a slower pace in november than october swonk noted that coronavirus cases and the recent delta variant wave have filled hospitals to capacity in many parts of the country which can prompt hospitals to pause elective surgeries the price increases can also be seen in the grocery store aisles with food companies including campbell soup kraft heinz and mondelez all announcing higher prices on items such as soup macaroni and cheese crackers and cookies federal data showed that prices for food at home namely groceries were up 6 4 in the past year and that the cost of food away from home climbed 5 8 steak was up almost 25 compared with a year ago and bacon 21 eggs were up 8 apples 7 4 and flour roughly 6 friday s inflation report showed rent was up 0 4 in november compared with the month before and 3 compared with last year in part because of soaring home prices and supply chain issues limiting construction of new homes economists say that hikes in housing are concerning especially since rent and home prices make up large shares of household budgets and are not expected to ease even after the pandemic eases or global supply chain snarls clear up rent and shelter costs tend to be much stickier than say fuel or food or industrial supply components said joe brusuelas chief economist at rsm this is the channel through which a possible wage price spiral starts because it reduces disposal personal income by many measures the economy has made tremendous progress since it was thrust into a recession in early 2020 the labor market has added 6 million jobs since biden took office economic growth is surging far faster than most economists forecast earlier in the pandemic the stock market is also up roughly 25 but inflation has proved to be one of the most visceral ways people judge economic recovery from the pandemic white house officials have been frustrated by a disconnect between such strong progress and a public discontent that is showing up in opinion polling and biden s approval ratings in recent months federal reserve policymakers have had to ditch their long held message that inflation is limited and temporary as that conflicted with what s been unfolding nationwide the fed s main policy tool for blunting inflation is raising interest rates which cools the overall economy down and slow growth in part by raising the cost of loans and business investment economists increasingly expect the fed will hike rates as early as next spring much faster than projected earlier this year meanwhile financial markets appeared to shrug off the november inflation news with the dow jones industrial average and the tech heavy nasdaq up slightly on friday there are also renewed concerns about workers wages and how the basic cost of living could begin to lag behind inflation stagnant wages haunted the country for years but the pandemic recovery brought in a new era that gave workers more leverage and contributed to better earnings for rank and file workers which grew at the fastest pace in decades stimulus checks and other government benefits like the child tax credit are also helping cushion households savings and balance sheets yet the rising cost of goods and services is cutting into those gains especially for households without much room to stretch their budgets food banks around the country report that families are continuing to show up for meals and groceries as they weigh whether to pay for gas rent food or medication plus some employers aren t increasing salaries with inflation google executives for example said the company wouldn t be instituting companywide pay raises to adjust to inflation according to cnbc top officials at the white house and fed have maintained that unsustainably high prices won t become a permanent feature of the economy and that policymakers if necessary have the right tools to get inflation under control but over the past few months they ve been forced to back away from their initial message that inflation is temporary or transitory because that position became increasingly at odds with what was unfolding in the economy and the ways people were experiencing it the biden administration has suffered low approval ratings and political attacks from republicans who blame democrats stimulus measures for overheating the economy this year the white house for its part touts steps it is taking to lower everyday expenses much of its argument for its safety net and infrastructure plan is that the proposals would bring down costs for working class families including in housing health care groceries gasoline elder care child care and education gas prices have ticked down in the past few weeks although that drop isn t in this inflation report it s unclear when inflation will come down closer to the fed s 2 annual target much depends on the pandemic and when supply chains have a chance to clear but the concern is that the price increases are showing up just about everywhere including in corners of the economy not directly pummeled by the coronavirus recession that leaves households and businesses to decide how to stretch their budgets or raise prices to stay afloat for decades dollar tree staked much of its brand on selling everything for 1 that strategy lasted decades until the retailer announced it was raising prices by a quarter in an earnings call this week campbell soup pointed to its recently announced price increases intended to offset added costs of ingredients packaging logistics and labor we are aggressively combating raw material inflation with significant pricing actions across each of our businesses sherwin williams chief executive john g morikis said in an october earnings call we implemented multiple price increases in the quarter we will continue to do so as necessary inflation is already posing a major test for the fed going into 2022 the central bank is charged with keeping prices stable and getting the economy to full employment and while it has so far held off on combating inflation so that the job market has time to grow it may soon be forced to raise interest rates and cool down the economy so that high prices don t become even more persistent for now the fed is winding down its vast asset purchase program which has supported the financial markets for much of the pandemic and fed policymakers are expected to speed up the pace of that taper at their meeting next week the washington post s andrew van dam and mariana alfaro contributed to this report

adrian florido host it was almost five years ago that the u s territory of puerto rico declared bankruptcy the island was buckling under more than 70 billion of public debt plus 50 billion in pension obligations it didn t have the money for since then a fiscal oversight board appointed by the u s congress has been negotiating to try to get puerto rico s creditors to accept less money than they re owed now a major deal has been reached and a federal bankruptcy judge is considering whether to approve it puerto rico s governor and legislature support the deal saying it s the territory s only chance to emerge from bankruptcy but the deal also has many critics who say it doesn t do enough to make puerto rico s debt affordable to discuss this deal we re joined by the woman who negotiated it natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico ms jaresko welcome natalie jaresko thank you florido i d like to start by asking you to give me just a sort of very brief sense of the magnitude of puerto rico s debt jaresko so as you said earlier adrian when the financial oversight board was established in 2016 it was a result of having accumulated over 70 billion of debt across a dozen or more issuers and an incremental 50 55 billion in unfunded pension liabilities and compare that to gnp of about 80 billion a year that is an overwhelming debt level for this island florido and so why do you consider this deal that you ve reached with puerto rico s creditors now a good one what does it achieve jaresko so this plan takes us out of bankruptcy and it does it in a affordable sustainable way it resolves about half of that debt that i described so about 30 35 billion of claims against the commonwealth against the territorial government and a large portion about 50 billion of the pension unfunded liabilities and so it accomplishes everything i think the promesa s set out to accomplish it ensures that the debt is reduced it ensures that the lawsuits are resolved it provides stability so that investment can return to the island and it provides confidence that because it is a sustainable level of debt that the government will be able to use all incremental revenues all incremental funds going forward to improve the situation on the island whether it s education public safety or other florido you mentioned promesa i should just note that that is the federal law that essentially established puerto rico rico s ability to declare bankruptcy and also created the board that you now lead as i mentioned puerto rico s governor pedro pierluisi and its legislature both support this deal but the deal has faced many criticisms from some prominent economists from a lot of everyday puerto ricans i want to ask you about a couple of those criticisms and the first is this argument that this deal is actually not affordable for the island because when you add other obligations like its pension obligations and the rest of its debt that is not part of this deal the government is still going to be devoting a really large chunk of its annual budget to paying off its creditors rather than on essential public services what do you say to that jaresko it s not true people are misunderstanding the numbers if you look at what it was prior to bankruptcy the government was spending approximately 25 cents of every dollar of taxpayer revenues on debt after this bankruptcy is finished it will be paying 7 cents of every dollar it s a substantial reduction in debt service it s a reduction of 50 billion over the life of the debt i think the other thing people don t recognize is that we limited the debt to less than 8 of revenues and that is something that is a very reasonable level it is an affordable level to pay approximately 8 of your less than 8 of your revenues towards debt florido another criticism of this deal is that you know some of puerto rico s richest and most powerful creditors like banks and hedge funds that own a lot of puerto rico s debt are making off with a profit whereas others like retired teachers for example will never see another cost of living increase to their pensions again i d like

you can now subscribe to our you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel four people turned up at a health clinic tucked in a sprawl of commercial maize farms on a recent morning looking for covid 19 vaccines the staff had vials of the johnson johnson vaccine stashed in the fridge but the staff members apologetically declined to vaccinate the four and suggested they try another day a vial of the johnson johnson vaccine holds five doses and the staff was under orders not to waste a single one ida musonda the nurse who supervises the vaccination effort suspected that her team might have found more takers if they packed the vials in styrofoam coolers and headed out to markets and churches but we have no fuel for the vehicle to take the vaccines there she said they vaccinated 100 people on their last trip to a farm the records from that trip sat in a paper heap in the clinic because the data manager had no internet connection to access an electronic records system for months the biggest challenge to vaccinating africans against covid and protecting both the continent and the world from the emergence of dangerous variants has been supply a continent of about 1 4 billion people has received just 404 million doses of vaccine and only 7 8 of the population is fully vaccinated but as supply has begun to sputter into something like a more reliable flow other daunting obstacles are coming into focus all of them are on view at and around ngwerere weak health care systems with limited infrastructure and technology and no experience vaccinating adults are trying to get shots into the arms of people who have far more pressing priorities at the same time the global flow of information and deliberate misinformation on social media is generating the same skepticism that has stymied vaccination efforts in the united states and other countries some zambians are hesitant but others have an attitude that could better be described as vaccine indifference this is a poor country where the economy has contracted sharply during the pandemic and many unvaccinated people are more focused on putting food on the table i d like to get it but i work monday to saturday and i don t know if they vaccinate on sunday said bernadette kawango who supports a large extended family with her wages from an auto parts store in a low income neighborhood on the edge of lusaka the capital she has heard many rumors that people who receive the vaccine will die in two years that the vaccine is part of a plot by europeans to kill africans and take their land that bill gates is on a campaign to reduce the world population such stories make her roll her eyes but covid is not at the top of her list of health care worries it s cholera season and people have malaria and there is hiv and tb she said she does not know anyone who has been diagnosed with covid all these challenges create two major problems first the pace of vaccination is far too slow to prevent unnecessary deaths in a fourth wave which is already beginning in southern africa or to prevent the emergence of new variants such as omicron which was first identified in south africa late last month the vaccines in stock many of them donations close to their expiration dates when they arrive may not be used before they must be destroyed second the push to vaccinate against covid is drawing resources from health systems that can hardly spare them which could lead to disastrous consequences for the fight against other devastating health problems at the ngwerere health clinic the usual bustle and screeching at the mother and child health area where babies are monitored for signs of malnutrition and given childhood immunizations was absent because everyone on that staff had been repurposed as covid vaccinators every time we have a wave here it really threatens the investments that have been made in hiv maternal and child health and tb and malaria and it s important that we protect those said dr simon agolory who runs the large zambia program of the u s centers for disease control and prevention dr andrew silumesii director of public health for zambia s health ministry said there was clear evidence that infant growth monitoring and childhood immunization had declined over the course of the pandemic he worries that malaria tb and hiv infections will also increase so far 7 of zambians have been vaccinated against covid according to silumesii president hakainde hichilema has set a target of vaccinating another 2 million by christmas and 70 of the population by the third quarter of 2022 a goal that looks exceedingly ambitious zambia s vaccines come mostly from covax the global vaccine sharing initiative with additional donations from china and the african union the fact that zambia is dependent largely on donations means that it must adapt its program to whatever shipments arrive a bit like making a meal with whatever arrives in a farm subscription box the country is managing distribution of five different vaccines each with different dosing regimens storage requirements and vial volumes that has created a huge additional administrative burden for skeleton staffs such as musonda s team her staff has no budget for cellphone calls to remind people about second shots and the effect can be seen in the charts stapled on the vaccination room wall of the 840 people who received a first dose of the astrazeneca vaccine in april only 179 came back for a follow up shot in july when zambia experienced a severe third covid wave earlier this year media coverage of people dying in the parking lots of hospitals that ran out of oxygen rattled a population that had been thinking of the virus as something that affected only white or rich people there were predawn lineups outside vaccination sites that couldn t keep shots in stock but when the wave abated so did the demand many people here recall the time when zambians were dying of aids in huge numbers and western pharmaceutical companies refused to produce affordable lifesaving medications there is skepticism now that those same companies have come offering free solutions vaccine misinformation spreads on tiktok and whatsapp and in evangelical churches where pastors warn that the shot contains the mark of the beast no matter how educated people are if their pastor says don t trust the vaccine they don t trust said dr morton zuze the clinical care coordinator at chongwe district hospital where seven staff members sat idle in an empty vaccination tent as in the united states there are false rumors in zambia that the vaccine causes female infertility or erectile dysfunction zambians have heard astrazeneca is not being used in many countries because of reports of blood clots in a very small number of people who received that shot it s a global village and everyone can switch on cnn zuze said zambia normally vaccinates only small children and it has no primary care practices an adult goes to a clinic only when pregnant or receiving hiv treatment or in an emergency dr lawrence mwananyanda an assistant professor with the boston university school of public health and a special adviser to hichilema said the government must balance between trying to create vaccine demand and not creating too much when it can t be sure if it will have the supply to deliver to just walk up and these health facilities are sometimes very far away 2 5 7 kilometers away and people don t have cars you have to be very motivated sometimes people have gone to a health facility and then there is no vaccine he said all they are told is you can only vaccinate if there s five or six people so you can t be vaccinated today how likely are you to come back charity machika was vaccinated recently at a rural health center in chongwe district she went to the clinic for a prenatal checkup and then was encouraged to head to the next building where the hiv treatment center was repurposed for vaccinations i was scared because people say a lot of stories that i will faint that i will not be able to walk that i will die she said i took the risk to come and protect myself and my baby she is the only vaccinated person in her family her husband tried twice but the sites he went to never had vaccines in stock and it was difficult for him to find the time to make the 4 kilometer walk to try again she said felix mwanza a veteran hiv activist in lusaka said the government had yet to tap into the vast network of hiv and tb treatment activists in the country we seem not to learn from our past he said recalling how testing and treatment for hiv only reached critical mass when care was delivered in bars at schools and on doorsteps if they don t use the structures we already have donors will keep sending the vaccines and they ll pile up here and expire and then they won t send us anymore he said mwananyanda said the key strategy for the planned rapid scale up in vaccination was to do exactly that taking vaccines to people in malls and at bus stops amid the scramble no one is thinking about what happens next we re really just addressing the vaccination problems for now but we don t have a system for the long run said agolory and what are we going to do when boosters are needed or if there s some new variants that escape the vaccine altogether and we need to start from zero and give people more vaccines zambia will need help procuring more and it will need funding to help bring on temporary health care workers to administer vaccines so that existing programs like the ngwerere mother and child clinic are not abandoned agolory said even with a huge boost in vaccination rates the country won t have enough coverage to blunt the coming wave or most likely the one after it i am hoping that we keep receiving vaccines so that we don t get into a situation where people need vaccines and they can t get them said silumesii the flip side which is something that i would really hate to see happen is where we have brought in vaccines and we don t have enough demand and vaccines go to waste these are vaccines that cost a lot definitely that pinch would sting so badly

in part 1 we asked whether alexander graham bell or thomas alva edison should be given credit for having the most profound effect on our modern world having made the case for bell it is now time to examine the evidence for the fabled wizard of menlo park thomas alva edison to wear the crown the information cited in this ftv comes from simon winchester s book the men who united the states 2013 harper perennial born in milan ohio on february 11 1847 thomas edison gained fame for the sheer volume of inventions he is credited with over his 84 years even though he was largely self educated early in his working career he was employed as a telegraph operator inspired by this new wonder of modern technology he established his first laboratory facility in menlo park new jersey in 1876 as for his most famous invention the light bulb there is a plaque on the roadway above battle lake in carbon county wyoming claiming the area can take some credit for the birth of edison s incandescent lightbulb as the story goes edison was in the wyoming territory to observe a solar eclipse in the summer of 1878 after the event he went to fish in battle lake where one of his bamboo fly rods fell into a campfire as the filaments of bamboo burned and glowed white hot edison is thought to have wondered if such a filament could be made to emit white light if it was heated by electricity running through it he also pondered if the filament would last longer if it was contained inside an enclosed glass bulb from which the air had been removed most historians choose to believe edison did most of his filament tests back at menlo park it is well documented that he tested strands of burned baywood boxwood hickory cedar flax and yes bamboo as he himself said i ransacked the world searching for the longest lasting filament he eventually settled on the carbonized cotton thread he used in his first ever patented lightbulb in 1879 the invention proved popular enough to provide edison with another set of problems to solve telegraph and telephones were powered by battery cells equipping each lightbulb with its own battery made no economic sense so thomas set about to find a way to produce or generate electricity and then a method to distribute it along wires according to winchester creation of the new science of electric power generation and distribution is the single unifying achievement that arguably outshines them all them all meaning his other 1 092 patents his first largescale experiment to light a half mile of christie street in raritan nj now known as the township of edison took place on december 31 1879 to commemorate this historic event there now stands a 13 foot high model of a domestic lightbulb at the southern end of christie street it is mounted atop a 120 foot tall tower surrounded by a mosaic made up of eight concrete columns each topped with a floodlight pointed at the enormous bulb above the locals credit edison as the man who invented today and the township s motto is let there be light during the summer of 1879 he oversaw the lighting of menlo park s 36 acres to demonstrate his invention to the powers that be from new york city he hoped to convince them to use their city as a test market for lightbulbs and the electrical generation distribution system needed to illuminate them manhattan was already being lit by electricity at the time edison made his proposal the streets docks and factories had been employing the unforgiving harsh white light from thousands of carbon arc lights for over a decade the electric arc formed between two pointed carbon electrodes was hard on the eyes smelled bad caused headaches and left an oily residue on walls and ceilings the batteries used were drained rapidly and the electrodes burned out which meant they had to be replaced frequently edison promised new york s visiting bigwigs a softer light and had the streets he laid out in menlo park lined with wooden poles topped with glass lanterns each containing one of his new bulbs the distribution model he used is the same basic pattern still in use feeder cables took the power in this case from a battery array to the streets main wires connected the feeder lines to the houses he had fake homes set up along the streets and service lines took the electricity to the individual house lamps the demonstration worked and edison forged ahead with the backing of the vanderbilts j p morgan baron rothschild and henry villard among other investors financing his nyc project early 1881 found edison hosting a dinner party to convince nyc s aldermen and commissioners to okay his first project in the city catered by delmonico s with entertainment by sarah bernhardt it was a lavish affair three weeks later mayor william russell grace granted the edison electric illuminating company permission to set up the first power station in a rundown industrial building edison complained about the 155 000 the city charged him for the property but he pressed on regardless by september 4 1882 the system was ready to go the boilers were fired up and direct current dc electricity flowed through fifteen miles of thick copper cable buried beneath the streets and insulated with beeswax linseed oil and thick asphalt the asphalt was specially ordered from tar pits in trinidad the first 800 light bulbs glowed with edison s promised softer light and this new form of illumination took hold faster than it seemed possible mansions were lit the stock exchange installed sixty six bulb electroliers chandeliers and many industries suddenly found the new safer lighting system a boon to expanding their businesses the birth of highrise buildings in the city can be attributed to the invention of the electric elevator and marquees on broadway festooned with the new bulbs gave the entertainment district a new name the great white way electric billboards became the rage consider h j heinz s creation a forty five foot pickle shaped sign with the bulbs covered in green paint naturally as with any new technology there were problems the generators would sometimes speed up break down or in some cases explode sudden power surges could scorch walls and carpets one branch of the vanderbilts tired of replacing burn carpets and went back to gas lights power from the main lines could leak out if the main cable covering was damaged causing manhole covers in the street to become electrified a major blizzard in 1888 provided the first episode where ice brought down miles of live wires a problem still occuring 130 years later the biggest problem however was the type of current itself with dc current electrons move in unison in one direction along a wire and this characteristic limits transmission of power to lines no longer than a mile or two when edison s rivals discovered a form of generation where the electrically charged particles moved back and forth many times a second called alternating current or ac there seemed to be no limitation as to how far electricity could be transmitted the so called war of the currents began and the outcome would take electricity from being a local utility to a national one edison s dc current was generated at 100 volts meaning all devices had to be built for that particular voltage when electric motors for everything from water pumps to electric clocks joined the fray there were immediate problems harnessing the only voltage available for different devices businessman george westinghouse and his colleagues soon found electricity generated as ac was more adaptable for their particular uses it could be altered up or down by a transformer this made it useful for anything from tiny light bulbs to heavy duty electric motors no matter how far they might be located from the generator thus ensued an epic battle between edison and westinghouse over the future of electrical generation westinghouse made his fortune designing brakes for railway trains signaling systems and gas pipelines he was opportunistic enough to invest 60 000 in seven inventions critical to the development of ac power generation and distribution he turned over all of the patents to a young serbian inventor who had come to new york to work for edison in 1884 his name was nikola tesla nikola tesla has become somewhat of a cult figure today with many calling him the father of the electric age tesla was shy soft spoken clever and impeccably dressed yet he had phobias about certain things like pearl earrings and spherical objects winchester explains tesla s personality he was also afflicted with an obsessive compulsive disorder he refused to shake hands he would feel a need to read all the books written by any author he encountered and he had a peculiar devotion to the number three and to any other number divisible by it nikola tesla was in short the classic exemplar of the mad scientist and the fact that he made dangerously interesting inventions by the score resonates still with today s imaginative fans of the far fetched tesla is also said by some to have held thomas edison in spectacularly low esteem tesla worked for edison at menlo park soon after his arrival on these shores he told his new boss he could rebuild a dc motor edison had designed and make it more efficient edison promised him 50 000 if he succeeded when he did improve the motor edison tried to tell nikola that he had been joking and the young man apparently did not understand american humor with the promised bonus now replaced with the offer of a 10 pay raise edison gained a formidable adversary with a personal grudge against him in the approaching war of the currents the first demonstration of tesla s ac current was conducted in great barrington ma using a generator designed to produce 500 volts of single phase ac electricity powered by the housatonic river backed by westinghouse and using tesla s designs manufacturer william staley used a big wire wound tesla style transformer to step up the generator s output to 3 000 volts his high voltage lines were then connected to six smaller step down transformers also designed by tesla to bring the voltage down to a more manageable 100 volts the process ensured that the lights farthest away from the generator would shine with a steady light just as the ones closer to the electricity s source it was something that was just not possible with edison s dc current edison fought back by warning the public about ac he claimed the back and forth current was dangerous and would kill people he resorted to fitting copper shoes on a rogue elephant named topsy and electrocuting her in public as she stood on a steel plate at a coney island zoo topsy had a disagreeable personality and had killed three of her handlers although one was a man who had tried to get her to eat a lit cigarette but it was still a horrific and fortunately quick death that is still hard to view on the surviving film clips the gruesome spectacle of topsy s death staged by edison to show the dangers of ac power put a black mark on the inventor s resume the final nails in the coffin of edison s dream to make dc current the standard across the land were much not as ghastly and they were shaped like dollar signs both competing camps were invited to bid on the honor of lighting the 1892 columbian exposition to be held at the year long chicago world s fair slated to be the first electrically lit exposition in the world it would set the stage for what would follow after the war of the currents whoever won the right to light the chicago event would undoubtedly be lighting the nation as well j p morgan had invested heavily in edison electric the newly reorganized company was now known as the general electric company corporations thrive on profits and ge had no trouble putting a 1 8 million price tag on their proposal the chicago show organizers were outraged and felt the tricky new york bankers were trying to make fools of them when westinghouse arrived to make his proposal both parties were asked to submit sealed bids for the same project ge wisely rounded their bid down to a more sensible 554 000 westinghouse s bid was 399 000 the expo would be lit by ac and the rest of the united states would follow dc would continue to have its uses the lines powering many subway systems like those in new york city are dc eventually the technology would be developed for dc current to be carried longer distances on ultra high voltage transmission lines with that said by of the end of the nineteenth century ac would become the dominant electrical system in the united states before i ask you to cast your vote i am going to admit that the bell or edison question was written as a bit of a red herring both men are certainly due their place in the pantheon of great american scientists but the final poll should really include four names if constructed as a four way vote i would have asked which two of these four scientists should be given credit for influencing our modern world the most my personal vote then would be cast not for bell or edison but for morse and tesla not to diminish what bell and edison accomplished both would have risen to their places of prominence based on their prodigious output of inventions without the contributions of morse bell might not have been pondering how to send messages by wire using electricity without tesla would ac have become the standard current used in america or would edison s fame have swung the pendulum toward dc as sir isaac newton wrote to fellow scientist robert hooke in 1675 if i have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants newton s meaning is clear there is nothing wrong with using what one learns from others to fuel creativity innovation and new discoveries there is no doubt that both bell and edison did lean on if not stand on the shoulders of morse and tesla top piece video okay can anybody think of a better song about electricity than eddie grant okay they didn t like me using eddie grant and took it down so we will settle for a little lou christie electricity instead you will have to find your own eddie grant
the holiday season is upon us meaning it s time to reflect on another pandemic year and raise our glasses to celebrate the big and small joys that have kept us going drinking has been a big part of winter holiday celebrations for nearly thousands of years it s been around for a long time and since the beginning of time there have also been people who have not been able to use alcohol in moderation says dr anna lembke a psychiatrist at stanford university and the author of dopamine nation finding balance in the age of abundance lembke and other experts say most people who drink alcohol over the next few weeks with family at office parties on new year s eve will just be fine but they also point out that this can be a uniquely risky time of year for some alcohol consumers if you think alcohol is problematic for you or want to avoid drinking too much during the holidays or just aren t the biggest drinker here are some strategies for navigating end of year celebrations remember the holidays can be a slippery slope our experts generally agree that risky and potentially problematic drinking increases this time of year sometimes with long term health consequences around thanksgiving i always gave myself this excuse that it was the holidays and i d always say this is the time of year this is when everybody s drinking says kim kearns a stay at home mom in massachusetts who writes about her recovery from alcohol use disorder alcohol is tangled up in many holiday rituals we love but the shorter days the colder weather and overwhelming social calendars can also leave some of us feeling more vulnerable or if you re spending the end of year away from loved ones you may be tempted to stock up on alcohol holidays are a time of great expectations which can be when things don t go according to how we envision they should go says lembke and although we can love our families and friends getting together can be stressful if you re feeling stressed while spending time with your loved ones you re not alone it s important to remind yourself that with the joy and warmth of the holidays comes an increased temptation to drink more as a way to cope with social anxieties keep track of how much your drink to keep from slipping into risky behavior experts say it s a good idea to keep an eye on your alcohol consumption not just on one given night or at a single party but over the course of each week according to lembke a safe and realistic drinking limit to keep in mind is three drinks in a day and seven drinks in a week for women for men it s more four drinks in a day and 14 drinks in a week the centers for disease control and prevention recommends even less for a healthier lifestyle one drink or less in a day and seven drinks in a week for women and two drinks in a day and 14 drinks in a week for men this all of course varies for every person quantity and frequency matter lembke says we measure a standard drink as either one 12 ounce one 5 ounce glass of wine or 1 to 1 ½ ounce of hard liquor and remember drinking even less alcohol or abstaining altogether is widely considered the healthiest option be ready to resist the pressure to drink another challenge experts say we should be prepared for are steady nudges from our loved ones to keep drinking past our healthy limits i felt a huge amount of fear in facing the social scene and all my friends says kim kearns who has given up alcohol altogether dr tyler oesterle who is the medical director at the mayo clinic s fountain center says this unaddressed pressure to drink can result in awkward conversations and even conflict among loved ones one strategy oesterle offers is having a scripted response in mind so when your favorite aunt offers you a glass of wine and you ve decided not to have wine that evening have something prepared your response can be as simples as no thank you i m not drinking tonight or i m good i ve been drinking too much lately or if you want to avoid the where s your drink question altogether you can also carry around a cup of a non alcoholic beverage like soda seltzer or even water you can always opt out it isn t easy to say no to loved ones and stay home during the holidays but experts say another important strategy for healthy drinking particularly for those who prefer abstinence is not going to that party at all keeping yourself in a safe place is the priority says david dorschu who heads recovery centers of america an addiction treatment program in new jersey you can instead make plans that don t involve alcohol like watching a movie or grabbing coffee with a friend if being social still sounds appealing kim kearns says she went into this year s holiday season with a plan that includes stepping away from gatherings when they become overwhelming i go for a walk i write i take breaks for myself to do the things that help me relax remember you don t owe anyone a drink and it s okay to turn down that invite and make time for yourself support those who want to drink less even if you don t struggle with alcohol you can support those that want to drink less or the non drinkers in your life this season when it comes to holiday parties make sure drinking feels like a choice and not an obligation try to make everyone feel welcome even if they re only drinking a little or abstaining altogether whether that be a company holiday party or a family function you have to have options for folks that are non alcoholic that s number one says dorschu number two you re creating an atmosphere where people feel comfortable to decline and say no thank you oesterle says it helps for hosts to let go of gestures of hospitality can i get you a drink want another beer that once seemed warm and inviting but can pressure guests to grab an unwanted drink there can even be a fun side to downsizing alcohol consumption during the holidays lembke says some hosts are offering fancy celebratory drinks that aren t alcoholic it s something to look forward to she says they want to find ways to reward themselves and celebrate without having an alcoholic drink a version of this story originally aired on npr

adrian florido host it was almost five years ago that the u s territory of puerto rico declared bankruptcy the island was buckling under more than 70 billion of public debt plus 50 billion in pension obligations it didn t have the money for since then a fiscal oversight board appointed by the u s congress has been negotiating to try to get puerto rico s creditors to accept less money than they re owed now a major deal has been reached and a federal bankruptcy judge is considering whether to approve it puerto rico s governor and legislature support the deal saying it s the territory s only chance to emerge from bankruptcy but the deal also has many critics who say it doesn t do enough to make puerto rico s debt affordable to discuss this deal we re joined by the woman who negotiated it natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico ms jaresko welcome natalie jaresko thank you florido i d like to start by asking you to give me just a sort of very brief sense of the magnitude of puerto rico s debt jaresko so as you said earlier adrian when the financial oversight board was established in 2016 it was a result of having accumulated over 70 billion of debt across a dozen or more issuers and an incremental 50 55 billion in unfunded pension liabilities and compare that to gnp of about 80 billion a year that is an overwhelming debt level for this island florido and so why do you consider this deal that you ve reached with puerto rico s creditors now a good one what does it achieve jaresko so this plan takes us out of bankruptcy and it does it in a affordable sustainable way it resolves about half of that debt that i described so about 30 35 billion of claims against the commonwealth against the territorial government and a large portion about 50 billion of the pension unfunded liabilities and so it accomplishes everything i think the promesa s set out to accomplish it ensures that the debt is reduced it ensures that the lawsuits are resolved it provides stability so that investment can return to the island and it provides confidence that because it is a sustainable level of debt that the government will be able to use all incremental revenues all incremental funds going forward to improve the situation on the island whether it s education public safety or other florido you mentioned promesa i should just note that that is the federal law that essentially established puerto rico rico s ability to declare bankruptcy and also created the board that you now lead as i mentioned puerto rico s governor pedro pierluisi and its legislature both support this deal but the deal has faced many criticisms from some prominent economists from a lot of everyday puerto ricans i want to ask you about a couple of those criticisms and the first is this argument that this deal is actually not affordable for the island because when you add other obligations like its pension obligations and the rest of its debt that is not part of this deal the government is still going to be devoting a really large chunk of its annual budget to paying off its creditors rather than on essential public services what do you say to that jaresko it s not true people are misunderstanding the numbers if you look at what it was prior to bankruptcy the government was spending approximately 25 cents of every dollar of taxpayer revenues on debt after this bankruptcy is finished it will be paying 7 cents of every dollar it s a substantial reduction in debt service it s a reduction of 50 billion over the life of the debt i think the other thing people don t recognize is that we limited the debt to less than 8 of revenues and that is something that is a very reasonable level it is an affordable level to pay approximately 8 of your less than 8 of your revenues towards debt florido another criticism of this deal is that you know some of puerto rico s richest and most powerful creditors like banks and hedge funds that own a lot of puerto rico s debt are making off with a profit whereas others like retired teachers for example will never see another cost of living increase to their pensions again i d like you to listen to daniel santamaria ots an economist who spoke to me about the fact that a lot of the territory s debt is owned by banks and hedge funds that scooped up government bonds after their value had tanked listen to what he said daniel santamaria ots so a very cheap price for them and they are going to have returns of investment right now of three four five times what they invested and those returns are at the expense of people of puerto rico the behavior of the hedge funds it s legal so far but it s an unethical and unfair and unjust outcome florido legal but unethical and unfair do you agree with his assessment and if so why could you not have pushed these creditors to give up a little bit more jaresko we have done everything within the law within federal bankruptcy law and i think that s really an important element to understand here this isn t a sovereign debt negotiation without rules this is something promesa put us into the u s federal court system and u s bankruptcy rules promesa and bankruptcy rules one thing that those rules do is they don t allow you to discriminate between holders you don t know who the ultimate holder is when you re making this when you re having this negotiation what their cost basis is which is what daniel is referring to is not an issue not a relevant issue in bankruptcy so it s unfair and unjust i don t believe applies because it is the fairness the justness of it is exactly what the judge is going to be determining when she confirms or when she issues her decision florido natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico natalie thanks for joining us jaresko thank you soundbite of the marias song spin me around transcript provided by npr copyright npr
a study published in the american journal of preventive medicine found that among 11 207 men who were 20 65 years old and had no history of cardiovascular disease those who vaped on a daily basis were 2 41 times more likely to have reported suffering erectile dysfunction than those who had never vaped photo by justin sullivan getty images getty images it s not hard to see why vaping might be associated with erectile dysfunction ed previous studies have shown that nicotine may affect the blood vessels in your penis and a study recently published in the american journal of preventive medicine ajpm found that men who vaped on a daily basis were more than twice as likely to have reported suffering ed this latest study used data collected from december 2016 to january 2018 as part of a larger longitudinal study named path launched in 2013 path is short for population assessment of tobacco and health and has entailed asking a nationally representative sample of 45 971 adults 18 years and older in the u s a range of questions to assess their tobacco use and health outcomes for those 20 years and older one of the questions was about ed although only 13 711 men ended up answering this question this wasn t surprising since ed isn t something that s openly discussed on a regular basis it s not as if people will typically ask would you like a soft drink with your meal oh and speaking of soft so the study team which consisted of researchers from new york university s grossman school of medicine the mohammed bin rashid university of medicine and health sciences the boston university school of public health and the johns hopkins school of medicine focused on the 13 711 men who had answered the ed question of this group of men over a fifth 20 7 had reported experiencing ed and 4 8 had reported currently vaping with 2 1 doing so on a daily basis the long and short of it is that those who had reported daily vaping were 2 24 times as likely to have reported ed compared those who had never vaped of course one possible cause of ed is cardiovascular disease indeed among everyone who answered the ed question those who had a history of cardiovascular disease and were 65 years and older were 1 39 times as likely to have reported having ed compared to those who didn t have any history of cardiovascular disease and were in the 20 24 years of age category therefore to better isolate whether vaping was still associated with higher ed risk the research team looked at a smaller slice of 11 207 men who fell in the 20 to 65 years age range and had no history of cardiovascular disease of this smaller slice 10 2 reported having ed and 5 6 reported currently vaping with 2 5 doing so each day for this smaller slice the likelihood of reporting ed was even higher 2 41 times among those reporting daily vaping compared with those who had never vaped now you may not be taking this news lying down and argue that such a study can only show associations and not prove cause and effect that is true the study didn t really tease out other possible causes of ed such as depression anxiety use of certain medications and playing the theme song for the tv series law and order while making love the study didn t identify who may not be having ed because they re getting treatment such as pounding ed medications either plus asking someone about ed via a survey is not the same as observing it yourself while you may not usually say show me whenever someone tells you that he has ed keep in mind that people may differ quite significantly in how they define ed for some it may be the occasional sorry was thinking of the stock market just then for others it may be a more recurring issue nevertheless this is not the first study to draw the possible connection between vaping and ed previous studies have linked both smoking and nicotine to ed while e cigarettes may be less harmful than regular cigarettes they aren t harmless e cigarettes typically have whole range of chemicals that aren t great to inhale including nicotine how can inhaling nicotine end up affecting your penis unless you are a contortionist or a phallostethus cuulong fish your penis is probably nowhere near your nose or mouth well once absorbed into your bloodstream nicotine may circulate down to the blood vessels in your penis where it can keep such vessels from expanding or dilating and even though you may use the word wood to describe an erection it s not wood or guide wires or wedges of cheese that keep your penis erect it s the blood vessels dilating and allowing blood to flow into and stay in your penis thus nicotine could transform a night of let s get it on to let s watch netflix the nicotine found in vaping products may affect the blood flow into your

the refill liquids could decrease testosterone levels even without the presence of nicotine and lower circulating testosterone levels may affect your ability to initiate and maintain erects function too sure you may assert that you aren t a rat no matter what people may say about you and results from rodent studies don t always apply to humans however such studies add to the total package of evidence that vaping may affect your package all of this suggests that vaping may be a rising problem in more ways than one the number of people vaping in the u s has continued to increase as katherine schaeffer described for the pew research center vaping was originally thought to be a promising way of getting those hooked on cigarettes to move towards quitting or at least reducing their inhalation of harmful chemicals but the concern is that ex cigarettes smokers aren t the only ones using e cigarettes as evidenced by the rising number of teens vaping which i ve covered for forbes previously vaping is by no means a harmless activity and it may be impotent to know that
the holiday season is upon us meaning it s time to reflect on another pandemic year and raise our glasses to celebrate the big and small joys that have kept us going drinking has been a big part of winter holiday celebrations for nearly thousands of years it s been around for a long time and since the beginning of time there have also been people who have not been able to use alcohol in moderation says dr anna lembke a psychiatrist at stanford university and the author of dopamine nation finding balance in the age of abundance lembke and other experts say most people who drink alcohol over the next few weeks with family at office parties on new year s eve will be just fine but they also point out that this can be a uniquely risky time of year for some alcohol consumers if you think alcohol is problematic for you or want to avoid drinking too much during the holidays or just aren t the biggest drinker here are some strategies for navigating end of year celebrations remember the holidays can be a slippery slope our experts generally agree that risky and potentially problematic drinking increases this time of year sometimes with long term health consequences around thanksgiving i always gave myself this excuse that it was the holidays and i d always say this is the time of year this is when everybody s drinking says kim kearns a stay at home mom in massachusetts who writes about her recovery from alcohol use disorder alcohol is tangled up in many holiday rituals we love but the shorter days the colder weather and overwhelming social calendars can also leave some of us feeling more vulnerable or if you re spending the end of year away from loved ones you may be tempted to stock up on alcohol holidays are a time of great expectations which can be when things don t go according to how we envision they should go says lembke and although we can love our families and friends getting together can be stressful so if you re feeling the holiday blues remind yourself that with the joy and warmth of the season comes an increased temptation to drink more as a way to cope with social anxieties keep track of how much you drink to keep from slipping into risky behavior experts say it s a good idea to keep an eye on your alcohol consumption not just on one given night or at a single party but over the course of each week according to lembke a safe and realistic drinking limit to keep in mind is three drinks in a day and seven drinks in a week for women for men it s more four drinks in a day and 14 drinks in a week the centers for disease control and prevention recommends even less for a healthier lifestyle one drink or less in a day and seven drinks in a week for women and two drinks in a day and 14 drinks in a week for men this all of course varies for every person quantity and frequency matter lembke says we measure a standard drink as either one 12 ounce one 5 ounce glass of wine or 1 to 1 ½ ounce of hard liquor many of the people npr heard from also suggested having a friend partner or spouse help keep track of drinking behavior and remember drinking even less alcohol or abstaining altogether is widely considered the healthiest option be ready to resist the pressure to drink another challenge experts say we should be prepared for are steady nudges from our loved ones to keep drinking past our healthy limits i felt a huge amount of fear in facing the social scene and all my friends says kim kearns who has given up alcohol altogether dr tyler oesterle who is the medical director at the mayo clinic s fountain center says this unaddressed pressure to drink can result in awkward conversations and even conflict among loved ones one strategy oesterle offers is having a scripted response in mind so when your favorite aunt offers you a glass of wine and you ve decided not to have wine that evening have something prepared your response can be as simples as no thank you i m not drinking tonight or i m good i ve been drinking too much lately or if you want to avoid the where s your drink question altogether you can also carry around a cup of a non alcoholic beverage like soda seltzer or even water you can always opt out it isn t easy to say no to loved ones and stay home during the holidays but experts say another important strategy for healthy drinking particularly for those who prefer abstinence is not going to that party at all keeping yourself in a safe place is the priority says david dorschu who heads recovery centers of america an addiction treatment program in new jersey you can instead make plans that don t involve alcohol like watching a movie or grabbing coffee with a friend if being social still sounds appealing kim kearns says she went into this year s holiday season with a plan that includes stepping away from gatherings when they become overwhelming i go for a walk i write i take breaks for myself to do the things that help me relax remember you don t owe anyone a drink and it s okay to turn down that invite and make time for yourself support those who want to drink less even if you don t struggle with alcohol you can support those that want to drink less or the non drinkers in your life this season when it comes to holiday parties make sure drinking feels like a choice and not an obligation try to make everyone feel welcome even if they re only drinking a little or abstaining altogether whether that be a company holiday party or a family function you have to have options for folks that are non alcoholic that s number one says dorschu number two you re creating an atmosphere where people feel comfortable to decline and say no thank you oesterle says it helps for hosts to let go of gestures of hospitality can i get you a drink want another beer that once seemed warm and inviting but can pressure guests to grab an unwanted drink there can even be a fun side to downsizing alcohol consumption during the holidays lembke says some hosts are offering fancy celebratory drinks that aren t alcoholic it s something to look forward to she says they want to find ways to reward themselves and celebrate without having an alcoholic drink a version of this

adrian florido host it was almost five years ago that the u s territory of puerto rico declared bankruptcy the island was buckling under more than 70 billion of public debt plus 50 billion in pension obligations it didn t have the money for since then a fiscal oversight board appointed by the u s congress has been negotiating to try to get puerto rico s creditors to accept less money than they re owed now a major deal has been reached and a federal bankruptcy judge is considering whether to approve it puerto rico s governor and legislature support the deal saying it s the territory s only chance to emerge from bankruptcy but the deal also has many critics who say it doesn t do enough to make puerto rico s debt affordable to discuss this deal we re joined by the woman who negotiated it natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico ms jaresko welcome natalie jaresko thank you florido i d like to start by asking you to give me just a sort of very brief sense of the magnitude of puerto rico s debt jaresko so as you said earlier adrian when the financial oversight board was established in 2016 it was a result of having accumulated over 70 billion of debt across a dozen or more issuers and an incremental 50 55 billion in unfunded pension liabilities and compare that to gnp of about 80 billion a year that is an overwhelming debt level for this island florido and so why do you consider this deal that you ve reached with puerto rico s creditors now a good one what does it achieve jaresko so this plan takes us out of bankruptcy and it does it in a affordable sustainable way it resolves about half of that debt that i described so about 30 35 billion of claims against the commonwealth against the territorial government and a large portion about 50 billion of the pension unfunded liabilities and so it accomplishes everything i think the promesa s set out to accomplish it ensures that the debt is reduced it ensures that the lawsuits are resolved it provides stability so that investment can return to the island and it provides confidence that because it is a sustainable level of debt that the government will be able to use all incremental revenues all incremental funds going forward to improve the situation on the island whether it s education public safety or other florido you mentioned promesa i should just note that that is the federal law that essentially established puerto rico rico s ability to declare bankruptcy and also created the board that you now lead as i mentioned puerto rico s governor pedro pierluisi and its legislature both support this deal but the deal has faced many criticisms from some prominent economists from a lot of everyday puerto ricans i want to ask you about a couple of those criticisms and the first is this argument that this deal is actually not affordable for the island because when you add other obligations like its pension obligations and the rest of its debt that is not part of this deal the government is still going to be devoting a really large chunk of its annual budget to paying off its creditors rather than on essential public services what do you say to that jaresko it s not true people are misunderstanding the numbers if you look at what it was prior to bankruptcy the government was spending approximately 25 cents of every dollar of taxpayer revenues on debt after this bankruptcy is finished it will be paying 7 cents of every dollar it s a substantial reduction in debt service it s a reduction of 50 billion over the life of the debt i think the other thing people don t recognize is that we limited the debt to less than 8 of revenues and that is something that is a very reasonable level it is an affordable level to pay approximately 8 of your less than 8 of your revenues towards debt florido another criticism of this deal is that you know some of puerto rico s richest and most powerful creditors like banks and hedge funds that own a lot of puerto rico s debt are making off with a profit whereas others like retired teachers for example will never see another cost of living increase to their pensions again i d like you to listen to daniel santamaria ots an economist who spoke to me about the fact that a lot of the territory s debt is owned by banks and hedge funds that scooped up government bonds after their value had tanked listen to what he said daniel santamaria ots so a very cheap price for them and they are going to have returns of investment right now of three four five times what they invested and those returns are at the expense of people of puerto rico the behavior of the hedge funds it s legal so far but it s an unethical and unfair and unjust outcome florido legal but unethical and unfair do you agree with his assessment and if so why could you not have pushed these creditors to give up a little bit more jaresko we have done everything within the law within federal bankruptcy law and i think that s really an important element to understand here this isn t a sovereign debt negotiation without rules this is something promesa put us into the u s federal court system and u s bankruptcy rules promesa and bankruptcy rules one thing that those rules do is they don t allow you to discriminate between holders you don t know who the ultimate holder is when you re making this when you re having this negotiation what their cost basis is which is what daniel is referring to is not an issue not a relevant issue in bankruptcy so it s unfair and unjust i don t believe applies because it is the fairness the justness of it is exactly what the judge is going to be determining when she confirms or when she issues her decision florido natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico natalie thanks for joining us jaresko thank you soundbite of the marias song spin me around transcript provided by npr copyright npr

the outdoor grilling company recently went public outdoor grilling company weber webr held its initial public offering in august shares are trading down about 20 since that time in this segment of backstage pass recorded on nov 1 fool com contributors toby bordelon danny vena and jose najarro discuss the major highlights that investors need to know when considering this company for their portfolio 10 stocks we like better than weber inc when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and weber inc wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of november 10 2021 toby bordelon let s look at our next company here where did i put that company we are talking about a company that i think everyone here knows you re going to recognize the name of this company this is weber grill what do they do they are an outdoor cooking company they make grills weber makes grills you ve probably seen them you probably know the brand for a long time they were known for those charcoal pits my dad had one of those they last a long time good stuff if you like charcoal grilling they ve since moved into things like gas grills and pellet grills new things for them they ve been around for 70 years this is a 70 year old company very solid they ve just never been public 24 global market share very strong brand they re selling in 78 countries about 50 of their revenue is coming from outside the u s so it s not just like yeah we sell in 78 countries but we sell five grills in canada no i mean it s a legit global business here in 2020 they introduced a connected grilling platform it s got an app that guides you through some stuff you control the grill genesis is the grill i think that s genesis ii even maybe i thought of buying one of those but my wife wouldn t let me i have a traeger cook 4 42 i wanted something because if you have a traeger it s hard to heat up they don t sear as well so i was going to get something else and her position was you can have one expensive grill and one cheap grill but not two expensive grills so there we are christmas is coming soon though so maybe we can change that heading into the new year they re doing a lot of work for their direct to consumer channel they sell online they have independently owned and operated stores that are branded weber weber they have restaurants too now this is independently operated licenses and i think they re mostly in the chicago area i remember the last i was in chicago i wanted to go there and i was not able to make it work but they do their cooking on the pit grills it seems cool 875 million eight market cap so not a large company pretty small check this out though you look at the finances they had good sales in the third quarter which they just released 93 of revenue is up and net income is declining pretty substantially this kind of maybe goes back to we re talking about that once you re public you start to see things start happening they have a lot of debt that s a concern i have the debt is pretty large 1 2 billion in debt compared to 134 million of cash on hand you got to watch that operating cash flow is coming down but they say that s being driven by inventory levels normalizing like we talked about and supply chain issues that we ve seen maybe that s a good thing they do expect their full year sales to be up to almost 2 billion which will be a 30 increase from last year demand is at record levels according to management on the surface that looks pretty good last year was a pretty good year for grills you think about the pandemic you couldn t go out to eat you couldn t go to restaurants you might think well if i m going to cook i m going to cook well my dining out money is not going to buy me a new grill because that s what i m doing for the next few months people did that the fact that we re still seeing that sales growth off of 2020 i think is pretty good this is definitely something that s on my watch list but i don t love the financials i don t love the debt i want to see some improvement here before i m willing to say when i go in and buy this company and make it a part my portfolio but one i wanted to look at because i just have a soft spot for weber grills it s that good old american grilling brand that s been around forever anyone who cooks outdoor i know you ve heard of this if you don t have weber i know you ve heard of this company one potentially to keep in mind but watch the financials let s get another quarter or two before we say this is going to be where we want to go danny vena that s exactly right in fact i certainly have a weber out in my backyard in fact i have owned a weber grill pretty much all of my adult life that i wasn t in the military i have a grill i like weber grills i like the options that they have they have everything from an entry level grill that cost next to nothing all the way up to several thousand dollar grills with all of the bells and whistles that you could possibly imagine on a grill i had some of the same concerns that you did this is another one of those cases where a company that saw a huge boost of growth during the pandemic for exactly the reasons you stated and i certainly want to watch for their growth to normalize and see what that s going to be post pandemic jose najarro toby quick question i live here in the east coast during fall and winter i hate it because i can t go outside and grill i was wondering i ve never really looked at it i have a weber outside as well and that s usually spring some of my favorite times super easy to use do they have anything for like indoor use i know pre pandemic where i pretty sure a lot of my friends were living in places like apartments and stuff like that someplace where they can t have a grill do they have any products that deal with those type of consumers that might want to have the weber grill taste but indoors or not some place where they can have it outdoors bordelon they do it s not going to give you the same thing but they do have a series of electric grill basically they are electric grills similar to i guess maybe the innovators in this category you would say would be the george foreman grill but they do have a series of those so that you can plug in some can be used outdoors some can be used indoors i think i ve seen one that almost looks like the kettle grill it s made for outdoor use but it s made for like a balcony where they say you can t have any grill but if you re just plugging it in and basically having it still outside it s fine those do exist if you re looking for that grill like the grill marks the grill style maybe it s something worth looking at to get one for your kitchen for indoor stuff you can jose and you can get this from weber depending on model of the grill you have they will sell you accessories like no one s business because those are high margin stuff you can get insulating blankets to throw over your grill to help regulate that temperature that doesn t help you when you have to go out in the snow but you can t get an insulating blanket to use for the grills so you re not using as much fuel if you just insist on having some smoke ribs in january najarro i don t know if i ll take a look at the stock but maybe i ll definitely take a look at those products you guys just mentioned vena then after you do that then maybe folks will have a bit of the shares enough because jose went out and bought that grill it might have that effect

value had tanked listen to what he said daniel santamaria ots so a very cheap price for them and they are going to have returns of investment right now of three four five times what they invested and those returns are at the expense of people of puerto rico the behavior of the hedge funds it s legal so far but it s an unethical and unfair and unjust outcome florido legal but unethical and unfair do you agree with his assessment and if so why could you not have pushed these creditors to give up a little bit more jaresko we have done everything within the law within federal bankruptcy law and i think that s really an important element to understand here this isn t a sovereign debt negotiation without rules this is something promesa put us into the u s federal court system and u s bankruptcy rules promesa and bankruptcy rules one thing that those rules do is they don t allow you to discriminate between holders you don t know who the ultimate holder is when you re making this when you re having this negotiation what their cost basis is which is what daniel is referring to is not an issue not a relevant issue in bankruptcy so it s unfair and unjust i don t believe applies because it is the fairness the justness of it is exactly what the judge is going to be determining when she confirms or when she issues her decision florido natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico natalie thanks for joining us jaresko thank you soundbite of the marias song spin me around transcript provided by npr copyright npr

washington tornadoes are a frequent and often devastating weather phenomenon most commonly seen in the united states but meteorologists are still unable to say exactly how they originate the us typically has more tornadoes than anywhere else in the world though they can occur almost anywhere according to the national weather service nws advertisement hardest hit are great plains states like kansas oklahoma and texas though they are also common in many other states all east of the rocky mountains origins scientists still struggle to pinpoint the precise way in which these powerful storms form much about tornadoes remains a mystery according to the national severe storm laboratory part of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa they are rare deadly and difficult to predict and they can deal out millions or even billions of dollars in property damage per year what is known is that they generally result from so called supercell thunderstorms characterized by extremely powerful updrafts according to noaa within the storm a strong vertical wind shear causes a horizontally rotating cylinder of air the updraft lifts the rotating cylinder within the supercell the rotating cylinder of air narrows becoming stretched and spins faster and faster forming a tornado the nws notes tornadoes develop extremely rapidly and may dissipate just as quickly most tornadoes are on the ground for less than 15 minutes devastation tornadoes are nature s most violent storms according to the nws with winds that can reach nearly 300 miles per hour 500 kph they can wreak devastation on a path more than one mile wide and 50 miles long or longer advertisement the devastating tornado that killed dozens in kentucky on december 11 2021 stayed on the ground for 227 miles said kentucky governor andy beshear that would be a record if confirmed on average tornadoes claim 50 lives in the us each year noaa said the spring of 2011 brought the deadliest spate of tornadoes in recent history with more than 580 people losing their lives in april and june they caused damage estimated at 21 billion after a tornado passes scientists evaluate its strength based on the damage inflicted and on measurements of wind speed they then classify it using the enhanced fujita ef scale which assigns ratings from ef 0 to ef 5 ef 0 means light damage and wind gusts of 65 to 85 mph while ef 5 signifies gusts of over 200 mph and incredible damage before 2007 the original fujita scale used ratings of f 0 to f 5 survivors tales the nws has gathered first person accounts from tornado survivors like william a resident of smithville mississippi who was at home watching the news when a powerful storm struck in 2011 he heard a local meteorologist say the storm was coming to smithville and i just stood there watching waiting looking at the tv and thinking this isn t gonna happen about 30 seconds later the power went out and the entire house shook for a minute and then stopped and i thought it was over so i was about to get up from my floor when the shaking began again and wouldn t stop this time i felt the pressure drop and as the shaking got louder i got worried then it felt like the house exploded i woke up one hour and a half later in a field a quarter mile away from the house with cuts to my body and a deep cut to my head michelle a resident of the small oklahoma town of skiakook survived a 1991 twister the noises i heard during the tornado hit was indescribable i do remember hearing nails squeak out of boards as they were being forced out she said when it was all over the tornado that hit our town was measured f4 it leveled several of the brick homes in that neighborhood i have rheumatoid arthritis so the intense low pressure temporarily disabled me i couldn t walk your subscription could not be saved please try again your subscription has been successful subscribe to our daily newsletter sign me up it was the absolute most frightening experience i have ever been through related stories

adrian florido host it was almost five years ago that the u s territory of puerto rico declared bankruptcy the island was buckling under more than 70 billion of public debt plus 50 billion in pension obligations it didn t have the money for since then a fiscal oversight board appointed by the u s congress has been negotiating to try to get puerto rico s creditors to accept less money than they re owed now a major deal has been reached and a federal bankruptcy judge is considering whether to approve it puerto rico s governor and legislature support the deal saying it s the territory s only chance to emerge from bankruptcy but the deal also has many critics who say it doesn t do enough to make puerto rico s debt affordable to discuss this deal we re joined by the woman who negotiated it natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico ms jaresko welcome natalie jaresko thank you florido i d like to start by asking you to give me just a sort of very brief sense of the magnitude of puerto rico s debt jaresko so as you said earlier adrian when the financial oversight board was established in 2016 it was a result of having accumulated over 70 billion of debt across a dozen or more issuers and an incremental 50 55 billion in unfunded pension liabilities and compare that to gnp of about 80 billion a year that is an overwhelming debt level for this island florido and so why do you consider this deal that you ve reached with puerto rico s creditors now a good one what does it achieve jaresko so this plan takes us out of bankruptcy and it does it in a affordable sustainable way it resolves about half of that debt that i described so about 30 35 billion of claims against the commonwealth against the territorial government and a large portion about 50 billion of the pension unfunded liabilities and so it accomplishes everything i think the promesa s set out to accomplish it ensures that the debt is reduced it ensures that the lawsuits are resolved it provides stability so that investment can return to the island and it provides confidence that because it is a sustainable level of debt that the government will be able to use all incremental revenues all incremental funds going forward to improve the situation on the island whether it s education public safety or other florido you mentioned promesa i should just note that that is the federal law that essentially established puerto rico rico s ability to declare bankruptcy and also created the board that you now lead as i mentioned puerto rico s governor pedro pierluisi and its legislature both support this deal but the deal has faced many criticisms from some prominent economists from a lot of everyday puerto ricans i want to ask you about a couple of those criticisms and the first is this argument that this deal is actually not affordable for the island because when you add other obligations like its pension obligations and the rest of its debt that is not part of this deal the government is still going to be devoting a really large chunk of its annual budget to paying off its creditors rather than on essential public services what do you say to that jaresko it s not true people are misunderstanding the numbers if you look at what it was prior to bankruptcy the government was spending approximately 25 cents of every dollar of taxpayer revenues on debt after this bankruptcy is finished it will be paying 7 cents of every dollar it s a substantial reduction in debt service it s a reduction of 50 billion over the life of the debt i think the other thing people don t recognize is that we limited the debt to less than 8 of revenues and that is something that is a very reasonable level it is an affordable level to pay approximately 8 of your less than 8 of your revenues towards debt florido another criticism of this deal is that you know some of puerto rico s richest and most powerful creditors like banks and hedge funds that own a lot of puerto rico s debt are making off with a profit whereas others like retired teachers for example will never see another cost of living increase to their pensions again i d like you to listen to daniel santamaria ots an economist who spoke to me about the fact that a lot of the territory s debt is owned by banks and hedge funds that scooped up government bonds after their value had tanked listen to what he said daniel santamaria ots so a very cheap price for them and they are going to have returns of investment right now of three four five times what they invested and those returns are at the expense of people of puerto rico the behavior of the hedge funds it s legal so far but it s an unethical and unfair and unjust outcome florido legal but unethical and unfair do you agree with his assessment and if so why could you not have pushed these creditors to give up a little bit more jaresko we have done everything within the law within federal bankruptcy law and i think that s really an important element to understand here this isn t a sovereign debt negotiation without rules this is something promesa put us into the u s federal court system and u s bankruptcy rules promesa and bankruptcy rules one thing that those rules do is they don t allow you to discriminate between holders you don t know who the ultimate holder is when you re making this when you re having this negotiation what their cost basis is which is what daniel is referring to is not an issue not a relevant issue in bankruptcy so it s unfair and unjust i don t believe applies because it is the fairness the justness of it is exactly what the judge is going to be determining when she confirms or when she issues her decision florido natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico natalie thanks for joining us jaresko thank you soundbite of the marias song spin me around transcript provided by npr copyright npr

composite image background shows 5th district courthouse cedar city utah april 15 2021 inset photo shows shawn michael smith during a pretrial conference november 2021 background photo by jeff richards inset image screenshot courtesy of 5th district court st george news cedar city news cedar city a cedar city man has been convicted of raping a 13 year old girl more than 18 years ago shawn michael smith 42 was found guilty by a jury thursday night following a two day trial the eight member jury deliberated for approximately two hours before returning to the courtroom and delivering the verdict to 5th district judge matthew l bell smith s sentencing has been scheduled for feb 2 the case focused on an incident that reportedly happened on or about june 25 2003 after smith then 23 had given the young teen a ride home from a local gym to the apartment that smith shared with his wife and mother the 13 year old girl who was friends with smith s sister in law had also been staying there temporarily while the two were alone inside the residence smith first rubbed himself up against the girl and asked for sex after which he threatened the girl with a knife and forcibly raped her prosecutor shane klenk said during his opening statement wednesday afternoon klenk told jurors that after the rape and prior to leaving the residence smith forced the girl to wash out her vagina and cervix with a baby oil bottle that had been refilled with soapy water thinking it would eliminate any trace of his bodily fluids smith remained utterly unconcerned and confident that his dna would not be found klenk said during his opening statement and for 17 long years he was right klenk said that the technology available in 2003 was unable to generate a dna profile sufficient for comparison due to the small volume of the sample that was collected the prosecutors at the time decided that without dna evidence they could not proceed forward with the case he said then in 2017 the sample in question was ordered to be retested as part of a statewide initiative passed by the utah legislature designed to improve rape test kit procedures and follow up when it was retested it was now with equipment that was far more advanced far more precise and far more sensitive klenk continued and this time a dna profile was generated that dna profile was then compared to shawn smith s dna and it was a match over the course of the trial several witnesses were called to the stand to testify the first was the woman now 31 who had reported being raped by smith while on the witness stand she shared details of the encounter and said that smith had exited the apartment by going out a back window but was still seen by a 17 year old male acquaintance that she d called and asked to come over and who had been knocking at the front door that witness identified in court as steve renner now lives in minnesota he said he hasn t been in touch with the girl he d befriended or her family since 2003 nevertheless renner told the court he felt it was important for him to appear in court and provide his testimony as to what he saw and heard that day i believe that she deserves justice he said other witnesses included police officers medical personnel and forensic technicians who had been involved in collecting and handling evidence in the case throughout the trial defense attorney shain manuele had challenged various witnesses recollections of long ago events in several instances a witness admitted they had little or no memory of a certain detail such as how long and how many times renner had knocked on the door the size and color of the knife the precise timeline of each person s whereabouts that day and whether or not certain follow up interviews had been conducted in his closing argument manuele asked the jury to consider any contradictions and inconsistencies in the testimony and apply them to the standard of reasonable doubt the state s proof must be more powerful than that he said it must be beyond a reasonable doubt proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly convinced of the defendant s guilt you should also consider whether the witness gives self contradicting testimony or was contradicted by other evidence manuele added earlier he had specifically challenged the accuser s credibility saying that she d changed certain key aspects of her story guess what she was also told that the reports were gone manuele told the jury she has a clean slate she gets to tell her story afresh and anew but we do have documents from 2003 that completely contradict what she said and completely destroy her credibility the reference to reports being gone was an issue brought up throughout the case certain police records made in 2003 including audio recordings of interviews had since been destroyed as part of the protocol of the police department s retention policy although the defense had raised objections related to the loss of such evidence prior to the trial the court overruled the objections and said there was still sufficient evidence for the case to continue during his closing argument iron county attorney chad dotson said he and the other prosecutors also wished that the destroyed records particularly the recordings of the initial interviews were still available this was a case that wasn t anticipated to be prosecuted until the saki initiative and the kit was retested he said referring to the legislature s sexual assault kit initiative nothing malicious going on here nobody destroying things trying to do anything untoward or unethical the only person that did anything to try and destroy evidence or hide evidence in this case was the defendant dotson added when did he do that that baby oil bottle he worked very hard and he was confident in his ability that he had washed out every last sperm cell that he d left behind that s the only person that s destroyed any evidence in this case following the closing arguments the jury left the courtroom about 5 30 p m thursday and deliberated for approximately two hours before returning with their unanimous verdict smith who has been incarcerated in iron county jail since march 23 faces at least five years in prison when he is sentenced in february after the trial concluded dotson told cedar city news this has been a unique and important case for our office

the holiday season is upon us meaning it s time to reflect on another pandemic year and raise our glasses to celebrate the big and small joys that have kept us going drinking has been a big part of winter holiday celebrations for nearly thousands of years it s been around for a long time and since the beginning of time there have also been people who have not been able to use alcohol in moderation says dr anna lembke a psychiatrist at stanford university and the author of dopamine nation finding balance in the age of abundance lembke and other experts say most people who drink alcohol over the next few weeks with family at office parties on new year s eve will be just fine but they also point out that this can be a uniquely risky time of year for some alcohol consumers if you think alcohol is problematic for you or want to avoid drinking too much during the holidays or just aren t the biggest drinker here are some strategies for navigating end of year celebrations remember the holidays can be a slippery slope our experts generally agree that risky and potentially problematic drinking increases this time of year sometimes with long term health consequences around thanksgiving i always gave myself this excuse that it was the holidays and i d always say this is the time of year this is when everybody s drinking says kim kearns a stay at home mom in massachusetts who writes about her recovery from alcohol use disorder alcohol is tangled up in many holiday rituals we love but the shorter days the colder weather and overwhelming social calendars can also leave some of us feeling more vulnerable or if you re spending the end of year away from loved ones you may be tempted to stock up on alcohol holidays are a time of great expectations which can be when things don t go according to how we envision they should go says lembke and although we can love our families and friends getting together can be stressful so if you re feeling the holiday blues remind yourself that with the joy and warmth of the season comes an increased temptation to drink more as a way to cope with social anxieties keep track of how much you drink to keep from slipping into risky behavior experts say it s a good idea to keep an eye on your alcohol consumption not just on one given night or at a single party but over the course of each week according to lembke a safe and realistic drinking limit to keep in mind is three drinks in a day and seven drinks in a week for women for men it s more four drinks in a day and 14 drinks in a week the centers for disease control and prevention recommends even less for a healthier lifestyle one drink or less in a day and seven drinks in a week for women and two drinks in a day and 14 drinks in a week for men this all of course varies for every person quantity and frequency matter lembke says we measure a standard drink as either one 12 ounce one 5 ounce glass of wine or 1 to 1 ½ ounce of hard liquor many of the people npr heard from also suggested having a friend partner or spouse help keep track of drinking behavior and remember drinking even less alcohol or abstaining altogether is widely considered the healthiest option be ready to resist the pressure to drink another challenge experts say we should be prepared for are steady nudges from our loved ones to keep drinking past our healthy limits i felt a huge amount of fear in facing the social scene and all my friends says kim kearns who has given up alcohol altogether dr tyler oesterle who is the medical director at the mayo clinic s fountain center says this unaddressed pressure to drink can result in awkward conversations and even conflict among loved ones one strategy oesterle offers is having a scripted response in mind so when your favorite aunt offers you a glass of wine and you ve decided not to have wine that evening have something prepared your response can be as simples as no thank you i m not drinking tonight or i m good i ve been drinking too much lately or if you want to avoid the where s your drink question altogether you can also carry around a cup of a non alcoholic beverage like soda seltzer or even water you can always opt out it isn t easy to say no to loved ones and stay home during the holidays but experts say another important strategy for healthy drinking particularly for those who prefer abstinence is not going to that party at all keeping yourself in a safe place is the priority says david dorschu who heads recovery centers of america an addiction treatment program in new jersey you can instead make plans that don t involve alcohol like watching a movie or grabbing coffee with a friend if being social still sounds appealing kim kearns says she went into this year s holiday season with a plan that includes stepping away from gatherings when they become overwhelming i go for a walk i write i take breaks for myself to do the things that help me relax remember you don t owe anyone a drink and it s okay to turn down that invite and make time for yourself support those who want to drink less even if you don t struggle with alcohol you can support those that want to drink less or the non drinkers in your life this season when it comes to holiday parties make sure drinking feels like a choice and not an obligation try to make everyone feel welcome even if they re only drinking a little or abstaining altogether whether that be a company holiday party or a family function you have to have options for folks that are non alcoholic that s number one says dorschu number two you re creating an atmosphere where people feel comfortable to decline and say no thank you oesterle says it helps for hosts to let go of gestures of hospitality can i get you a drink want another beer that once seemed warm and inviting but can pressure guests to grab an unwanted drink there can even be a fun side to downsizing alcohol consumption during the holidays lembke says some hosts are offering fancy celebratory drinks that aren t alcoholic it s something to look forward to she says they want to find ways to reward themselves and celebrate without having an alcoholic drink a version of this

exclusively to business insider subscribers become an insider and start reading now in any other year the invitation wouldn t have raised eyebrows but a los angeles times investigation into the hfpa last year revealed questionable journalistic ethics zero black members and allegations of financial misconduct prompting the entertainment community to explode with demands that the group reform or disband more than 100 public relations firms co signed a letter in march effectively cutting off hfpa access to the talent they represent studios including warnermedia netflix and amazon studios vowed not to engage with the organization until it made meaningful reforms tom cruise returned his three globes statuettes advertisement so when golden globe nominations were announced in december in an awkward muted press event at 6 a m at the beverly hilton most honorees were quiet on social media and the globes ceremony this sunday january 9 will get even less fanfare after 15 years of broadcasting the awards nbc decided to drop the telecast amid the controversy there will be no fancy dinner no red carpet nor any outside press allowed to cover the event still during the run up to the nominations and awards hollywood appears to have left the door open for the hfpa s return to grace multiple sources insider spoke to 15 industry insiders across the studios agencies networks pr firms and the hfpa in december contend that any public perception of a total shut out is inaccurate while major studios rejected the idea of hfpa hosted events and refused to officially submit projects for nominations sources say those same studios quietly continued to provide screener links dvds and event invitations to hfpa member reporters for consideration advertisement meanwhile even at meetings centered on its transformation some hfpa members stirred doubt about their ability to change course with one making an offensive comment about vice president kamala harris racial background on a july call let s not be overly woke kamala harris isn t even black after the publicist coalition authored its march letter it met on several occasions with the hfpa to hash out reforms on one early october call attended by 10 hfpa members president helen hoehne and interim ceo todd boehly explained proposed reforms to a group of 25 to 30 publicists hfpa leadership seemed frustrated said one publicist who attended that its efforts were not being lauded more but the pr coalition had reason to be skeptical in a virtual july meeting attended by around 75 people one hfpa member brought the conversation about reforms to awkward silence advertisement let s not be overly woke kamala harris isn t even black said the hfpa member according to one attendee vice president harris is of multiracial heritage her mother and father moved to the u s from india and jamaica respectively james lee of lee strategy the crisis pr firm hired by the hfpa disputed the wording and context of the comment but did not deny that such a remark was made to paint a broad brush of the membership of the hfpa over one comment taken out of context and prevent a group of foreign journalists from earning a living most of whom are diverse themselves to deny them a living is not worthy of advancing the debate on diversity in this country he told insider nor does it advance the cause of diversity in this industry related stories but it was not the first time the hfpa came under scrutiny over race just two months after the explosive la times investigation longtime hfpa leader philip berk was ousted after sharing a post that called black lives matter a racist hate movement advertisement the hfpa has in recent months added 21 new members including six who are black bringing its membership to 105 the group voted on bylaws to reform the organization and hired a chief diversity officer as well as launched a ceo search interim ceo boehly is the chairman of mrc which owns the company that produces the globes big show big money nbc pays a reported 60 million a year for the rights to the liquored up star packed ceremony whose ratings have stayed relatively strong amid the oscars viewership decline until a pandemic plummet in 2021 the telecast s ad revenues also have stayed steady at around 50 million according to numbers from kantar media cited in the washington post but for those in the hunt for an oscar a globes win even a nomination can be priceless falling just weeks before academy award nominations are announced the globes telecast not only can boost a film s haul at the box office by 31 according to one recent study but also can turn an oscar also ran into a contender though groups like the producers guild are more reliable predictors of oscar nods for all the nonsense associated with them they still carry a lot of weight said one longtime industry pr exec in international markets the golden globes still do mean a lot in terms of promotional value and sales value advertisement one member of the group shared with insider a disney invitation this person received for screenings of steven spielberg s 20th century studios film west side story on december 8 one day before the globes deadline for consideration thanks to its outsize influence this small group of international journalists known for often tone deaf questions scarlett johansson said some remarks have bordered on sexual harassment has been courted much more extravagantly in the past the hfpa and golden globes stock may have taken a plunge but those golden statuettes are way too precious to marketing and tv campaigns and are destined for a comeback way sooner than anyone thinks predicted awards consultant rich licata of licata co what s next for the golden globes after a crisis of their own making this is an industry that historically is in the habit of building up then tearing down then forgiving continued licata several insiders said that while some hfpa members appear out of step the group includes highly regarded journalists such as decades long member silvia bizio who writes for italy s la repubblica and reporter scott orlin who represents germany advertisement the controversy has been financially damaging to members who don t have the access afforded to major national publications and have this year lost the benefit of one on one interviews at exclusive hfpa press conferences as a result of the boycott earlier this year i am now earning 3 5 percent of my usual income michele manelis an hfpa member told insider via email along with the enormous financial loss due to the boycott the metaphorical public flogging in the streets by way of negative and relentless press has been incredibly damaging to my reputation manelis who moved to la in 1990 and joined the hfpa in 2012 said she made a reasonable living interviewing stars for australian and new zealand outlets filing three to five stories a week this year she said she has been able to file only two or three a month though manelis and others call hollywood s stance toward the hfpa a boycott screening invitations from studios indicate otherwise several publicity and studio sources said that while they are not hosting screenings specifically for the hfpa there is no ban on its members attending events or requesting interviews advertisement but lee said that over the summer hfpa members consistently requested interviews that were denied and have had access only via a few select interviews in small group settings it s hard to see people you ve known for a long time go through that said the industry pr exec on the flip side there were people in that organization who weren t great who weren t professional one signatory of the pr coalition letter who identifies as non white and owns an agency that represents many non white performers is in no rush to work with them again for me words are meaningless i need action and i am not having my clients be the ones who tokenized said this person via email i hope they get it right and appreciate the long overdue overhaul but i need more time and action to be shown before i jump in with open arms advertisement added another pr

the holiday season is upon us meaning it s time to reflect on another pandemic year and raise our glasses to celebrate the big and small joys that have kept us going drinking has been a big part of winter holiday celebrations for nearly thousands of years it s been around for a long time and since the beginning of time there have also been people who have not been able to use alcohol in moderation says dr anna lembke a psychiatrist at stanford university and the author of dopamine nation finding balance in the age of abundance lembke and other experts say most people who drink alcohol over the next few weeks with family at office parties on new year s eve will be just fine but they also point out that this can be a uniquely risky time of year for some alcohol consumers if you think alcohol is problematic for you or want to avoid drinking too much during the holidays or just aren t the biggest drinker here are some strategies for navigating end of year celebrations remember the holidays can be a slippery slope our experts generally agree that risky and potentially problematic drinking increases this time of year sometimes with long term health consequences around thanksgiving i always gave myself this excuse that it was the holidays and i d always say this is the time of year this is when everybody s drinking says kim kearns a stay at home mom in massachusetts who writes about her recovery from alcohol use disorder alcohol is tangled up in many holiday rituals we love but the shorter days the colder weather and overwhelming social calendars can also leave some of us feeling more vulnerable or if you re spending the end of year away from loved ones you may be tempted to stock up on alcohol holidays are a time of great expectations which can be when things don t go according to how we envision they should go says lembke and although we can love our families and friends getting together can be stressful so if you re feeling the holiday blues remind yourself that with the joy and warmth of the season comes an increased temptation to drink more as a way to cope with social anxieties keep track of how much you drink to keep from slipping into risky behavior experts say it s a good idea to keep an eye on your alcohol consumption not just on one given night or at a single party but over the course of each week according to lembke a safe and realistic drinking limit to keep in mind is three drinks in a day and seven drinks in a week for women for men it s more four drinks in a day and 14 drinks in a week the centers for disease control and prevention recommends even less for a healthier lifestyle one drink or less in a day and seven drinks in a week for women and two drinks in a day and 14 drinks in a week for men this all of course varies for every person quantity and frequency matter lembke says we measure a standard drink as either one 12 ounce one 5 ounce glass of wine or 1 to 1 ½ ounce of hard liquor many of the people npr heard from also suggested having a friend partner or spouse help keep track of drinking behavior and remember drinking even less alcohol or abstaining altogether is widely considered the healthiest option be ready to resist the pressure to drink another challenge experts say we should be prepared for are steady nudges from our loved ones to keep drinking past our healthy limits i felt a huge amount of fear in facing the social scene and all my friends says kim kearns who has given up alcohol altogether dr tyler oesterle who is the medical director at the mayo clinic s fountain center says this unaddressed pressure to drink can result in awkward conversations and even conflict among loved ones one strategy oesterle offers is having a scripted response in mind so when your favorite aunt offers you a glass of wine and you ve decided not to have wine that evening have something prepared your response can be as simples as no thank you i m not drinking tonight or i m good i ve been drinking too much lately or if you want to avoid the where s your drink question altogether you can also carry around a cup of a non alcoholic beverage like soda seltzer or even water you can always opt out it isn t easy to say no to loved ones and stay home during the holidays but experts say another important strategy for healthy drinking particularly for those who prefer abstinence is not going to that party at all keeping yourself in a safe place is the priority says david dorschu who heads recovery centers of america an addiction treatment program in new jersey you can instead

william germundson left and glenn bailey crossroads urban center food pantry director unload food at the center in salt lake city on wednesday dec 1 2021 we are here today in the heart of downtown salt lake city to talk to the man in charge of the top rated charity in utah but first glenn bailey has a truck to unload a white pickup has just backed up to the rear of the crossroads urban center loaded with several dozen boxes of donated food glenn joins a couple of staff members who have left their desks to pitch in it s like they ve done this a thousand times except that estimate is almost assuredly on the low side crossroads is a low overhead place as you can see everybody kind of helps everybody do everything says glenn suggesting that might help explain why charity navigator a respected national organization in the business of assessing charities has accorded crossroads the top spot in its ratings of the state s nonprofits grading out with a 98 1 financial score and a perfect 100 for accountability and transparency a look around the 118 year old house that serves as crossroads headquarters seconds glenn s motion that this is a no frills no airs all hands on deck kind of place the ornate two story building a mansion in its time was constructed in 1903 it started out as a private residence but that changed when it was acquired by the methodist church in 1905 for the first six decades of its existence it served as a sort of women s dormitory first for methodist women missionaries then for young methodist women working or going to school in the city in 1966 the house transformed into the crossroads urban center dedicated to helping the poor the needy the disadvantaged the down and out the underprivileged the house long since paid for is still owned by the united methodist women but over the years crossroads has evolved into a self contained nonprofit governed by a 24 person board of directors and supported by dozens of area churches family foundations and other charity minded organizations and individuals we have donors who give anywhere from 10 to 50 000 says glenn those 10 gifts don t help the bottom line as much but they mean a lot because you know that person is giving what they can give and they trust you with it it s humbling to see how much people invest in crossroads and how much confidence they have in our work erika gee crossroads urban center food pantry assistant stocks shelves at the center in salt lake city on wednesday dec 1 2021 jeffrey d allred deseret news the donations along with thousands of hours of volunteer service each year provide food clothing blankets shoes help with rent and utility payments and many other services including a free of charge landline phone in the front office it gets used a lot says glenn crossroads has become a true community center that s fitting for glenn since he is a true community organizer picture barack obama but without the white house born in 1960 the same year as obama glenn a native of michigan first came to utah and the crossroads urban center in 1984 when he was offered a job over the phone he d just completed a two year service mission for the united methodist church in oklahoma city which he signed on for after getting his bachelor s degree in political science and public policy at kalamazoo college the work he did in oklahoma serving the underserved had nothing to do with his major but everything to do with what he wanted to do with the rest of his life i came to understand this is what i was meant to do i decided i d look to stay in some sort of helping profession particularly regarding issues around poverty crossroads was 18 years old and bailey just 24 when he drove his beat up 1975 ford ltd station wagon to a place he d never seen and took a position on the staff he d risen to the position of deputy executive director when he left in 1988 for a job in chicago as a community organizer on the southwest side he arrived the year barack obama left chicago as a community organizer to go to harvard law crossroads urban center is pictured in salt lake city on wednesday dec 1 2021 jeffrey d allred deseret news in 1992 he returned to crossroads when the executive director position opened and the board remembering bailey s dedication and his skills offered him the job remembering the mountains the great outdoors and the city he d grown to love glenn said yes in the 29 years since he s seen everything grow the population the needs the homelessness when i started as director we served the occasional homeless person but mostly we served families and kids but over the years that has shifted usually more than half we feed each month from this facility are experiencing homelessness that s very different from 30 years ago the giving has also increased as has the entire crossroads operation in addition to the downtown location another food pantry and a thrift store have been added on the west side the cause though remains the same try and make the world a better place glenn says summing it up try to give people hope i think that s the critical thing people need to be able to look forward to something glenn has finished unloading the pickup the staff members have retreated to their separate workstations he looks around him the neighborhood keeps changing high rise luxury apartments are on all sides of the 118 year old house we re surrounded by apartments that nobody who comes here is ever going to live in he muses but crossroads urban center remains a downtown refuge a no questions asked sanctuary a

2021cyber immunity the great challenge for companies in 2022 report this adtcrn staff creating a conscious alternative news network that we feel the world needs pura vida along with the beginning of the crisis created by covid 19 a global cyber pandemic was unleashed given the complexity of threats and the increase in attacks on companies it is important to adopt practices that seek a type of immunity to manage resist and then be able to respond to attacks or interruptions we are going through a series of threats with cyber pandemic characteristics with more sophisticated attacks worldwide so companies must pay special attention to protecting themselves against risks defending and limiting the severity of attacks for this reason within the framework of the international day of information security which will take place on november 30th we want to highlight the main trends and challenges that companies will face in 2022 says ángel salazar general manager of soluciones seguras guatemala tip get our latest content by joining our newsletter don t miss out on news that matter in costa rica click here the global impact that this pandemic has had is represented by the 40 increase in weekly attacks on organizations in 2021 compared to 2020 mainly in latin america social engineering techniques were used increasing the attack surface with main attention to corporate devices the so called byod bring your own device or the unsecured internet connections used by some remote employees this is why companies like all countries are seeking immunity that allows them to face attacks and according to the predictions made by experts from check point a partner of secure solutions the risks that companies will face worldwide during 2022 are also related to malware privacy and cyber conflicts among the main predictions are fake news and disinformation campaigns are back misinformation campaigns about covid 19 and vaccines were identified during 2021 in 2022 this trend will continue with groups of cybercriminals taking advantage of this type of campaign to deploy phishing attacks and scams attacks on supply chains attacks on supply chains will be on the rise so governments will need to establish regulations to address these disruptions and protect networks it is also estimated that they will seek to collaborate with the private sector as well as other countries to identify and target more threat groups operating on a global and regional scale the cyber cold war intensifies the improvement of infrastructures and technological capabilities will allow terrorist groups or political groups to launch and carry out more sophisticated or far reaching attacks these cyber attacks will increasingly be used as indirect conflicts to destabilize activities or economies globally data breaches will be more expensive and on a larger scale starting in 2022 we will see an increase in data breaches with greater frequency and scale such leaks will tend to be more expensive and more difficult for businesses and governments to recover the ransoms demanded by the attackers are expected to increase in 2022 attacks on mobile devices are on the rise as more people use their devices as digital wallets and payment platforms malware attacks on them will increase and cybercriminals will evolve their techniques to exploit the growing dependence on mobile devices cryptocurrencies become focal point for global cyber attacks when money is turned purely into software the cybersecurity needed to protect against hackers stealing and manipulating bitcoins will change unexpectedly in 2022 it is expected to see an increase in attacks related to cryptocurrency wallets or users cybercriminals will exploit vulnerabilities in microservices due to the microservices architecture adopted by cloud service providers csps cybercriminals are expected to use vulnerabilities to launch large scale attacks attackers will use deepfake technology as a weapon fake video or audio techniques are now advanced enough to be used to create targeted content that manipulates sentiment stock prices or worse as in the case of other mobile attacks that are based on social engineering the results of a phishing attack can range from fraud to the most advanced espionage these attackers will use these types of deepfake social engineering methods to obtain permissions and access confidential data of companies people etc penetration tools will continue to grow globally in 2021 every week 1 out of 61 organizations was affected by ransomware it will continue to grow despite efforts by some governments to limit this growth criminals will target companies that can pay a ransom and ransomware attacks will become more sophisticated in 2022 the sophistication and scale of cyber attacks will continue to increase to stay ahead of threats organizations must be proactive and not leave any part of their assets unprotected or they run the risk of

adrian florido host it was almost five years ago that the u s territory of puerto rico declared bankruptcy the island was buckling under more than 70 billion of public debt plus 50 billion in pension obligations it didn t have the money for since then a fiscal oversight board appointed by the u s congress has been negotiating to try to get puerto rico s creditors to accept less money than they re owed now a major deal has been reached and a federal bankruptcy judge is considering whether to approve it puerto rico s governor and legislature support the deal saying it s the territory s only chance to emerge from bankruptcy but the deal also has many critics who say it doesn t do enough to make puerto rico s debt affordable to discuss this deal we re joined by the woman who negotiated it natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico ms jaresko welcome natalie jaresko thank you florido i d like to start by asking you to give me just a sort of very brief sense of the magnitude of puerto rico s debt jaresko so as you said earlier adrian when the financial oversight board was established in 2016 it was a result of having accumulated over 70 billion of debt across a dozen or more issuers and an incremental 50 55 billion in unfunded pension liabilities and compare that to gnp of about 80 billion a year that is an overwhelming debt level for this island florido and so why do you consider this deal that you ve reached with puerto rico s creditors now a good one what does it achieve jaresko so this plan takes us out of bankruptcy and it does it in a affordable sustainable way it resolves about half of that debt that i described so about 30 35 billion of claims against the commonwealth against the territorial government and a large portion about 50 billion of the pension unfunded liabilities and so it accomplishes everything i think the promesa s set out to accomplish it ensures that the debt is reduced it ensures that the lawsuits are resolved it provides stability so that investment can return to the island and it provides confidence that because it is a sustainable level of debt that the government will be able to use all incremental revenues all incremental funds going forward to improve the situation on the island whether it s education public safety or other florido you mentioned promesa i should just note that that is the federal law that essentially established puerto rico rico s ability to declare bankruptcy and also created the board that you now lead as i mentioned puerto rico s governor pedro pierluisi and its legislature both support this deal but the deal has faced many criticisms from some prominent economists from a lot of everyday puerto ricans i want to ask you about a couple of those criticisms and the first is this argument that this deal is actually not affordable for the island because when you add other obligations like its pension obligations and the rest of its debt that is not part of this deal the government is still going to be devoting a really large chunk of its annual budget to paying off its creditors rather than on essential public services what do you say to that jaresko it s not true people are misunderstanding the numbers if you look at what it was prior to bankruptcy the government was spending approximately 25 cents of every dollar of taxpayer revenues on debt after this bankruptcy is finished it will be paying 7 cents of every dollar it s a substantial reduction in debt service it s a reduction of 50 billion over the life of the debt i think the other thing people don t recognize is that we limited the debt to less than 8 of revenues and that is something that is a very reasonable level it is an affordable level to pay approximately 8 of your less than 8 of your revenues towards debt florido another criticism of this deal is that you know some of puerto rico s richest and most powerful creditors like banks and hedge funds that own a lot of puerto rico s debt are making off with a profit whereas others like retired teachers for example will never see another cost of living increase to their pensions again i d like you to listen to daniel santamaria ots an economist who spoke to me about the fact that a lot of the territory s debt is owned by banks and hedge funds that scooped up government bonds after their value had tanked listen to what he said daniel santamaria ots so a very cheap price for them and they are going to have returns of investment right now of three four five times what they invested and those returns are at the expense of people of puerto rico the behavior of the hedge funds it s legal so far but it s an unethical and unfair and unjust outcome florido legal but unethical and unfair do you agree with his assessment and if so why could you not have pushed these creditors to give up a little bit more jaresko we have done everything within the law within federal bankruptcy law and i think that s really an important element to understand here this isn t a sovereign debt negotiation without rules this is something promesa put us into the u s federal court system and u s bankruptcy rules promesa and bankruptcy rules one thing that those rules do is they don t allow you to discriminate between holders you don t know who the ultimate holder is when you re making this when you re having this negotiation what their cost basis is which is what daniel is referring to is not an issue not a relevant issue in bankruptcy so it s unfair and unjust i don t believe applies because it is the fairness the justness of it is exactly what the judge is going to be determining when she confirms or when she issues her decision florido natalie jaresko is executive director of the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico natalie thanks for joining us jaresko thank you soundbite of the marias song spin me around transcript provided by npr copyright npr
menafn jordan times wellington there are many legitimate complaints about work in the gig economy but in time many of the gigs will be automated eliminating a significant source of work for immigrants and the less educated and as these jobs disappear so too will social contacts between socioeconomic classes and between immigrants and natives the broader question then is the impact of the impending loss of involuntary social mixing on diverse multiethnic societies consider uber which provides work to many immigrants according to the company s website uber is keen to foster happiness and inclusiveness by means of global cultural and community events to increase and enhance cross cultural learning and understanding but while that people centered message certainly sounds nice uber has placed its hopes and its future profitability in automated vehicles avs in anticipation of its disappointing 2019 initial public offering uber disclosed losses of 1 8 billion for the previous year owing partly to its payout of 1 billion in driver referrals and other incentives to gig workers since the ipo the company s stock has struggled because it has yet to demonstrate that it can turn a profit with its human driver model avs are an obvious potential solution to this problem as uber s founder travis kalanick foresaw back in 2013 viewing a google driverless car prototype he concluded that the minute your car becomes real i can take the dude out of the front seat i call that margin expansion needless to say gig work in the sharing economy has disappointed earlier expectations that it would produce an explosion of micro entrepreneurship driving an uber is no one s dream job and the company s drivers have found themselves locked in a protracted battle for better pay and work conditions nonetheless we should bear in mind the social interactions that will be lost when all ubers indeed all transportation become driverless the same concerns apply to retail work which amazon plans to eliminate through its amazon go cashier less convenience stores again retail is nobody s dream job not least because it does not pay well but if we eliminate all these positions what occasions will we have to interact with others unlike ourselves humans are naturally gregarious animals our happiness depends on being with other humans but this fundamental trait combines awkwardly with another feature of our evolved psychologies suspicion of strangers this makes perfect sense when one considers that the forager bands of our pleistocene ancestors had around 50 100 members many of whom were related in fact humankind s crowning achievement is not the moon landing or the invention of the computer it is that we the descendants of xenophobic hunter gatherers have built sprawling diverse societies comprising tens of millions of strangers though many students who attend diverse colleges say they enjoy meeting new kinds of people research shows that even these social butterflies tend to stick with their own only when they join the working world do they find that they have no option but to get along with strangers who look sound and act unlike themselves but even then our shy occasionally murderous inner apes will reassert themselves in times of stress or political and economic uncertainty in recent years some of us have found it disturbingly easy to imagine that all immigrants are bringing drugs crime and disease into our countries and social media s biased sampling of our online expression has aggravated this problem as well as deepened social partisan and other divisions how will we form social connections and develop empathy in an economy where teachers baristas cab drivers and retail clerks have all become highly efficient machines we certainly cannot count on social platforms like twitter where our murderous inner apes reign supreme let us return to the example of uber when you hail a ride you can act insultingly or simply sit sullenly but this may affect your rating in the future nearby drivers may skip over you for higher rated passengers but if you engage your drivers in interested and polite conversation you will most likely maintain a good rating better yet these incentives generally lead to enjoyable exchanges you might just learn something interesting from someone you would not otherwise have met as for retail clerks there has been much discussion about the growing social divide between workers in san francisco s flourishing tech industry and all those who perform traditional services for them store clerks do not get to rate google software engineers as customers but at least when they come face to face each gets a glimpse of the other when an initiative proposing a higher minimum wage or more spending on affordable housing appears on the ballot those software engineers may be more likely to support it because they can picture whom it will benefit if amazon go eliminates such encounters san francisco already has four stores will they still support social policies that do not help them directly to be sure commentators in 2030 will probably look back at the introduction of amazon go as the beginning of the end of the human store clerk but as citizens of diverse democracies we should recognise what is at stake when we use technology to disintermediate economic interactions there may come a time when we need to subsidise expensive less efficient work much as we do now with renewable energy the fact is that we need other humans in our lives to avoid despair and we need encounters with those unlike ourselves to sustain our diverse democracies automating service jobs may solve some problems but it will create plenty of new ones will the tradeoff be worth it nicholas agar is professor of ethics at victoria university of wellington new zealand he has written extensively on the human consequences of technological change his latest book is how to be human in the digital economy project syndicate

the holiday season is upon us meaning it s time to reflect on another pandemic year and raise our glasses to celebrate the big and small joys that have kept us going drinking has been a big part of winter holiday celebrations for nearly thousands of years it s been around for a long time and since the beginning of time there have also been people who have not been able to use alcohol in moderation says dr anna lembke a psychiatrist at stanford university and the author of dopamine nation finding balance in the age of abundance lembke and other experts say most people who drink alcohol over the next few weeks with family at office parties on new year s eve will be just fine but they also point out that this can be a uniquely risky time of year for some alcohol consumers if you think alcohol is problematic for you or want to avoid drinking too much during the holidays or just aren t the biggest drinker here are some strategies for navigating end of year celebrations remember the holidays can be a slippery slope our experts generally agree that risky and potentially problematic drinking increases this time of year sometimes with long term health consequences around thanksgiving i always gave myself this excuse that it was the holidays and i d always say this is the time of year this is when everybody s drinking says kim kearns a stay at home mom in massachusetts who writes about her recovery from alcohol use disorder alcohol is tangled up in many holiday rituals we love but the shorter days the colder weather and overwhelming social calendars can also leave some of us feeling more vulnerable or if you re spending the end of year away from loved ones you may be tempted to stock up on alcohol holidays are a time of great expectations which can be when things don t go according to how we envision they should go says lembke and although we can love our families and friends getting together can be stressful so if you re feeling the holiday blues remind yourself that with the joy and warmth of the season comes an increased temptation to drink more as a way to cope with social anxieties keep track of how much you drink to keep from slipping into risky behavior experts say it s a good idea to keep an eye on your alcohol consumption not just on one given night or at a single party but over the course of each week according to lembke a safe and realistic drinking limit to keep in mind is three drinks in a day and seven drinks in a week for women for men it s more four drinks in a day and 14 drinks in a week the centers for disease control and prevention recommends even less for a healthier lifestyle one drink or less in a day and seven drinks in a week for women and two drinks in a day and 14 drinks in a week for men this all of course varies for every person quantity and frequency matter lembke says we measure a standard drink as either one 12 ounce one 5 ounce glass of wine or 1 to 1 ½ ounce of hard liquor many of the people npr heard from also suggested having a friend partner or spouse help keep track of drinking behavior and remember drinking even less alcohol or abstaining altogether is widely considered the healthiest option be ready to resist the pressure to drink another challenge experts say we should be prepared for are steady nudges from our loved ones to keep drinking past our healthy limits i felt a huge amount of fear in facing the social scene and all my friends says kim kearns who has given up alcohol altogether dr tyler oesterle who is the medical director at the mayo clinic s fountain center says this unaddressed pressure to drink can result in awkward conversations and even conflict among loved ones one strategy oesterle offers is having a scripted response in mind so when your favorite aunt offers you a glass of wine and you ve decided not to have wine that evening have something prepared your response can be as simples as no thank you i m not drinking tonight or i m good i ve been drinking too much lately or if you want to avoid the where s your drink question altogether you can also carry around a cup of a non alcoholic beverage like soda seltzer or even water you can always opt out it isn t easy to say no to loved ones and stay home during the holidays but experts say another important strategy for healthy drinking particularly for those who prefer abstinence is not going to that party at all keeping yourself in a safe place is the priority says david dorschu who heads recovery centers of america an addiction treatment program in new jersey you can instead make plans that don t involve alcohol like watching a movie or grabbing coffee with a friend if being social still sounds appealing kim kearns says she went into this year s holiday season with a plan that includes stepping away from gatherings when they become overwhelming i go for a walk i write i take breaks for myself to do the things that help me relax remember you don t owe anyone a drink and it s okay to turn down that invite and make time for yourself support those who want to drink less even if you don t struggle with alcohol you can support those that want to drink less or the non drinkers in your life this season when it comes to holiday parties make sure drinking feels like a choice and not an obligation try to make everyone feel welcome even if they re only drinking a little or abstaining altogether whether that be a company holiday party or a family function you have to have options for folks that are non alcoholic that s number one says dorschu number two you re creating an atmosphere where people feel comfortable to decline and say no thank you oesterle says it helps for hosts to let go of gestures of hospitality can i get you a drink want another beer that once seemed warm and inviting but can pressure guests to grab an unwanted drink there can even be a fun side to downsizing alcohol consumption during the holidays lembke says some hosts are offering fancy celebratory drinks that aren t alcoholic it s something to look forward to she says they want to find ways to reward themselves and celebrate without having an alcoholic drink a version of this

the recent death of 26 year old entrepreneur jake millar prompted an angry backlash against the media over coverage of his failed venture unfiltered some in business cited tall poppy syndrome and claimed the media scrutiny of risk takers and innovators must change but what sort of coverage should they expect photo photo rnz mediawatch unfiltered was unusual an online service offering paying subscribers long video interviews mostly conducted by millar himself with other businesspeople and innovators and investors some of the subjects even invested in unfiltered later alongside millions of dollars of venture capital a crown agency nz venture investment fund took a stake too and new zealand trade and enterprise and the university of auckland s business school also backed it jake millar s own backstory was also compelling for investors and the media alike he d been in business since he was a schoolboy and his father died in an air accident he co founded the company with yuuki ogino but it was the snappily dressed charismatic millar who was the face voice and image of unfiltered when forbes picked him as one of 30 upcoming entrepreneurs under the age of 30 in 2019 he told rnz s morning report it was surreal to be included in a list he had used to source subjects for interviews to monetise but to business journalists the likely value seemed way out of kilter with the investment in it and the claims of backers i commend your business acumen but i am curious to know what you offer that is different from multitudinous ted talks and other similar things the market you re moving into is pretty crowded nbr journalist dita di boni told jake millar in an interview in 2019 nbr also reported that the interviews weren t unfiltered some subjects had creative control over the final edit and some of it was effectively content marketing which is really a form of advertising some investors lost faith in both the business and millar last year and they were prepared to tell the media why in february nbr reported some high net worth kiwis were out of pocket and angry when jake millar suddenly sold unfiltered to crimson education a company founded by his friend and fellow young entrepreneur jamie beaton for a sum reported to be just us60 000 and some shares all that made for quite a story for the media crimson called the acquisition a partnership but new zealand herald investigations reporter matt nippert labelled it a garage sale under the headline from hype to gripe unfiltered collapse sparks shareholder anger the nbr pointed out that both crimson and unfiltered had claimed wage subsidies in 2020 despite backing from american billionaire julian robertson and to venture capital funds and sir john key the fact that jake millar went to kenya and then went incommunicado heightened the media s interest in what had gone wrong but the next time millar made the news was when he died late last month pointing the finger photo photo rnz mediawatch friends acquaintances and fellow entrepreneurs were quick to sheet the blame home at least in part to the media on the online business network linkedin jamie beaton claimed journalists had targeted millar especially the nbr whose owner todd scott had aggressively pursued millar to go on the record about the unraveling of unfiltered some on linkedin even urged nbr customers to cancel their subscriptions jenene crossan the founder of online businesses nz girl and powered by flossie claimed she pleaded with reporters to back off jake millar earlier this year instead she said they reported on an otherwise pretty ordinary and quite vanilla flavoured business failure with spectacular delight the medical equipment innovator sir ray avery who has had his own run ins with the media condemned what he called clickbait assassination journalism he claimed jake millar himself had told him that a tsunami of media attention here had driven him away this prompted pushback from others on the same forum fair and balanced reporting should not be stifled nor should honorable and genuine reporters be tried like this said former tvnz journalist lisa glass now a pr professional even if you genuinely believed this young man was driven out by the media labeling individuals as the cause of complex personal tragedies is both unhelpful and cruel she said former journalist turned tech sector pr man paul brislen said that people in business need to understand the role of media it s not about cheerleading it s not about advertising it s not about promoting you or your products it s about holding power to account he wrote blaming journalists really misses the point of what journalists do and why it s important he said dialing it down two days after lashing the media for their reporting of jake millar last week jamie beaton reconsidered the reporters and commentators are people doing their jobs and as an entrepreneur if we seek coverage for our wins then we have to front up to our losses i know this better than most and understand the trade we make he told his followers on linkedin but plenty of the people who put their names to some fierce criticism of the media on linkedin clearly didn t in a story this week about the special strains faced by founders of fast growing start ups some entrepreneurs spoke of toxic criticism to the herald s andrea fox dr amanda williamson lecturer in innovation and strategy at waikato university told the herald a problem of surface acting by entrepreneurs needs to be addressed fake it until you make it is a big saying you ve got to act confident to get the money people don t want to let down the mask they re very afraid of sharing the harsh realities of what they re going through she said if our attitude in new zealand business and media culture is that failure is unacceptable and will be mocked and punished brutally we will make kiwi entrepreneurship extinct and fast andrew barnes the founder of perpetual guardian wrote in the herald back in march on businessdesk under the headline lessons from the death of a start up founder technology journalist peter griffin said the entrepreneurs do suffer silent despair and some fear exposure of their shortcomings or failures did the media deserve the criticism after jake millar died photo supplied but the media s job is to tell it like it is even if it amplifies anxiety for the subject of a story there was one instance of media behaviour which involved a message the publisher of the nbr sent to jake though it wasn t published in any newspaper or anything like that this crossed the line into bullying and i think the publisher accepts that now that that was a really poor thing to do peter griffin told mediawatch that aside the stories about the collapse of unfiltered were fair he said what surprises many people is the amount of coverage this was a relatively small start up with a few million dollars involved but a lot of big names were interviewed as part of unfiltered he said what journalists latched onto was the contrast between a guy who had an incredible network of successful people yet something went wrong in the culture of this business that led to its own failure he said and if you court the media and the hype that goes with it on the way up you are going to face a lot more scrutiny when things fail he said are any business journalists really out to get tall poppies as the critics claimed after the death of millar look i just don t see it griffin told mediawatch this year we ve had rocket lab list on the nasdaq allbirds list on the nasdaq we ve had vend ninja kiwi and timely this is all being celebrated in the media but along the way there are legitimate questions that need to be answered he said rocket lab had a lot of questions about the military contracts that it s engaged in and how much money the government has pumped into the space industry that benefits rocket lab he said there s been questions raised about the work culture at rocket lab too and peter beck and the people there have responded he said i think it s just really different cultures a lot of the start up people that i interview from time to time are head down in their businesses they don t have a heck of a lot of time to really engage with the media other than in a transactional way when they need to sell their product or raise money he said there s an immaturity around the approach to media that that really needs to be addressed said peter griffin who introduced media training for media phobic scientists and experts when he ran the science media centre a lot of entrepreneurs will hire public relations companies with that specific aim they get this sort of view in their mind that the media is a tool to exploit rather than being something for me to genuinely engage with build relationships with journalists and be prepared for scrutiny a few years back newsroom really called sir ray avery out on some of his business activities and some of the claims he was making there were genuine questions there after years of very positive media coverage griffin said the stories withstood media council complaints and legal challenges he said the media council accepts that journalists must be able to carry out robust investigative journalism even if that involves implicit or direct criticism of institutions or individuals in the public eye the council noted in its ruling avery even tried unsuccessfully to use the so called cyberbullying law the harmful digital communications act to address grievances about newsroom s reporting shifting the focus from the founders photo supplied the spinoff also tracked the rise and fall of unfiltered and the claims and conduct of jake millar as it unraveled in another article reflecting on millar s death managing editor duncan greive a start up founder himself set out some of jake millar s sensitivities and pushback over what was published if there is a lesson to be drawn from it critiquing the media seems a shallow one he said he also concluded the intense focus on the founders of these start ups whether successful or not is unhealthy for everyone get rid of the mythos and allow for the complexity of reality and we might allow them to recover from the consequences of both success and failure with their lives intact he wrote as reporting on millar has been subjected to intense critiques it seems strange that his investors have escaped a similar trial greive wrote but when it fell apart he and most of his fellow investors failed to respond to requests for comment he noted for practical considerations the media are guilty of focusing on one personality the ceo the founder peter griffin told mediawatch at unfiltered was a co founder jake had someone else with with them who really never got any media exposure having some of them stepping up and taking some of the burden off jake i think would have been really useful he said all of this was discussed by some people in the tech and business world last weekend including callaghan innovation ceo vic crone and jenene crossan they don t want this to happen again but business journalists are not psychologists and certainly not counselors how are they supposed to work out if something they publish might put the subject of the story at risk if you have direct knowledge that there is potential harm in publishing something that would give me pause to think griffin said should this be delayed or could we defer this or phrase it in a different way or have someone else from the organisation front the story maybe one of those investors or someone like that he said with sportspeople and with celebrities the media sometimes make those allowances but ultimately that cannot stop the hard questions that need to be asked at some point he said we do have ethical standards in the media people have recourse to the media council and the broadcasting standards authority and there are ethical standards and charters that we must adhere to he said it s just these two cultures that don t quite understand each other linkedin going feral photo afp the most stinging criticism of the media in the wake of jake millar s death was to be found on the microsoft owned online business network linkedin there definitely is something going on with linkedin peter griffin told mediawatch most people use it as their default resume and that s what its primary purpose was but it s become in the last few years much more of a social network a lot of business people are quite libertarian in their outlook and some of the businesses have been devastated by by covid restrictions he said my network is mainly tech and science people but i m starting to see people like a plumber from tauranga appearing in my news feed with 3000 comments on his post railing against covid passports he said the algorithms that underpin this network like any other social network are elevating that stuff because the technology is saying this is where the conversation is happening but i don t want to see this stuff he said people need to realise how damaging that can be for your reputation this is your background your history your reputation on the line if you really start getting intemperate and inappropriate on linkedin everyone is going to see that and that could have serious consequences for your reputation griffin told mediawatch

names preserve a place s story and history many local roads and streams actually have real stories to tell unfortunately some of the names have been altered by people who did not understand or fully appreciate the heritage and story behind the original name when stories are forgotten or names are changed a little piece of our past disappears and our sense of place is diminished here are some local names that tell our story mississippi mississippi is commonly said to be based on an indian word for father of waters however there are two possible choctaw names from which mississippi is based one is place of foreign languages the other is found in a letter from peter pitchlynn published in the columbus whig in january 1861 pitchlynn who grew up on plymouth bluff and became principal chief of the choctaw nation in 1864 wrote that the word mississippi is from a choctaw word which is thus defined as river beyond old or any age columbus according to keeler s 1848 history of columbus spirus roach who had settled in columbus about 1819 occupied and kept entertainment in the 1817 house built by thomas thomas because of the peculiarities of roach s long pointed nose local indians who traded at roach s establishment called roach opossum and referred to columbus as opossum town in the summer of 1819 the residents at the rapidly growing settlement decided a name was needed and silas mcbee suggested columbus on december 6 1819 the alabama legislature officially recognized the town of columbus on january 3 1821 the governor of mississippi announced that lands including columbus were in mississippi not alabama tombigbee the earliest recorded name of the tombigbee river was the river of the chicasa chickasaw that name dates to 1540 and the narratives of spanish explorer hernando de soto in 1805 mississippi territorial judge harry toulmin wrote that the name tombigby came from the choctaw word elome gabee which meant box maker toulmin said that the river was named for a box maker who formerly lived on some of its headwaters pontotoc land office draughtsman edward fontaine wrote in 1848 that the choctaws began calling the river itta ombee aye ika abee or wooden box making river about 1730 he explained the choctaws named the river to commemorate the french teaching them to make wooden boxes in which to ship furs military road work on andrew jackson s military road started in 1817 and it was completed in 1820 the road was constructed after the war of 1812 had ended and there is no evidence jackson ever set foot on the part of the road where columbus was established jackson ordered the road to be built to provide a direct route between nashville and new orleans to address the difficulties he experienced in getting troops to new orleans during the war of 1812 since jackson was instrumental in getting congressional approval for the road and seeing to its construction it was named after him and was referred to as the jackson highway into the 1930s coal fire creek on the highway from columbus to aliceville alabama the road crosses a creek named coal fire creek the original name was cold fire creek early settlers crossing the creek during the winter of 1818 or 1819 described the water as being so cold that it burned them like fire when they crossed it so they named the creek cold fire creek years later people thought that name made no sense and as the story goes they changed the name to coal fire thinking it must have been associated with a fire in the north alabama coal region where the creek s headwaters were located wolfe road in northeastern lowndes county there is an old road now called wolfe road that name is another example of people not appreciating history wolf road as it was originally named is one of the oldest roads in the area in 1872 w e gibbs told the story behind its name that part of our county was then around 1817 1820 a veritably a howling wilderness being made so by innumerable bands of predatory wolves so numerous that the rearing of stock was an impossibility the wolf road took its name from this fact magby creek in 1817 silas mcbee settled on a creek in what is now east columbus the creek soon took the name of mcbee creek as more settlers arrived in 1818 and 1819 a community formed at the nearby tombigbee ferry on the military road at a meeting of the settlers mcbee suggested the new town be named columbus and by december of 1819 the new community was officially recognized as the town of columbus however the name of mcbee s creek did not survive in that spelling mcbee apparently pronounced his name as magby and the creek s name became corrupted to its present spelling of magby creek magowah creek magowah creek flows eastward across southwestern lowndes county to the tombigbee river local tradition says that magowah is taken from a choctaw word for impassable swamp or waters an 1817 survey shows the spelling as macawa that definition makes perfect sense as magowah bottom after a heavy rain is an almost impassable five or six mile wide swampy flood plain several large plantations were established on the fertile prairies around magowah by 1884 there was a magowah school and the families in the area referred to their residence as magowah to complicate the story one of the 1820s settlers in lowndes county was john mcgowan who lived on the east side of the tombigbee but not too far from the mouth of magowah creek and an 1839 map refers to the creek as mccower s creek luxapallia creek it is commonly translated as floating turtle but may be turtle crawls there in 1818 gideon lincecum camped on the creek which he called lookse ok pullia and said it meant a terrapin floating on the water buttahatchee probably means sumac river but some sources say river which comes from the hills tibbee creek it s name is shortened from oktibbeha and based on french version of its name oktibia or octibea in 1772 english explorer bernard romansicalled the creek oka teebehaw it is commonly translated as fighting waters but probably means icy waters so much history is reflected in the names we find around us and those names tell the story of who and where our community had its beginnings
