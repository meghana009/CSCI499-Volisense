new yorkers have witnessed construction of the gleaming freedom tower renamed one world trade center on the site that was ground zero getty images photo although most of lower manhattan s damaged areas have been rebuilt since the 9 11 terrorist attacks destroyed the world trade center 20 years later there are still projects that await completion new yorkers have witnessed construction of the gleaming freedom tower renamed one world trade center on the site that was ground zero a memorial to those who lost their lives on sept 11 2001 also rests on the ground that once supported the twin towers and new yorkers are still waiting for the finish of the oculus a 4 billion train station and mall that sits just steps from the memorial outside of new york many americans may not know that two other structures remain to be built near ground zero world trade center two and a residential building planned for the site where the deutsche bank building once stood and it is still unclear when those projects will be done according to the new york daily news area being rebuilt as mixed use neighborhood the process that began after 9 11 to rebuild the neighborhood has been a long and tortured slog at times in the effort s preliminary stages plans included converting the entire ground zero site into a park and building two new replicas of the twin towers however carl weisbrod an urban planning expert and board member for the lower manhattan development corporation one of the entities central to its redevelopment told the newspaper that the transformation that eventually took place in the neighborhood took longer because of efforts years before the attacks to address the lack of economic diversity in that part of downtown after the 1987 stock market crash planners and business leaders in new york city recognized that the neighborhood s heavy reliance on the financial industry made it all too vulnerable to the whims of the market the daily news reported that at the time the vacancy rate of buildings in the area hovered around 25 percent to remedy that officials decided to diversify it economically by converting buildings to more residential and business uses the aftermath of 9 11 accelerated the process while nothing is worth the loss of 3 000 lives and the tragedy that not only happened that day and the continued sickness and health and medical problems and loss of life of people that were around there that day lower manhattan itself as a place i think has done extremely well over the last 20 years weisbrod said in speaking to the newspaper the strategy of creating a mixed use neighborhood has taken hold it is one of the most diverse in terms of uses and mix of residents and businesses neighborhoods in the city it has a diversity in its commercial sector that would have been hard to imagine pre 2001 as new buildings were constructed new tenants arrived including tech advertising and media companies the reconstruction also allowed developers to correct what weisbrod described as a key planning mistake that occurred when the twin towers were built in the early 1970s even though the twin towers were iconic for new york city for lower manhattan the superblock that the world trade center occupied was really a planning mistake because it separated and kept lower manhattan from being knit together with battery park city sort of isolated with the financial district separated from tribeca he explained the focal point of what the city got in the wake of 9 11 is the memorial the two imprints of the twin towers that are lined with waterfalls and the names of the dead from that day and what was initially known as the freedom tower the 1 776 ft tall skyscraper that replaced the towers as new york s tallest building new projects will be expensive finishing the jobs at ground zero was not surprisingly full of logistical complications building one world trade center for instance spawned a dispute between developer larry silverstein and insurance companies over policies on the location that held up construction and took years to litigate silverstein who also is developing the two remaining world trade center properties received more than 4 billion for the destruction of the twin towers the battle he said was worth it it became obvious to me that we had to rebuild and rebuild as quickly as possible because people were moving out of lower manhattan at an incredible rate he said in comments to the daily news if we were going to rebuild this thing we had to get going to date the total bill for redeveloping the wound left downtown on 9 11 exceeds 20 billion according to silverstein who added that the final total is likely to come in at around 30 billion once the two remaining projects are complete world trade center two which he predicted would top everything at the site has remained stalled the daily news reported in part because the covid 19 pandemic has made it more difficult to secure an anchor tenant or tenants the 3 million sq ft office building is expected to operate with a zero carbon footprint and will utilize artificial intelligence according to silverstein the developer has teamed up with brookfield property partners to build a 1 300 unit 900 ft tall apartment building at the former deutsche bank site which will become known as 5 world trade center when it is finally completed silverstein expects that to occur in about five years currently 28 percent of people who live in lower manhattan also work in the area noted silverstein who predicted that the number would increase once units are rented three hundred apartments in his development are slated as affordable housing i m 90 years of age so i want to see everything finished while i m still here he said it s my life the deutsche bank building was closed following the sept 11 attacks due to contamination that spread from the collapse of the south tower of the world trade center that led to its being demolished

file in this sept 1 2021 file photo a firefighter lights a backfire to stop the caldor fire from spreading near south lake tahoe calif california lawmakers have approved more than 2 billion dollars in new spending aimed at preventing wildfires and addressing the drought the votes on thursday sept 9 mark the end of lawmakers work on the state s 262 5 billion operating budget this year ap photo jae c hong file california lawmakers on thursday voted to spend more than 2 billion to prevent wildfires and address a severe drought closing the book for now on a 262 5 billion operating budget that began the year with a record deficit because of the pandemic and ended with a record surplus in spite of it wildfire spending in california has more than tripled since 2005 surpassing 3 billion last year but most of that money is spent on putting out fires not preventing them that strategy hasn t been working in an era of climate change that is making fires larger than ever and more difficult to put out fifteen of the state s most destructive wildfires have occurred in the last 10 years five of the largest wildfires in state history happened just last year and a fire that s still burning this year is the second largest ever advertisement new spending approved thursday brings california s wildfire prevention budget to more than 1 5 billion the money will pay for things like the strategic clearing of brush and trees that could fuel massive fires in the future it will also pay for a bevy of inspectors to review homes in wildfire prone areas before they are sold lawmakers also approved an additional 1 2 billion to pay for things like grants to plan for climate change water recycling projects and cleaning up contaminated water sources assembly speaker pro tempore kevin mullin a democrat from south san francisco called it the largest state level investment in climate resilience ever but some lawmakers from both parties were disappointed with the final spending package state sen bob wieckowski a democrat from fremont said newsom got everything he wanted in the budget while lawmakers had to sacrifice some of their priorities including hundreds of millions of dollars in additional spending for various sate conservancies that promote and protect undeveloped landscapes it s uninspirational it s not bold wieckowski said of the budget s climate spending during a committee hearing on tuesday the drought in the western united states has drained california s complex system of 1 500 reservoirs that store water for drinking agriculture energy and fish habitat throughout the year one of the biggest lake oroville in northern california has so little water that state officials were forced to shut down a large hydroelectric power plant for the first time ever yet california s spending plan does not have any money for water storage projects the newsom administration noted about 2 7 billion is set aside for seven water storage projects including a plan to build the largest new reservoir in california in more than 40 years but assemblyman vince fong a republican from bakersfield and vice chair of the assembly budget committee said voters approved that money seven years ago and so far nothing has been built this budget is a missed opportunity fong said we have the resources we have the projects but we apparently lack the political will the bills approved thursday represent agreements reached between newsom and democratic leadership in the state legislature but they couldn t agree on everything leaving about 3 3 billion in transportation money unspent that means about 1 billion for infrastructure projects to prepare for the 2028 summer olympics in los angeles will be delayed while negotiations continue into next year other items caught some lawmakers by surprise including raises for commissioners on the public utilities commission of 5 per year for the next three years the commission regulates utility companies in the state and lawmakers have been furious with them for not coming down hard enough on large investor owned utilities like pacific gas electric which owns equipment that has started numerous deadly and destructive wildfires they are not doing their jobs said assemblywoman rebecca bauer kahan a democrat from orinda who spoke against the raises the five commissioners earned between 207 000 and 283 000 in salary and benefits last year according to data compiled by transparent california the newsom administration requested the raises in order to ensure we continue to be competitive with salaries according to assemblyman phil ting a democrat from san francisco and chair of the assembly budget committee thursday s votes marked the end of one of the strangest budget years in memory with large swings in revenue as lawmakers tried and failed to accurately predict the pandemic s impact on the economy last year newsom and the democratic dominated legislature cut spending raised taxes and delayed funding across state government because they thought the state was headed toward a devastating 54 3 billion deficit after the coronavirus forced a statewide shutdown of schools and many businesses instead revenues soared as most office workers kept their jobs and kept paying taxes while they transitioned to working from home meanwhile the super wealthy saw their net worth skyrocket on the back of a strong stock market pouring billions of dollars in capital gains taxes into the state treasury the result was an astonishing 47 billion surplus for california according to an analysis by the nonpartisan legislative analyst s office adding in other new money including aid from the federal government and new revenue for schools means california had more than 100 billion in new money to spend we planned for the worst and we got one of the best budgets in our state history actually the largest budget in our state s history ting said the turnaround could not have come at a better time for newsom who is facing a recall election on tuesday that could end his term one year early newsom and his democratic allies in the state legislature used the new money to hand out up to 1 000 checks to most of the state s adults plus agreed to pay off up to 18 months of unpaid rent for most renters

mammoth freighters llc backed by funds managed by fortress investment group on thursday publicly launched a business that will convert used 777s into all cargo planes that can carry heavy containers on the main deck instead of passenger seats accelerating growth in air cargo shipments has sparked greater interest from investors and operators in revamping large boeing 777 passenger planes into freighters mammoth officials say the reconfigured aircraft will add capacity for cargo shippers and also serve as replacements for aging 747 400 and md 11 freighters a flexible business model will allow air cargo operators express carriers and leasing companies to provide their own assets for conversion or pick up a ready to fly converted freighter from mammoth s existing inventory mammoth has 10 777 200lr aircraft it acquired from delta air lines nyse dal which retired its 777 fleet last year mammoth s investment is driven by an abundance of widebody aircraft that airlines are abandoning for smaller more fuel efficient models more suited to the diminished scale of air travel since covid and people s desire for direct service that doesn t involve hub connections the availability of a substantial amount of 777 200 and 300 feedstock really set this opportunity into motion said brian mccarthy vice president of marketing and sales in an interview the two planes are very similar with the biggest difference being the fuselage of the 300 is about 33 feet longer mccarthy said the market needs about 350 heavy aircraft between now and 2030 with 150 to support expected growth and 200 as replacements the 777s have a large carrying capacity the 200 has a maximum payload of 105 tons and a wide fuselage that make them well suited for dense freight and light e commerce shipments the 777 300 has 14 more volume than a 747 400 and is ideal for lightweight freight that takes up space because it has more interior volume but a similar weight payload compared to its sister that will translate into 10 more main deck pallet positions than the 200lr remodeling a passenger aircraft for heavy cargo is a huge engineering endeavor that involves replacing the passenger door with a wide cargo entrance installing a rigid 9g barrier in front of the cockpit reinforcing the floor plugging windows adding main deck temperature control systems and installing a powered or manual cargo handling system fortress is a new york based private equity firm with 53 9 billion under management it s holdings include aircastle an aircraft leasing firm and the florida east coast railway in addition to being well financed mammoth which was founded by co ceos bill wagner and bill tarpley in december has assembled a team of more than 100 design engineering certification maintenance and other professionals with extensive experience converting boeing passenger aircraft to freighters tarpley is a former boeing program manager for dc 10 md 10 and boeing 767 conversion programs and then spent eight years as chief operating officer of aircraft leasing company cargo aircraft management nasdaq atsg where he bought and deployed 757 and 767 converted freighters wagner who began his career as a stress analyst at boeing and worked at major aerospace companies is president of wagner aeronautical he is considered a guru in the conversion industry having developed an approved design for the boeing 727 and fathering the 757 conversion from precision aircraft solutions in beaverton oregon which has sold about 158 units so far he has also worked on boeing 737 767 and 747 combi conversion programs as well as on the airbus a321 mammoth freighters said it has completed pre modification flight tests of the 777 200 the engineering house expects to obtain federal aviation administration approval in the second half of 2023 for its design to structurally modify the 777s with an amended supplemental type certificate stc submitted shortly thereafter for the 300 favorable market that same year israel aircraft industries and ge capital aviation services plan to deliver their first 777 300 converted freighter dubbed the big twin to a u s cargo airline the joint venture is also obtaining stcs for its design change average annual growth in air cargo volume is about 4 7 but that is up more than 50 since the pandemic because of unbalanced inventories and supply chain disruptions that are driving companies to expedite shipments and a surge in e commerce spending meanwhile airlines are reevaluating selling off 777 fleets with the shrinkage in long haul travel and the availability of more efficient aircraft like the 787 dreamliner air new zealand in august for example announced plans to scuttle its entire 777 fleet in the coming years after retiring its 777 200s last year many 777s are being retired earlier than planned and their relative low age makes them even more valuable assets for conversion mammoth said it is already fabricating tooling and parts for its production line and has a boeing data license that makes it easier to access maintenance and engineering information for any necessary updates it plans to induct the prototype 777 for initial production work during the second quarter of 2022 with metal cutting and testing taking place simultaneously while it awaits the faa certificate a typical passenger to freighter overhaul takes three to four months but experts say larger aircraft like the 777 take about five months there are far fewer used 777 200s than 300s available which makes it more difficult for competitors to offer since mammoth has already acquired a large chunk of the available pool development costs are in the tens of millions of dollars and difficult to justify if they can t be amortized over many units we are probably going to command a real market position in the aircraft because we re starting with it and being first to market with any fleet type is important especially if there is a limited quantity of them said mccarthy who joined mammoth from precision conversions last week eastern airlines a niche passenger carrier announced a quicker go to market strategy that only involves removing passenger seats and overhead bins instead of making costly structural changes the planes will be limited to carrying light boxes on the upper deck which fits with the e commerce shipments the company hopes to attract eastern officials said they have accumulated 35 aircraft and that the first modified freighter will start operating in the first quarter of 2022 by skipping a heavy conversion eastern says it can prepare planes for cargo mode in a couple of weeks but aviation industry experts are skeptical the concept will work a serious downside is that the freighters will require much more labor to load and unload the cabin by hand passenger freighters temporarily being operated by airlines while travel remains muted by the pandemic can take several hours of work compared to pure freighters with containerized shipments that can be moved with specialized handling equipment airport services companies are already overworked because of staffing shortages and are turning away so called ghost freighters in some cases and without the same carrying capacity many doubt the planes will be economical to operate once freight rates fall to normal levels and the price of jet fuel increases click

after two decades of conflict in afghanistan it s difficult to imagine western powers resorting to military intervention against the taliban even if the group lives up to the worst of everyone s fears that leaves economic and financial sanctions a favored policy option to impose costs and contain adversaries without using force as the primary tool with which to pressure the country s new rulers yet the multilateral sanctions regime freezing the group s assets has been largely dormant for fifteen years as the united states and its allies pushed for reconciliation in afghanistan meanwhile given the widespread reports of abuses and an interim government packed with hard liners few believe a friendlier regime will take shape this is why the united states and its allies will need to wield both existing and new sanctions as strategically as possible that means using the carrot of sanctions relief if the taliban governs responsibly and the stick of additional sanctions if it doesn t no matter which path it chooses washington must commit to meaningful humanitarian relief efforts a positive outcome may be unlikely but a good faith offering is worth the effort since the alternative scenario will result in increased suffering of afghans a solid foundation first the united states and its partners should target several individuals in the taliban leadership who are not yet subject to us or multilateral sanctions but allies will also need to quickly pivot to consider broad jurisdictional sanctions similar to those imposed on iran or syria to deny the taliban resources it could leverage to cause more harm this would amount to a quick escalation of sanctions pressure but would need to be on the table given the threats the repression of women human rights abuses drug trafficking support for terrorism the group poses while the taliban faced broad sanctions and political isolation in the 1990s during its previous stint in power today s measures are substantially more powerful targetable and flexible the increased centralization of global finance and the primacy of the us dollar in cross border transactions have made us sanctions a powerful tool in preventing access to international financial markets even those not involving the united states us and international sanctions against al qaeda following the 9 11 attacks were successful in cutting off the group s fundraising efforts and external financial links that effectiveness was due in large part to al qaeda s external financing model which left cross border payments vulnerable to us pressure by contrast sanctions against the islamic state of iraq and al sham isis were less impactful because the group relied more on internal sources of revenue such as extortion bank robbery and fuel smuggling on territory it controlled no silver bullet yet it is unclear to what degree the taliban will seek to conduct lawful international trade as well as how integral that trade would be to the group s ability to retain power in afghanistan where it enjoys a substantial military edge this calls into question the effectiveness of sanctions that restrict access to international markets and cross border transactions that does not mean they will be useless sanctions could deprive the taliban of the financial resources and access to arms markets that it could use to project power and export violence beyond its borders they could also make it harder for the group to control the entirety of afghanistan by reducing available financial and military resources leaving pockets of the country free from its repression whatever their impact sanctions will not be the proverbial silver bullet that solves all the problems presented by the taliban instead they must be only a part of a multilateral effort to reduce threats both inside and outside afghanistan sanctions are a poor tool for regime change as cia deputy director david cohen has argued and are instead best used to deny resources and build leverage for negotiations if the taliban is willing to rule afghanistan as something akin to an autarky however sanctions may not be effective at changing its behavior since the leverage they produce will be lessened even if they can accomplish lesser goals moreover because sanctions can have broad impact there are side effects that the united states and others need to manage to minimize those effects on the people of afghanistan while jurisdictional sanctions are not directly responsible for a people s suffering they undoubtedly have a chilling effect on all trade and economic activity even in areas such as food and medicine where there are exceptions to sanctions restrictions i have argued that sanctions implementation needs to be changed in order to ease humanitarian transactions afghanistan will be a key test for the treasury department the united states needs to lead a renewed effort to facilitate humanitarian relief in jurisdictions affected by sanctions the centrality of the us financial system in global trade and the fear of running afoul of us sanctions often causes private sector actors around the globe to shy away even from legal trade in afghanistan particularly the us military withdrawal is the clear reason the taliban regained power which is why the united states has a moral imperative to be as aggressive as possible in providing humanitarian support to afghans suffering under taliban rule regardless of sanctions tempering expectations this will take some hard thinking in washington since sanctions exceptions typically do not apply to designated terrorist groups such as the taliban so far the treasury department has ensured that those engaged in humanitarian work will not be penalized unduly which is encouraging for ongoing efforts sanctions are likely to be less effective against the taliban than they have been against iran which is heavily dependent on oil exports and yet remains defiantly in power the us government needs to be clear eyed about these shortcomings and the potential adverse consequences on ordinary people it must work with its partners in the international community and especially through the united nations where multilateral pressure on the taliban originated to devise an effective approach that should include diplomatic pressure on a leadership group that desires acceptance law enforcement and intelligence resources deployed against weapons and narcotics smuggling or support for terrorism and conditioning any aid to the taliban and potentially its external supporters on promoting positive change in afghanistan it is probably too much to hope that sanctions could be part of an approach that convinces the taliban to moderate its governing style instead the best the united states and its allies can hope is that sanctions will assist in containing the taliban s ability to export violence and perhaps create weaknesses that domestic opposition forces can exploit it is sobering to think in such terms after twenty years of western military intervention in afghanistan but if the mistakes of those two decades have taught us anything it is that we must be honest in assessing likely outcomes

by matt egan cnn business federal reserve chairman jerome powell has been criticized by progressives for going soft on big banks and not doing enough to address the climate crisis now a lifelong republican is joining that critique sheila bair one of the few american regulators who sounded the alarm prior to the subprime mortgage meltdown told cnn that powell has presided over a troubling rollback of the rules installed to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis his real weakness is on financial regulation said bair who led the federal deposit insurance corporation from 2006 to 2011 oversight is weaker since janet yellen left that s an easy one bair an appointee of president george w bush also said that the powell led fed hasn t done enough to address climate change she called for a more structured consideration of climate risk in bank supervising and stress testing there are very real financial risks the banking system is exposed to because of climate bair said biden s big decision the comments come as president joe biden weighs reappointing powell to another four year term leading the world s most powerful central bank progressives led by new york rep alexandria ocasio cortez have called on biden to replace powell as chairman when his term expires in february a white house official previously told cnn that biden will appoint candidates to the fed who he thinks will be the most effective in implementing monetary policy powell has been praised by some economists for his response to the biggest test of his tenure the global pandemic in march 2020 the fed moved swiftly to slash interest rates to zero and announced unprecedented programs aimed at unfreezing credit markets some economists argue those emergency actions prevented the covid recession from morphing into a full blown depression bair said powell deserves high marks for acting quickly and decisively to the pandemic that erupted in march 2020 and for publicly communicating the fed s mission it s all weakening however the former fdic chief argues the fed and other agencies should have been tightening financial regulations prior to the arrival of covid to snuff out asset bubbles and force banks to build capital buffers ahead of a potential storm they did the opposite they kept loosening and loosening even as the economy was growing well under trump said bair who has long been an outspoken proponent of tougher regulation it definitely disregards a key lesson of the financial crisis the financial crisis inquiry commission which spent more than a year examining the causes of the financial crisis found that regulatory lapses contributed to the 2008 meltdown widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision proved devastating to the stability of the nation s financial markets the commission concluded today bair serves on various boards including at fannie mae where she s the chair bair is also reviving her career as a children s book author by launching a series of books titled money tales that will focus on financial education the vast majority of the 2010 financial reform law known as dodd frank is still in effect today yet bair worries about a steady chipping away of those safeguards she pointed to a slew of changes made during the powell era including altering bank stress test assumptions reforming the controversial volcker rule and eliminating a margin requirement on derivatives transactions during each of those regulatory tweaks proponents have cited a desire to modernize the rules of the road bair rejects that sentiment i don t know how that s modernization directionally it s all weakening she said if they want to modernize it would be nice to see them kick into gear on cryptocurrency that s been a very slow train bair sits on the board of paxos a fintech company backed by paypal that describes itself as the first regulated blockchain infrastructure platform powell defends regulatory record anthony scaramucci founder and managing partner of investment firm skybridge capital defended powell s tenure running the fed and questioned who would be a better candidate jerome powell has by and large done a very good job scaramucci told cnn if you want to replace him for optics purposes go ahead but i think it would be a mistake the federal reserve declined to comment in response to bair s criticism despite bair s comments the powell led fed has taken steps to address the climate crisis late last year the central bank joined an international network of global financial regulators focused on climate change in june powell said the climate crisis poses profound challenges for the global economy and certainly the financial system during a july senate hearing powell defended his regulatory track record he argued the severity of stress tests has very much been maintained and effectively raised capital requirements for the biggest banks powell also pointed to how last year the fed suspended share buybacks for banks and capped dividends steps that drove their capital levels even higher by and large our financial institutions are well capitalized powell said they did manage to get through the recent pandemic and the acute phase of it and the recovery and did their jobs during it banks survived this time the fed announced last month that big banks will be required to hold approximately 1 trillion in high quality capital enough to survive a severe recession and still be able to lend to households and businesses bair agrees that banks are certainly better capitalized than during the last crisis when the implosion of lehman brothers threatened to tank the entire financial system however bair pointed out that big banks benefited massively from the fed s unprecedented intervention in march 2020 including its promise to buy junk bonds and other corporate debt i don t think they have a lot to brag about bair said of the major banks i m glad they didn t fail but i think a lot of them would have if the fed hadn t stepped in big time to rescue the whole economy the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

the asx200 down through that level under cover of each morning s ex dividends but only yesterday did they succeed this time the buyers clearly stood aside there was no specific trigger for the sell off other than pent up pressure if anything there was a slight defensive bias to the session with the outperforming sectors on the day being staples 0 7 property 1 1 healthcare 1 3 and utilities 1 8 every other sector fell 2 plus and technology lost over 3 after the nasdaq turned overnight there was no joy in the news sydney and still locked up areas of regional nsw will come out of lockdown when 70 are double dosed while a specific target is supposedly good news the assumption this won t happen for more than another month is not so thrilling it was clearly not good news that china s wholesale inflation ppi rose by a thirteen year high rate of 9 5 in august annual up from 9 0 in july such inflation will be passed on through goods exports across the globe but not domestically given china s cpi rose only 0 8 due to falling oil and pork prices there were also more signs in government interference in china s stock market with beijing moving to de emphasise profits why not just go the whole hog back to communism the hang seng fell 2 3 yesterday it was not good news locally that payroll numbers have continued to fall in august but then hardly a surprise amidst lockdowns and in the wake of wa smugly declaring a record budget surplus the crumbling iron ore price has everyone concerned it is not the case for other metals however see below interestingly one of the biggest elements of china s ppi surge were coal prices with beijing still refusing to buy australian that really hurts whitehaven coal whc was one of the handful of index stocks closing in the green yesterday either way it was clear the day s agenda was pre set at the open no news good or bad was going to make any difference as an indication fifth place on the top five index leaders board yesterday required a gain of 0 3 but as i suggested above in these situations buyers typically just stand out of the way and let it happen providing for opportunities the next day the s p500 fell 0 5 last night and our futures are up 25 points this morning more of the same the ecb declared last night it would now purchase bonds qe at a moderately lower pace but would not taper no no one else understands either apparently slowing bond purchase is not in this instance tapering because purchases had been pumped up to emergency levels recently and now they re dropping back to earlier levels all semantics but a funny thing happened in us bond yields overnight we recall the us ten year yield opened the week with a 5 basis point jump attributed to the fact the treasury would be issuing an awful lot of debt this week with supply assumed to overwhelm demand turns out the opposite was true last night s 30 year treasury auction was swamped and the ten year fell 4 basis points to 1 30 lower long end yields typically imply fears of a slowing economy which may well be the case but the theory is clouded by sovereign bond buying form regions with much lower or even negative rates wall street is nonetheless concerned about a slowing us economy as delta runs unabated in the south having mandated that all federal workers must be vaccinated biden last night moved to mandate vaccinations for all private contractors to the government this is seen as good news in fighting delta but not good enough at this point the major indices continue to slip away at this stage the de rating is fairly incremental as was the run up to the august new highs so the question now is whether or not incremental will give way to something more fundamental such as a 5 pullback that has not been seen all year there is much agreement that something of this nature is quite possible and overdue but no real confidence it will actually happen commodities spot metals minerals energy futures gold oz 1794 20 5 60 0 31 silver oz 24 01 0 10 0

demand despite beijing s efforts china continues to pump out for example stainless steel lower us yields help gold recover somewhat but were also seen as a bad sign for oil on the assumption of slowing economy fears and beijing plans to release oil from its strategic reserve the us dollar index fell back a tad last night but did not spur on the aussie which is steady at us 0 7368 bit of

a couple of weeks ago i predicted that the stock market could stop being supersonically positive with rising cases of the delta variant worldwide especially in america now it looks like that overdue negativity has hit wall street and in a world much more attune to infections since february 2020 introduced us to the unforgettable coronavirus let me remind you of that old market rule of thumb when wall street sneezes the world catches a cold yesterday in australia our stock market s monitoring measurer i e the s p asx 200 which checks out the stock prices of our top 200 companies fell 142 points or 1 9 this is a big one day fall and the world s most reported market measurer i e the dow jones industrial average which has 30 of america s biggest companies in it has been negative for four days this is saying that the number of sellers relative to buyers is on the increase but there s no panic yet could there be yep a little but let me assure you that if it happens i ll be buying stocks that in 12 months time will be a lot higher than they are today so why is the stock market vulnerable now try these excuses september and october have been bad months for stocks and some of the biggest crashes have happened around these times the delta strain cases are growing especially among the unvaccinated those who were expecting fast growth rates for economies and businesses will now be peeling back their forecasts this means their expected share price guesses will be lower so they could sell some or all of their affected or infected stocks future economic growth rates are being reduced and even the latest chinese growth rates are down as they play hardball to keep the virus under control china does control very well that s its specialty last friday the us got a jobs number that was either an aberration or it was telling us that the yanks are losing economic steam in august employment rose by 235 000 but this was about half a million short of economists expectations the figure was well down on the 1 05 million jobs created in july but the unemployment rate fell to 5 2 in august from 5 4 in july which contained the negativity many economists think the number will rebound in september but then there s the virus impact which is hard to measure until you see it in some statistics in contrast some investors are worried about us wage rises and inflation that could force interest rates up especially in the bond market which then would put pressure on the fed to act in 2022 other investors are worried the us central bank will start reducing stimulus this year by buying less bonds off the public which puts money into the economy overnight the european central bank said it was slowing down its bond purchasing some commentary says the us is only weeks away from a debt problem because of its huge spending program under president joe biden on top of the blowout under president trump who cut taxes and then had to deal with the coronavirus shutdowns when he gained office and the republicans control of congress the debt was just under us20 billion wrote the smh s steve bartholomeusz by the time he left in january this year it was more than us27 trillion with his tax cuts and pandemic related spending the main factors in the increase if congress goes into argument mode over raising the debt limit the stock market could get spooked like it did in 2011 when standard poor s downgraded us debt from aaa to aa but here s the big reason for a sell off and it s in this chart below s p 500 the us stock market has been surging this year and is up about 34 since its peak before the coronavirus crash our market is up only 5 so the us market is overdue for a pullback when it comes to the congress debt debate the yanks will do what winston churchill once said of them you can always count on americans to do the right thing after they ve tried everything else if you believe that vaccinations will eventually sort out the health and then economic challenges out there then any stocks sell off will be a buying opportunity after a period of fear and loathing that s the stock market and its legendary climbing the wall of worry preoccupation but it does provide some wonderful buying opportunities my podcast this week with morgan s chief economist michael knox confirms my positive view on the 2022 economy and even 2023 both here and overseas that s why i will be a buyer if this stock market sell off gets scary i m taking the view of alfred e neuman of mad comic fame when i say what me worried and i m feeling quite sensible about it

takeaways the m a market is at a record pace in 2021 with a variety of factors a thriving stock market available debt vaccines fueling a pandemic recovery low interest rates etc driving this growth representations and warranties insurance is increasingly important and allows buyers and sellers to focus on bigger picture m a issues the renewed federal push on antitrust compliance and a tight talent market are potential challenges but the m a market looks to remain hot going into 2022 no doubt about it mergers and acquisitions are taking place at a feverish pace going back to the second half of 2020 a recent refinitiv report found that the u s has reported 2 14 trillion in m a activity already in 2021 and the year is on pace to be the biggest in history according to a s p global market s intelligence report q2 2021 was the third straight quarter where total global m a value surpassed 1 trillion the first time this has ever happened in three consecutive quarters womble bond dickinson polled its linkedin contacts and asked what in their opinion is driving this boom with the choices being 1 tax changes 2 increased economic activity 3 regulatory structure changes or 4 other factors the second choice increased overall activity was the overwhelming winner over the course of my 35 years i ve never seen anything like this rutley said i personally thought covid in march and april of 2020 would be a huge dampener on m a activity but unlike previous events like the economic crisis in 2008 2009 the hit to m a by covid proved to be temporary instead of seeing a decline in my m a practice i ve had my largest year of m a deal volume and deal value in my entire 35 year career it s not unusual for my teams to currently have 9 12 deals going at once and while he agrees that increased economic activity is the primary reason he said that category is broad drilling down a bit deeper rutley points to a healthy stock market the availability of cheap debt low interest rates and upbeat forecasts in such sectors as technology healthcare and financial services the covid 19 pandemic absolutely slowed down initially what had been a robust corporate transactions market in early 2020 but rutley and anderson both said the pandemic forced buyers and sellers to adapt and they learned that some of these changes actually were for the better rapid digitalization is underpinning the m a recovery and enabling the white hot market we re seeing today rutley said stakeholders are adapting to virtual due diligence and deal closing the pandemic forced this but we found we could do deals faster and more easily activity has been super heavy i was expecting a more prolonged slowdown but i would characterize it more as a hiccup once people got comfortable with virtual connections the volume picked right back up anderson said representations and warranties insurance and other m a trends representations and warranties insurance has become an increasingly important aspect of m a deals in the past 10 years anderson said in a deal parties give reps and warranties about the company statements of fact that are supposed to be true and accurate anderson explained that reps and warranties insurance is an underwriting process in which the insurer takes the risks that the seller is being accurate on the reps and warranties chances are there might be something inaccurate instead of having the buyer and seller fight over those terms one side or the other will buy a policy that underwrites the whole thing he said most deals of 20 million or more now are covered under such policies because reps and warranties insurance has become so important it too has become a hot commodity in the booming m a market reps and warranties insurance changes the disclosure burden sellers now have to meet the insurer s standards rather than the buyer s it often accelerates the deal because you take a contentious piece between the buyer and seller and makes it a little smoother anderson said you can focus on the deal side the bigger points and take this equally critical piece and let someone else moderate it but because reps and warranties insurance has become so important it too has become a hot commodity in the booming m a market we ve found the costs are increasing it s definitely a sellers market for companies selling reps and warranties insurance products rutley said adding that insurers are quicker to decline offering policies if the transaction doesn t meet their terms the insurance companies say they have a line outside their door he said the hot market has caused insurance companies to have the upper hand in what they are offering rutley also cautioned that reps and warranties insurance only covers the unknown insurance companies won t insure known deal risks so rutley said an in depth due diligence process is just as important as ever even if the deal is covered by reps and warranties insurance it has benefit but only for the things nobody thought of on either side he said preparation meeting opportunity how to give your m a deal the best chance to succeed so what are the biggest stumbling blocks to closing m a transactions anderson said employee classification issues are at the top of the list of headaches for buyers and sellers alike the areas we see coming up time and time again are employee classification exempt or non exempt and contractor classification whether individuals are properly classified as employees or independent contractors he said other potential issues of concern include disputes or confusion about the ownership of intellectual property data security concerns the use of offshore contractors creating regulatory compliance problems and state and local tax compliance anderson and rutley agree that advance preparation and due diligence are the best defenses against a deal falling apart this advice holds true for both buyers and sellers my father always said success is when preparation meets opportunity and that s true in m a that means being willing to move fast and efficiently but being prepared beforehand rutley said advance preparation and due diligence are the best defenses against a deal falling apart this advice holds true for both buyers and sellers doing internal homework is essential to the process for the seller s in house counsel you don t want the buyer to come in and find something you weren t aware of anderson said when the seller has the luxury of time if they can start 12 18 months to get things in order that is best it s like selling your house you don t wait until the house is on the market to start cleaning out the garage on the buy side rutley said company leaders should know what you what to buy why you want to buy it and how integration will be done and don t cheat due diligence it may be the most mundane part of m a but the battle is won or lost on due diligence you want to know as much about the target as you can thankfully early pandemic fears that travel restrictions could hinder integration plans proved not to be a problem companies found they still could integrate new acquisitions even in a virtual environment so what do corporate leaders need to be aware of in the last quarter of 2021 and the first half of 2022 will the white hot m a market continue to burn anderson said the biden administration s strong antitrust push could be the biggest factor shaping the market in the next few quarters we re already seeing scrutiny not just of the biggest deals but also the middle market run of the mill deals he said it s not that the department of justice is saying these deals couldn t close but it s just the specter of additional regulation and the time it requires to meet those requirements rutley however noted that deals in the 10 50 million range may fall below the radar of federal antitrust scrutiny while antitrust may be an area of increasing concern anderson believes the prospects of a massive tax law overhaul are probably more remote by the day and such discussions are unlikely to happen in the near future the tight talent market also remains an issue both for in house counsel and outside corporate attorneys some firms are aggressively hiring talent just to keep up with the deluge of current work an issue american lawyer examined in a recent article the war for talent is definitely there and the grass is not always greener on the other side of the hill but it s a perfect storm for professional talent anderson said money is certainly important you have to be able to pay the mortgage and the bills but it becomes more important to listen to people about what they want from their career covid has exposed the flexibility in the market and if we as employers are willing to provide that in the form of flex time off hours working from home etc i think that s what the up and coming generation of leaders is looking for we re not in a one size fits

real estate news boston gets a second and third chance to build affordable neighborhoods will it part of the seaport district skyline framed by the institute of contemporary art in south boston jonathan wiggs globe staff it s rare in a city as old as boston to find large tracts of land available for development and the city suddenly has two stakeholders in boston s real estate orbit recognize that the city must avoid development insanity doing the same thing repeatedly expecting different results when it comes to housing in both when it comes to the seaport so many things went wrong more than 20 billion in public spending created the seaport and yet we have a neighborhood that does not have equity or inclusion in its foundation in terms of who built it who lives there now and the businesses that exist there acting mayor kim janey said via e mail with suffolk downs and allston we must include our workers in this prosperity and help families build generational wealth advertisement but recognition and action are two very different things while the seaport remains one of the city s hottest construction zones developers are looking beyond to new blank canvases like suffolk downs in east boston and the stretch of allston where the mass pike is expected to get a billion dollar plus overhaul there are already signs that housing isn t as immediate a priority as lucrative life science projects and that the city is setting itself up for a repeat of some of its seaport stumbles people in a poll we did a few years ago were saying there s nothing for me to do on the waterfront i can t afford to eat at the restaurants i can t afford to shop at the retail locations there just isn t enough diversity cost wise of things for me to do and places for me to go that i would actually want to be there deanna moran director of environmental planning at the conservation law foundation said of the seaport if we re not careful i could see that playing out in east boston as well that is the demographic that a lot of developers in the development boom are catering to and producing these high end luxury condos and the high end restaurants that go along with that advertisement boston real estate circles see the allston development as one with the potential to become kendall square 2 0 due to its ability to appeal to the region s booming life science sector the master plan for the hym investment group s 161 acre suffolk downs redevelopment which straddles boston and revere calls for 10 000 units of housing upon completion but the development team earlier this summer swapped plans from housing in the first phase to labs to capitalize on the life science surge despite the firm s emphasis that the project would have a significant residential component right out of the gate tom o brien hym s founding partner and managing director maintains that the firm is devoted to seeing its housing target to fruition there will still be housing built in another portion of the site so we ll still do the same amount of housing o brien said but it gives us a chance to set the table for commercial and lab success right out of the gate as well if we re not careful i could see that playing out in east boston as well that is the demographic that a lot of developers in the development boom are catering to and producing these high end luxury condos and the high end restaurants that go along with that deanna moran conservation law foundation advertisement the roughly 1 billion first phase of suffolk downs is slated to have 500 000 square feet of lab space roughly 85 000 square feet of retail a hotel and 1 400 housing units this initial residential turned lab building swap stems from that parcel being in revere where o brien said there was more of a need for commercial uses than residential but keep in mind boston leaders like former mayor marty walsh and think tanks like the brookings institution all have rallied in recent years around the argument that the communities surrounding the city simply aren t developing enough housing stock to make a dent in a supply shortage that continues to send prices skyward this may sound familiar to seaport critics who argued that the neighborhood leaned far more in the direction of commercial lab and office development than aspects highlighted in earlier master plans such as housing cultural features like a performance hall and even basic services like a school or full service grocery store boston global investors boasts of 160 plus affordable units of housing created from the seaport square master plan a number that seems low in relation to the more than 3 billion in construction mentioned in the same sentence on the firm s website roughly 450 income restricted units of housing have been created from development across the entire seaport neighborhood according to the boston planning development agency four hundred and fifty units is a lot of units in a neighborhood that s now got a few thousand units said brian golden director of the bpda that s 14 percent of all the idp units generated in the city of boston so that s not nothing it is significant advertisement walsh s housing a changing city boston 2030 plan called for the creation of 69 000 units of housing nearly 16 000 of which would be designated as income restricted according to the city s website but the housing developments that have been built across the seaport are largely luxury apartments typically starting at 2 400 per month for a studio according to apartments com listings a bulk of the units at the neighborhood s luxury condo buildings like 22 and 50 liberty as well as echelonseaport list for well over 1 million according to marketing and brokerage materials for each development four hundred and fifty units is a lot of units in a neighborhood that s now got a few thousand units so that s not nothing it is significant brian golden boston planning development agency developers of each new residential project with more than 10 units in boston are required to set aside at least 13 percent as income restricted under the city s inclusionary policy they can sidestep this by developing 15 percent to 18 percent of the unit percentage off site or by paying into the inclusionary development policy fund o brien sees the off site option as a key factor considering that the seaport has tilted so much in the direction of high end housing rather than becoming a neighborhood for all there s affordable units that came out of it but they just didn t get built in the seaport o brien said for us from the beginning one of our primary tenets has been we want the affordable housing to be built in suffolk downs advertisement along with promising to deliver on site the 13 percent affordability requirement o brien said 20 percent of the units across the entire development would be affordable an entirely different setup from the seaport some organizations are already writing off the idea of widespread affordability in allston and the neighboring harvard enterprise research campus instead they want better transit connectivity between suburban markets and the urban center if we did improve connectivity and we made the travel time between gateway cities and boston better more efficient and also reliable then all of a sudden we re opening up affordable housing markets relative to job centers said richard dimino president and ceo of a better city a nonprofit focused on growth under the lens of equity sustainability and improved transit it s interesting to think about transportation as being an affordable housing solution but don t discount affordable housing in boston s urban core quite yet almost everyone in the city s development and political communities has an opinion of what can be learned from the seaport before a major era of groundbreakings and construction takes place in allston and at suffolk downs the zoning code is so outdated that it is effectively obsolete and each individual particle becomes a one off negotiation for special approval said michelle wu a boston city councilor at large a candidate in the mayoral election and a proponent of abolishing the boston planning development agency we need to move to a system where there is a planning department that is accountable separate from our development agency to ensure that the rules that govern our growth and the development approval process truly reflects the urgency of needs that we re seeing in our community advertisement not every developer in boston is swapping out housing for lab use berkeley investments redevelopment of boston tech center along the mass pike in allston calls for more than 300 units of housing and the developer is unlikely to change the build out even amid a life science surge in the area in our approach it wasn t let s maximize the amount of lab that we can do but let s make sure that it is really fully integrated within the neighborhood said young park president of berkeley investments to do that we needed both the office component obviously you have to pay the rent and make sure that you get a return on your investment but also housing of all types there are very early signs that several mayoral candidates including the acting mayor appear to be hearing what critics have been saying about the development paths of the waterfront and seaport that could put boston s next crop of hot spots on a different construction trajectory janey pulled a waterfront zoning plan last month on the grounds it didn t do enough about climate change and making the waterfront accessible to all residents when it comes to development in any neighborhood in boston i have a simple rule planning has to drive development not the other way around janey said we need to ensure that our planning processes are equitable and set goals based on a clear set of city wide and neighborhood land use policies that strengthen the fabric of our neighborhoods and propose a modernized community value based zoning code advertisement a similar development focus on equity and the environment is expected on megaprojects elsewhere in the city no matter who wins the boston mayoral race later this year all of these areas that we ve been discussing there s an opportunity for boston to become more affordable more sustainable more equitable but that really means that we need to lean in hard and disrupt what has been become the norm in the current broken process wu said send comments to subscribe to the globe s free real estate newsletter our weekly digest on

holland landing ontario sept 09 2021 globe newswire inscape tsx inq a leading designer and manufacturer of furnishings and movable wall systems for the workplace today announced its results of operations for the first quarter ended july 31 2021 the results we are reporting for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 do not yet capture the impact of previous and ongoing actions taken by management to better position the business going forward controllable events such as securing a new five year labour agreement for our jamestown new york walls plant will immediately lower our hourly labor costs and are not yet reflected furthermore benefits related to the full integration of the dual automation tower which arrived in may with the the new laser turret press which arrived last february in our holland landing ontario furniture plant have not been recognized during this quarter both of these initiatives will enhance margins of our existing products said eric ehgoetz ceo similarly new products to be introduced and manufactured later this fiscal are expected to improve our sales but won t impact our results until subsequent quarters additionally key sales and marketing talent and new distribution channels which were also secured during the quarter are expected to improve our sales pipeline in future periods total sales revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 7 9 million compared to 11 4 million for the same period of fiscal 2021 the decline in the quarter related to some customer sales pushouts from the first quarter to future quarters which largely related to the availability of material supply and timing of certain projects net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 3 4 million or negative 0 24 per diluted share compared to net income of 3 4 million or positive 0 24 per diluted share for fiscal 2021 the decline was largely due to lower sales of 3 5 million a decrease in net non operating income by 3 9 million due to the adverse movement in market to market valuation on derivative instruments and a lower level of government grant and subsidies non gaap ebitda for the first quarter was negative 2 3 million compared to positive 4 4 million for fiscal 2021 non controllable events such as significant customer orders moving out to the second quarter and unanticipated supply chain disruptions also impacted our sales performance in the first quarter these events continue to be driven by the pandemic and its effect on customer preferences and supply lines we have initiated new procedures to help mitigate the ongoing supply chain disruptions being experienced globally in order to better deliver for our customers current visibility suggests the second quarter will begin to reflect an improved financial profile but exact timing to achieve normalized profitability levels remains dependent on a more fulsome economic recovery and management s continued efforts to streamline operations and costs said eric ehgoetz ceo first

with deadlines looming this month on key items in the biden administration s domestic agenda the 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and the 3 5 trillion human infrastructure package the process of corporate manipulation and watering down of the already inadequate social welfare measure is moving into high gear speaker of the house nancy pelosi d calif meets with reporters to discuss president joe biden s domestic agenda including passing a bipartisan infrastructure bill at the capitol in washington wednesday sept 8 2021 ap photo j scott applewhite last month house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader charles schumer set a september 15 deadline for the various committees in each chamber to draft their pieces of the budget bill which in its present outline form modestly expands benefits for working people and increases taxes on corporations and the rich to partially offset the cost unlike the physical infrastructure bill which is broadly backed by big business and passed the senate with 19 republican votes there is no republican support for the budget proposal and corporate america is for the most part lined up against it the democrats are seeking to bypass a filibuster in the senate which could be overcome only by obtaining the votes of 10 republicans in the evenly divided chamber by moving the bill under the budget reconciliation process whereby the legislation can be passed by a simple majority that means however the democratic leadership has to secure the votes of all 50 democratic senators vice president kamala harris would then cast the tie breaking vote last month pelosi agreed to bring the infrastructure bill up for a vote in the house by september 27 that was a concession to a group of right wing democrats who said they would not vote to move forward on the budget reconciliation bill if pelosi continued to insist that the house not act on the infrastructure bill until after the senate had passed the broader measure as a result schumer has been compelled to set a september 27 deadline for the senate passage of the social spending bill the process of drastically shrinking the social improvements contained in the human infrastructure bill slashing its cost and blocking any significant increase in corporate taxes began in earnest last week when democratic senator joe manchin of west virginia published a column in the wall street journal headlined why i won t support spending another 3 5 trillion manchin a multimillionaire owner of coal companies in west virginia cited the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff retired admiral mike mullen as his authority on the danger to national security from too much debt the senator called for a strategic pause in consideration of the budget bill in effect delinking passage of the corporate backed infrastructure bill from passage of the broader social legislation an unabashed flack for the fossil fuel industry manchin has repeatedly opposed environmental regulations on mining and energy in general he previously called certain provisions in the budget bill aimed at modestly restraining carbon emissions such as repealing tax subsidies to the fossil fuel industry very disturbing he has also made it clear he is opposed to raising corporate taxes and would like to means test measures such as tuition free community college universal preschool child care tax credits and an extension of the enhanced child tax credit other democratic senators who have publicly opposed the budget bill s 3 5 trillion price tag spread out over 10 years include kyrsten sinema of arizona jon tester of montana and mark warner of virginia a former tech entrepreneur worth 200 million and now chairman of the intelligence committee on tuesday press reports emerged that manchin had let it be known he was prepared to support a bill costing from 1 billion to 1 5 billion back in june bernie sanders chairman of the senate budget committee was claiming he would oversee passage of 6 trillion in social welfare measures calling it the most far reaching reform since the new deal sanders was chosen by biden to lead the effort to pass his budget in order to give his conservative domestic economic agenda a progressive gloss the vermont senator who at times calls himself a socialist and is relentlessly promoted by the pseudo left as proof that the democratic party can be pressured to carry out progressive and even socialist policies has said nothing about biden s termination of federal jobless benefits in the midst of the widening covid 19 pandemic or the drive to reopen the schools amidst soaring infections hospitalizations and deaths of children teachers and school staff the response by the white house and the democratic congressional leadership has made clear that the 3 5 trillion package of social measures will be drastically cut back before any bill is brought up for a vote the same applies to biden s promise to increase taxes on corporations and the wealthy on tuesday biden told the press referring to manchin joe at the end has always been there he s always been with me i think we can work something out and i look forward to speaking with him pelosi has said she will only bring before the house a budget measure that can be passed in the senate i e one that accommodates the most right wing factions in the democratic party yahoo news cited a lobbyist familiar with internal deliberations on capitol hill as saying there was optimism among congressional democrats that a bill would get passed and sent to biden for signing into law but such a bill is likely to be in the range of about 2 trillion the article continues while the various house committees are likely to approve bills that would total 3 5 trillion that number would get whittled down before the legislation is sent to the full house for debate and passage the source said that could mean that any proposed tax increases on the wealthy and corporations would not have to be as steep as initially envisioned even were the infrastructure and budget bills passed with the current proposed spending levels they would be hopelessly inadequate to address the catastrophic levels of poverty and social crisis and decades long degradation of social infrastructure this was revealed in the response of the ruling class to the pandemic and the social disaster unfolding in the gulf coast and new york city as a result of hurricane ida capitalism is incapable of addressing these existential public health and environmental issues both because of the total subordination of all questions to corporate profit and the accumulation of private wealth by the ruling elite and the division of the world economy into rival nation states the measures dictated by science and made possible by the development of technology to eradicate the coronavirus and resolve the climate change crisis are blocked by the economic and geo political interests of a corporate financial oligarchy that accounts for a miniscule portion of the world population the infrastructure bill includes only 550 billion in new money spread out over eight years the current funding figure in the budget bill 350 billion per year pales in comparison to the vast increase in wealth of the us financial elite just in the course of the pandemic according to a recent report from americans for tax fairness and the institute for policy studies program on inequality us billionaires have seen their wealth surge 1 8 trillion in just the first 18 months of the pandemic their collective fortune has skyrocketed by nearly two thirds 62 percent from just short of 3 trillion at the start of the covid crisis on march 18 2020 to 4 8 trillion on august 17 2021 elon musk has seen his wealth increase by 150 billion during the pandemic a gain of over 600 percent meanwhile the federal reserve continues to pump 120 billion every month into the financial markets and maintain near zero interest rates to fuel the stock market frenzy the minor tax increases on corporations and the rich proposed by biden and the democrats should they see the light of day would do little to reverse the ongoing plundering of society by the oligarchy government tax revenues from us corporations have declined by 40 percent just since the enactment of the republican tax bill in december of 2017 and biden is only proposing to restore half the 14 percent cut in the 35 percent corporate tax rate that prevailed prior to donald trump s reform in any event corporate america will not tolerate any significant increase in its taxes or reduction in its profits and these are the class interests that control both parties the pharmaceutical giants pfizer abbvie astrazeneca energy monopolies exxonmobil entertainment monoliths walt disney company tech titans major retailers manufacturers and banks are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to bribe lawmakers target them with negative ads and mobilize right wing organizations they have funded to determine the final shape of any spending bills that might emerge from this sordid process which is carried out largely behind the backs of the american people the washington post reported last month that the pharmaceutical industry has embarked on its own wide ranging campaign to combat democrats drug pricing proposals another potential revenue source in the bill conservative outfits previously backed by the sector s top trade group known as phrma have run recent ads claiming lawmakers plans would have worsened the coronavirus pandemic the post noted that the rate coalition reforming america s taxes equitably which counts support from capital one disney fedex lowe s and lockheed martin is preparing a seven figure digital ad campaign to oppose any increase in the corporate tax rate one of its top spokesmen is blanche lincoln a former democratic senator from arkansas who served with biden in the senate
penny hughes has been a trailblazer for women in business throughout her career in 1992 aged only 32 she was appointed president of coca cola s operations in great britain and ireland three years later she quit to have the first of her two sons making headlines in the process rather than sacrificing her career on the altar of motherhood however she accumulated an impressive portfolio of directorships trailblazer penny hughes has made her name as a high profile board director and her latest role is chairman of riverstone a posh retirement property developer over the ensuing years she graced the boardrooms of morrisons next vodafone reuters and body shop along with a couple of much more trickier propositions three decades on she has matured from a female prodigy into an elder stateswoman her latest role is chairman of riverstone a posh retirement property developer selling multi million pound flats to well heeled over 65s in swish areas of london the venture is backed by goldman sachs undoubtedly there is a gap in the market for retirement accommodation for older people who find a large family property hard to manage but are not yet ready for a care home riverstone is unapologetically at the top end with two sites in london one in kensington and one in fulham where apartments cost between 900 000 and 6m eventually the plan is for ten sites in the capital we think the majority of our residents will come from a five mile radius of the two residences says hughes they know the local area already they enjoy it they ve got places they want to keep on visiting whether it be the royal albert hall or the chelsea flower show does she have any thoughts on how the remaining 99 per cent of over 65s might solve their housing needs so of course we re at the higher end but we do expect a sort of trickle down and there are other operators which provide retirement living to a different sort of audience we re providing a choice that isn t available today retiring in style with a hefty price tag it is certainly not your typical granny flat let s just say riverstone is in the plutocrat pensioner zone this is no place for anyone who wants to grow old in comfy carpet slippers and give their grandkids fondant fancies for tea no it s pitched at the kind of couple who have aged with a silver sheen of wealth and who you can imagine tripping along the beach in those pensions ads on an expensive holiday entering the show apartment in kensington through a huge solid door which incidentally allows easy passage for a wheelchair and black pomegranate fragrance wafts out the adaptations for a mature resident no trip hazards easy opening kitchen cupboards accessible bathroom and the like are ultra discreet surfaces gleam carpets are deep the decor is cool of course retiring in this sort of style comes at a cost on top of the purchase price there will be a service charge currently set at around 16 000 to 17 000 a year fixed for the duration of ownership drinking to success penny hughes was president of coca cola in gb and ireland then there is the exit fee riverstone prefers the term deferred management charge which is 4 per cent per year of ownership capped at seven years or 28 per cent the idea is that the developments will feel like an exclusive members club with amenities such as a spa swimming pool herb beds designed by garden guru jekka mcvicar a restaurant and cinema hughes 62 is a bit too young to move in herself though she says she would love it she is married to david who she met at university in sheffield where she gained a first in chemistry he gave up work when she was pregnant an unusual arrangement then and now their two sons alex and robbie are in their twenties does she think things have improved for women in business since the early 1990s undoubtedly i used to often be the only woman in the room and now that happens only rarely has it gone far enough of course not but i m an optimist i think we ve now got enough momentum going why did she feel she wouldn t have been able to combine her career at coca cola with motherhood well it was for multiple reasons yes i was pregnant and we wanted a family but if i had taken on the next role i would have been corporate property she says she would have been expected to go to the us in order to climb the ladder adding i didn t feel able to sign up for that sort of corporate journey it was a combination of both career and family reasons in the past hughes has revealed margaret thatcher was the woman who most inspired her now however she says she learned about profit with principles from the late anita roddick at the body shop where she became an independent director after leaving coca cola anita s outlook was that we need to make a profit in order to stay in business but that looking after the communities in which we trade with is the right thing to do i remember going to kathmandu with her and she had that sparkle and could communicate with anyone among the tougher directorships hughes took on was royal bank of scotland where she was in the thick of a long running row over the pay of then boss stephen hester doing the right thing penny hughes says she learned about profit with principles from the late anita roddick pictured he was heavily criticised for his rewards as boss of a bank that was bailed out at taxpayer expense many felt he should have approached the role as a public service not a money making opportunity as chair of the pay committee she was slammed for failing to keep his pay in check we took the balance sheet down from 2trillion to 500billion that s not public service work she replies crisply more recently hughes was the chairman of aston martin for its stock market float which turned out to be one of the worst performing on the london market in decades shares in the luxury car maker fell by 75 per cent after the listing and remained in the doldrums unsurprisingly it is a job she says she would never have taken in hindsight she segued into the role at riverstone after chairing iqsa one of the uk s largest providers of student accommodation which was also backed by goldman sachs the business was bought last year for 4 7billion by us private equity group blackstone hughes believes the broader picture behind the riverstone developments is that in the uk there is inadequate housing for later living this model is well developed in new zealand australia and the usa where there is now legislation to protect both the resident and the developer that s not yet in place in the uk but it s something that we would welcome leaseholders will be protected hughes insists what about the risks in this kind of housing though the apartments are on 150 year leaseholds but what if riverstone at some future point sells the freehold this has caused significant problems in the past when leaseholders have been hit with high and rising charges it doesn t make sense for us to do that but they would have protection under their lease she says and what if people become medically unable to cope or fall into financial hardship won t it be terribly difficult to have to ask elderly residents to move out potential buyers have a compulsory medical before they purchase and can pay for care we are not trying to screen people out it is to help us understand their needs she says as for money worries hughes says obviously we are dealing with high net worth people i m sure that we ll be able to manage hardship cases but we re not anticipating that that will be a frequent occurrence she points out that fewer than 1 per cent of homes being built nationwide are for retirement living that is not enough we want government to adopt a policy which would include an allocation of new houses built for later living maybe five to ten per cent within 20 years one in four of us is going to be over 65 so i could argue for a much higher number but we have to start somewhere

by kanishka singh reuters food delivery companies doordash inc grubhub inc and uber eats n have sued new york city over a legislation to license food delivery apps and to permanently cap commissions they can charge restaurants the three food delivery companies filed a lawsuit in federal court in new york late on thursday the companies are seeking an injunction that would prevent new york from enforcing the fee cap ordinance adopted last month as well as unspecified monetary damages and a jury trial the new york city council approved in august a legislation which limits the amount that food delivery companies can charge restaurants to use their platforms and requires them to obtain operating licenses that are valid for two years those permanent price controls will harm not only plaintiffs but also the revitalization of the very local restaurants that the city claims to serve the companies said in the lawsuit filed on thursday the suit argues that the legislation is unconstitutional because it interferes with freely negotiated contracts between platforms and restaurants by changing and dictating the economic terms on which a dynamic industry operates the legislation comes after the city enacted temporary caps on the commissions food delivery companies charged restaurants during the pandemic when so many of them were forced to close or rely on delivery and carry out alone it seeks to limit the amount those companies can charge restaurants to 15 of food orders for delivery services and 5 for advertising and other non delivery services the new york city restaurant delivery market is split almost evenly among the major platforms according to bloomberg second measure which collects payment data from customers doordash commanded 36 of july sales in the city grubhub 34 and uber eats and postmates a joint 30 san francisco has also enacted permanent commission caps on the services

by john w whitehead nisha whitehead i tell you freedom and human rights in america are doomed the u s government will lead the american people in and the west in general into an unbearable hell and a choking life osama bin laden october 2001 as reported by cnn what a strange and harrowing road we ve walked since september 11 2001 littered with the debris of our once vaunted liberties we have gone from a nation that took great pride in being a model of a representative democracy to being a model of how to persuade a freedom loving people to march in lockstep with a police state our losses are mounting with every passing day what began with the post 9 11 passage of the usa patriot act has snowballed into the eradication of every vital safeguard against government overreach corruption and abuse the citizenry s unquestioning acquiescence to anything the government wants to do in exchange for the phantom promise of safety and security has resulted in a society where the nation has been locked down into a militarized mechanized hypersensitive legalistic self righteous goose stepping antithesis of every principle upon which this nation was founded set against a backdrop of government surveillance militarized police swat team raids asset forfeiture eminent domain overcriminalization armed surveillance drones whole body scanners stop and frisk searches police violence and the like all of which have been sanctioned by congress the white house and the courts our constitutional freedoms have been steadily chipped away at undermined eroded whittled down and generally discarded the rights embodied in the constitution if not already eviscerated are on life support free speech the right to protest the right to challenge government wrongdoing due process a presumption of innocence the right to self defense accountability and transparency in government privacy press sovereignty assembly bodily integrity representative government all of these and more have become casualties in the government s war on the american people a war that has grown more pronounced since 9 11 indeed since the towers fell on 9 11 the u s government has posed a greater threat to our freedoms than any terrorist extremist or foreign entity ever could while nearly 3 000 people died in the 9 11 attacks the u s government and its agents have easily killed at least ten times that number of civilians in the u s and abroad since 9 11 through its police shootings swat team raids drone strikes and profit driven efforts to police the globe sell weapons to foreign nations which too often fall into the hands of terrorists and foment civil unrest in order to keep the security industrial complex gainfully employed the american people have been treated like enemy combatants to be spied on tracked scanned frisked searched subjected to all manner of intrusions intimidated invaded raided manhandled censored silenced shot at locked up denied due process and killed in allowing ourselves to be distracted by terror drills foreign wars color coded warnings pandemic lockdowns and other carefully constructed exercises in propaganda sleight of hand and obfuscation we failed to recognize that the u s government the government that was supposed to be a government of the people by the people for the people has become the enemy of the people consider that the government s answer to every problem has been more government at taxpayer expense and less individual liberty every crisis manufactured or otherwise since the nation s early beginnings has become a make work opportunity for the government to expand its reach and its power at taxpayer expense while limiting our freedoms at every turn the great depression the world wars the 9 11 terror attacks the covid 19 pandemic viewed in this light the history of the united states is a testament to the old adage that liberty decreases as government and government bureaucracy grows or to put it another way as government expands liberty contracts this is how the emergency state operates after all and we should know after all we have spent the past 20 years in a state of emergency from 9 11 to covid 19 we the people have acted the part of the helpless gullible victims desperately in need of the government to save us from whatever danger threatens in turn the government has been all too accommodating and eager while also expanding its power and authority in the so called name of national security this is a government that has grown so corrupt greedy power hungry and tyrannical over the course of the past 240 plus years that our constitutional republic has since given way to idiocracy and representative government has given way to a kleptocracy a government ruled by thieves and a kakistocracy a government run by unprincipled career politicians corporations and thieves that panders to the worst vices in our nature and has little regard for the rights of american citizens what this really amounts to is a war on the american people fought on american soil funded with taxpayer dollars and waged with a single minded determination to use national crises manufactured or otherwise in order to transform the american homeland into a battlefield indeed the government s mis management of various states of emergency in the past 20 years has spawned a massive security industrial complex the likes of which have never been seen before according to the national priorities project at the progressive institute for policy studies since 9 11 the united states has spent 21 trillion on militarization surveillance and repression clearly this is not a government that is a friend to freedom rather this is a government that in conjunction with its corporate partners views the citizenry as consumers and bits of data to be bought sold and traded this is a government that spies on and treats its people as if they have no right to privacy especially in their own homes while the freedom to be human is being erased this is a government that is laying the groundwork to weaponize the public s biomedical data as a convenient means by which to penalize certain unacceptable social behaviors incredibly a new government agency harpa a healthcare counterpart to the pentagon s research and development arm darpa will take the lead in identifying and targeting signs of mental illness or violent inclinations among the populace by using artificial intelligence to collect data from apple watches fitbits amazon echo and google home this is a government that routinely engages in taxation without representation whose elected officials lobby for our votes only to ignore us once elected this is a government comprised of petty bureaucrats vigilantes masquerading as cops and faceless technicians this is a government that railroads taxpayers into financing government programs whose only purpose is to increase the power and wealth of the corporate elite this is a government a warring empire that forces its taxpayers to pay for wars abroad that serve no other purpose except to expand the reach of the military industrial complex this is a government that subjects its people to scans searches pat downs and other indignities by the tsa and vipr raids on so called soft targets like shopping malls and bus depots by black clad darth vader look alikes this is a government that uses fusion centers which represent the combined surveillance efforts of federal state and local law enforcement to track the citizenry s movements record their conversations and catalogue their transactions this is a government whose wall to wall surveillance has given rise to a suspect society in which the burden of proof has been reversed such that americans are now assumed guilty until or unless they can prove their innocence this is a government that treats its people like second class citizens who have no rights and is working overtime to stigmatize and dehumanize any and all who do not fit with the government s plans for this country this is a government that uses free speech zones roving bubble zones and trespass laws to silence censor and marginalize americans and restrict their first amendment right to speak truth to power this is a government that persists in renewing the national defense authorization act ndaa which allows the president and the military to arrest and detain american citizens indefinitely based on the say so of the government this is a government that saddled us with the patriot act which opened the door to all manner of government abuses and

standing army by way of programs that transfer surplus military hardware to local and state police this is a government that has militarized american s domestic police equipping them with military weapons such as tens of thousands of machine guns nearly 200 000 ammunition magazines a million hollow point bullets thousands of pieces of camouflage and night vision equipment and hundreds of silencers armored cars and aircraft in addition to armored vehicles sound cannons and the like this is a government that has provided cover to police when they shoot and kill unarmed individuals just for standing a certain way or moving a certain way or holding something anything that police could misinterpret to be a gun or igniting some trigger centric fear in a police officer s mind that has nothing to do with an actual threat to their safety this is a government that has created a constitution free zone within 100 miles inland of the border around the united states paving the way for border patrol agents to search people s homes intimately probe their bodies and rifle through their belongings all without a warrant nearly 66 of americans 2 3 of the u s population 197 4 million people now live within that 100 mile deep constitution free zone this is a government that treats public school students as if they were prison inmates enforcing zero tolerance policies that criminalize childish behavior and indoctrinating them with teaching that emphasizes rote memorization and test taking over learning synthesizing and critical thinking this is a government that is operating in the negative on every front it s spending far more than what it makes and takes from the american taxpayers and it is borrowing heavily from foreign governments and social security to keep the government operating and keep funding its endless wars abroad meanwhile the nation s sorely neglected infrastructure railroads water pipelines ports dams bridges airports and roads is rapidly deteriorating this is a government that has empowered police departments to make a profit at the expense of those they have sworn to protect through the use of asset forfeiture laws speed traps and red light cameras this is a government whose gun violence inflicted on unarmed individuals by battlefield trained swat teams militarized police and bureaucratic government agents trained to shoot first and ask questions later poses a greater threat to the safety and security of the nation than any mass shooter there are now reportedly more bureaucratic non military government agents armed with high tech deadly weapons than u s marines this is a government that has allowed the presidency to become a dictatorship operating above and beyond the law regardless of which party is in power this is a government that treats dissidents whistleblowers and freedom fighters as enemies of the state this is a government that has in recent decades unleashed untold horrors upon the world including its own citizenry in the name of global conquest the acquisition of greater wealth scientific experimentation and technological advances all packaged in the guise of the greater good this is a government that allows its agents to break laws with immunity while average americans get the book thrown at them this is a government that speaks in a language of force what is this language of force militarized police riot squads camouflage gear black uniforms armored vehicles mass arrests pepper spray tear gas batons strip searches surveillance cameras kevlar vests drones lethal weapons less than lethal weapons unleashed with deadly force rubber bullets water cannons stun grenades arrests of journalists crowd control tactics intimidation tactics brutality contempt of cop charges this is a government that justifies all manner of government tyranny and power grabs in the so called name of national security national crises and national emergencies this is a government that exports violence worldwide with one of this country s most profitable exports being weapons indeed the united states the world s largest exporter of arms has been selling violence to the world in order to prop up the military industrial complex and maintain its endless wars abroad this is a government that is consumed with squeezing every last penny out of the population and seemingly unconcerned if essential freedoms are trampled in the process this is a government that routinely undermines the constitution and rides roughshod over the rights of the citizenry eviscerating individual freedoms so that its own powers can be expanded this is a government that believes it has the authority to search seize strip scan spy on probe pat down taser and arrest any individual at any time and for the slightest provocation the constitution be damned in other words as i make clear in my book battlefield america the war on the american people and in its fictional counterpart the erik blair diaries
