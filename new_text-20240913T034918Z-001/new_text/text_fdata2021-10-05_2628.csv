by chuck collins as lawmakers scramble to finalize a historic jobs and infrastructure package huge fights are underway to figure out how to fund it the simplest most effective and most popular way is to tax the extremely wealthy like the billionaires who ve seen their collective wealth grow by 1 8 trillion during the pandemic unfortunately lawmakers have missed several opportunities to do this for example the house ways and means committee has failed to take obvious steps like taxing income from stocks at the same rate as income from work or closing the loopholes billionaires use to avoid the federal estate tax on the other hand the committee has also suggested some powerful inequality fighting reforms that should be in the final legislation one of these promising proposals is a millionaires surtax the idea is simple any income that multimillionaires earn over a certain amount would face a modest additional tax the millionaires surtax was originally introduced in 2019 and reintroduced in 2021 by maryland senator chris van hollen and virginia representative don beyer that bill would institute a 10 percent surtax on the incomes of couples making 2 million or more the top 0 2 percent the tax policy center estimated this would raise 635 billion over 10 years the americans for tax fairness coalition has coordinated a national campaign that has now put the concept at the center of the federal budget negotiations don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free the recently released house ways and means plan differs slightly from that original proposal it would impose a 3 percent surtax on the incomes of ultra wealthy households making 5 million or more per year raising an estimated 127 billion over 10 years it also applies to incomes from investments including trusts that s a smaller haul to be sure but worth building on of course the holy grail of tax reform would be a total elimination of the preferential treatment of capital gains taxing income from wealth at the same rates as income from wages short of that a surtax on the incomes of ultra millionaires is an important foot in the door toward equalizing the treatment of capital and wage income the millionaires surtax is easy to understand simple to apply and effective because it covers all kinds of income making it difficult for the wealthy to avoid it s laser focused on the super rich if you re not a multi millionaire you won t pay one extra dime the surtax is overwhelmingly popular according to a poll by hart research associates 73 percent of voters support the idea including 76 percent of independents and moderates even a majority of trump voters 57 percent and republicans 53 percent favor the policy the millionaires surtax legislation has been endorsed by a diverse range of 72 national organizations in the coming weeks congress will debate the size of the build back better plan and how to pay for it the millionaires surtax should remain part of that mix and could even be expanded by raising the rate from 3 percent to 10 percent and lowering the income threshold to 2 million while the millionaires surtax does not address the colossal inequalities of wealth it focuses on taxing income that largely flows from wealth see more about the millionaires surtax at the campaign website created by the americans for tax fairness www surtax org previously published on otherwords with creative commons licenses join the good men project as a premium member today all premium members get to view the good men project with no ads a 50 annual membership gives you an all access pass you can be a part of every call group class and community a 25 annual membership gives you access to one class one social interest group and our online communities a 12 annual membership gives you access to our friday calls with the publisher our online community register new account log in if you wish to renew an existing subscription username email first name last name password password again choose your subscription level yearly 50 00 1 year monthly 6 99 1 month credit debit card paypal choose your payment method auto renew subscribe to the good men project daily newsletter our terms of service which can be found here need more info a complete list of benefits is here photo credit istock

when it comes to your life you want to stay physically and mentally healthy and this also applies to your personal finances which is commonly called your financial health financial healthwhile your physical and mental health is far superior to your financial health it s still crucial to work on this too and as i know and you may too finances can cause some serious stress that financial stress can then put a toll on your body mind and relationships yet when it comes to your personal finances and financial well being there is one area that is critical to master self control the challenge is it might be the toughest thing to be consistent with throughout your lifetime table of contents what is financial health before we get into how self control affects your financial health i think it s important we are all on the same page on the definition financial health is the term used to describe your own personal finances and how healthy it is this includes things like how well your saving what you put away for retirement how little debt you have etc there is a bit more to it than that but for the sake of this post we ll keep it that simple why self control matters to your financial health as i mentioned in the introduction i think self control is one of the toughest things to master for your financial health don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free your ability to control certain desires or urges with your money can really determine your overall financial stability and results in the long run it s also incredibly challenging especially if you are just starting to take control of your personal finances i see a need for discipline and self control in four key financial areas spending tax refunds getting a raise investing money below i m going to dive into each area and why self control plays a major role also i m now going on five years of working on my financial health and sometimes i still struggle in these areas too it s an ongoing practice to master self control in your finances but the rewards can certainly be life changing spending for your financial health to really be awesome you have to get your spending under control but not only that you need to continue to resist the urge to spend over time we are the society of consuming things and buying items we want but do not necessarily need it can put us into credit card debt deplete our savings or stop us from even building a quality savings account according to a 2018 cnbc article the average american has a credit card balance of 6 375 up nearly 3 percent from previous year there are some other stats on their infographic within the post that are also a bit alarming a big part of this credit card debt is retail therapy or buying and charging anything and everything to credit cards this is where self control becomes vital but it s not easy to break this cycle the internet makes everything easy to consume with you being one click away from having something you may want additionally what your friends colleagues or family has or recommends might entice you to spend more or seeing what others have on social media can be an influence too the challenge is to resist and break the cycle your current and future financial health depends on it i m also not against treating yourself and occasionally buying something you d want we all need that it s learning when to say no ask yourself will this bring me temporary or long term happiness can i live without it most likely you can tax refunds when it comes to these types of posts my intention is to never be preachy or come off shaming anyone s financial choices and i almost did not include tax refunds into this but i think it is relevant to include based on the subject matter mostly because it s not my place to tell people what to do with their refunds but let s explore most people i know if and when they get their tax refund will spend it there s that spending again and on things that they probably really don t need having a nice chunk of change in one lump sum is nice and extremely tempting to use but if you are looking to better your financial health your tax refund has much better uses it s also pretty easy to spend it i remember a few times taking that 800 refund and spending it all on random things not anything that would improve my career finances or household needs just random things that have no added no value to me the point is try resist the urge to spend your tax refund frivolously and find ways to put that money to work or use it for something much needed like household repairs related looking for more on tax refunds here are some ways you can invest your refund for your financial health getting a raise what raise where can i get one of those that might be what you are thinking but i do hope you have and will continue to get raises in your career hey even if you are self employed i hope you give yourself a raise too all that aside i know one thing i used to do when i did get a raise start to upgrade my lifestyle or buy more useless items sure this may go back to spending but self control applies to your raises too when you get a raise think about what that money can be used for like don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free paying down any debt faster contributing more to your savings increasing your 401k or ira contributions investing it elsewhere you ve heard the stories and you probably know people in these situations they make six figure salaries have a big house multiple fancy cars go on the best vacations but have little saved it s incredibly common there is more to it than just self control but it plays a pretty big role i think investing if you are working on your personal finances and financial health you ll most likely get involved with investing whether that is in the stock market real estate or something else it s a great way to put your money to work for you besides spending challenges self control is major when it comes to investing i actually think it might be more challenging than the rest on this list but that s just my humble opinion investing your money brings a lot of temptations like you hear about a hot investment opportunity the markets are down so you want to sell the media tells you about the markets and what to do those are just a sampling of things that might come up but without mastering some self control you can do some serious financial damage back to those examples self control can stop you from blindly investing with doing your research resist the urge to sell because the markets are down saving your long term growth not making buying or selling decisions because some media expert told you it s easy to fall into these traps early on i would sell something because i was losing a little bit of money yet had i held on and kept investing i would of recovered plus made money investing takes removing the emotion creating a plan and mastering the art of self control final thoughts when i look back at my last few years of personal finances and investing i realized that the common challenge in most areas was self control without truly recognizing it and learning to master self control it was seriously damaging my financial health and future finances by not controlling spending and having discipline to keep on with my goals i was hurting my bank account with investing and being tempted i would sell low and buy high hurting my investing goals think back to some of your financial mistakes or challenges did your self control play a part in why it was affecting your financial health what do you think let me know in the comments below this post was previously published on investedwallet com

today marks a decade since wikileaks published the iraq war logs the most comprehensive exposure of imperialist criminality and neo colonial banditry since the pentagon papers of the 1970s revealed the scale of american military activities in vietnam and perhaps of all time in minute detail the logs exposed all of the lies used to justify the occupation of iraq revealing it to be a brutal operation involving the daily murder of civilians torture innumerable acts of imperialist thuggery targeting an oppressed population and cover ups extending to the top of the us and allied military commands the material was painstakingly reviewed contextualised and its political implications explained above all by julian assange and his small team of journalistic colleagues at wikileaks the logs were one of the most powerful applications of the wikileaks model that assange had developed when he founded the organisation in 2006 the publication of leaked documents kept hidden by the powers that be would expose to the population the real military economic and political relations and the daily intrigues of governments that shaped world politics and so much of their lives only by knowing what was really occurring could ordinary people take informed political action including in the fight to end war assange and wikileaks have never been forgiven by the us ruling elite or its allies in britain australia and internationally for taking these enlightenment ideals seriously and acting on them behind all of the lies and slanders used to undermine support for assange the real watchword of the campaign against the wikileaks founder is he exposed our crimes so we will destroy him ten years after he revealed war crimes of a scale and intensity not seen since the horrors of the nazi regime assange is alone in a cell at london s maximum security belmarsh prison a facility designed to detain terrorists and murderers he faces extradition to the us prosecution under the espionage act for publishing the truth including the iraq war logs and 175 years in a supermax prison chelsea manning the courageous whistleblower who released the material has been subjected to a decade long nightmare involving imprisonment what the united nations deemed to be state torture and attempts to coerce her into giving false testimony against assange which she has heroically resisted but the gangsters who orchestrated the rape of iraq remain free george w bush has been politically rehabilitated above all by the us democrats and the corrupt liberal press former british prime minister tony blair is still up to his neck in imperialist intrigues in the middle east and his australian counterpart john howard is enjoying a quiet retirement this operation has above all relied upon the same pliant corporate media that promoted the illegal invasion of iraq based on lies about weapons of mass destruction and then embedded itself in the occupation forces that pillaged the country and looted its oil their complicity today is summed up by the fact that not a single major publication in the us britain or australia has even taken note of the ten year anniversary of the iraq war logs the significance of the logs and the explosive impact they had on popular consciousness however must be recalled the publication comprised 391 832 field reports by the us army from 2004 to 2009 making it the largest leak in the history of the american military they recorded 109 000 iraqi deaths at least 66 081 were described by the us army as civilians this included some 15 000 fatalities that had been completely covered up by the us and its allies who prior to the publication claimed that they did not have a record of civilian deaths without wikileaks and assange the murders of these workers students young people and senior citizens equivalent to the population of a small town would never have been known the logs showed that the us military routinely described those it killed as insurgents when they were known to be civilians such was the case in the infamous 2007 apache helicopter attack in baghdad documented in wikileaks collateral murder video which involved the slaughter of up to 19 civilians including two reuters journalists a us army press release at the time had described a fictitious firefight with insurgents the war logs revealed that some 700 civilians had been gunned down by us and allied troops for coming too close to a military checkpoint they included children and the mentally ill on at least six occasions the victims were rushing their pregnant wives to hospital to give birth the carnage was also perpetrated by the private contractors who operated as shock troops of the us occupation one report described blackwater employees firing indiscriminately into a crowd after an ied explosion another said us soldiers observed a blackwater psd shoot up a civ vehicle in baghdad the may 2005 attack killed an innocent man and maimed his wife and daughter the logs showed that the us routinely handed over detainees to their puppet iraqi security forces for torture one report noted the presence of a hand cranked generator with wire clamps in a baghdad police station used to electrocute prisoners the official policy of the coalition troops as revealed in the logs was not to investigate such incidents taken together the revelations painted an undeniable picture of systemic criminality involving the most powerful governments in the world their militaries and proxies testifying at british show trial hearings for assange s extradition last month professor john sloboda co founder of iraq body count stated that the logs had brought the killings of iraqi civilians to the largest global audience of any single release all of which were unique to the logs in 2010 are still unique the iraq war logs remain the only source of those incidents their significance is even starker when placed in a broader political context in 2003 millions of people joined demonstrations against the invasion of iraq in the largest anti war movement in human history the pseudo left green and trade union forces that politically dominated the protests did everything they could to subordinate this movement to pro war organisations such as the democratic party in the us and the labor party in australia as well as impotent appeals to the united nations in 2008 they supported the election of us president barack obama proclaiming that representative of wall street who would be at war his entire eight years in office as the bringer of peace wikileaks publication of the war logs cut through this suppression of the anti war movement raising the urgency of a renewed fight against imperialist militarism in the process young people around the world became aware in many cases for the first time of the horrors being perpetrated in iraq and were politically activated the new york times and the guardian partnered with wikileaks on the war logs their aim was to control the narrative and land a scoop but as it became clear that the publications were contributing to a political radicalisation of workers and young people and that wikileaks was facing the full force of the us state they began to denounce assange in the most slanderous terms such is the basic reason for the venomous hostility of the entire political and media establishment towards assange in every country especially its pseudo left and liberal contingents he and wikileaks rocked the boat upon which their own privileged and selfish upper middle class existence depends the wars moreover had not been at all bad for their stock portfolios contributing to the open support of this milieu for the imperialist attacks on libya and syria but the publication of the war logs was an imperishable contribution to humanity and the fight against imperialist war for which assange is rightly viewed as a hero by millions of workers and young people now it is up to the international working class to spearhead the fight for assange s freedom the defence of all wikileaks staff and of democratic rights as a whole this is inseparable from the struggle against the escalating drive to war including us threats of war against china and russia and the fight to put an end to the capitalist order that is responsible for imperialist violence and authoritarianism

claim pepsi originated as a rat poison company rating about this rating false in early october 2021 social media users shared a copy and pasted copypasta meme that contained a false story about the history of the soft drink brand pepsi claiming that the soda maker originated as a rat poison company the intent of the meme appeared to be humor gustav pepsi a history pepsico began as the indiana poison works the manufacturer of a low quality rat poison that would either kill the rats or make them incredibly strong and angry after the unusually cold february of 1896 killed most of the local rat population and poison sales slumped company owner gustav pepsi disposed of the excess stock by bottling and selling it to humans in the endeavor he was guided by his corporate philosophy that all our customers deserve to die and laws aren t real the meme is a work of fiction pepsi according to the company s own history was founded in new bern north carolina by pharmacist caleb bradham the drink was originally composed of sugar water caramel lemon oil kola nuts nutmeg and other ingredients and dubbed brad s drink bradham started calling his beverage creation pepsi cola in 1898 and then trademarked it in 1903 as sales took off bradham established an office building for the newly flourishing business in his home town of new bern in 1908 eventually the company grew into a mega corporation for drinks and snack foods but nowhere in its history did it ever sell rat poison
reuters the u s congress has about two weeks to raise the federal government s 28 4 trillion debt ceiling or cause a historic default that would take a heavy toll on the economy the parties are deadlocked over how to do so minority republicans want the senate to use a parliamentary maneuver known as budget reconciliation which would allow democrats to act without republican votes majority leader chuck schumer has resisted that approach preferring the measure to pass in regular order here is the process the senate would have to race through if schumer were to blink giving senate minority leader mitch mcconnell his way and turning to reconciliation the budget committees in the senate and house of representatives would have to write legislation enabling the debt limit to be raised through this arcane tightly controlled procedure the senate budget committee likely would deadlock 11 11 if all 22 members are present preventing chairman bernie sanders from sending such a bill to the full senate schumer could then make a move on the senate floor to discharge the stuck legislation from the budget panel there would be a maximum of four hours of debate and then the senate would vote on whether to instruct sanders to release the bill to the floor the senate could then start debate for a maximum of 20 hours but it would be open to a potentially large number of amendments in a procedure that is known as a vote a rama amendments would have to be directly related to budgetary matters however vote a ramas are often all night affairs following votes on amendments the senate could vote to approve the debt limit bill and could do so with a simple majority of 51 votes the house also would have to go through the process of debating and passing the bill also by simple majority as all of this is unfolding global financial markets could become unsettled as oct 18 nears and washington flirts with a default some democrats have said it would be difficult to go through all these steps in time an assertion mcconnell dismisses democrats suspect mcconnell wants all of this to unfold with no republican fingerprints on the legislation easing the way for republican attack ads against democrats in the 2022 congressional elections compiled by richard cowan editing by scott malone and grant mccool

senate republican leader mitch mcconnell is forcing senate democrats into a cumbersome process that could near the debt limit deadline with little margin for error washington president joe biden on monday told republican senators to get out of the way and let democrats suspend the nation s debt limit on their own hoping to keep the u s government from coming dangerously close to a credit default as senate republican leader mitch mcconnell refuses to lend his party s help biden s criticism comes as congress faces an oct 18 deadline to allow for more borrowing to keep the government operating after having accrued a total public debt of 28 4 trillion the house has passed a measure to suspend the debt limit but mcconnell is forcing senate democrats into a cumbersome process that could drag on for weeks and brush up against a deadline with little margin for error both biden and mcconnell have promised the country will avoid default yet the public fight and political posturing risks an economic meltdown the global economy relies on the stability of u s treasury notes and unpaid debt could crush financial markets and hurl america into recession biden said the debt limit applies to borrowing that has already occurred including under former president donald trump and that republicans are hurting the country by blocking the suspension they need to stop playing russian roulette with the u s economy biden said at the white house republicans just have to let us do our job just get out of the way if you don t want to help save the country get out of the way so you don t destroy it once a routine vote the need to raise the nation s debt limit has become increasingly partisan it s become a favorite political weapon of republicans to either demand concessions or force democrats into unpopular votes to enable more borrowing mcconnell has tied the vote to biden s multitrillion dollar tax and economic agenda that awaits congressional approval but biden says the price tag in terms of debt for his plan will be zero paid for by raising taxes on corporations and on the wealthy whom the house democrats have defined as individuals earning more than 400 000 a year or couples making more than 450 000 biden said he planned to talk with mcconnell who dug in with a letter of his own to the president we have no list of demands for two and a half months we have simply warned that since your party wishes to govern alone it must handle the debt limit alone as well the kentucky senator wrote in the monday letter the financial markets have stayed relatively calm with interest rates on 10 year treasury notes holding just below 1 5 that rate is slightly higher than the all time lows set last year as the coronavirus pandemic spread but it s still lower than at any other time over nearly 60 years of data tracked by the federal reserve treasury secretary janet yellen has said the government will exhaust its cash reserves on oct 18 an event she says would likely trigger a financial crisis and economic recession senate majority leader chuck schumer warned on monday that it would be hazardous for the economy to come anywhere near that deadline the consequences of even approaching the x date could be disastrous for our economy and devastating to american families raising the costs of borrowing for average americans and hampering our economic recovery over the long term schumer said in a letter to democratic senators democrats and republicans are in a standoff over how to handle an extension for the debt ceiling republicans are insisting that democrats go it alone with the same legislative tool that is already being used to try and pass biden s plan to boost safety net health and environmental programs democrats say that extending the debt limit has traditionally been a bipartisan effort and that the debt cap was built up under presidents from both parties schumer said that if the debt issue is not resolved this week the senate will likely be

monday s outage of facebook facebook messenger instagram and whatsapp one of the longest in facebook s history marooned billions of users who rely on the social media giant and its apps for everything from connecting with friends to running their businesses and logging into websites the social network and the facebook owned platforms stopped working around 11 30 a m edt monday according to the site downdetector com at around 5 40 p m some users were able to access the platforms but not all functions were back facebook said that the root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change when an engineer doing routine maintenance work issued a command which unintentionally took down all the connections in our backbone network effectively disconnecting facebook data centers globally our systems are designed to audit commands like these to prevent mistakes like this but a bug in that audit tool didn t properly stop the command facebook detailed in a tuesday blog post this change caused a complete disconnection of our server connections between our data centers and the internet and that total loss of connection caused a second issue that made things worse the company said late monday that there was no evidence that user data was compromised as a result and a facebook spokesperson reiterated that stance tuesday in an email to usa today saying that we want to make clear there was no malicious activity behind this outage the company has also offered a litany of apologies to its users we re sorry we know billions of people and businesses around the world depend on our products and services to stay connected we appreciate your patience as we come back online facebook chief technology officer mike schroepfer personally apologized twice monday to users via twitter facebook services coming back online now may take some time to get to 100 to every small and large business family and individual s who depends on us i m sorry windows 11 what you need to know about microsoft s release of its new operating system facebook whistleblower who is frances haugen everything you need to know the outage affected facebook s moneymaker ads facebook s u s digital advertising revenue is estimated to be more than 48 billion this year and 57 billion in 2022 according to emarketer instagram s digital ad revenue is projected to be 25 billion this year and more than 32 billion in 2022 emarketer said that s why facebook scrambled to get the sites back up and running the company said late monday that the underlying cause of the outage affected many of its internal systems making it harder to diagnose and resolve facebook said its engineers determined the problem originated with a networking issue that interrupted communications between its data centers and with the servers unable to communicate the problems mounted causing outages across its systems and its three major social platforms that are now being brought back up slowly facebook said the global facebook outage grew to be one of the largest downdetector ever tracked in terms of reports and duration said luke deryckx cto of internet testing firm ookla which owns the online monitoring site the combined popularity of facebook instagram whatsapp and facebook messenger means that billions of users have been impacted by the services being entirely offline today when facebook goes down it s a bad day on the internet and today is particularly stormy about an hour into the outage facebook tweeted we re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products we re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and we apologize for any inconvenience the outage came after a whistleblower said the world s largest social network prioritizes profits over users safety former facebook product manager frances haugen said in an exclusive 60 minutes interview sunday on cbs that a change in 2018 to the content flow in facebook s news feed contributed to more divisiveness and ill will in a network ostensibly created to bring people closer facebook s stock fell by nearly 5 monday but rebounded slighly on tuesday facebook consumer boycott would you take a

did all these networks get affected at the same time computer security writer brian krebs tweeted a possible answer for some of the problems facebook and instagram were apparently removed from the dns domain name system servers that basically make up the white pages of the internet the dns records that tell systems how to find facebook com or instagram com got withdrawn this morning from the global routing tables krebs tweeted we don t know why this change was made it could well have been the result of an internal system wide change or update that went awry it s all speculation at this point why fb alone is in control over its dns records facebook s service became unavailable and remained unavailable monday afternoon and unreachable on the internet according to web infrastructure company cloudflare this occurred apparently because of an error in the border gateway protocol bgp an internet traffic standard from what we understand of the actual issue it is a globalized bgp configuration issue usman muzaffar cloudflare s senior vice president engineering told usa today in our experience these usually are mistakes not attacks when traffic is directed at facebook s internet addresses the addresses basically are not there because of the issue visitors trying to reach a facebook property like facebook com will not get an answer and so the page won t load muzaffar said it is 100 an internet routing issue said andrew wertkin chief strategy officer at bluecat networks the routes are missing from the internet why that happened we don t know nor the cause of it the routes were withdrawn or yanked we just don t why they were yanked is facebook com for sale twitter reacts as the incident continued cybersecurity analyst anis haboubi tweeted what appears to be a for sale ad for the facebook com domain krebs saw it too and found domain name company godaddy also offering facebook com for sale bidding starts at one beeleon dollars he tweeted facebook com was never seriously at risk of being sold web domain company godaddy com said in a statement to usa today a third party who doesn t own facebook com attempted to list it for sale on uniregistry com and we inadvertently included it in search results because the third party didn t own or control the domain it was never at risk of being sold and it remains with the current owner the listing has been removed and is

facebook instagram and whatsapp were hit by a massive global outage on tuesday morning leaving tens of millions of people worldwide unable to access the sites users trying to access facebook in affected areas were being greeted with the message something went wrong we re working on it and we ll get it fixed as soon as we can it is now understood that many locked out facebook users in australia at least have been able to get back on the site as of about 9am aedt this morning many aussies say their instagram and whatsapp sites are back up and running too with some people are reporting issues across the three sites facebook issued a statement saying their services were back online to the huge community of people and businesses around the world who depend on us we re sorry we ve been working hard to restore access to our apps and services and are happy to report they are coming back online now thank you for bearing with us they said however the outage lasted for more than five hours and it is estimated to have cost facebook which runs the three sites us 160 million for every hour it was down according to netblocks the company s shares are also taking a hammering as of this morning they are down 5 per cent we re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products facebook said in a statement we re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and we apologise for any inconvenience downdetector which provides real time information about the status of various websites and services confirmed the widespread outage which began about 2 23am today the outage has been blamed on a domain name system dns failure a dns or domain name system connects domain names to the right ip addresses so that people can access popular websites earlier this year an outage at a major dns operator took out huge swathes of the internet briefly however the problem appears to be bigger than just a technical issue with reports of trouble at facebook s headquarters today employees have been reportedly unable to enter the tech giant s buildings since the outage began two facebook security team members told the new york times it was unlikely that a cyberattack caused the issues because the technology behind the apps was still different enough that one hack was not likely to affect all of them at once facebook s site this morning returned a message that read this site can t be reached network intelligence company thousandeyes said tests confirmed that the facebook application became unreachable due to dns failure facebook s authoritative dns nameservers became unreachable at that time it said in a statement twitter users responded by mocking the company saying that the world would be better if you just left it all switched off and that we re actually enjoying the lack of disinformation and misinformation twitter also posted the cheeky message hello literally everyone in a curious twist the domain name facebook com was listed for sale by domain tools the organisation behind the domain registration was still listed as facebook inc and it s unclear why the site s address would be listed for sale independent cybersecurity journalist brian krebs also linked the outages to a dns issue tweeting that facebook s dns records got withdrawn this morning from the global routing tables can you imagine working at fb right now when your email no longer works all your internal fb based tools fail he wrote major websites can also go offline if content delivery networks or cdns crash which is what happened in june when a fastly crash took out major websites including amazon google and the new york times facebook embroiled in controversy the outage began after several reports that were severely critical of facebook appeared yesterday cbs news show 60 minutes aired a segment in which facebook whistleblower frances haugen shared a trove of facebook alleging the social media giant knew its products were fuelling hate and harming children s mental health ms haugen a 37 year old data scientist from iowa who has worked for companies including google and pinterest said in an interview that facebook was substantially worse than anything she had seen before she called for the company to be regulated facebook over and over again has shown it chooses profit over safety it is subsidising it is paying for its profits with our safety ms haugen said the version of facebook that exists today is tearing our societies apart and causing ethnic violence around the world she said facebook instagram and whatsapp have all suffered outages picture istock the world s largest social media platform has been embroiled in a firestorm brought about by ms haugen who as an unnamed whistleblower shared the documents with us politicians and the wall street journal that detail how facebook knew its products including instagram were harming young girls in the 60 minutes interview she explained how the algorithm which picks what to show in a user s news feed is optimised for content that gets a reaction the company s own research shows that it is easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions ms haugen said facebook has realised that if they change the algorithm to be safer people will spend less time on the site they ll click on less ads they ll make less money a new report released yesterday by plan international australia found 87 per cent of the thousands of people it surveyed thought misinformation and disinformation had had a negative impact on their lives one in three reported false information affected their mental health leaving them feeling stressed worried and anxious while one in five had been left feeling physically unsafe with the new york post and afp originally published as facebook whatsapp instagram hit by global outage why facebook isn t working

smith of bcs the chartered institute for it and a software testing expert said the outage is caused by changes made to the facebook network infrastructure many of the recent high profile outages have

amid a bevy of institutions posting high flying returns for the 2021 fiscal year one stands out among the rest particularly in garnering headlines washington university in st louis but a rare look under the hood of wash u s returns illustrates what was happening in the markets over the past year and the challenges facing cios including where to place bets the washington university investment management company had been on the rise for a few years already but cio scott wilson led the organization as it skyrocketed 65 percent to 15 3 billion for the fiscal year ending june 30 the numbers are even more impressive when broken down by asset class the private investment portfolio which makes up 40 percent of the endowment s assets was up 82 percent while the public equities portfolio was up 72 percent for the year wilson said those returns reported on september 20 were seeded by decisions made years prior according to wilson who spoke with institutional investor first off a huge portion of it is just beta wilson said referring to the returns that came exclusively from the rise of markets overall but the organization s decision to concentrate on emerging markets and co invest alongside some of its managers paid off wuimc s executive chairman and former interim cio eric upin likes to call this model endowment 2 0 that means the endowment focused more on its best ideas or high conviction investments co invested alongside managers in both public and private markets and pushed for deeper involvement from all its team members the board members aren t easy on wilson they gave the investment team a benchmark of 70 percent stocks 30 percent fixed income to beat we are comfortable with a cio who has a concentrated co invested portfolio upin told ii when wilson joined the organization in december 2017 the portfolio had no co investments now they make up 20 percent of wuimc s investments which are made alongside both public and private investment managers according to wilson his team spends roughly 90 percent of its time on these deals wilson s team is also focused on investing in emerging markets prior to the pandemic wuimc s top five team members spent a significant chunk of their time flying to far flung locales in the hopes of finding strong investment themes outside of the u s the top five spent 400 000 miles each traveling in 2018 and 2019 to source investments in general we like to go where our peers aren t wilson said we have a lot of exposure in frontier and emerging markets most of which is bottom up driven when the covid 19 pandemic began in march 2020 wuimc had already done the legwork necessary to deploy capital despite being unable to travel the endowment has also allocated capital to cryptocurrency wuimc made a super tiny investment back in 2014 and has since added to it wilson is focused on crypto companies like lenders or blockchain related gaming firms rather than those that focus on one specific currency moving forward wilson said his team is worried about valuations in both public and private equity particularly in technology and late stage growth companies we re trying to take profits where we can in that space he said our other focus has been rebalancing the portfolio wilson added with the huge run up in equities both public and private we ve gotten out beyond our risk profile amid the march and april market drawdown wilson said wuimc rebalanced about five percent of its portfolio and would have moved more capital around but the markets roared back quickly for now wuimc is selling futures against its book to hedge the portfolio while waiting for certain liquidity events that will allow it to rebalance wilson said although assets under management have increased significantly wilson doesn t plan to add specialists from outside to his team he said he prefers promoting staff internally when he can growing them from interns and associates to higher ranking professionals that will be the case for managing director michael stohler s replacement stohler left the organization in late july for the wisconsin foundation and alumni association where he was named cio we ll just continue to do what we re doing wilson said most of it is just hard work and basic blocking and tackling we re still finding interesting things to do but we re also passing on so many opportunities

huntington beach calif officials investigating one of california s largest oil spills are looking into whether a ship s anchor may have struck a pipeline on the ocean floor causing a major leak of crude into coastal waters and fouling beaches authorities said monday the head of the company that operates the pipeline said company divers were inspecting the area of the suspected leak and he expected to have a much better idea what caused the damage within a day an anchor striking the pipeline is one of the distinct possibilities behind the leak amplify energy ceo martyn willsher told a news conference he said divers have examined more than 8 000 feet of pipe and were focusing on one area of significant interest cargo ships entering the twin ports of los angeles and long beach routinely pass through the area coast guard officials said we re looking into if it could have been an anchor from a ship but that s in the assessment phase right now coast guard lt cmdr jeannie shaye said the spill sent up to 126 000 gallons of heavy crude into the ocean contaminating the sands of famed huntington beach and other coastal communities the spill could keep beaches closed for weeks or longer the orange county district attorney todd spitzer said he has investigators looking into whether he can bring state charges for the spill spitzer said his jurisdiction ends 3 miles offshore spitzer also said amplify s divers should not be allowed near the pipeline without an independent authority alongside them other potential criminal investigations were being pursued by the u s attorney s office for the central district of california the coast guard and the california department of fish and wildlife officials said safety advocates have pushed for years for federal rules that would strengthen oil spill detection requirements and force companies to install valves that can automatically shut down the flow of crude in case of a leak the oil and pipeline industries have resisted such requirements because of the high cost if the operator had more valves installed on this line they d have a much better chance at having the point of failure isolated by now said bill

information you need to know every morning loading you re all signed up want more of our free weekly newsletters in your inbox let s get started explore all your options the pipeline was built using a process known as electric resistance weld according to a regulatory filing from the company that welding process has been linked to past oil pipeline failures because corrosion can occur along seams according to government safety advisories and pipeline safety trust director bill caram environmentalists had feared the oil might devastate birds and marine life in the area but michael ziccardi a veterinarian and director of the oiled wildlife care network said only four oily birds had been found so far one suffered chronic injuries and had to be euthanized he said it s much better than we had feared he said at a news conference monday ziccardi said he s cautiously optimistic but it s too soon to know the extent of the spill s effect on wildlife in other offshore oil spills the largest number of oiled birds have been collected two to five days after the incident he said amplify operates three oil platforms about 9 miles off the coast of california all installed between 1980 and 1984 the company also operates a 16 inch pipeline that carries oil from a processing platform to an onshore storage facility in long beach the company has said the oil appears to be coming from a rupture in that pipeline about 4 miles from the platform in a 2016 spill response plan submitted to federal regulators the company said its worst case spill scenario was based on the assumption of a full guillotine cut of the pipeline occurring 3 miles inland from one of its platforms but an outside consultant concluded that a spill of that size was very unlikely at that location because the line is 120 feet deep and beneath a shipping lane where ships do not normally anchor the beta oil field has been owned by at least seven different corporations since it was discovered by royal dutch shell in 1976 records show a corporate predecessor of amplify bought the operation in 2012 the amplify subsidiary known as beta operating co has been cited 125 times for safety and environmental violations since 1980 according to a database from the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement the federal agency that regulates the offshore oil and gas industry the online database provides only the total number of violations not the details for each incident the company was fined a total of 85 000 for three incidents two were from 2014 when a worker who was not wearing proper protective equipment was shocked with 98 000 volts of electricity the worker survived in a separate incident crude oil was released through a boom where a safety device had been improperly bypassed in 1999 a 1 8 mile undersea pipeline running between two platforms sprang two leaks totaling at least 3 800 gallons of oil causing tar balls to wash up on beaches in orange county the cause of of the leaks was determined to be corrosion that caused pin sized holes in the steel walls of the pipeline the owner of the oil field at the time a partnership between mobil oil corp and shell oil co called aera energy llc was fined 48 000 by federal regulators a penalty environmental groups criticized as a slap on the wrist before the spill amplify had high hopes for the beta oil field and was pouring millions of dollars into upgrades and new side track projects that would tap into oil by drilling laterally we have the opportunity to keep going for as long as we want willsher said in an august conference call with investors he added there was capacity up to 20 000 barrels a day investors shared willsher s optimism sending the company s stock up more than sevenfold since the beginning of the year to 5 75 at the close of trading on friday the stock plunged more than 40 in morning trading monday the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and emerged a few months later it had been using cash

let s start by chatting a bit about the two campaigns you ve been involved with since you ve been here making history and the power of penn what are some of the biggest features of each there are a lot of highlights when you consider 9 7 billion raised across two campaigns one of the things that we did and we did very early on was make strategic investments in our alumni relations and outreach programs in making history we had the campaign goals the core priorities and then we had an engagement goal everything we did was not only about raising money it was also about bringing the penn community closer together we launched a number of different initiatives to showcase our amazing faculty including engaging minds an annual event in new york that consistently sells out and our penn to you faculty series where alumni from around the world can connect virtually with renowned faculty and their work we were really looking at our regional clubs both domestically and especially internationally where we wanted to bring them closer to the institution we also put a terrific focus on coordinating all the alumni relations programs from central alumni relations to all the schools and centers to ensure that our alumni feel connected and the numbers speak for themselves back in 2004 and 2005 we would have 8 000 attendees at alumni weekend by alumni weekend in 2019 we had over 13 000 the other important piece is that both campaigns really focused on volunteers during the power of penn we had over 6 500 volunteers involved we also had more than 41 000 alumni make their first gift ever to penn during this campaign finally making history and the power of penn were built on a strong foundation of president gutmann s vision the original penn compact that she articulated in 2004 which embraced access integrated knowledge and increased community engagement locally and globally what she now characterizes as the three i s of inclusion innovation and impact what was the final total for the power of penn campaign and what does that number signify the final total is 5 408 980 446 add that to the 4 3 billion from making history and we have raised nearly 10 billion under dr gutmann s leadership first and foremost the power of penn has had an enormous impact on undergraduate and graduate financial aid we created 830 new undergraduate scholarships and raised nearly 900 million for student aid the penn first plus program was launched and one in seven students at penn are now the first in their families to go to college up from one in 20 when dr gutmann became president we created 186 new endowed positions including 12 new penn integrates knowledge professorships there was a real focus on strengthening the faculty and over 660 million was raised for capital projects which you can see across campus we had a large infusion of funds for research both in medicine and across the university and some very very unique programs were made possible because of philanthropy from penn dental s center for integrative global oral health to the penn athletics wharton leadership academy the sachs program for arts innovation to the stavros niarchos foundation paideia program as well as the behavior change for good initiative mindcore and the actionable intelligence for social policy program literally across all the schools and centers at penn philanthropy made it possible to launch new initiatives and the results have been spectacular what has made the power of penn so unique as a campaign and why has it been so successful over the past few years when we were envisioning this campaign we asked all of the schools and centers to identify their top priorities these priorities ultimately informed the 4 1 billion goal but we knew that we were going to have to raise more it s not just putting a big number up it s the impact the funds raised will ultimately have which was one of the great distinguishing elements of the power of penn another unique element was the continued focus on engaging our alumni and friends around the world and building out programs like the penn alumni interview program during the 2021 admissions cycle more than 10 000 alumni supported penn s efforts to offer interviews to 45 000 prospective students the success we ve enjoyed is also attributed to our trustees our wonderful volunteers the academic leadership and an extraordinarily talented and innovative development and alumni relations staff across the university bringing them all together with a focus and a purpose had astonishing results but it s also the execution bob levy as campaign chair and lee doty as vice chair their volunteer leadership really inspired others it s a story of hundreds of participants moving in the same direction let s talk about the physical transformation of campus over the past two decades how did fundraising contribute to such growth if you were to go back and look at the physical campus in 2004 when dr gutmann came to penn it was very different the perelman center was just starting to be constructed penn park is probably the most significant visual transformation we actually kicked off the making history campaign at a celebration on the parking lot of the postal lands each of the schools and centers have benefited from capital projects if you ve been to the penn museum recently you would notice its complete transformation during the past two decades 3 8 billion has been invested in new and renovated space on campus including the addition of more than 30 acres of open space what sets penn apart in its ability to be able to have undergone this type of enormous physical transformation every college and university undertakes capital projects during a campaign what sets penn apart is that we didn t build for the sake of building it was strategic construction the college houses are not just nice spaces for students to live they will allow the university to move into a new era for first and second year students to be able to live on campus a critically important factor for a successful and engaging student experience you look at projects like tangen hall wharton s academic research building penn engineering s data science building which was recently named amy gutmann hall the vagelos building all of the construction that s been done at penn medicine and the upcoming opening of the pavilion at the hospital of the university of pennsylvania these are all projects that contribute to the physical transformation of our campus but it s what they enable that is so meaningful as a result our faculty are undertaking research on critically important issues and our students have access to state of the art living and learning environments you managed the making history campaign during the biggest economic downturn since the great depression and you managed the power of penn during the covid 19 pandemic how have you been able to keep alumni engaged during such extraordinary times i come back to what we started talking about when we began this conversation engaging our alumni and making them part of the fabric of the institution the downturn occurred just a year after we launched the making history campaign our focus on making sure alumni felt connected was ever so important particularly given the devastation in the financial markets president gutmann invested in financial aid so when students financial conditions changed we were able to support them we spent a lot of time meeting with our graduates and friends both domestically and internationally not asking them for money but just talking to them about their needs and what the university could do to help as the economy recovered in the latter parts of the campaign people felt very connected and very much engaged with the institution that was one of the critical pieces as we went into the power of penn campaign we continued to make strategic investments in programs that kept our alumni and donors close to the institution and stewarding them to show the impact of their giving when the covid 19 pandemic arrived in march of 2020 it upended how we do our work our business has always been conducted in person by bringing people together and showcasing the exceptional work happening at penn all of a sudden like everybody else we had to stay home i give great credit to the staff and our volunteers upon whom we had to rely on very heavily during this last period of the campaign almost 40 of the public phase of this campaign was done virtually we ended this last fiscal year with the second highest fundraising total in our history and we didn t have a single in person visit it s a credit to how quickly the team was able to pivot to a virtual environment we also found new and innovative ways to connect with our alumni we did a lot of virtual programming which had three times as many attendees than we would have had if we conducted the events in person the piece that i think is most telling is that we had six times the number of first time attendees it s about fostering a sense of community and that really came to the fore when we had to finish this campaign in a virtual environment

don t miss out on the headlines from social followed categories will be added to my news facebook instagram and whatsapp were hit by a massive global outage on tuesday morning leaving tens of millions of people worldwide unable to access the sites users trying to access facebook in affected areas were being greeted with the message something went wrong we re working on it and we ll get it fixed as soon as we can it is now understood that many locked out facebook users in australia at least have been able to get back on the site as of about 9am aedt this morning many aussies say their instagram and whatsapp sites are back up and running too with some people are reporting issues across the three sites facebook issued a statement saying their services were back online to the huge community of people and businesses around the world who depend on us we re sorry we ve been working hard to restore access to our apps and services and are happy to report they are coming back online now thank you for bearing with us they said however the outage lasted for more than five hours and it is estimated to have cost facebook which runs the three sites us 160 million for every hour it was down according to netblocks the company s shares are also taking a hammering as of this morning they are down 5 per cent we re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products facebook said in a statement we re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and we apologise for any inconvenience downdetector which provides real time information about the status of various websites and services confirmed the widespread outage which began about 2 23am today the outage has been blamed on a domain name system dns failure a dns or domain name system connects domain names to the right ip addresses so that people can access popular websites earlier this year an outage at a major dns operator took out huge swathes of the internet briefly however the problem appears to be bigger than just a technical issue with reports of trouble at facebook s headquarters today employees have been reportedly unable to enter the tech giant s buildings since the outage began two facebook security team members told the new york times it was unlikely that a cyberattack caused the issues because the technology behind the apps was still different enough that one hack was not likely to affect all of them at once facebook s site this morning returned a message that read this site can t be reached network intelligence company thousandeyes said tests confirmed that the facebook application became unreachable due to dns failure facebook s authoritative dns nameservers became unreachable at that time it said in a statement twitter users responded by mocking the company saying that the world would be better if you just left it all switched off and that we re actually enjoying the lack of disinformation and misinformation twitter also posted the cheeky message hello literally everyone in a curious twist the domain name facebook com was listed for sale by domain tools the organisation behind the domain registration was still listed as facebook inc and it s unclear why the site s address would be listed for sale independent cybersecurity journalist brian krebs also linked the outages to a dns issue tweeting that facebook s dns records got withdrawn this morning from the global routing tables can you imagine working at fb right now when your email no longer works all your internal fb based tools fail he wrote major websites can also go offline if content delivery networks or cdns crash which is what happened in june when a fastly crash took out major websites including amazon google and the new york times facebook embroiled in controversy the outage began after several reports that were severely critical of facebook appeared yesterday cbs news show 60 minutes aired a segment in which facebook whistleblower frances haugen shared a trove of facebook alleging the social media giant knew its products were fuelling hate and harming children s mental health ms haugen a 37 year old data scientist from iowa who has worked for companies including google and pinterest said in an interview that facebook was substantially worse than anything she had seen before she called for the company to be regulated facebook over and over again has shown it chooses profit over safety it is subsidising it is paying for its profits with our safety ms haugen said the version of facebook that exists today is tearing our societies apart and causing ethnic violence around the world she said facebook instagram and whatsapp have all suffered outages picture istock the world s largest social media platform has been embroiled in a firestorm brought about by ms haugen who as an unnamed whistleblower shared the documents with us politicians and the wall street journal that detail how facebook knew its products including instagram were harming young girls in the 60 minutes interview she explained how the algorithm which picks what to show in a user s news feed is optimised for content that gets a reaction the company s own research shows that it is easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions ms haugen said facebook has realised that if they change the algorithm to be safer people will spend less time on the site they ll click on less ads they ll make less money a new report released yesterday by plan international australia found 87 per cent of the thousands of people it surveyed thought misinformation and disinformation had had a negative impact on their lives one in three reported false information affected their mental health leaving them feeling stressed worried and anxious while one in five had been left feeling physically unsafe with the new york post and afp originally published as facebook whatsapp instagram hit by global outage why facebook isn t working
in a statement posted to twitter at 11 31pm facebook engineering confirmed the platforms were coming back online and thanked its millions of users around the world for bearing with us to the huge community of people and businesses around the world who depend on us we re sorry the statement said we ve been working hard to restore access to our apps and services and are happy to report they are coming back online now thank you for bearing with us the platforms had confirmed on twitter they were aware of issues and worked to resolve them after thousands of people reported outages shortly before 5pm on monday users were able to access facebook and instagram from late on monday evening while whatsapp said just after midnight its services were slowly and carefully being restored at 3 30am whatsapp confirmed its services were back and running at 100 security experts speculated the problem came following network changes with the cause still unconfirmed we re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products we re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and we apologize for any inconvenience facebook facebook october 4 2021 adam leon smith of bcs the chartered institute for it and a software testing expert said the outage is caused by changes made to the facebook network infrastructure many of the recent high profile outages have been caused by similar network level events it is reported by unidentified facebook sources on reddit that the network changes have also prevented engineers from remotely connecting to resolve the issues delaying resolution notably many organisations now define their physical infrastructure as code but most do not apply the same level of testing rigour when they change that code as they would when changing their core business logic tens of thousands reported issues within an hour of the outage dominic lipinski pa however cyber security specialist jake moore said there is a chance the issue could be related to a cyber attack he told the pa news agency there have been many reports and i m struggling to find out exactly what has happened i m reading it could be dns related which means there is an issue with the connection not knowing where to go to your device it could well be a human error or a software bug lurking in the shadows but whatever it is facebook needs to do its best to mitigate the problem of causing more panic about this the biggest problem is fears over a cyber attack but as we saw from fastly in the summer i would hedge my bets on that not being the case as we re talking about one of the biggest companies in the world but there s always a chance instagram and friends are having a little bit of a hard time right now and you may be having issues using them bear with us we re on it instagramdown instagram comms instagramcomms october 4 2021 the new york times reported the issue likely stemmed from a misconfiguration of facebook s server computers which were not letting people connect to its sites like instagram and whatsapp it said the problems appeared to be more complex and required some manual updating mike schroepfer facebook s chief technology officer said on twitter sincere apologies to everyone impacted by outages of facebook powered services right now we are experiencing networking issues and teams are working as fast as possible to

after more than 50 years of service and significant achievements supporting army readiness an operations expert retired from army materiel command in nathan godwin s final assignment he served as amc s principal deputy g 3 a position he held since 2017 gen ed daly commanding general of amc honored godwin s legacy of service during his retirement ceremony sept 28 at amc s headquarters i ve gotten to know nate well over the last five years i ve seen firsthand that nobody works harder nobody takes his job more seriously and nobody tries to drive to effects better than nate daly said godwin began his career of service by attending a u s military academy prep school and then west point graduating with the class of 1976 during his military service his highlights included meeting his wife at fort lewis washington serving in germany and his tour in el salvador he retired from active duty in 2000 beginning his army civilian service in 2001 as the branch chief for training and integration at army forces command while at forscom he was appointed as a senior executive in 2008 daly said godwin also became known as the father of army force generation which at the time was the army s core process of building trained and ready units he led the team that developed arforgen and enforced it all while seeing the deployments of every soldier and army conventional unit to bosnia iraq and afghanistan from 2001 2016 it was up to him to certify everything had been done for that unit before they deployed daly said literally thousands and thousands of soldiers went through a process that nate helped establish after leaving forscom godwin said coming to amc was an awesome experience that expanded his knowledge across the military spectrum at forces command it s about readiness making sure our young men and women are prepared to go and do their job win and come home he said here at amc it is about ensuring that those young men and women have the resources they need to successfully accomplish their mission and come home in addition to budget planning positioning and restoring army prepositioned stocks and responding to the changing military environment amc transformed and adapted part of this transformation included gaining three new major subordinate commands including installation management command amc became responsible for improving on base housing and other quality of life initiatives godwin said as someone who lived in army housing and on installations being a part of the reform meant a lot it means a lot because we actually got to see a change in environment across the army families from absolute i do not trust army leadership you re not taking care of us you don t care about us to one of our army leadership really does care he said godwin also watched the operational environment change with the army shifting to the regionally aligned readiness and modernization model a flexible predictable force generation process enabling the army to transform into a multi domain force while providing a predictable supply of ready units during this shift the world began to experience the global covid 19 pandemic as a leader he played a part in reassuring the workforce that leaders were taking positive actions to protect them at the same time he said he saw the workforce step up the individual employees within amc stepped up and took the onus on them to protect one another and hence their families he said as the pandemic impacted training it in turn impacted the supply chain hard work and collaboration across staff enabled the command the ability to react to demand keep the supply lines hot and return to normal business as military training started resuming toward the end of his service godwin also was a part of the afghanistan retrograde and the mission to evacuate special immigrant visa applicants from afghanistan he said it has been a mission that has impressed him as we evacuated those who had helped us and we are bringing them here to the united states and what we are doing to provide them places to stay i am proud he said i am just extremely proud of everything that our army amc and everybody has accomplished in support of this mission after more than 50 years supporting readiness and adapting to change he looks forward to his next big assignment being a full time husband father and grandfather i m not driving toward the setting sun in fact i m driving east toward the rising sun godwin said there s a lot of life left a lot of goodness left and a lot of fun left for me to experience as he drives forward he knows amc has a bright future ahead amc has only one direction to go and that s up and that doesn t mean because they re on the bottom said godwin the level of credibility and respect that amc has is at a point that it s never been at before and it s because of the great leadership and the great personnel assigned to amc the good news is the personnel and leaders in this headquarters

are having trouble accessing our apps and products we re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and we apologize for any inconvenience facebook facebook october 4 2021 adam leon smith of bcs the chartered institute for it and a software testing expert said the outage is caused by changes made to the facebook network infrastructure many of the recent high profile outages have been caused by similar network level events it is reported by unidentified facebook sources on reddit that the network changes have also prevented engineers from remotely connecting to resolve the issues delaying resolution notably many organisations now define their physical infrastructure as code but most do not apply the same level of testing rigour when they change that code as they would when changing their core business logic tens of thousands reported issues within an hour of the outage dominic lipinski pa however cyber security specialist jake moore said there is a chance the issue could be related to a cyber attack he told the pa news agency there have been many reports and i m struggling to find out exactly what has happened i m reading it could be dns related which means there is an issue with the connection not knowing where to go to your device it could well be a human error or a software bug lurking in the shadows but whatever it is facebook needs to do its best to mitigate the problem of causing more panic about this the biggest problem is fears over a cyber attack but as we saw from fastly in the summer i would hedge my bets on that not being the case as we re talking about one of the biggest companies in the world but there s always a chance instagram and friends are having a little bit of a hard time right now and you may be having issues using them bear with us we re on it instagramdown instagram comms instagramcomms october 4 2021 the new york times reported the issue likely stemmed from a misconfiguration of facebook s server computers which were

oil spills has been cited 72 times for safety and environmental violations that were severe enough that drilling had to be curtailed or stopped to fix the problem regulatory records show in all beta operating has been cited 125 times since 1980 according to a database from the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement the federal agency that regulates the offshore oil and gas industry the online database provides only the total number of violations not the details for each incident the company was fined a total of 85 000 for three incidents two were from 2014 when a worker who was not wearing proper protective equipment was shocked with 98 000 volts of electricity and a separate incident when crude oil was released through a boom where a safety device had been improperly bypassed beta which is a subsidiary of houston based amplify energy is under scrutiny after a suspected leak in an underwater pipeline sent 126 000 gallons of heavy crude into the ocean waters fouling the sands of famed huntington beach and other coastal communities the spill could keep beaches closed for weeks or longer environmentalists had feared the oil might devastate birds and marine life in the area but michael ziccardi a veterinarian and director of the oiled wildlife care network said only four oily birds had been found so far one suffered chronic injuries and had to be euthanized he said it s much better than we had feared he said at a news conference monday cautiously optimistic ziccardi said he s cautiously optimistic but it s too soon to know the extent of the spill s effect on wildlife in other offshore oil spills the largest number of oiled birds have been collected two to five days after the incident he said amplify operates three oil platforms about 9 miles off the coast of california all installed between 1980 and 1984 the company also operates a 16 inch pipeline that carries oil from a processing platform to an onshore storage facility in long beach the company has said the oil appears to be coming from a rupture in that pipeline about four miles from the platform before the spill amplify had high hopes for the beta oil field and was pouring millions of dollars into upgrades and new side track projects that would tap into oil by drilling laterally we have the opportunity to keep going for as long as we want amplify ceo martyn willsher said in an august conference call with investors he added there was a capacity for up to 20 000 barrels a day investors shared willsher s optimism sending the company s stock up more than sevenfold since the beginning of the year to 5 75 at the close of trading on friday the stock plunged more than 40 in morning trading monday the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and emerged a few months later it had been using cash generated by the beta field and others in oklahoma and texas to pay down 235 million in debt some residents business owners and environmentalists questioned whether authorities reacted quickly enough to contain the spill people who live and work in the area said they noticed an oil sheen and a heavy petroleum smell friday evening booms were deployed on the ocean surface sunday to try to contain the oil while divers sought to determine where and why the leak occurred on land there was a race to find animals harmed by the oil and to keep the spill from harming any more sensitive marshland but it was not until saturday afternoon that the coast guard said an oil slick had been spotted and a unified command established to respond and it took until saturday night for the company to shut down the pipeline rick torgerson owner of blue star yacht charter said on friday evening people were emailing and the neighbors were asking do you smell that by saturday morning boats were returning to the marina with their hulls covered in oil he said garry brown president of the environmental group orange county coastkeeper decried a lack of initial coordination among the coast guard and local officials in dealing with the spreading oil slick by the time it comes to the beach it s done tremendous damage our frustration is it could have been averted if there was a quick response said brown who lives in huntington beach some of the oil washed up on the shores of orange county the city and state beaches at huntington beach were closed and late sunday the city of laguna beach just to the south said its beaches also were closed huntington beach mayor kim carr said the beaches of the community nicknamed surf city could remain closed for weeks or even months the oil created a miles wide sheen in the ocean and washed ashore in sticky black globules in a year that has been filled with incredibly challenging issues this oil spill constitutes one of the most devastating situations that our community has dealt with in decades carr said we are doing everything in our power to protect the health and safety of our residents our visitors and our natural habitats amplify ceo martyn willsher said the pipeline and the company s three platforms were shut down saturday night the 17 5 mile pipeline that is 80 to 100 feet below the surface was suctioned out so no more oil would spill while the location of the leak was being investigated crews led by the coast guard deployed skimmers laid some 3 700 feet of floating barriers known as booms to try to stop more oil from seeping into areas including talbert marsh a 25 acre wetland officials said the oil will likely continue to wash up on the shore for several days and could affect newport beach and other nearby communities officials said the spill comes three decades after a massive oil leak hit the same stretch of orange county coast on feb 7 1990 the oil tanker american trader ran over its anchor off huntington beach spilling nearly 417 000 gallons of crude fish and about 3 400 birds were killed in 2015 a ruptured pipeline north of santa barbara sent 143 000 gallons of crude oil gushing onto refugio state beach the area affected by the latest spill is home to threatened and endangered species including a plump shorebird called the snowy plover the california least tern and humpback whales

f or much of the past half decade the operative word in the energy sector was abundance an industry that had long sought to ration the production of fossil fuels to keep prices high suddenly found itself swamped with oversupply as america s shale boom lowered the price of oil around the world and clean energy sources such as wind and solar competed with other fuels used for power generation such as coal and natural gas listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element in recent weeks however it is a shortage of energy rather than an abundance of it that has caught the world s attention on the surface its manifestations are mostly unconnected britain s miffed motorists are suffering from a shortage of lorry drivers to deliver petrol power cuts in parts of china partly stem from the country s attempts to curb emissions dwindling coal stocks at power stations in india are linked to a surge in the price of imports of the commodity yet an underlying factor is expected to worsen the scarcity in the next few years a slump in investment in oil wells natural gas hubs and coal mines this is partly a hangover from the period of abundance with years of overinvestment giving rise to more capital discipline it is also the result of growing pressures to decarbonise this year the investment shortfall is one of the main reasons prices of all three energy commodities have soared european gas prices though volatile were near record highs as the economist went to press oil crossed 81 a barrel after the organisation of the petroleum exporting countries opec and producers such as russia who are part of the opec alliance resisted calls to raise output at a meeting on october 4th the potentially inflationary upheaval will not be good for a world that still gets most of its energy from fossil fuels but it may at least accelerate the shift to greener and cheaper sources of energy start with oil an industry that needs constant reinvestment just to stand still a rule of thumb is that oil companies are supposed to allocate about four fifths of their capital expenditure each year just to stopping their level of reserves from being depleted yet annual investment by the industry has fallen from 750bn in 2014 when oil prices were above 100 a barrel to an estimated 350bn this year reckons saad rahim of trafigura a commodity trader analysts at goldman sachs a bank say that over the same period the number of years worth of current production held in reserves in some of the world s biggest projects has fallen from 50 to about 25 a supply crunch was averted last year because the covid 19 pandemic clobbered oil demand but once the world economy started to recover it was only a matter of time before a squeeze started to emerge the industry would usually respond to robust demand and higher prices by investing to drill more oil but that is harder in an era of decarbonisation for a start big private sector oil companies such as exxonmobil and royal dutch shell are being pressed by investors to treat oil and gas investments like week old fish that is either because their shareholders reckon that demand for oil will eventually peak making long term projects uneconomic or because they prefer to hold stakes in companies that support the transition to clean energy even though prices are rising investment in oil shows no sign of picking up the economist has looked at capital spending forecasts for american and european commodity producers in 2021 and 2022 compared with 2019 whereas mining firms predict big increases in capital expenditure energy investment is expected to fall sharply oil firms are instead giving excess cash back to shareholders another factor inhibiting oil investment is the behaviour of opec countries the half decade of relatively low prices during the age of abundance which reached its nadir with a price collapse at the start of the pandemic gutted state coffers that cut funding for investment as prices recover governments priority is not to expand oil production capacity but to shore up national budgets moreover state run producers are cautious worried that a new flare up of covid 19 cases could hit demand again and as oswald clint of bernstein an investment firm puts it many are wondering why not just ride this high price for a while in any case even if the rally were eventually to inspire investment it would take several years to meaningfully raise production lower investment in oil has a spillover effect on the output of natural gas which is often a by product of drilling for crude added to that is a dearth of liquefied natural gas lng terminals for shipping gas from places where it remains relatively easy to access america to those where it is scarcer asia and europe given the long time it takes to build facilities the lack of spare terminal capacity in america is expected to last at least until 2025 investment in thermal coal is weakest of all even in china and india which are planning new coal fired power plants the mood has swung against the dirtiest fossil fuel because of both its carbon emissions and its effect on air quality yet with demand likely to be pushed up as china potentially heads into a cold winter and with india struggling with supplies coal may be in the throes of its last hurrah all this places fossil fuel producers in something of a bind a slump in investment could enable some oil gas and coal investors to make out like bandits but the longer prices stay high the more likely it becomes that the transition to clean energy ultimately buries the fossil fuel industry consumers in the meantime must brace for more shortages the age of abundance is dead for more expert analysis of the biggest

at the turnoff four workers with coastal gaslink security gather in orange and yellow vests their voices edged with frustration as they talk above four idling pickup trucks that release a haze of exhaust into the early morning light another pickup faces off against the group blocking access to the rough and muddy spur road that leads to the pipeline worksite it s a scene that has played out every day for the past week and a half on wet suwet en territory as land defenders block pipeline workers from accessing a site where coastal gaslink is preparing to drill under the morice river and install the pipeline on sept 24 protesters used coastal gaslink s own machinery to dig up the rough resource road that connects this junction to a worksite two kilometres beyond a camp was established at the site and a school bus used to block access the school bus has since been removed twice by rcmp and coastal gaslink before being returned to its place in the road which has been roughly repaired by the pipeline company known to the wet suwet en as wedzin kwa the morice river becomes the bulkley eventually flowing into the skeena river at hazelton it s a major artery through the territory and source of sustenance and tradition for the nation as well as the territorial boundary between the gidimt en clan s cas yikh house and the unist ot en a house group belonging to gilseyhu clan according to molly wickham a cas yikh house member whose wet suwet en name is sleydo it was never a question of whether they would fight to protect wedzin kwa only a question of when it s always been about wedzin kwa she says everything that s happened up until now has been about wedzin kwa the current standoff takes place 63 kilometres down the morice west forest service road south of houston b c the site of two past police actions in early 2019 rcmp arrested 14 people including wickham when they raided a roadblock at kilometre 44 where members of the gidimt en clan had erected a camp to re occupy the land and keep pipeline workers out a year later in february 2020 four camps along the morice were raided after coastal gaslink was granted a permanent injunction to continue its work on wet suwet en territory the final day of arrests took place at the unist ot en healing centre just a few kilometres from the current roadblock where wet suwet en resistance to pipelines began more than a decade ago in total 28 people were arrested over five days seven of them at the healing centre police have already arrested two people in the latest standoff but today the camp and blockade two kilometres beyond the turnoff from the forest service road are quiet it s the first day that rcmp haven t arrived to read the injunction or threaten arrests and the land defenders busy themselves working on projects around the camp as a raven hops brazenly nearby the inquisitive tilt of its head appearing to ask what s for breakfast the camp has been established on a muddy site intended as a helipad next to coastal gaslink s right of way the pipeline route which the company says is more than 90 per cent cleared through this section extends 670 kilometres from northeast b c to kitimat where it will connect with lng canada s processing and export facility it s only by walking the right of way to where clearing stops about a kilometre below camp that you hear wedzin kwa gurgling beyond here the 30 metre wide route expands several times over its surface scraped bare and mud threatening to consume a rubber boot deer and bear have left their marks in its surface it s here that coastal gaslink plans to stage its drilling operation the vast expanse of muck a holding area for lengths of 48 inch pipe slash piles and dirt mounds tower several times the height of a person an abandoned bulldozer sits idly nearby a sign reading active work site appearing to mock the scene where the clearing ends a narrow trail begins it leads to wedzin kwa where the river s edge is quiet continuing as it has for millennia a pair of seagulls dip and dive over the river that s our main river wedzin kwa that s where our salmon are hereditary chief na moks john ridsdale says about the river s significance as a food source and lifeblood for the nation we re the wet suwet en this is who we are the land the air and the water in its 135 kilometre journey through the skeena watershed the pipeline route crosses 206 watercourses according to a technical data report submitted as part of its 2014 environmental assessment application tributaries that offer vital spawning habitat for salmon this stretch of river below morice lake wedzin bin supports important chinook salmon spawning and holding areas according to the data report pink coho and sockeye salmon are also found here and steelhead and bull trout use the river on their way to spawning channels upstream these areas and other accessible tributaries also provide critical rearing and overwintering habitat for juvenile salmon and resident char and trout the report says the report indicates there is no low risk period for working within the waterways salmon occupy wedzin kwa up to 11 months of the year and other species fill the mid summer gap when fry have left their spawning ground in spring and the return of salmon in late summer there are fish of one species or another that are in that waterway at all times of the year says michael price a fisheries biologist and researcher with simon fraser university who co authored a sockeye recovery plan with the office of the wet suwet en price says sockeye returns in wedzin kwa plummeted in the mid 20th century from an estimated 70 000 a year to an all time low of about 1 000 in the mid 1950s work to recover salmon populations has been ongoing for more than 50 years with moderate success by the early 2000s returns appeared to rebound levelling off at between 10 000 and 20 000 returning sockeye each year still well below historic numbers but even as the nation in partnership with fisheries and oceans canada works on a strategy to rebuild salmon stocks industry continues to impact salmon habitat this spring wickham says the river s silty runoff season when people avoid drinking its water lasted several months instead of the usual several weeks she suspects it was the result of industrial logging in the watershed trenching through creeks and streams in preparation to lay pipe beneath the riverbed will likely also release silt and sand into the waterway my biggest fear is that we re never going to be able to drink from wedzin kwa again and that it will impact spawning salmon wickham says price says the continued effects on the watershed things like habitat destruction overfishing and climate change act as a death by a thousand cuts fish need cold clean contaminant free water whenever you have industrial projects that take place in or near water there s a high potential for damage he says i m amazed that a project like this has been allowed to go ahead given that there s at least one endangered population of salmon up there there s a rebuilding plan that fisheries and oceans was part of and we can t even stop an industrial project like this from taking place in an email to the tyee coastal gaslink says it s not required to limit work on river crossings to least risk windows june and july under its environmental assessment application if it s using trenchless crossings where a tunnel is bored below the river rather than disturbing the riverbed the company says its plans to use micro tunnelling which uses a hydraulic jack to force pipe into the ground behind the boring machine is the most precise and state of the art drilling method available the almost 900 metre span is expected to take 10 months to complete the company says it did not respond to the tyee s question about how deep the drilling would go this is the only trenchless crossing in wet suwet en territory nothing like that s ever happened along that river system ever chief na moks says about the company s plans to drill under wedzin kwa he says something as simple as a bridge constructed over a river can be enough to keep salmon from migrating upstream a hereditary chief recently met with the bc oil and gas commission and ministry of energy and mines to request a moratorium on the drilling he says when asked about the request the oil and gas commission says that any changes in the project s timeline are up to coastal gaslink if they destroy this they re wiping us off this territory read more it s unlikely that coastal gaslink would voluntarily agree to further delays the project has been plagued with cost overruns and setbacks largely due to protests and the pandemic the delays have led to tensions with lng canada with drilling already a year behind schedule wickham speculates the company is feeling anxious to regain access and begin the work they cannot afford this conflict or any delays she says wickham says the land defenders ability to delay the project is a testament to the strength of these occupations which have been backed by hereditary chiefs from all five wet suwet en clans and sends a cautionary tale to industry attempting to work in indigenous territories without explicit consent what happens here is going to set a precedent for all other industries that want to trespass on our land without free prior and informed consent from our hereditary governance system wickham says industry needs free prior and informed consent from indigenous people coastal gaslink spills more contaminants in wet suwet en territory read more coastal gaslink did not address the tyee s questions about the delays project timelines or how significant the current setback is for the project saying only that progress continues with almost 50 per cent of construction complete it has already done five trenchless crossings of other rivers it says back at the turnoff the workers who say they are with coastal gaslink security have hung an orange shirt from a pylon next to the road on the eve of canada s first reconciliation day the symbol recognizes indigenous children who were forcibly taken from their families many of whom died at residential schools when approached the workers pull out video cameras and decline to answer questions a fifth man arrives in another pickup wearing an identical orange t shirt when asked about the shirt s message his response is brisk to show our support for the missing children he says edging toward his vehicle as he speaks we all have children and we all know that s why we re doing it just to show support the man declines to give his name back at camp wickham is thinking about her own children and their future here on the territory it s been a week in camp and she doesn t know when she ll see her family it all seems really crazy she acknowledges recalling a recent moment when she left her cabin in the dead of night as she stared into the darkness her headlamp beam caught the nearby right of way its trees razed by machinery and i was like no that s crazy she says i feel like it s so normalized to see the destruction of the land that it doesn t feel absurd to people what we re doing should be normal and destruction of the land should not be what seems normal

of 18 7 million or 35 7 versus 52 2 million in the prior year period the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to 40 volume growth which compares to 15 volume growth in the prior year period this was partially offset by 4 6 mix contribution as our leading decoy and duckhorn vineyard winery brands outpaced the rest of the portfolio and wholesale to distributor sales growth exceeded the growth of our california direct to retail and dtc channels on a like for like basis pricing changes were immaterial to our results gross profit was 34 4 million an increase of 8 5 million or 32 7

increase of 8 2 million or 30 9 versus the prior year period total selling general and administrative expenses were 24 4 million an increase of 8 2 million or 50 6 versus 16 2 million in the prior year period the increase was primarily attributed to a 2 1 million increase in incentive costs resulting from the company s strong performance 1 7 million in transaction expenses primarily related to the company s ipo in the previous fiscal quarter an additional 1 7 million related to public company costs namely professional fees and d o insurance which were not present in the prior year quarter and 0 8 million in higher equity based compensation net income was 7 4 million or 0 06 per diluted share versus 2 7 million or 0 03 per diluted share in the prior year period adjusted net income was 9 2 million or 0 08 per diluted share versus 7 4 million or 0 07 per diluted share in the prior year period the increases to adjusted net income and eps were due to higher net sales lower interest expense and lower depreciation expense partially offset by negative mix contribution due to brand and channel mix increases in direct selling expenses generally in line with net sales growth during the period as well as public company costs adjusted ebitda was 18 4 million an increase of 0 6 million or 3 4 versus 17 8 million in the prior year period the increase was largely driven by higher net sale volume partially offset by the aforementioned increases in incentive costs transaction expenses primarily related to the company s ipo and ongoing public company costs fiscal year 2022 guidance ryan continued as we enter our first full fiscal year as a public company we are introducing initial guidance that we view as thoughtful and well calibrated for the currently fluid operating environment we remain confident in our ability to continue to well outperform the market and we look forward to continuing to build upon our legacy as the standard for american fine wine and long term value creation for all stakeholders in fiscal 2022 we expect to deliver adjusted eps between 0 54 and 0 57 per diluted share versus fiscal 2021 adjusted eps of 0 58 per diluted share note the provided annual range is negatively impacted by an increase in weighted average share count of approximately nine million shares or 8 on a year over year basis a function of timing related to the company s third quarter fiscal 2021 ipo on a comparative basis fiscal 2022 will also include a full year of public company costs whereas fiscal 2021 results only include a partial year of public company costs accordingly the company views it as useful to consider these factors in evaluating our operating performance year over year on a like for like basis the guidance range provided for fiscal 2022 adjusted eps of 0 54 to 0 57 is comparable to what would be an adjusted eps of 0 52 per share in fiscal 2021 if that year had been burdened by a full year of public company costs and assuming a diluted share count consistent with our guidance for fiscal 2022 the following table provides the company s guidance range for fiscal year 2022 millions except per share data and percentages fiscal

additions in accounts payable and accrued expenses 1 369 3 081 the duckhorn portfolio inc reconciliation of non gaap financial measures adjusted gross profit adjusted net income adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps collectively referred to as non gaap financial measures are commonly used in the company s industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income or earnings per share as indicators of operating performance as determined in accordance with gaap these non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the company has included these non gaap financial measures because it believes the measures provide management and investors with additional information to evaluate business performance in comparison to budgets forecasts and prior year financial results non gaap financial measures are adjusted to exclude certain items that affect comparability the adjustments are itemized in the tables below you are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reason the company considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis in evaluating adjustments you should be aware that in the future the company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments set forth below the presentation of non gaap financial measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or recurring items adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that the company calculates as net income before interest taxes depreciation and amortization non cash equity based compensation expense purchase accounting adjustments casualty losses or gains impairment losses changes in the fair value of derivatives and certain other items which are not related to our core operating performance adjusted ebitda is a key performance measure the company uses in evaluating its operational results the company believes adjusted ebitda is a helpful measure to provide investors an understanding of how management regularly monitors the company s core operating performance as well as how management makes operational and strategic decisions in allocating resources the company believes adjusted ebitda also provides management and investors consistency and comparability with the company s past financial performance and facilitates period to period comparisons of operations as it eliminates the effects of certain variations unrelated to its overall performance adjusted ebitda has certain limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company s results as reported under gaap some of these limitations include although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for the company s working capital needs adjusted ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the company s debt adjusted ebitda does not reflect income tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to the company and other companies including companies in the company s industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently which reduce their usefulness as comparative measures because of these limitations you should consider adjusted ebitda alongside other financial performance measures including net income and the company s other gaap results in evaluating adjusted ebitda you should be aware that in the future the company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation the company s presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that the company s future results will be unaffected by the types of items excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda adjusted gross profit adjusted gross profit is a non gaap financial measure that the company calculates as gross profit excluding the impact of purchase accounting adjustments including depreciation and amortization related to purchase accounting and bulk wine losses we believe adjusted gross profit is a useful measure to us and our investors to assist in evaluating our operating performance because it provides consistency and direct comparability with our past financial performance between fiscal periods as the metric eliminates the effects of non cash or other expenses unrelated to our core operating performance that would result in fluctuations in a given metric for reasons unrelated to overall continuing operating performance adjusted gross profit should not be considered a substitute for gross profit or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap adjusted net income adjusted net income is a non gaap financial measure that the company calculates as net income excluding the impact of non cash equity based compensation expense purchase accounting adjustments casualty losses or gains impairment losses changes in the fair value of derivatives and certain other items unrelated to core operating performance as well as the estimated income tax impacts of all such adjustments included in this non gaap performance measure we believe adjusted net income assists us and our investors in evaluating our performance period over period in calculating adjusted net income we also calculate the following non gaap financial measures which adjust each gaap based financial measure for the relevant portion of each adjustment to reach adjusted net income adjusted net sales calculated as net sales excluding the impact of purchase accounting and bulk wine losses calculated as net sales excluding the impact of purchase accounting and bulk wine losses adjusted sg a calculated as selling general and administrative expenses excluding the impacts of purchase accounting transaction expenses equity based compensation and covid 19 costs calculated as selling general and administrative expenses excluding the impacts of purchase accounting transaction expenses equity based

adjusted net income should not be considered a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap adjusted eps adjusted eps is a non gaap financial measure that the company calculates as adjusted net income divided by diluted share count for the applicable period we believe adjusted eps is useful to us and our investors because it improves comparability of results of operations from period to period adjusted eps should not be considered a substitute for net income per share or any other measure of financial performance reported

huntington beach calif ap officials investigating one of california s largest oil spills are looking into whether a ship s anchor may have struck a pipeline on the ocean floor causing a major leak of crude into coastal waters and fouling beaches authorities said monday the head of the company that operates the pipeline said company divers were inspecting the area of the suspected leak and he expected to have a much better idea what caused the damage within a day an anchor striking the pipeline is one of the distinct possibilities behind the leak amplify energy ceo martyn willsher told a news conference he said divers have examined more than 8 000 feet 2 438 meters of pipe and were focusing on one area of significant interest cargo ships entering the twin ports of los angeles and long beach routinely pass through the area coast guard officials said we re looking into if it could have been an anchor from a ship but that s in the assessment phase right now coast guard lt cmdr jeannie shaye said the spill sent up to 126 000 gallons 572 807 liters of heavy crude into the ocean contaminating the sands of famed huntington beach and other coastal communities the spill could keep beaches closed for weeks or longer the orange county district attorney todd spitzer said he has investigators looking into whether he can bring state charges for the spill spitzer said his jurisdiction ends 3 miles offshore spitzer also said amplify s divers should not be allowed near the pipeline without an independent authority alongside them other potential criminal investigations were being pursued by the u s attorney s office for the central district of california the coast guard and the california department of fish and wildlife officials said safety advocates have pushed for years for federal rules that would strengthen oil spill detection requirements and force companies to install valves that can automatically shut down the flow of crude in case of a leak the oil and pipeline industries have resisted such requirements because of the high cost if the operator had more valves installed on this line they d have a much better chance at having the point of failure isolated by now said bill caram with the pipeline safety trust an organization based in bellingham washington the pipeline was built using a process known as electric resistance weld according to a regulatory filing from the company that welding process has been linked to past oil pipeline failures because corrosion can occur along seams according to government safety advisories and pipeline safety trust director bill caram environmentalists had feared the oil might devastate birds and marine life in the area but michael ziccardi a veterinarian and director of the oiled wildlife care network said only four oily birds had been found so far one suffered chronic injuries and had to be euthanized he said it s much better than we had feared he said at a news conference monday ziccardi said he s cautiously optimistic but it s too soon to know the extent of the spill s effect on wildlife in other offshore oil spills the largest number of oiled birds have been collected two to five days after the incident he said amplify operates three oil platforms about 9 miles 14 5 kilometers off the coast of california all installed between 1980 and 1984 the company also operates a 16 inch pipeline that carries oil from a processing platform to an onshore storage facility in long beach the company has said the oil appears to be coming from a rupture in that pipeline about 4 miles 6 44 kilometers from the platform in a 2016 spill response plan submitted to federal regulators the company said its worst case spill scenario was based on the assumption of a full guillotine cut of the pipeline occurring 3 miles inland from one of its platforms but an outside consultant concluded that a spill of that size was very unlikely at that location because the line is 120 feet deep and beneath a shipping lane where ships do not normally anchor the beta oil field has been owned by at least seven different corporations since it was discovered by royal dutch shell in 1976 records show a corporate predecessor of amplify bought the operation in 2012 the amplify subsidiary known as beta operating co has been cited 125 times for safety and environmental violations since 1980 according to a database from the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement the federal agency that regulates the offshore oil and gas industry the online database provides only the total number of violations not the details for each incident the company was fined a total of 85 000 for three incidents two were from 2014 when a worker who was not wearing proper protective equipment was shocked with 98 000 volts of electricity the worker survived in a separate incident crude oil was released through a boom where a safety device had been improperly bypassed in 1999 a 1 8 mile undersea pipeline running between two platforms sprang two leaks totaling at least 3 800 gallons of oil causing tar balls to wash up on beaches in orange county the cause of of the leaks was determined to be corrosion that caused pin sized holes in the steel walls of the pipeline the owner of the oil field at the time a partnership between mobil oil corp and shell oil co called aera energy llc was fined 48 000 by federal regulators a penalty environmental groups criticized as a slap on the wrist before the spill amplify had high hopes for the beta oil field and was pouring millions of dollars into upgrades and new side track projects that would tap into oil by drilling laterally we have the opportunity to keep going for as long as we want willsher said in an august conference call with investors he added there was capacity up to 20 000 barrels a day investors shared willsher s optimism sending the company s stock up more than sevenfold since the beginning of the year to 5 75 at the close of trading on friday the stock plunged more than 40 in morning trading monday the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and emerged a few months later it had been using cash generated by the beta field and others in oklahoma and texas to pay down 235 million in debt associated press writers michael biesecker in washington bernard condon in new york felicia fonseca in phoenix julie walker in

as a debt ceiling standoff heats up on capitol hill some democrats are floating out there alternatives such as a 1 trillion coin to avert a fiscal crisis and are planning how congress can avoid another debt limit fight in the future numerous times in recent days house speaker nancy pelosi questioned why the debt limit system is structured so that congress has to take action on the debt ceiling the 14th amendment says the full faith and credit of the united states of america shall not be in doubt for some reason we ve put ourselves in a situation to vote on this each year pelosi said in a press conference last week we ll have to examine that process pelosi also told reporters that while the current standoff has to be solved with congressional action the democratic caucus is exploring ways to avoid falling into a future political stalemate with the credit of the united states in the balance that s up to mcconnell biden to speak with republicans for first time on raising debt ceiling she mentioned a bill from democratic rep brendan boyle and house budget committee chairman john yarmuth of kentucky that would transfer authority over setting the debt limit to the treasury secretary which pelosi called an excellent idea boyle has also proposed eliminating the debt ceiling altogether since hardly any other western countries have a similar system there are others jerold nadler wants to have a coin a trillion dollar coin pelosi said referring to the new york democrat who is chairman of the house judiciary committee that doesn t require congressional approval so we ve talked about an array of things the unconventional idea to exploit a quirk in federal law to address the debt limit without wading through a divided congress first popped up around a decade ago a few sentences of the law passed in the 1990s authorize the treasury secretary to mint platinum coins aiming to give coin collectors better access to platinum u s coins but the language of the statute allows the treasury secretary to mint coins of any quantities denominations and inscriptions as the secretary in the secretary s discretion may prescribe from time to time some thinkers toyed with the idea as a solution for debt ceiling standoffs in 2011 and 2013 simply mint a trillion dollar coin or several of them nadler explained the concept to the washington examiner you mint the coin platinum because of everything else you say it s a trillion dollars you put it in the treasury and you can borrow against that trillion dollars and that eliminates that debt limit just eliminates it so you don t have to worry about voting in congress but nadler does not have all of the nitty gritty details about the coin worked out asked whose face he would like to see on a trillion dollar coin nadler said i don t care it s irrelevant other scholars argue that the 14th amendment may authorize the president to continue borrowing money without the thumbs up from congress one section says that the validity of the public debt of the united states authorized by law including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion shall not be questioned the white house has reportedly circulated memos about possible debt limit workarounds in the event that congress does not take action in time such as continuing to make debt payments while pointing to the 14th amendment or even the 1 trillion coin idea but the executive branch has publicly shut down doing anything without congress we obviously look at a range of options and none of those options were viable either because they wouldn t be accepted by the federal reserve by the guidance of our treasury secretary or just by legal restrictions white house press secretary jen psaki told reporters monday senate minority leader mitch mcconnell is at the center of the debt ceiling fight taking place in congress this week he thinks the limit should be increased but wants democrats to do it themselves mcconnell warned democrats for months that republicans will not vote to increase the debt ceiling so long as democrats pursue their go it alone budget reconciliation spending bill of up to 3 5 trillion last week republicans did block raising the debt ceiling president joe biden and senate majority leader chuck schumer on monday urged mcconnell not to block a procedural vote on the debt ceiling and allow democrats to raise the limit themselves without forcing them to go through the same kind of longer budget reconciliation process that they are utilizing to pass their sweeping social spending plan schumer has rejected that plan saying that he wants to send a debt limit increase to biden this week treasury secretary janet yellen warned congress that unless it takes action before oct 18 the u s will no longer pay its debts causing irreparable damage to the u s economy and global financial markets senate majority whip dick durbin on monday floated eliminating the ability to filibuster debt ceiling votes though that change could not be made for this current fight the idea that you can filibuster the debt ceiling is an outrage durbin told reporters that to me discredits the argument that the filibuster is in fact the way to get bipartisanship baloney click here to read more from the washington examiner eliminating the debt ceiling is unlikely to get support from republicans who both fear an out of control debt and see an opportunity to use debt ceiling votes as leverage or to make a political point so we can just spend more and more house minority leader kevin mccarthy said last week when the washington examiner asked about democrats considering eliminating the debt ceiling it s interesting to me that the credit cards are completely maxed out and the answer the democrats have is not to find a way to pay them off but find a way to get another credit card and get a higher limit

before 5pm on monday users were able to access facebook and instagram from late on monday evening while whatsapp said just after midnight its services were slowly and carefully being restored at 3 30am whatsapp confirmed its services were back and running at 100 security experts speculated the problem came following network changes with the cause still unconfirmed we re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products we re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and we apologize for any inconvenience facebook facebook october 4 2021 adam leon smith of bcs the chartered institute for it and a software testing expert said the outage is caused by changes made to the facebook network infrastructure many of the recent high profile outages have been caused by similar network level events it is reported by unidentified facebook sources on reddit that the network changes have also prevented engineers from remotely connecting to resolve the issues delaying resolution notably many organisations now define their physical infrastructure as code but most do not apply the same level of testing rigour when they change that code as they would when changing their core business logic tens of thousands reported issues within an hour of the outage dominic lipinski pa however cyber security specialist jake moore said there is a chance the issue could be related to a cyber attack he told the pa news agency there have been many reports and i m struggling to find out exactly what has happened i m reading it could be dns related which means there is an issue with the connection not knowing where to go to your device it could well be a human error or a software bug lurking in the shadows but whatever it is facebook needs to do its best to mitigate the problem of causing more panic about this the biggest problem is fears over a cyber attack but as we saw from fastly in the summer i would hedge my bets on that not being the case as we re talking about one of the biggest companies in the world but there s always a chance instagram and friends are having a little bit of a hard time right now and you may be having issues using them bear with us we re on it instagramdown instagram comms instagramcomms october 4 2021 the new york times reported the issue likely stemmed from a misconfiguration of facebook s server computers which were

gambit president biden is laying the groundwork to blame senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky if the country defaults on its debt for the first time in u s history biden singled out mcconnell on monday for the gop leader s insistence that democrats raise the federal borrowing limit on their own continued efforts to block bipartisan legislation on the debt ceiling the president argued would make republicans responsible for the financial consequences making the stakes clear biden told reporters after his speech he cannot guarantee that the u s will be able to pay its bills past oct 18 if gop senators are unwilling to clear a path to keep the country solvent i cannot believe that will be the end result because the consequences are so dire he said but can i guarantee it if i could i would but i can t welp we ve got more here the context the u s is on track to default on the national debt by oct 18 the date at which treasury secretary janet yellen said the government will run out of the cash and accounting measures necessary to stay solvent while republicans voted to raise the debt ceiling three times under former president trump they ve blocked several democratic attempts to do so gop senators have vowed to block any democratic attempt to raise the debt ceiling unless it comes through the budget reconciliation process the vehicle for biden s multi trillion dollar social services and climate bill that process allows for the legislation to pass with a simple majority meaning democrats don t need any gop support in a monday letter to biden released shortly before the president s remarks mcconnell reiterated the gop s months long position republicans position is simple we have no list of demands for two and a half months we have simply warned that since your party wishes to govern alone it must handle the debt limit alone as well why some budget veterans are worried democrats and republicans have faced off over the federal debt limit for decades and have never allowed the u s to default due to the dire implications but the gop s unwillingness to even consider voting for a debt limit increase has alarmed budget experts and capitol hill veterans involved in past standoffs i ve dealt with the debt limit many times before when i was up there for some reason this one has me more scared than any other said bill hoagland senior vice president at the bipartisan policy center who spent almost three decades as a high ranking senate gop budget aide mcconnell has won he continued with all due respect to the minority leader you re not being internally consistent all you said was all we want is 51 votes then don t set up a hurdle of 60 votes read more on the fight over the debt limit mcconnell respectfully tells biden it s time for democrats to

the polls and facing a quagmire over the debt ceiling and how to get a bipartisan infrastructure bill and a reconciliation package through congress he spent last week largely out of the public eye as the white house navigated a battle between centrists and liberals in the democratic party but the president will now take a more active role in front of the cameras as he seeks to unify the party pass

i t s a quarter past noon on a wednesday at an indiana university at bloomington cafeteria and if you want a burger in the next hour you re probably out of luck help wanted signs hang around wright eatery a popular spot among freshmen several staff members are behind the counter at the burger station flipping patties scooping tater tots and placing foil wrapped meals on a counter for customers to pick up no one s taking in person orders instead students tap their smartphones to order on grubhub there are 74 orders in the queue a quarter pounder with cheddar cheese is expected to take between 58 and 68 minutes waits are one problem edibility is another on instagram and tiktok students share photos of undercooked meat bugs in salads and a blackened patty sandwiched between raw onions and a thin bun sometimes dining stations are closed which has angered students and their families it has been hard for many to count on three square meals a day from the campus colleges across the country are seeing similar stories play out as they scale up in person operations after a year of reduced capacity supply chains and labor markets are stressed reflecting local national and global issues that have crept onto the quad the universities of wyoming and michigan are down bus drivers and duke university closed a recreational center through 2021 students meanwhile expect their campuses to have snapped back to normal higher education doesn t always like to think of itself as a business but when it comes to housing and dining its students are more like customers those amenities are part of the sales pitch and they account for a significant amount of revenue across the country though colleges are struggling to keep up their end of the deal with students indiana s freshmen are required by the university to buy meal plans which cost between 3 800 and 4 800 for the academic year what students get in return they say is a university that over promises and under delivers advertisement the last thing in the world i thought my daughter was going to have to worry about was where to find food erin burger told the chronicle adding that her freshman daughter is eating about one decent meal on campus each day this is the bare minimum we re turning our kids over to you we re putting them in your hands tensions grew to the point that iu dining held an online town hall in september with hundreds of frustrated customers five administrators fielded concerns and answered questions for about an hour where can students find information on dining check instagram why are grubhub orders canceled up to an hour after being placed we re working on it are reports of food poisoning being addressed so far there are no findings to support that what about undercooked food our health inspection team makes rounds regularly a long wait for a burger isn t the fault of one dining hall one warehouse one driver s route or one vendor the stressed system hits roadblocks and often gets through them every day but the mismatch between expectations and reality is driving tempers high students and their families wonder shouldn t colleges have prepared better before they took our money yes an administrator in a limestone building in bloomington could have had clearer foresight especially because the university knew a record number of first time students enrolled at the campus this fall but that wouldn t have entirely sped up the burger line the full answer for higher education s stop start semester is more complicated it touches everything from the plastic casing holding the patties to the speed of companies conducting background checks and even federal debates on the minimum wage it all starts in the rolling hills of birdseye ind 80 miles south of campus advertisement d ave fischer is driving his suburban down a narrow road that cuts through the green acreage of his farm which has been in his family since the late 1800s as he drives past black and brown cattle in open fields he explains the schedule of growing and harvesting food for the livestock but the business today doesn t just sell beef it also distributes pork eggs maple syrup and other goods from nearby farmers demand for those products is high partly that s because of indiana university which is the farm s biggest customer said joseph fischer the sales manager and dave s son not only is bloomington s enrollment up but the campus is also using fischer farms products in more dining halls joseph said the thin burgers that the farm produces are a staple on campus the cattle are slaughtered and in a processing center adjacent to the fischer farms office a machine stamps out the patties one at a time the beef is packaged and then in a 38 degree storage room sorted into boxes for campus kitchens iu s orders can account for up to 30 percent of the farm s sales but the campus s huge orders have brought challenges to fischer s business to meet the demand the farm had to hire a delivery driver for the bloomington campus new employees in order fulfillment handle the extra volume too they were brought on in a tight labor market dave fischer said and salaries are about 5 per hour more than usual and of course the pandemic poses its own operational challenges in the fall a few butchers contracted covid 19 and couldn t come into work joseph fischer said that meant that fewer cattle could be processed at a time for several weeks when the fischer farms delivery driver came to pick up the meat products that were headed to indiana university not everything was ready so the driver would take a partial order to bloomington in the morning which left either joseph fischer or his grandparents having to make another three hour round trip to campus with the rest of the goods later in the day advertisement if a supply chain is a series of interconnected links then a glitch or adjustment in one spot can cause ripple effects up and down the line joseph fischer knows that the stakes are high students need to eat one student is his cousin a freshman she told him that she has struggled to get meals between classes because of long lines if you re sending your kid to school he said you want them to be eating well the family has made small adjustments to operations for campus orders for example meat products are generally sealed with an airtight cryovac vacuum before they leave fischer farms now employees stack burger patties in clear bags separated by thin sheets it s easier for campus chefs to get the product out of the packaging and onto the grill on a tuesday afternoon the products going to iu wait on one side of the chilly room where even in mid september employees in warm jackets and winter hats load boxes the next morning the driver will pick up the products and drive them to a central warehouse in bloomington illustrations by jan feindt for the chronicle i n the predawn darkness vehicles pull up to loading docks at a warehouse a few miles from indiana university s iconic sample gates vendors in box trucks and cargo vans unload their goods before pulling away big white trucks operated by the university take their place iu s trucks will pack up food for individual dining halls distributing it across campus the choreography happens every day with routes detailed on a whiteboard inside the warehouse advertisement the warehouse down one staff member compared with before the pandemic stocks far more than just fischer farms patties pallets of nonperishable items coca cola products chex mix eco friendly takeout containers are sorted by the dining hall to which they re headed items are arranged the day before delivery said stewart cutshall the associate director of business operations in a sign of the broader supply chain challenges this semester vendors trucks have shown up in the morning with one or two products missing cutshall said when that happens iu needs to look for a substitute for the dining hall menus typically planned in advance sometimes no substitutes are available say you re in a dining hall and want to wash down your burger with a soda you might walk up to one of the sleek freestyle machines touchscreen dispensers of dozens of products from coca cola the university s exclusive vendor for beverages you would normally be able to choose among 29 types of soda or juice but on a recent day in bloomington just 13 had been stocked the company told the chronicle that it has worked with its supply chain to address challenges brought on by the pandemic and that it is committed to serving customers other parts of the supply chain are getting pinched too two of iu s distributors gordon food service and sysco corp get food from domestic and international suppliers and manufacturers established strategies like forecasting demand based on past patterns have proven unreliable there s challenges in getting the amount we need and understanding what our customers are going to buy said trace ruback gordon food service s director of sales for noncommercial entities which includes hospitals and universities it s more of a scramble at this point to fulfill menu items it s been a scramble since really march 2020 advertisement the vulnerability of the supply chain isn t just about the goods or products being delivered interruptions can be caused by other glitches like broken equipment a custom made alto shaam oven was damaged on the way to campus where it would have been installed in mcnutt a newly renovated dining hall supply chain issues meant that replacing it would have taken 16 weeks instead of less than one the university decided to use a different machine but the equipment was a different size so iu needed to change the physical space to install it the university also had to wait for an inspector which took additional time said lukas leftwich head of residential programs and services that delay served as another reminder the supply chain relies on people to drive trucks stock warehouses and take orders the pandemic pushed many people out of those roles others left to care for family members and some got sick or changed jobs the nation s colleges and universities employed about half the number of food service workers in august relative to the average for that month from 2015 to 2019 according to estimates from the u s department of labor in a recent sec filing sysco pointed to the tight labor market for drivers in particular the company is trying to recruit high school graduates to become warehouse employees and it hopes these people will enroll in a new sysco driver academy sysco is also spending on hiring with referral and retention bonuses advertisement tyson foods one of sysco s suppliers and a major processor of chicken has faced similar challenges absenteeism and turnover have been major problems donnie king tyson s president and chief executive said in an august earnings call in addition to raising wages the company is opening child care facilities and medical clinics at some plants to recruit and retain more staff essentially king said it takes us six days to get five days worth of work i ndiana university isn t immune to the staffing shortages either as the campus returned to in person operations many people quit leftwich said some feared working with tens of thousands of students he said and others may have been driven out by the university s vaccine requirement many people who had worked for decades on campus including in dining retired the gaps they left behind are big the scope of the losses became clear to leftwich as another data point was emerging more new freshmen than ever wanted to become hoosiers the new class in bloomington is about 9 500 according to september estimates the surge followed a year in which the overall student headcount had declined in bloomington advertisement then came another curveball a smaller number of those students wanted to work leftwich said at this point he s not sure why but he ticks off a few ideas perhaps there is a market expectation for a 15 hourly wage thanks to federal advocacy on the topic starting hourly wages in iu dining halls for no experience part time student employees is 10 40 perhaps students want to focus on their education after a long stretch of disrupted learning perhaps they fear getting sick an outside staffing agency was having a real hard time when the university approached it leftwich said the campus has also tried to hire displaced refugees but transportation and visa processing have been issues unlike many other campuses the university does not outsource campus dining to a third party company like sodexo or aramark it also did not furlough dining employees during the pandemic leftwich said in late september a campus spokesman said the university aims to employ 1 200 part time staff members both students and non students and there are about 500 vacancies the full time dining work force is typically about 300 people and there are 83 vacancies each of these people plays a role on campus taking orders washing dishes preparing ingredients the existing staff is stretched thin it s not just in dining advertisements for driving jobs are plastered on university shuttle buses and iu and other big ten universities are struggling to hire live in housing workers typically an entry level position in student affairs leftwich said iu generally hires about 80 percent of the applicants for student resident assistant positions he said but this year the university hired every person who expressed interest some of those who were hired have already left their roles and the university needs to reopen the search process to find more talent leftwich said advertisement another chokepoint when someone applies for a job at iu the university must run a background check but delays at hireright the vendor that iu uses for the service have extended for weeks leftwich said many organizations are hiring increasing demand hireright did not respond to a request for comment the university also faces competition in hiring from restaurants in town in late september in bloomington nearly every restaurant had a sign on the door nick s english hut had changed its hours noodles company would only take online orders we do not have the staff a sign read please be polite to our team as they showed up today to ensure you get your food faster and still hot parents and students wonder why doesn t iu just raise its wages the university is in the final stages of doing so said chuck carney a spokesman but it might not solve the problem leftwich said first city restaurants could bump up their salaries even further to compete against the university where wage data are public and second the managers of hourly employees may feel frustrated that their wages are roughly equivalent he said despite the challenges leftwich said the university brings on a few more staff members every day each time a new person starts the campus examines where plugging them in would yield the most capacity some stations are closed when current staff levels cannot support full operations many people are pitching in beyond their job descriptions one day in late september at the lantern a pan asian inspired restaurant a woman cleaned a countertop it wasn t a new staff member it was rachael mcaleer director of retail dining advertisement t he long wait times for meals this fall have been exacerbated by another culprit grubhub during the pandemic grubhub minimized contact for safe operations students logged on to the application selected from a list of open dining halls and food stations and chose the dish they wanted to eat the application linked to their meal plan told them when the order was ready for pickup several dining locations still use the app and the campus plans to keep it through the academic year the service means that some dining stations do not need to staff cashiers and it s a service that many students continue to want as they ve grown accustomed to the ease of on demand ordering during the pandemic because fewer food stations than anticipated have been open though virtual lines are long at the beginning of the semester the app didn t turn away orders even when hundreds of people had submitted them at once that meant some lines stretched for hours during a september morning even after that problem was fixed an online order for a small black coffee took 40 minutes to be completed a grubhub spokesperson told the chronicle that the company aims to prevent technical issues but when they occur we resolve them quickly and with as little interruption as possible iu has already paid for the service covering the fees that grubhub adds to transactions about a month into the semester hoosier students have patched together workarounds to get food some like jayden mcmullen a sophomore have switched from grubhub to in person ordering which can move faster others like jimmy malony a sophomore place a grubhub order during class knowing it will take time to complete kendal knosp a freshman spends a few hundred dollars a month on groceries in addition to the meal plan so that she can always eat advertisement sometimes students order from a few stations at once and pick up whatever is ready first that means that many completed orders that are paid for are abandoned on countertops never to be eaten a sign announces that after two hours the staff will throw away the food because it s no longer safe to consume the university has taken steps to manage the situation while it is not considering refunds for the semester it has allowed students to downgrade from more expensive plans several dining stations have transitioned from grubhub to in person ordering this fall and campus leaders are trying to nudge students into getting their food at all you can eat dining halls including mcnutt the facility that was just renovated for nearly 24 million there students can order in person not online it takes just minutes to swipe into the facility with its bright lights and high ceilings there you ll find different stations with pre plated ready to eat food like vegetable lo mein mushroom sliders and beef nachos one station serves allergen free food at many stations there s not even an in person line indiana university has lowered some pricing at mcnutt to try to drive traffic to the facility and away from dining halls that still operate using à la carte or grubhub ordering when those virtual lines are long leftwich said students falsely believe food is scarce when there is plenty in other locations but it s unclear how quickly students will take up this new system sophomores spent last year ordering exclusively on grubhub and they have told freshmen that s how things go a survey in early 2021 asked iu students what factors were most important in choosing where to eat quick service was important to more than 85 percent of respondents nearly as many students wanted their food to be customizable and able to be purchased to go only about a third thought an all you can eat dining location was important the fall 2021 semester is neither the fall 2019 semester nor the fall 2020 semester campus leaders staff members and students are creating new patterns and norms every day advertisement some freshmen who spoke to the chronicle said they didn t have time or interest to graze at an all you can eat facility or even wait for food in person one junior colin prince now looks back at his freshman year and wonders how much time he wasted waiting in line in person now he said he can be productive while online food orders are being prepared covid 19 has changed people in other ways too according to campus employees there is less patience for when things go wrong people are quick to post their complaints online eager for sympathy and affirmations from peers instead of filing feedback with staff members one day in september maya warner a freshman bit into an apple that she had ordered to go the flesh was brown and rotten it was the latest frustration she had experienced with grubhub earlier in the week she had waited for an hour only to have her order canceled she posted the photo of the apple on twitter tired of the frequent waits warner now orders a few meals at once to keep food in her dorm for the week she also regularly buys groceries or orders food from local restaurants it s just so frustrating she said to not eat whenever i need to recently she applied to transfer to another college closer to home the dining experience was one big reason why she understands that the campus is short staffed and that enrollment is high and sometimes she feels bad for complaining but the experience has fallen short of what she had anticipated advertisement it s definitely not what i was expecting especially for iu warner said tuition is so expensive and it s such a nice school dan bauman contributed to

been caused by similar network level events it is reported by unidentified facebook sources on reddit that the network changes have also prevented engineers from remotely connecting to resolve the

could be related to a cyber attack he told the pa news agency there have been many reports and i m struggling to find out exactly what has happened i m reading it could be dns related which means there is an issue with the connection not knowing where to go to your device it could well be a human error or a software bug lurking in the shadows but whatever it is facebook needs to do its best to
