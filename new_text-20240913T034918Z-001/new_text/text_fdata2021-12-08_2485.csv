menafn afp us senators struck a deal tuesday to create a one time law allowing democrats to lift the nation s borrowing authority and avert a catastrophic credit default without requiring votes from the opposition republicans the house of representatives will vote on the fix as early as tuesday evening and it is expected to be approved by congress in the coming days allowing lawmakers to avert the crisis with a simple 51 vote majority in the upper chamber the bipartisan policy center said last week it expected the united states would no longer be able to meet its debt repayment obligations between december 21 and january 28 us treasury secretary janet yellen has put deadline even earlier next wednesday nobody wants to see the us default on its debts as secretary yellen has warned a default could eviscerate everything we ve done to recover from the covid crisis democratic senate majority leader chuck schumer said on the floor of the chamber we don t want to see that i don t believe we will see that and i continue to thank all my colleagues for cooperating in good faith to preserve the full faith and credit of the united states america spends more money than it collects through taxation so it borrows money via the issuing of government bonds seen as among the world s most reliable investments around 80 years ago lawmakers introduced a limit on how much federal debt could be accrued the ceiling has been lifted dozens of times to allow the government to meet its spending commitments usually without drama and with the support of both parties and stands at around 29 trillion democratic leaders have spent weeks underlining the havoc that a default would have wrought including the loss of an estimated six million jobs and 15 trillion in household wealth as well as increased costs for mortgages and other borrowing but republicans in both chambers of congress were initially objecting to helping raise the limit this time around saying they refused to support president joe biden s reckless taxing and spending plans in reality both parties see raising the borrowing cap as politically toxic and republicans hope to weaponize the issue in the 2022 midterm election campaign under the complex multi step compromise proposed tuesday the republicans can essentially stand on the sidelines offering help to create the new law but offering no votes to increase the limit congress would have to specify the exact dollar amount of a new borrowing cap likely upwards of 30 trillion both chambers would have to approve the new process first and then the senate followed by the house would pass the extension by simple majority votes crucially mitch mcconnell the leader of the republicans in the senate is backing the process i think this is in the best interest of the country by avoiding default he told reporters when questioned about the convoluted approach

day on tuesday continuing their rebound from the late november sell off as traders became less fearful of the covid 19 omicron variant at the market close the s p 500 climbed 2 07 to end the session at 4 687 coming increasingly close to its record high of 4 744 the dow jones also powered higher leaping 1 4 492 points to 35 719 while the russell 2000 managed to rally 2 28 to 2 253 a move that allowed the small and mid cap index to retrace more than a third of its recent correction a preliminary report from south african hospitals released the past weekend suggesting that omicron is causing only mild illness has led wall street to bet that the new strain of the virus will not derail the global recovery or have a major negative impact on mobility and therefore activity comments by anthony fauci the chief medical advisor to the white house that omicron is almost certainly less serious than delta and a study by the africa health research institute indicating that pfizer s vaccine offers some protection against the variant in question also bolstered bullish sentiment accelerating buying interest amid the fomo mentality even though risk appetite has bounced back this week traders should remain vigilant as health authorities do not yet have sufficient information to judge how big a threat the new coronavirus variant will be while early details seem encouraging the hypothesis could change as more data become available either way we ll know more in the coming days and weeks after scientists complete their research and share their findings u s stocks outlook if future studies confirms that existing vaccines remain effective and that omicron only leads to mild diseasewhile conferring immunity against other more deadly covid versions after it has been contracted there is room for the equity market to rally further heading into 2022 with reopening stocks having the greatest upside potential the opposite is also true if omicron can defeat vaccines and turns out to be more dangerous than initially feared sentiment is likely to take a hit paving the way for a large sell off as we approach the end of the year and the holiday period it is important to keep in mind another point trading volume is likely to drop as traders close their books at times thinner liquidity can spark explosive volatility amplifying downside and upside moves in the market similar to what transpired the day after thanksgiving turning our attention economic data the u s calendar is devoid of market moving events on wednesday and thursday however friday should be interesting as the u s department of labor will release the november inflation report price pressures are expected to accelerate significantly with headline cpi seen at 6 8 y y versus 6 2 y y in october and the core gauge seen at 4 9 y y from 4 6 y y if inflation results surprise to the upside or details reveal that the stickier cpi components are growing too aggressively to the point they risk contaminating expectations treasury yields could spike higher as traders begin to price faster monetary policy normalization faster qe tapering and sooner liftoff for borrowing costs this scenario could weigh on the equity market especially on technology and growth stocks with elevated valuation under this assumption the nasdaq 100 or the heavily tech skewed s p 500 may be more vulnerable to pullback than the dow jones industrial average for example s p 500 technical analysis after breaking above the 4 620 resistance area now support based on the polarity principle the s p 500 has staged a strong rally and looks poised to retest the all time high of 4 744 amid increased risk appetite if this scenario plays out in the coming days traders should keep a close eye on the index s reaction around its record as if the price manages to overtake this barrier and print a higher high on a daily closing basis buying interest could accelerate paving the way for a climb towards channel resistance close to the 4 800 psychological region on the flip side if sellers resurface and the s p 500 begins to retreat technical support appears at 4 620 though a move below this floor can expose the 50 day simple moving

inflation driven by government spending strong consumer demand and a bottle necked supply chain will likely persist for at least the next six months says hadiza djataou vice president and senior investment director with mackenzie investments fixed income team add new uncertainty around the omicron covid 19 variant and consumer prices rents and wages are unlikely to drop anytime soon inflation is going to be stubborn and is going to stick around for at least until the middle of next year she said we re going to have to face a stickier inflation than we expected only a few months ago djataou said imbalances between demand and supply have wreaked havoc in some sectors among them the auto industry where a shortage of computer chips has created a backlog of unfinished cars with the emergence of omicron we could even see additional supply bottlenecks in the economy especially in north america she said adding that investors particularly bond investors are increasingly seeking protection from inflation there are areas of the market where you can have a fluctuating coupon and you can also receive an income that is more related to inflation and therefore you don t see your purchasing power being eroded she said for example u s treasury inflation protected securities tips have become popular in recent months as a hedge against rising prices but that popularity could dilute their performance next year djataou warned tips have been the favoured instruments to play inflation by direct investors she said but there s a form of speculation running tips today so that s why the outlook is not necessarily negative but there s mostly going to be volatility around their price going into 2022 djataou said alternative fixed income products like tips have joined traditional bonds on the 40 side of the 60 40 recommended investment split she said the new 40 takes into account the fact that equities have long outperformed fixed income extending the fixed income spectrum is an attempt to keep investments in balance the new 40 would a somewhat differentiated type of assets where you will receive a flexible income an income that will reflect ongoing market condition she said as for other fixed income strategies she is underweight government bonds because of the threat of rising interest rates going into 2022 she said the market is pricing in a rate hike but not to a sufficient degree on the other side of the spectrum we love corporate debt and we ve been expressing our active risk positioning in leveraging high yield and also in investment grade she said one of the key strengths of our team is to play that corporate space in public debt markets also on private debt where we ve been adding some significant exposure throughout 2022 djataou said the jury is still out on the effectiveness of cryptocurrencies as an indirect hedge against inflation any evidence that it functions in that capacity could merely be a self fulfilling prophecy she warned if the market collectively believes that bitcoin is going to protect them from inflation which they believe today well there is a strong correlation when inflation expectation is rising we see bitcoin price rising again djataou said direct inflation hedges like commodities have performed well particularly gold and lumber all those commodity prices have been rising significantly and they ve actually been feeding into headline inflation she said this article is part of the soundbites program sponsored by canada life the article was written without sponsor input

the good news is that the economy is making a robust recovery the bad news is that housing supply continues to lag and that is a significant problem on december 7 nh housing presented an online webinar economy 2022 growing or slowing with economist elliot eisenberg phd eisenberg is a former economist at the national homebuilders association and currently works as a consultant and writes a daily economics blog on a range of subjects dealing with the economy according to eisenberg the covid 19 pandemic caused a recession unlike anything in recent memory while it took years to recover from the dot com bust and the 2008 recession this time the economy bounced back almost immediately the national unemployment rate is down to 4 percent productivity is up the gdp is growing and the stock market is performing well but not everything has recovered as quickly as the pandemic made its way around the globe it caused interruptions in manufacturing and movement of goods and materials and created scarcities of consumer goods these supply chain issues caused shortages and price increases that have led to inflation the pandemic also caused significant changes in consumer behavior people continued to work and collect paychecks but were unable to spend money on travel or entertainment that combined with stimulus checks led to significant increases in savings also during the pandemic many people shifted to working from home without the need to be close to the office some workers began moving away from the city proper and out to suburbs and nearby rural areas this led to a boom in housing sales and while many people across the country did move most did not move far ben frost managing director for policy and public affairs for new hampshire housing indicated that this is also true for new hampshire while we heard a lot about an increase in buyers from massachusetts we found that most buyers were already here in new hampshire however there was a modest but statistically significant increase of homebuyers from elsewhere said frost the small inventory of homes on the market combined with increased demand led to skyrocketing sale prices for homes according to frost currently the average home price in new hampshire is 375 000 down from the 410 000 peak in august of 2021 eisenberg noted that nationally there is a deficit of between 3 and 4 million units and that this inventory has been shrinking for the last decade most of the current real estate market centers on the resale of existing homes there are no new homes to purchase he said two areas of the economy that continue to lag are creating significant challenges for builders and developers who want to construct new homes the supply chain problems have caused a scarcity of or significantly increased costs of building materials such as lumber shingles nails and even appliances secondly many people have left the workforce which has made it difficult to secure the necessary labor to build new homes and many of the people who work in these trades are currently busy with renovation projects for existing homes eisenberg also notes that 10 years ago 40 percent of new home construction was entry level homes now it is virtually zero this will have long term ramifications given that millennials are reaching prime home buying age and there is nothing for them to buy the state s rental market also remains challenging across the country rents are rising 3 1 percent housing costs constitute 20 to 30 percent of the consumer price index and may contribute to inflation vacancy rates remain very low which makes finding a place difficult and contributes to increased costs even with this eisenberg is optimistic about the future as long as the covid 19 pandemic continues to fade and shift to the endemic phase he sees the economy continuing to recover areas that have lagged like retail and restaurants will gain strength and increased wages will entice more people to return to the workforce he also sees continuing improvement for small businesses this event was also the last to be hosted by nh housing ceo dean christon who will be retiring at the end of the year christon worked at nh housing for 34 years and served as ceo for the past 15 new ceo robert dapice will take over in january dapice has been with nh housing since 2014 and managed the multi family housing program eisenberg s visual presentation is below

allowed the small and mid cap index to retrace more than a third of its recent correction a preliminary report from south african hospitals released the past weekend suggesting that omicron is causing only mild illness has led wall street to bet that the new strain of the virus will not derail the global recovery or have a major negative impact on mobility and therefore activity comments by anthony fauci the chief medical advisor to the white house that omicron is almost certainly less serious than delta and a study by the africa health research institute indicating that pfizer s vaccine offers some protection against the variant in question also bolstered bullish sentiment accelerating buying interest amid the fomo mentality even though risk appetite has bounced back this week traders should remain vigilant as health authorities do not yet have sufficient information to judge how big a threat the new coronavirus variant will be while early details seem encouraging the hypothesis could change as more data become available either way we ll know more in the coming days and weeks after scientists complete their research and share their findings u s stocks outlook if future studies confirms that existing vaccines remain effective and that omicron only leads to mild diseasewhile conferring immunity against other more deadly covid versions after it has been contracted there is room for the equity market to rally further heading into 2022 with reopening stocks having the greatest upside potential the opposite is also true if omicron can defeat vaccines and turns out

but this piece is about crime covid and the big city not meeting notes and agendas i was in town for sofrep s annual head shed meeting my first as editor in chief and it was pretty productive it s a room full of driven creative people we all did various presentations staked out ideas and hashed through some arguments over things but in the end i think our members will be pretty pleased with what we have planned for 2022 not this night though the streets were almost empty my ear pods were playing a mix of jazz greats like miles davis and chet baker as i walked alone in the chill air it wasn t freezing yet but you could tell it wasn t far off all that s needed is a little arctic tip of the hat from canada and new york will freeze for sure it felt a bit like a movie a city of more than 7 million people and i felt like i had it all to myself it was after 9 pm in new york city and i just about had the streets to myself as i was walking back from dinner at a little italian place in chelsea this neighborhood on the west side of manhattan is tucked between the holland and lincoln tunnels and is the home of art galleries and in my past visits had a lot of foot traffic in the evening going to new york recent media coverage made me think this trip was not going to be much fun according to the narrative new york is supposedly locked down like the cash counting room in a vegas casino as feral gangs loot designer handbag stores because of some nonsense about covid and the root causes of poverty here is what i noticed the mask indoctrination of the masses here in florida the population has adjusted in the early stages of what i am calling the post covid era businesses are open people are going about their lives you can get the vaccination or not depending on your preference and only about one person in ten seem to be wearing masks indoors or out now that there are drugs like remdesovir and monoclonal antibodies for treating covid cases the focus here has shifted away from preventing its spread with lockdowns and mask mandates and moving towards early treatment to reduce hospitalizations and deaths but in a place that the federal government controls you are time warped back to 18 months ago i m talking about going to any commercial airport here airports really do represent everything the government is terrible at doing they are crowded the seating uncomfortable the prices for everything are outrageous and they constantly bombard you with notices of things you must not do in this cheery polite voice passengers are reminded that pets must remain in their kennels in the terminal failure to do so can result in significant fines for the comfort and safety of all our guests smoking is prohibited anywhere in the airport it is against federal law too do not leave your bag or vehicle unattended or and now the latest passengers are required to wear masks at all times while in the airport terminal and aboard planes failure to comply will result in walking into the terminal was the first time i had to don a mask in more than a year i had forgotten how uncomfortable they are how they suck onto your nostrils when you breathe and how they fog your sunglasses as the mask tries to ride down under your chin but everyone was wearing them dutifully until you get to remove the mask when the ticket agent and then the tsa wants to see your face then you are allowed to supposedly put everyone in the entire airport at risk of death by lowering your mask for several seconds the government has to also be safe from terrorists and that comes in conflict with being safe from covid so something s gotta give right you can also take your mask off to eat your 18 dollar club sandwich and drink your 12 beer because public safety has to take a back seat to overpriced concessions airports are a pretty good indication of what life would be like if the government controlled everything you have to show up 2 hours early to your appointment for something walk about a mile stand in line three times pay 18 for a 5 sandwich and then sit in a cramped uncomfortable chair for three hours where you will be treated to a pantomimed lecture on the importance of social distancing while two other people are sitting so close to you that when you get an itch they scratch then i arrived at newark airport and the rules were restated all over again then i got on a train to go to penn station in manhattan and i heard the rules all over again on the train then i arrived at penn station and heard the rules about masks yet again when i got in a cab to go to my hotel i got the mask lecture a final time finally i had to fend off three text messages from new jersey health asking me if i wanted to be notified if i came in contact with anyone who had tested positive for covid they track such people by their phone apparently all told i spent about 7 total hours hearing mask lectures that day new york city health don t discriminate while you are discriminating i had expected that arriving in the city that i would spend the next several days hearing this lecture over and over again checking the covid restrictions from new york city health before i arrived these two things stuck with me we strongly recommend everyone including people who are vaccinated or were previously infected wear masks in all public indoor settings but first you have to get into that indoor setting and new york requires proof of vaccination to even enter you are allowed in if you just have to go to the bathroom and they remind businesses about the rule that says you can t use this proof of vaccination before entry to discriminate against anyone besides the discrimination forbidding public entry to unvaccinated persons that discrimination is approved i had in my possession a white pristine vaccination card issued in florida proving that i had all my shots like a puppy it looks brand new because we really don t need to show them in florida unless we are getting a shot and they need to update it i had it in my wallet and expected that i would be showing it constantly while i was in town when i entered my hotel the mask bubble burst not only were people not wearing masks but i was not asked for my vax card which i was ready to draw like a gunfighter on the street i noticed few people wearing masks out of doors or indoors sadly i think the last two years for many people have been so traumatic and panic inducing that they will wear masks for the rest of their lives i was only asked for my vax card in a couple of places irish democracy in new york city the people are practicing something jokingly referred to as irish democracy or the tendency of people to silently but stubbornly ignore rules and laws that seem unjust or contradictory to them the bureaucrats pass these laws and rules and tell themselves everyone will just go along but out in the real world they are being largely ignored and not enforced the economist milton friedman once said in a speech something along the lines of the british will obey all the laws both the good and the bad the french just ignore their laws and the americans follow the good ones but will just ignore the bad ones that s what i saw in new york city despite the media stories that the city is locked down like ft leavenworth prison these mask and vax card rules aren t the only law they ignore either i seemed to smell marijuana nearly everywhere and saw people casually smoking weed seated at outdoor restaurants and on the steps of their apartment buildings as for the reports of crime running rampant in the city i saw nothing that set off my spidey sense of danger i take certain personal security measures walking around in that city that i won t say anything more about but overall it felt pretty safe where i was even late in the evening there was a marked absence of foot traffic on the streets for most of my time there and traffic moved pretty smoothly on the street the millions of tourists who visit new york city every year are definitely not back and neither are a lot of the businesses that catered to them i saw numerous empty commercial properties in areas that should be in very high demand in spite of claims made by politicians that new york city is open for business many of the businesses are only partially opened at my hotel the bar and restaurant were both closed and i had to walk a block for a cup of coffee in the morning after a meeting one afternoon in lower manhattan several of us wanted to get a drink i saw a huge hilton hotel about a block away and said let s go in there asking for directions to the bar we were informed it was closed we didn t ask why we already knew covid is the reason for everything that doesn t work isn t ready isn t on time or is out of stock it may be the greatest excuse for inconveniences and disappointments ever devised by human beings the country is short of lots of goods and services right now but in the places that are open they hand out paper masks like candy there is no shortage or delay in shipping masks because of covid less than a block away we found an irish pub overflowing with people that was open probably with guests from the hilton unlike the sour faces you see at airports all over the country this bar was full of people having a great time over nothing more than it being friday night and after work i decided to walk a couple of blocks before i grabbed a cab and see new york in a way that few ever get to see it with nearly empty streets at 8 pm the next afternoon i submitted to hours of hectoring about masks again to get back to florida and the relative calm of a post covid state of things the last mask i saw was laying on the ground in the parking lot in gross violation of the airport rules about using the trash receptacles a little irish democracy thrives in florida too

mann was speaking as reports filtered out of china suggesting property development giant evergrande which is teetering under about us300 billion 429 billion of debt would launch a giant debt restructuring program that is likely to see it default on some of its bonds causing painful losses for bondholders particularly those outside china the news will come as little surprise to most in the market mann said the likelihood of foreign bondholders taking a big hit has been priced in and local and foreign equity investors are now more sanguine about evergrande s troubles than they were a few months ago indeed chinese property stocks rose on monday as the government lowered some lending rates a move interpreted as being supportive for the sector mann says it appears the chinese government is controlling the situation in the property market and determined to ensure a soft landing but he believes that unlike previous attempts to cool the housing market that were abandoned as soon as the economy slowed chinese president xi jinping is determined to follow through with reforms to a sector that has seen too much speculation and carries too much debt this is because the property sector problems are part of a broader story of change in china mann argues xi and his top officials have been hit by three shocks in the last 12 months that have dramatically altered their view the first was covid 19 which mann says has actually become a positive for xi in that the government s handling of the outbreak has been widely supported by citizens advertisement the second was the results of the census released earlier this year which showed china s birth rate was plummeting and pointed to a worsening population growth crisis kids cost too much mann says the government s concern is that the middle class are not having children because of the cost of living the third shock has been the realisation that china s economy remains heavily reliant on foreign technology and intellectual property particularly from the us mann says the chinese may have hoped relations with the us would improve under the biden administration but this has proven wide of the mark the effect of these three shocks has been to convince the government to push ahead with a series of reforms to make the chinese economy more sustainable stronger and fairer the crackdown on for profit education for example is about lowering the cost of raising a child to both encourage population growth and make life easier for the middle class advertisement the crackdown on tech companies and the wealthy is designed to reduce visible signs of inequality mann likes the comparison of china moving from its gilded age to its progressive era as the us did in the late 19th century and early 20th century the crackdown on property speculation is similarly designed to support the middle class but also to make space in the chinese economy for growth in other sectors the chinese government could have taken a hands off approach to the housing sector and simply waited for the debt bubble to burst spectacularly but mann says its approach is designed to help contain the fallout surely the chinese way is better if they get it right he says this is a sort of managed wind down in my view reshaping the economy this transition will not necessarily be smooth many experts have estimated that the property sector accounts for as much as 35 per cent of china s gdp and while mann believes the number is more likely somewhere between 15 per cent and 20 per cent there are still several hurdles to navigate including replacing the income local governments have received from land sales to property developers and managing the redeployment of large numbers of workers the latter task is not easy but mann says historical precedents suggest china s economy is flexible enough to make it work advertisement for example the consolidation of the chinese steel sector a few years ago was supposed to be a doom and gloom moment but those workers were absorbed into the economy and particularly the services sector relatively quickly so what is china making space in its economy for mann says the short answer is technology several officials have told him that soft technology internet based businesses are now seen as old fashioned by the chinese government and the focus is very much on hard technology particularly related to decarbonisation china is determined to take a lead on battery technology and energy storage a push that has been given more momentum by the recent power shortages it has suffered its electric vehicle makers have also built a strong share of the chinese ev market and the government sees this as a sector that local ev makers can dominate on their own unlike in internal combustion engines where most chinese groups are joint ventures with traditional carmakers mann says there are huge investments being made in solar wind and nuclear power while the jury is still out on many western nations actually delivering on their net zero promises mann says china has the political will and the resources to actually get there advertisement this push away from property and towards technology has not gone unnoticed by local investors the chinese market is always aggressively looking for what policy is going to be needed next mann says pockets of growth so is nikko it has recently launched an innovation focused fund a consumer and healthcare fund and a decarbonisation fund so it can ride these long term government backed trends these funds are completely focused on the a shares market which mann believes will continue to move differently to us or hong kong listed china stocks while he remains cautious about equity valuations across asia mann does believe these pockets of growth can deliver value particularly with the government essentially backing investors play chinese officials have been busy softening the market for a lower gdp growth target than the economy has seen for some time but where many observers expect a target of between 5 per cent and 5 5 per cent next year mann believes it could be lower than that advertisement clearly a slower chinese economy and a declining housing sector spells bad news for australian iron ore miners and the broader australian economy mann stresses he s no mining expert but doubts a retreat to long term average iron ore prices which sit somewhere about us60 a tonne would not be unexpected for those in the sector there are other niggling concerns around china too such as consumption spending growth mann sees potential weakness here as close to zero population growth keeps a cap on wages and a weak tax base limits the potential for government stimulus his final message is to be wary of predictions of either explosive growth or doom and gloom in china the government has shown itself to be extraordinarily agile and flexible and will generally find a way around hurdles they re human they re going to make mistakes but they learn

promising covid treatments two new covid pills are on their way and they are expected to have a significant impact on how the pandemic plays out in our lives the pills one from merck and the other from pfizer reduce the risk of hospitalization and death if taken early in an infection if all goes well the f d a may authorize both of them by year s end in the simplest terms my colleague carl zimmer said the pair of pills can help turn covid into a more ordinary respiratory disease similar to the common cold or the flu and they may be just the beginning scientists say we will need an arsenal of drugs to deploy against new foes especially if new variants erode the protection of existing vaccines ideally if you tested positive for covid 19 someone could immediately pick up antiviral pills for you at a nearby pharmacy and you could start taking a course carl said another possibility down the line might be that people at high risk for severe covid 19 who live in the same house as someone with an infection would get a prescription for pills to take as a preventive measure

increasingly close to its record high of 4 744 the dow jones also powered higher leaping 1 4 492 points to 35 719 while the russell 2000 managed to rally 2 28 to 2 253 a move that allowed the small and mid cap index to retrace more than a third of its recent correction a preliminary report from south african hospitals released the past weekend suggesting that omicron is causing only mild illness has led wall street to bet that the new strain of the virus will not derail the global recovery or have a major negative impact on mobility and therefore activity comments by anthony fauci the chief medical advisor to the white house that omicron is almost certainly less serious than delta and a study by the africa health research institute indicating that pfizer s vaccine offers some protection against the variant in question also bolstered bullish sentiment accelerating buying interest amid the fomo mentality even though risk appetite has bounced back this week traders should remain vigilant as health authorities do not yet have sufficient information to judge how big a threat the new coronavirus variant will be while early details seem encouraging the hypothesis could change as

forecast get my guide u s stocks outlook if future studies confirms that existing vaccines remain effective and that omicron only leads to mild diseasewhile conferring immunity against other more deadly covid versions after it has been contracted there is room for the equity market to rally further heading into 2022 with reopening stocks having the greatest upside potential the opposite is also true if omicron can defeat vaccines and turns out to be more dangerous than initially feared sentiment is likely to take a hit paving the way for a large sell off as we approach the end of the

after a brutal month for the broader fintech sector investors have started to pile back into it what happened the past month or so has been terrible for fintech company stocks but on tuesday they shifted gears as investors began to shake off their fears about the potential risks carried by the omicron covid 19 variant on a day when the nasdaq composite climbed by 3 upstart upst 3 76 rose roughly 10 lendingclub lc 2 18 gained about 8 and katapult kplt 4 56 rose by 14 3 still over the past month upstart is down by about 42 lendingclub is down nearly 31 and katapult is down more than 21 so what this autumn worries intensified that inflation would be stronger and last longer than experts previously expected in october the consumer price index which tracks prices across a basket of common goods was up by 6 2 year over year it was the largest such cpi increase in more than 30 years the direction things were going was further clarified when federal reserve chairman jerome powell told congress that he would no longer use the word transitory when discussing the recent price inflation the fed also indicated it would taper its bond buying program more rapidly than it had previously planned a signal that hikes could indeed be coming in benchmark interest rates next year just months ago many believed the fed would not raise the fed funds rate until late 2023 or 2024 now bank of america research analysts are modeling for three rate hikes in 2022 upstart lendingclub and katapult all leverage technology artificial intelligence and data to make loans to consumers higher interests rates mean these companies can charge higher interest on their loans but it also means that the cost of the funds needed to originate these loans could rise too furthermore higher interest rates also mean higher costs of borrowing for consumers and typically higher default rates while fintech lending models are supposed to be quite good investors are curious to see how they will fare during different phases of the interest rate cycle finally higher interest rates hurt high growth tech stocks because they make materials and debt more expensive and erode the value of companies future earning power upstart at one point this year briefly traded at 60 times revenue with that kind of valuation there isn t a lot of room for error and then of course with everything going on with inflation the world found out about the omicron variant which features significantly more mutations than the delta variant and looks both more contagious and more able to evade the immune responses generated by current covid 19 vaccines that news hit the market hard as investors wondered if there would be a return to lockdowns or if gross domestic product in 2022 would take a big hit for upstart lendingclub and katapult to thrive they need consumers taking out loans making purchases and spending now what a couple of months ago upstart exceeded a 26 billion valuation at that point i thought the fintech had simply risen too fast and needed to come back to a more reasonable valuation which it has since done lendingclub and katapult were trading at much more reasonable valuations they simply got caught in the stampede away from the fintech sector hopefully omicron won t prove to be quite the danger that the market initially feared it would be certainly there are some early signs that indicate it causes less severe illnesses than earlier variants of concern inflation could be tough for these three companies but i still think they could perform well in 2022 if the economy is decent i remain quite bullish on lendingclub in particular given its business transformation this year its astounding growth over the past few quarters and its valuation

pam and barry van dyck have been dreaming of leaving behind the snow in grand rapids mich and going someplace warm and adventurous for their 50th wedding anniversary with zip lining snorkeling rivers in caves amphibious vehicles and waterslides pam van dyck says of course those aren t activities just for them but for their children and grandchildren too as the retired couple wants to celebrate a half century together with their entire family everybody enjoys being together and this would be a fun way to celebrate us having 51 years together pam van dyck says it s 51 years now because the van dycks initially planned the anniversary trip to mexico for last december but postponed it amid a surge in covid 19 cases at a time when vaccines were not yet widely available now they re not entirely sure they can take the rescheduled trip this month our biggest concern of course is what s happening now with the new variant and it s just getting a little risky i not ready to cancel or postpone pam van dyck says adding that she s waiting and watching to see what happens with the new coronavirus strain i really don t want to do that but we would i m not putting everybody at risk the discovery of the omicron variant of the coronavirus in at least a third of u s states is raising questions about whether it will be safe to travel for the upcoming holidays with christmas now less than three weeks away to try to curb the spread of the variant many countries are imposing travel restrictions and bans including the u s which has banned most non u s citizens who have recently been in any of eight southern african countries from entering the united states starting monday the biden administration is requiring all travelers coming into the u s to provide proof of a negative coronavirus test taken within a day of their departure regardless of citizenship and vaccination status and it is extending the mask wearing mandate on board planes and inside airports into mid march such restrictions are raising concerns that there may be another slowdown in air travel hurting an industry that was just beginning to turn the corner toward recovery after having its busiest week since the pandemic began over the thanksgiving holiday period u s airlines flew about 2 4 million passengers on nov 28 that s the most since february 2020 and the industry had been preparing for a busy december too with some airlines offering employees incentive pay to work extra or not call in sick to accommodate the increase in passengers should you travel health experts say it depends experts in infectious disease and public health officials note that omicron is a variant of concern but add that there is not much known about it including its transmissibility its ability to evade the immune system and the severity of disease it causes so it s difficult to say right now if those with travel plans for christmas should instead stay home dr robert murphy a professor of infectious diseases at northwestern university s feinberg school of medicine and director of the school s institute for global health says we ll know more in a couple of weeks i think people should really get ready to hit the pause button on their travel plans he says those who are immunocompromised should definitely not travel and that includes people over 65 people who are obese people with diabetes people with underlying cancer people with any kind of immunocompromised condition i think these people should not be traveling anywhere he also recommends that people cancel or postpone their trip if they were planning to go overseas spencer platt getty images getty images united airlines planes sit at gates at newark liberty international airport in new jersey on nov 30 the united states as well as a growing list of other countries has restricted flights because of the detection of the omicron variant of the coronavirus the international traveler is at much higher risk than domestic murphy says and not just for contracting the coronavirus he says with governments worldwide closing borders and imposing new travel restrictions there s a significant risk of your flight being canceled and you getting stranded overseas or you being forced to quarantine upon arrival at your destination because of an outbreak murphy says he has canceled his own planned trip to europe over the holidays as for domestic travel for those without underlying health conditions whose flights are already booked murphy and other public health experts urge travelers to take a wait and see approach we ll know a lot more in the next two weeks murphy told npr if this comes out like we think it s going to come in other words it s just more contagious and it s not a worse disease and if you re vaccinated and boosted that if you do get infected you don t get too sick you know i think travel could be pretty safe very soon omicron s impact on airlines one more headache you didn t need the rise of the omicron variant and subsequent global travel restrictions come at a perilous time for the airlines which had been banking on a strong holiday season and a recovery in business and international travel next year to help propel the industry out of a long pandemic slump well you know it s one more headache you didn t need and you hope to avoid says robert w mann a former airline executive who now works as a consultant for the industry it s a continuation of the thing we ve seen since the beginning which was you know two steps forward one step back or sometimes two steps back mann says but you know we ll make it through this we understand how to deal with it a lot better than we did initially united airlines ceo scott kirby says he expects united to take a financial hit from the omicron coronavirus variant adding that trans atlantic flights will be most affected my guess is we ll have less flying to europe than we would have in january because of the new variant kirby told the financial times in an interview with cnbc kirby added that omicron is certainly going to have a near term impact on bookings there will be a short term dip in revenue but the dip will be smaller than it was for delta we ve always known there were going to be more variants and we ve said the covid recovery would never be a straight line kirby said adding we re much better dealing with this as a society vaccines are likely to prove effective again we look confident about the long term nothing changes about where we ll be 12 months from now industry analysts agree that the airlines appear better prepared to handle the now inevitable ups and downs that come with surges in coronavirus infections and the discovery of new variants in the past year each new variant has brought a decline in bookings but then an increase once the surge dissipates said helane becker an analyst with financial services firm cowen in an interview with the associated press the omicron variant does not appear to be biting into americans appetite to travel as domestic air travel bookings rose over the past week according to adobe digital insights which tracks flight booking data airline and travel related stocks rose monday as bookings have not fallen as sharply as expected adobe s data shows that from nov 25 through dec 1 domestic flight bookings online were up 19 compared with the week prior cyber monday saw the biggest uptick in bookings with levels elevated through the two days following the majority of these bookings were for trips happening in the next two months mann the airline consultant says holiday travelers who had already booked flights don t appear to be canceling their trips yet out of fears of possibly another surge in coronavirus infections but he says the omicron variant does cast a pall of uncertainty over how airline executives plan for next year and their decision has to be you know how much capacity am i going to risk scheduling in 2022 for the spring and summer mostly mann says because that s when everyone hoped we would be out of the soup and into the black again i think there s still some concern that this may once again delay that recovery process citing the world health organization s advisory warning that blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of the coronavirus and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods the airline and travel industries are urging governments worldwide to reverse the most severe travel restrictions that have already been put into place the emergence of the omicron variant panicked many governments into once again restricting or

you may have never heard of urea but the worldwide shortage of the chemical compound could bring australia s supply chain to its knees in a matter of weeks the world is facing a major shortage of the compound a key ingredient found in the diesel exhaust fluid adblue and a large component in fertiliser the main reason for the shortage is that china which previously supplied 80 of australia s urea supplies has banned export of the product that s because the cost of fertiliser has skyrocketed and china wants to slow that price growth but this could inadvertently force many of australia s trucks off the road as urea is injected into the exhaust systems of modern diesel vehicles to reduce emissions which is a requirement for trucks private vehicles and tractors the shortage could also lead to higher food prices at the register so what is urea and how badly could the shortage impact australia s supply chain what is it urea is a handy naturally occurring chemical compound co nh 2 2 also known as carbamide that is found in mammalian urine among other places since 1828 when the german chemist friedrich wohler developed a process to synthesise the compound urea has also been produced in bulk for human uses these include as an agricultural fertiliser but also to reduce nitrous oxides produced in combustion engines what is it made from the main feedstock for the world s urea production is gas which is first converted to ammonia under high temperatures and pressure and then into liquid urea global urea production is about 220m tonnes a year according to volker hessel a professor at the university of adelaide australia s largest producer incitec pivot has a capacity of about 290 000 tonnes a year or one 800th of the total that company told the stock exchange last month it plans to close its main urea plant in brisbane s gibson island by the end of next year the facility had been unable to secure an economically viable long term gas supply instead it will rely on its international supply chains to replace the manufactured product at least until it can determine the viability of making so called green ammonia using hydrogen at scale as the substitute feedstock for fossil gas what s the problem demand and supply shifts have contrived to push up fertiliser prices by about threefold in a year according to the world bank high fertiliser prices could exert inflationary pressures on food prices compounding food security concerns at a time when the covid pandemic and climate change are making access to food more difficult the bank said in a post wes lefroy a senior agriculture analyst at raboresearch says if anything the fertiliser prices were responding at first to a surge in demand for wheat soya beans and corn farmers eyeing high prices for those crops see it as a good bet to toss on more fertiliser to glean higher returns economies juiced up for covid also pushed up demand for gas while hurricane ida the second strongest tropical storm on record to come ashore at louisiana in the us last august triggered the suspension of key refineries adding to fertiliser shortages view image in fullscreen trucks queue to buy urea at a petrol station on in yeoju south korea photograph yonhap epa big fertiliser producers have also been responding by curbing trade china which accounts for about one 10th of urea and one third of another important farm input of diammonium phosphate closed off exports until next june to ensure local farmers have enough supply and russia has curbed fertiliser exports for six months road transport concerns it s not just a worry on the farm urea supplies also disrupt the availability of a diesel exhaust fluid adblue is its trade name a refined additive caught up in the china trade block the national road transport association is among the groups trying to get action from the morrison government to secure supplies the association s head warren clark has called for the creation of a taskforce of industry groups to obtain alternatives while the use of the fluid is meant to reduce production of nitrous oxides newer diesel engines don t function well without it sign up to receive an email with the top stories from guardian australia every morning in most of the modern diesels there s a chemical added to the system called adblue clark told the abc a lot of the adblue or the chemical that goes into making it is imported from china the supply of that chemical urea has dried up from china and hence there s now a massive shortage of adblue in this country our industry isn t the only one that will be affected but we will be hit first and hardest clark said these issues go beyond natroad and the trucking industry what happens next raboresearch s lefroy says australia imports about 90 of its urea based fertilisers and of that about two thirds comes in between march and july before they are used on winter crops there s very little urea being traded in australia at the moment just because we re in summer he said adding that the pinch if there is one won t be felt until next year view image in fullscreen a wheatfield in bethungra nsw fertiliser shortage will drive up grain prices photograph mike bowers the guardian depending on the soil health farmers can also turn to other fertiliser if urea is not available or plant crops such as legumes that require less fertiliser to start with rabobank s global research points to fertiliser shortages as just one of several factors pointing to high prices for many farm commodities into 2022 the prices of grains and oilseeds like wheat and corn food staples coffee and sugar and key inputs such as palm oil will all continue at high prices it said in a report last week the bank expects many food processors to support any significant drop in prices by extending commercial hedges to historical averages and by stockpiling more enabling them to weather some of the broader global volatility hessel from the university of adelaide says the problem underscores the tight interconnections with the shortage of just one key ingredient affecting the whole supply chain eventually hydrogen offers an alternative to gas as the fuel stock taking out a significant source of greenhouse gases in the process those plants will take five six seven years until they are operational those plants will be investments of billions hessel said that is not something you build overnight

ten years later the worst imaginable scenarios have played out iraq wrecked u s bankrupt during a march 14 interview american free press spoke with erin evers of human rights watch in the past she has also worked with the iraqi refugee assistance program thus gaining invaluable firsthand knowledge of that nation s problems when asked to describe daily life in iraq evers replied the residents of baghdad feel insecure because of ongoing terrorist attacks many are also being targeted by security forces while corruption is rife in political and judicial institutions on an even more basic level evers continued most people in baghdad wouldn t say they re leading normal lives movement is extremely difficult due to checkpoints roadblocks and blast walls many neighborhoods are still cordoned off and people especially women can be stopped and harassed at any time as to their state of mind evers provided these insights iraqis are angry they feel like victims after decades of dictatorship under saddam hussein and occupation by the u s after everything they ve endured most worry that it s all been for naught an opportunity wasted indeed from 2003 2011 the united states has spent 823b in iraq although total long term healthcare costs and other expenditures may reach an astounding 4t at a time when u s bridges highways and other infrastructure crumble from disrepair 60b in taxpayer money has been earmarked for iraqi reconstruction a march 6 special inspector general for iraq reconstruction sigir 186 page report concluded that approximately 15 of these funds were wasted outright other allocations disappeared via embezzlement and kickbacks one example should be enough to infuriate any red blooded american in june 2004 the u s coalition provisional authority earmarked 35m for a fallujah waste water treatment facility they projected an 18 month construction window eight years later total expenditures rose to 108m and it s still not finished serving only one third of city dwellers worst of all contractors estimated they need another 87m to complete the project by 2014 after reading the sigir report senator susan collins r maine commented the level of fraud waste and abuse in iraq was appalling whereas iraq s interior minister adnan al assadi stated you can fly in a helicopter around baghdad or other cities but you cannot point a finger at a single project that was built and completed by the united states it s worth remembering that 5 000 years ago civilization began in mesopotamia the land between two rivers iraq today after a decade of war iraq is in ruins and may never recover high priests of war still have blood on hands long before other journalists in the alternative media pointed out that a host of israeli partisans otherwise known as neocons were responsible for pushing the bush administration toward war with iraq in 2003 afp s michael collins piper penned what still remains the ultimate book on this subject published in 2004 piper s the high priests of war ventured into territory that the jewish controlled press refused to touch while the american public got duped into believing smokescreen stories about saddam hussein s non existent wmds piper chronicled the exploits of such nefarious figures as richard the prince of darkness perle also exposed were staunch zionists such as paul wolfowitz doughlas feith and scooter libby as well as the weekly standard s william kristol to get an idea of what actually transpired in the lead up to war piper cited a little known bit of advice offered by a supposedly educational group called the israel project they told their zionist allies if your goal is regime change you must be much more careful with your language because of the potential backlash you do not want americans to believe that the war on iraq is being waged to protect israel rather than to protect america and that explains why vice president dick cheney falsely warned his countrymen about iraqi mushroom clouds while the neocons trotted out secretary of state colin powell to push their phony wmd rhetoric powell later called it the lowest point in my life yet behind the scenes piper described the real movers and shakers the project for a new american century pnac that called for a new pearl harbor 9 11 strike that would get the wheels of their war machine turning to his credit piper also clarified precisely who the neocons are despite being called neoconservatives these reformed trotskyites are actually big government israel firsters from this writer s perspective the only real difference between them and 1920s style progressives is that these fake conservatives possess a bloodthirsty penchant to fight zionist wars for them unfortunately all of these war criminal neocons are still at large escaping justice after deceiving americans into accepting a lie that 19 cave dweller muslims orchestrated the 9 11 terror strikes which then led to the catastrophic wars in afghanistan and iraq these treasonous men got away with murder and 10 years later the blood is still on their hands u s covert ops remain in iraq cia still arming death squads weapons still crossing the border half of iraqis living in squalor to understand what s happening in iraq 2013 on march 14 afp contacted one of the most outspoken voices on the scene today as an iraqi american writer and activist who founded the website mask of zion jonathon azaziah definitely pulls no punches when questioned about president barack obama s role in iraq over the past four years azaziah said obama is even more dangerous than bush who everyone knew was a christian zionist controlled by the christian zionist cabal but liberals and the antiwar community see obama s black skin and eloquence and they re blindsided by him speaking truths that are rarely heard azaziah added people tell me that obama s thumbing his nose at benjamin netanyahu but i ask them why is his administration still sending israel 3b a year in military aid obama s foreign policy is just as zionistic and imperialistic as bush s he s as much a neocon as bush but obama wears a mask to hide it with plenty of ammunition to support his arguments azaziah insisted obama is the biggest mass murderer on the planet earth today not only is his administration overseeing an unrelenting covert warfare campaign in syria but they re conducting drone strikes from one end of the world to another as for iraq conditions most certainly haven t improved over the past four years the cia has increased support to iraqi militias and death squads azaziah remarked and obama hasn t pulled them out the flow of weapons is still coming across iraq s border so it s a fallacy to say the u s has left when it comes to living conditions despite billions allocated for reconstruction azaziah sees no betterment quite bluntly iraq s entire social order and structure has been annihilated half the people live in poverty one third are unemployed while running water and electricity remain insufficient in fallujah they don t have power 18 hours a day bombs still cause 40 50 deaths on a daily basis plus the cancer rate in fallujah from depleted uranium is higher than hiroshima and nagasaki after we nuked them azaziah closed with this distressing observation when i think of iraq today one word comes to mind decimation will u s fight more wars to keep petrodollar safe want to get bombed suggest taking something else besides u s dollars for oil when most people discuss the motivations behind the u s attack on iraq in 2003 control of the country s oil and threats to israel are the two most common topics that come up there remains one subject however that many people remain in the dark about even to this day and that is saddam hussein s announcement on october 30 2000 that iraq would no longer accept u s dollars for iraqi petroleum as i wrote in my book the new world order illusion during richard nixon s second term national security advisor henry kissinger and treasury secretary william simon negotiated a deal with saudi arabia s king fahd where all opec oil would be sold solely in u s dollars because every nation now required our money the u s dollar became the de facto global currency this stockpiling of u s dollars thus created an inordinate demand for america s currency if hussein got away with bucking opec s status quo the rationale was that a domino effect would ensue and other anti u s nations would follow suit since the world has been effectively propping up the american economy for the past four decades by holding u s dollars in reserve the u s has enjoyed a unique position in history whereby washington could live trillions of dollars beyond its means and rack up astronomical deficits without concern what would happen then if the petrodollar suddenly went away first of all with the evaporation of global demand ben bernanke could no longer create billions of dollars each month out of thin air to monetize our debt if he did continue to dump trillions into the system inflation would skyrocket to offset further devaluation the fed would be compelled to increase interest rates thus eliminating the days of low cost mortgages next with 43 of every dollar either being borrowed or printed without backing the federal government s bloated bubble would burst with 50m people collecting food stamps and nearly half of u s residents collecting some type of government check uncle sam could no longer finance all these programs as such welfare social security and pensions would all face reductions obviously the current size of government couldn t persist and as a result amid massive federal layoffs no locale would suffer more than washington d c virginia maryland and delaware all of whom continue to prosper while the rest of america languishes in recession in addition the reason wall street is breaking records can be traced directly to banks pumping bernanke s free money into the stock market but without quantitative easing say goodbye to your 401ks anyone who doubts this need only look at the pentagon where daily its 16 reserved parking lots are filled with 8 770 vehicles inside the pentagon there are 23k military and civilian employees and an additional 3k support personnel as it is today the american empire persists for two reasons the petrodollar and military dominance if demand for the petrodollar were wiped out the u s standard of living would nosedive here s the bitter reality americans are war weary but they don t want to surrender their government social programs so the question everyone must ask themselves is if the petrodollar is endangered are americans willing to enter another war at the banking cabal s bequest against those who threaten the way of life we ve become accustomed to one thing is certain once the tides of history shift they don t return just ask the greek roman british and ottoman empires victor thorn is a hard hitting researcher journalist and author of over 40 books

for many americans inflation could not be more pronounced at a worse time the consumer price index shows this holiday season prices are up more than 6 from a year ago and they have risen an extra one percent over just the last month as people turn their attention to buying gifts according to the national retail federation thought the increased prices are not deterring buying the nrf estimates that there were 66 million people who tried to get a jump start on holiday shopping this thanksgiving weekend a considerable jump from 52 9 million last year and the average consumer spent 364 the nostalgia factor is big for consumers i think we all missed a sense of normalcy and some of that involves heading to stores seeing the décor and getting out and about with other people said katherine cullen senior director for industry and consumer research at the national retail federation the nrf says holiday spending this year is projected to grow between 8 5 to 10 from 2020 a big portion of that is electronics the fourth biggest spending category according to the federation that has been hit hard by supply chain issues xboxes and playstations that debuted last holiday season are still in short supply if you do not find a deal a new one could cost you as much as double its original retail price of 550 but dig a little deeper and you will find there are some good alternatives data from the bureau of labor statistics shows smartphones for instance have fallen in price by 29 since the pandemic began look at a number of retailers to see what s available and what discounts and prices are being offered said cullen many retailers are offering things like a gift card with the purchase another option to bypass issues is to shop locally some major retailers are experiencing delays in shipping for hard to find items so going out to a local store could mean you are getting your gift in stock and on time there are added supply chain challenges even with retailers taking a lot of proactive steps to bring inventory in earlier said cullen some categories like electronics have been impacted a little bit more due to supply chain issues than others

listen to post christmas is the time of year when many people have time off work enjoy opening presents under a lit up decorated tree and come together to enjoy a feast with family and friends however behind closed doors christmas is a sad season for those impacted by poverty and for many the pandemic has heightened this problem according to recent data from the national retail federation the average household in the united states spends 998 on gifts food and decorations during the holidays in particular christmas can put a lot of stress and financial strain on families which is why every year charities across metro vancouver like the surrey christmas bureau help low income families get toys stocking stuffers and grocery cards so they can celebrate with peace of mind it s almost like a pop up toys r us says lisa werring the executive director for the bureau one member of each family cluster can apply for assistance online through the bureau s website after they provide their i d financial information number of children in the household under 18 and their proof of residency in surrey once approved parents give the bureau staff their children s wish lists and volunteers help pack toy hampers for each child the hampers consist of three toys containing one small medium and large toy with a christmas stocking filled with small items including a book if they have them in stock in addition to the hampers every family receives a grocery gift card providing breakfast lunch and dinner on christmas day werring says the bureau accepts new items such as unwrapped toys books universal size clothing such as hats gloves scarves and more those who donate can also drop them off at their local surrey fire hall where volunteers collect them daily as of nov 29 300 families have already picked up toys says werring they expect to see over 2 000 families this season which will include around 4 700 children due to high demand they accepted applications until dec 4 to ensure they could provide enough resources for families however the process hasn t always been easy before the pandemic families would line up to register for the surrey christmas bureau and would have roughly 300 volunteers to help last year the organization had to move their application process entirely online and saw their volunteer numbers drop to help with the transition werring says the bureau received a grant from the federal government that was offered to charities throughout canada to assist with covid 19 protocols this included investing in application software ppe such as masks plexiglass barriers and hand sanitizer for volunteers and staff for this season they are seeing fewer people signing up to help though they do have high school student volunteers who are a part of the co op program from guildford park secondary most of our volunteers are seniors so they re particularly vulnerable to the virus we do everything we can to make sure everybody is protected says werring we figured out a way to manage with what we have and we do want to keep the numbers controllable in the building so that everybody has sufficient social distancing space after serving for five years as the bureau s executive director there is only one memory from this year that stands out to her werring met a single mother who recently moved to canada from afghanistan in august with her seven children the mother happened to walk by the surrey christmas bureau and stepped inside to inquire what it was about one of the volunteers speaks six languages and was able to communicate with the mother and help get her registered we got her information so that she ll be able to come and get toys for her children and she s got something happy to look forward to and is spending time this christmas with her family here safe in surrey says werring when we see parents leave here they re just so happy to be able to give their children toys and know they re going to have that special holiday meal they ll all share together then when these kids go back to school in january they re going to be full of stories of their new toy they got just like all their friends she says kids should all feel the same when they go back to school werring says charities like the bureau are important this time of year the sense of isolation and loneliness when people are struggling financially to provide is very stressful and emotionally exhausting for parents and kids feel that too she says it provides a sense of relief and happiness for families to come together at the holiday time teresa kelly who has been volunteering with the bureau since 2019 says it s important that people are looked after because the holidays are the worst time of year to have no familial support kelly helps people with their applications over the phone and verifies their information such as bank statements and proof of address most of the applicants are people who have recently immigrated to canada or are on refugee status she says often they say it is more difficult to find employment and many rely on charities like the bureau i came to canada 40 years ago as an immigrant so i know what it s like to be on that side of things says kelly it s all about giving back it s important that all kids are treated the same you see the smiles on those people s faces and it just does your heart good she says it s important that people feel that they re being respected being looked after and they can put food on the table which is a good thing these days outside of surrey many other organizations like the downtown eastside women s centre dewc are helping those in need during the holiday season the dewc provides meals counselling and programs that empower women in the community leading up to and during the holidays the centre collects gently used or brand new clothing toiletries shoes and other donations to provide gifts to those in the centre this is a space where they can come and have a break from the streets and from their difficult life where they can find help and the resources to move on with what they want to do says sara nunez the manager for the drop in location every year the dewc offers a few holiday dinners throughout december where women and their children are given gifts and participate in activities afterwards due to provincial lockdowns last year the centre wasn t able to offer the dinner however nunez says they expect to host the dinner outside this season and are preparing for over 400 people this year we are going to have a big street celebration where we close the street and rent a big tent with heaters and fancy tables for the women says nunez christmas is very sad for women especially when you re homeless she says they are lonely they re missing their families and their children so they come to gather and that s why it s important to have it open in addition to the dinner the centre uses its social media to spread awareness and spark people s interest in holding fundraising events to raise money and donate to the charity they are also a part of givingtuesday a movement that motivates people to give something to a charity of their choice last year the centre faced some challenges like not being able to collect donations for a while and when they were able to again donations had to be left in a room for two days to prevent cross contamination it was very hard for the women because they didn t have clothes to change or warm blankets and stuff for a little while says nunez however one positive change this year is that the dewc has roughly 50 volunteers to help around the centre and with events such as the dinner later this month the organization will open another emergency shelter just before christmas to provide more women with support the conditions of the pandemic were disastrous in the downtown eastside says lisa curry the dewc fundraising and grants coordinator also overdoses increased gender based violence and increased isolation isolation at the same time as the loss of basic need services and mental health supports was catastrophic for the community she says curry says the centre has seen a 50 per cent increase of women accessing their services specifically this christmas we will be serving more women than we re used to thankfully we have these new sites but the need has increased says curry this is definitely the time of year that we try to bring back the christmas spirit while organizations like the surrey christmas bureau and the downtown eastside women s centre have seen progress with hosting events this year and weathering the hardships through the pandemic the surrey urban mission society sums has been experiencing some challenges on what they can do this holiday season the organization provides shelter clothing and three meals a day in the whalley neighbourhood romeo kabanda director of operations and volunteer coordinator says they can t host events like they normally did before the pandemic and can t accommodate many volunteers in the building due to limited space when the pandemic hit all of our volunteers left that was challenging when you re using a lot of volunteers to help you out says kabanda but during this christmas period we have been getting a lot more volunteers sums has been gathering tons of donations from the community such as food and clothing and the mission is currently planning to prepare its annual christmas dinner later this month kabanda says they plan to serve around 200 people from all four of their shelters with an additional 70 people outside to help serve people outside during the pandemic sums has installed a drive thru style window to hand out food in an easier way he adds that this time of year gets so busy because everybody s got the festive spirit so we get overloaded with a lot of donations which is nice although there have been challenges persevering through the pandemic and the holiday season the surrey christmas bureau the downtown eastside women s centre and the surrey urban mission society are still actively looking for volunteers and donations to help those in need this christmas it s just seeing happiness there s a lot of negativity sometimes that surrounds the people that we serve kabanda says we always recommend that they speak to the person and get to know who they are that person is a human being as well we just want to make sure that everybody is included werring says that s what it s all about
listen to this article listen to this article within the last month three central pennsylvania companies announced that they had or would be buying back part or all of their stock to give to their employees as part of new employee stock ownership plans known as esops the announcement that your company is adopting an esop can be an exciting one it means the potential of retiring with a drastic boost to your retirement fund after selling your stock back to the company for an employer it means securing a business succession plan giving employees a sense of ownership and more however while a company can have a long list of reasons for adopting an esop maintaining the plan and educating employees about ownership brings its own challenges the initial decision providence engineering a lancaster based engineering firm with 75 employees announced in november that it would be going to employee ownership for providence leadership an esop plan was one of three options on the table when discussing what the next phase of transition would look like for the firm providence could look for potential buyers outside of the company look internally to be purchased by someone within the company or it could take out a loan and give its stock to its employees at a point after really digging into the options it became clear that for providence the best option was to esop the company said david bernhardt president of providence engineering it allows providence to remain providence we didn t get bought or sold the brand remains and the culture remains as a professional services firm without many saleable tangible assets going esop spoke to providence because it supplied an avenue to transition the company without having to bet on finding an interested buyer said bernhardt we don t have a warehouse full of goods a yard full of equipment or contracts that annually renew to help establish a sales price he said a professional service firm is built on good will the good will of our team to help provide our service and the good will of our clients to provide us with opportunities to provide that service the value of that good will is only worth what someone is willing to pay esops have been around since the 1950 s but began to see more use after the employee retirement security act of 1974 erisa the law introduced an incentive for esop creation in the form of tax exemptions which help a company with the funds needed to make contributions back into the company stock the federal government pennsylvania and most states stood up and said that if you adopt an esop you don t have to pay taxes on the part owned by employees said kevin mcphillips executive director and ceo of the pennsylvania center for employee ownership you get all of this extra cash to build the business in forming an esop a company must have the capital on hand to buy whatever percentage of the company it is looking to give to its employees generally a loan is needed to tackle that upfront cost which affects the initial value of the stock now owned by the employees the stock becomes a retirement benefit in line with something like 401 k employee owners can then watch their stock mature over the years and sell it back to the company when they leave the stock maturates as the company increases in value which can be found through an external esop trustee who works with a valuation firm to value the stock annually educating new employee owners the champaign has been poured and the company has celebrated the adoption of their new esop that initial announcement may not convince every employee of the latent benefit they would receive upon retirement if they check the worth of their stock in those early days they may be surprised to see that their stock is worth hundreds not thousands of dollars it s not uncommon for an esop that the company took on all of this debt and that debt drives down the value of the stock said trevor bare a partner and consulting actuary with employee benefit and investment advisory firm conrad siegel there is this disconnect where we have this valuable big company but they don t see that reflected in the stock because most of the shares are held because of the outstanding debt bob whalen ceo of harrisburg based hb mcclure helped lead the charge for the company s transition into an esop in 2010 since transitioning into an esop the commercial residential plumbing and hvac services company has also transitioned the employees of the companies it has acquired which whalen said has made the company a more attractive buyer despite hb mcclure s 23 transactions educating employees on the benefits of an esop has not gotten any easier said whalen according to mcphillips one third of employees understand the function of an esop and are excited by the concept another third has a wait and see attitude and the final third believe the entire thing is a scam educating the employees is a challenge we would like to think that we can tell them that they are an owner of the firm you snap your fingers and their behavior aligns with how you want it to said whalen the reality is just like any other adoption curve that happens over time people want to see results before they are willing to buy into it in the new year providence will be introducing an esop committee comprised of both providence leadership and staff to allow the firm s employees to learn about the esop process and explain it to their peers rather than allow communication to come just from leadership it s important the message is received better from your coworkers and friends said bernhardt a national outlook for esops the most recent data available from the national center for employee ownership states that there were 6 501 esops operating across the country in 2018 with total assets over 1 4 trillion in pennsylvania that number was 252 esops with assets over 8 3 billion mcphillips anticipates that pennsylvania may have become the state with the most esops in 2020 but that data won t be available for some time we are hearing from the business community that activity is brisk in pennsylvania he said the data also shows that the number of esops nationally have continued to decline dropping from a recent high of 6 717 in 2014 that is due to the double edged sword that is an esop said mcphillips many times these businesses are extremely valuable he said the company does very well and you get offers for the business once the business is more than 50 employee owned the trust has the authority to assign the board of directors i ve never seen them change the board but they have the authority and the trustee must make a decision of what is best for the employees cashing out even when forming an employee ownership plan a company should take into consideration what it will look like when employees are ready to sell stock back to the company and receive payments from the company which can take time to completely pay out conrad siegel does not work with new companies looking to adopt an esop but it does bring on esop clients and help with the ongoing administration of the plan securing a loan planning out the initial esop strategy and announcing the plan to employees is a months long process but maintaining an esop lasts decades we help companies communicate this to employees we manage it so its sustainable for the long term we make sure everything is in balance so that the cash paid to former employees is matched by active employees said bare we are not there are the start line but we are there for the rest of the race

for many americans inflation could not be more pronounced at a worse time the consumer price index shows this holiday season prices are up more than 6 from a year ago and they have risen an extra one percent over just the last month as people turn their attention to buying gifts according to the national retail federation thought the increased prices are not deterring buying the nrf estimates that there were 66 million people who tried to get a jump start on holiday shopping this thanksgiving weekend a considerable jump from 52 9 million last year and the average consumer spent 364 the nostalgia factor is big for consumers i think we all missed a sense of normalcy and some of that involves heading to stores seeing the décor and getting out and about with other people said katherine cullen senior director for industry and consumer research at the national retail federation the nrf says holiday spending this year is projected to grow between 8 5 to 10 from 2020 a big portion of that is electronics the fourth biggest spending category according to the federation that has been hit hard by supply chain issues xboxes and playstations that debuted last holiday season are still in short supply if you do not find a deal a new one could cost you as much as double its original retail price of 550 but dig a little deeper and you will find there are some good alternatives data from the bureau of labor statistics shows smartphones for instance have fallen in price by 29 since the pandemic began look at a number of retailers to see what s available and what discounts and prices are being offered said cullen many retailers are offering things like a gift card with the purchase another option to bypass issues is to shop locally some major retailers are experiencing delays in shipping for hard to find items so going out to a local store could mean you are getting your gift in stock and on time there are added supply chain challenges even with retailers taking a lot of proactive steps to bring inventory in earlier said cullen some categories like electronics have been impacted a little bit more due to supply chain issues than others

announced a mega deal with swiss drug and diagnostics giant roche ag and its u s subsidiary genentech that could generate billions in new revenues for the salt lake city based company in the coming decade biotech startup recursion pharmaceuticals on tuesday announced a mega deal with swiss drug and diagnostics giant roche ag and its u s subsidiary genentech that could generate billions in new revenues for the salt lake city based company in the coming decade the announcement follows news released monday that recursion secured an extension of its partnership with another european pharma behemoth bayer ag for work on fibrosis diseases in a deal that could earn a value north of 1 billion both deals bookend a year in which recursion has been a veritable rocket ship ride generating over 500 million in an april public stock offering and announcing plans to double its 100 000 square foot salt lake headquarters facility at the gateway complex in downtown salt lake city the company reports it has also added about 200 employees in the last 12 months currently has a workforce nearing 400 and has open job listings for 100 positions not bad for a company launched less than a decade ago by two university of utah ph d students and their professor that in 2016 employed about a dozen people and was running on a couple million dollars in funding one of those doctoral student co founders now a full fledged ph d and current recursion ceo chris gibson said the new collaborations fit into a long running vision for what the founders always believed the company could become we were always looking to build a 21st century biopharmaceutical company that could go after many different areas of research and development gibson said the technology we re building is applicable broadly across many areas of biology and we ve always had in mind a plan to look for partnerships with companies we see as thought leaders under its latest deal recursion says it will receive an upfront payment of 150 million and roche and genentech may initiate up to 40 programs each of which if successfully developed and commercialized could yield more than 300 million in development as well as tiered royalties on net sales roche s global head of pharma partnering james sabry lauded the recursion partnership as a first step toward bringing new technology to bear on the pursuit of new drugs to combat disease this collaboration highlights the potential of technology to transform drug discovery and unlock previously unknown insights into complex disease in an unbiased way sabry said in a press statement we are excited about the opportunity this collaboration offers to help advance the development of medicines at scale since its launch in 2013 recursion has been focused on innovation aiming to upend the realm of clinical stage drug research melding robot driven automation with digital artificial intelligence to revolutionize how new medications are developed to battle some of the rarest and most challenging of human medical conditions recursion s innovative approach began as the core of doctoral research performed by gibson and his co founders the method relies on automating the once human intensive process of peering through a microscope to assess if a chemical compound s impact on a diseased cell is having a positive effect or advancing it toward being a healthy cell in a 2018 deseret news profile of the company president and chief operating officer tina larson explained that recursion has developed a technique to take a sample cell representing a genetic disorder and test it against the effects of hundreds of thousands of chemical compounds in a process that automates the visual evaluations and data gathering to allow for a lot of testing in a very short period of time we look at a disease we re interested in against every chemical we can access larson said we have so much robotics we can run hundreds of thousands of experiments very quickly in a way that you can t do with traditional biology the advanced automation identifies hits or impacts from particular chemical compounds on diseased cells that show promising results once identified the recursion team can hone in and pursue furthering the results through modifications to the compound gibson said in a tuesday deseret news interview the company now has the capacity to perform some 2 million of these experiments every week while recursion is poised to develop multiple new drugs with its collaborators the company also has four of its own potential pharmaceutical products in or nearing clinical trials gibson said gibson said the techniques employed in recursion s innovations represent a quantum leap in the approach to drug research and development likening the advancement to how google maps revolutionized the once tedious task of having to rely on a paper map and careful plotting to determine the best travel route from starting point to destination recursion s machine learning processes and robotic intensive automation also helps minimize one of the biggest challenges in the realm of drug research and development human error lux capital based in new york city and menlo park california was an early recursion investor participating in a 60 million round of funding for the company in 2017 in the 2018 deseret news profile zavain dar a principal with lux said a former stanford graduate school classmate of his put the company on lux s radar in 2016 and when he looked into it he was wildly impressed with recursion s approach their process is exceptionally intelligent dar said it removes human hubris and bias from the equation a factor that s plagued preclinical drug discovery research for decades now recursion is continuing to expand its local and global footprint after outgrowing two facilities at research park before taking over the 100 000 square foot former dick s sporting goods space at the gateway center in 2017 now it s not only doubling that space at gateway but working on a new chemistry facility at another building in downtown salt lake recursion also operates facilities in montreal and toronto canada and milpitas california recursion trades on the nasdaq exchange under the rxrx symbol at midday on tuesday recursion stock was trading for a little under 21 per share giving the company a market capitalization of

adjusted home sales gross margin the company has not provided projected first quarter and full fy 2022 home sales gross margin or a gaap reconciliation for forward looking adjusted home sales gross margin because such measure cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts on a forward looking basis since inventory write downs are based on future activity and observation and therefore cannot be projected for the first quarter and full fy 2022 the variability of these charges may have a potentially unpredictable and potentially significant impact on our first quarter and full fy 2022 home

income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda we define ebitda as net income before net interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda further adjusts ebitda by excluding the gain or loss on disposal of assets as well as impairment charges neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda are considered gaap measures and should not be considered as a substitute for net income cash flows from operating activities or other income or cash flow statement data these measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under gaap we strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure we believe ebitda and adjusted ebitda are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of financial performance and debt service capabilities and they are regularly used by the company for internal purposes including our capital budgeting process evaluating acquisition targets assessing performance and awarding incentive compensation because non gaap financial measures are not standardized ebitda and adjusted ebitda as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies it therefore may not be possible to compare our use of these non gaap financial measures with those used by other companies the following table contains a reconciliation of

have ops in her background too before she took over the data business she ran ice s clearing business prior to that she spent 14 years at nyse in derivatives business development and other roles before the ice acquisition including a year as ceo of the nyse liffe us market business line so maybe it s simply a matter of her varied experience that led her to the job and not an indication of the growing importance of data but keep in mind that nyse is one of the us consolidated tape administrators which has been a cash cow for it over the years and there is likely some anxiety over the possibility of that revenue line disappearing under the sec s sip shakeup to be clear exchanges will still get paid for the data that goes to the tapes but they ll no longer get an additional cut for operating them one way of looking at this is to say that they need someone with martin s chops to help devise new possibly data led leveraging her recent experience revenue lines to replace any impact from the sip shake up or they think the new sip environment presents opportunities and martin is best poised to identify and execute on them or if you want to be quite cynical combine this long term revenue line potentially diminishing with the fact that nyse is an old school equities listings marketplace that s facing new competition from the likes of the members exchange aka memx it could make this job a thankless unwinnable task finally what might be even more interesting is what becomes of cunningham while she s not leaving entirely the announcement makes vague references to her starting a new chapter that could simply mean taking a career break before moving to a new company or maybe it means she s being lined up for a different tba job recklessly speculating could it mean taking over for ice ceo jeff sprecher should he look to relinquish the throne unlikely or maybe she s going to run some sort of spinoff or head up a tba acquisition longshot time will tell on all fronts but if you have thoughts i m interested anthony malakian infopro digital com and speaking of the importance of data professionals give me a c give me a d give me an o h no i was speaking with the chief data officer of a large bank recently and one of the first things he told me was this what we re trying to do is put ourselves out of the cdo business and live in an environment where our value system is embodied in our technology platforms and our operating processes it s not often that you hear someone say that they want to put their current job function out of business but it s not so unheard of when it comes to cdos at the faangs the title of chief data officer doesn t exist granted that s also because they re given fancier titles than something as pedantic as cdo but these companies were born and bred in the cloud and data is used differently at these organizations than it is at highly regulated financial institutions which are run by legacy platforms and mainframes and which have gone through numerous acquisitions over decades his contention was that traditionally the cdo role was a regulatory and compliance function in the wake of the financial crisis and a data governance role the push has been in creating a single source of truth and consolidated implementations of organizational single sources of truth additionally is there referenceable integrity i e can this information be verified against public sources these things combined set the foundation that allows for completing regulatory and compliance functions while building proper data governance throughout the organization but that has to become table stakes as the need for more data and analytics tools grows the cdo needs to become more of a business enabler that spearheads things like ai ml projects and deploying event modeling techniques among a litany of other duties if we do our jobs right we can give you phenomenal insights on what s going on around the world he said when we expose the technologies and techniques that we re using to get from this legacy company to something where we don t have a cdo i get to go and do something else because we re good at it a second investment bank cdo echoed that sentiment saying that firms need to make the role less defensive and more offensive how do we move beyond the millions and billions we spend on reg compliance and lineage and justifying model explainability and moving it to a way that becomes meaningful for that cdo the answer was to become more proactive he said that about four years ago the job was all regulatory and all defensive what i ve tried to do is look at the literally 100 million that we were spending on various regulatory initiatives and i thought that there had to be a better way to do it he identified four work streams across different regulatory programs that were all conducting similar data functions he combined those work streams so that they were done once across the organization while it didn t solve all the bank s problems he said that it did help to cut costs and time working on governance after that i was given a bit more to do now today i have reg and i have commercialization what can i do with my client data my counterparty data can i create my own market data from the various bids and quotes that we do all day long the job now also includes the tech direction what that means is that the software development lifecycle or sdlc process at the bank now has a tollgate the cdo himself in some ways it sounds like he s consolidating power in the way robert moses created new york s roads and parks systems via the new york city department of parks and the triborough bridge and tunnel authority i have to sign off before any program for it to go forward if they re spending any money that involves touching an interface or a database or a migration of an application stack they have to come to my data design authority where we get to stipulate how they do it and where they do it the second cdo said so think about market data in the cloud that s how i prioritize what data goes into the cloud if they come and they re going to rebuild their app stack i say fine go build your app stack but decouple all the data and let s put it into the cloud so that everybody else can use it it s the enterprise s data not the exotic equities desk s data as i ve written about previously modern trading firms need to own the data and they need to contextualize it too that s how you create alpha throughout an organization sounds simple enough but if you don t have the foundation in place that the first cdo talked about you can t do this efficiently which drives up costs as the second cdo pointed out next phase whenever people talk about the cdo it feels like the conversation is always something along the lines of creating a data driven culture of getting senior management buy in of creating proper data governance and efficient taxonomies and other stuff that s well quite boring but how do you get the traders and portfolio managers and data scientists and analysts to see the value of their cdo it s not via the regulatory and compliance siloes and it s not by explaining the importance of data governance and whatnot it s by helping them to see data across the organization democratizing it and helping them to contextualize it and create something from it that has never been done before to do that the first bank cdo said you should never do things for one purpose and you should always leave budgeting room and time for ambitious forward looking projects we re all inundated with regulation but i try to ensure that we re never doing something for one reason if i m doing something for regulators because they re trying to achieve market transparency timeliness accuracy if i can t flip that into something that s good for the enterprise then they fail and i waste a lot of time and money just checking a box the cdo for a large asset manager notes that you also need to automate the governance process to allow business users to move faster process has become so heavy he said our initial goal was to make data available to everybody whoever wants to use it but just for running a three week poc i have a three month cycle of governance in order to get it approved and finally a third bank cdo said that the cdo role of the future cannot just be about the data as more workloads move to the cloud the role needs to evolve and become a key component of infrastructure projects and migrations you have to think about data not just in terms of content but also in terms of architectural components as we start to see all this blend together one of the key things is to really plan our infrastructure so it s not just about data you have to have access what we ve learned is that sometimes we can get all the data from a place but getting it there is only half the battle if we don t have all the right capabilities architecturally to enable people to use it then it s a long process i do hope that the conversation around the cdo role does evolve so often it s a boring back and middle office conversation but if data is king the cdo will need to be treated at least like a prince by the front office but first they must show they re worthy of being treated like royalty by bringing in royalties the image accompanying the story is fight between a tiger and a

conference call i ll start today s call with a review of the quarter and outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year before turning the call over to george who will view our financial results since joining the company as ceo in august my confidence in our differentiated business model has only increased we had a great third quarter which reinforces my excitement in the direction conn s headed and my belief in the enormous potential of our expanding retail digital and payment offerings overall i m proud of our impressive third quarter performance especially in this very fluid business environment during the third quarter earnings per share increased to 140 over the prior year to 0 60 per diluted share driven by accelerating retail sales momentum triple digit year over year e commerce growth and favorable credit performance on a year to date basis total retail sales have increased 26 3 to 972 7 million and earnings have increased to 3 34 per diluted share 10 stocks we like better than conns when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and conns wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of november 10 2021 our strong financial results are a testament to the hard work and commitment of our team members and the actions we are pursuing to create sustainable value for our shareholders the third quarter same store sales exceeded our expectations increasing 20 6 over the prior fiscal year and total sales were up 28 8 on a two year basis same store sales continue to accelerate in the third quarter increasing 9 7 compared to 3 2 in the second quarter and 1 8 in the first quarter we have growth underway demonstrating the rapid expansion of our e commerce business increasing demand across our major product categories and our success attracting a wider range of customers in fact retail sales grew across all payment options even as we lapped the significant growth we experienced last fiscal year in non conn s finance sales we are also benefiting from the assortment and supply chain decisions we made earlier this year to maintain a high level in stocks to support next day delivery at october 31 2021 over 80 of the items we carry were available for next day delivery even as sales increased at a faster pace than inventory we believe our in stock position and next day availability was a competitive differentiator in the third quarter and enable us to attract new customers while global supply chain challenges are expected to continue into the new year this year s results demonstrate that our teams are successfully managing these issues we believe our proactive inventory strategies will continue benefiting our business and competitive position going forward as expected third quarter retail gross margins were pressured by higher international freight costs that elevated the cost of goods sold our team continues to do a great job managing this fluid environment and optimizing our domestic distribution assets our nimble supply chain approach has also allowed us to reduce dependency on quad core we re also taking actions to support our margins by diversifying our sourcing base flexing our assortments reducing promotions and selectively increasing prices while we remain focused on providing customers with compelling value we will continue to closely monitor market conditions and margins across our categories and expect to continue to prudently pass along price increases to mitigate higher costs looking at our third quarter retail sales and performance in more detail we saw double digit sales growth across our top product categories within our appliance category sales remain strong and same store sales increased 21 9 over the prior year sales growth was driven by our assortment expansion favorable in stock position and rapid e commerce growth furniture and mattress same store sales increased 18 8 over the prior year more than any other category we have pivoted the furniture assortment to a creative sourcing action to maintain a consistent flow of products and ensure a broad range of next day delivery options for our customers in our mattress category we continue to see strong growth from our reinvented assortment launched earlier this year composed of leading national brands and our first private label brand dreamspot dreamspot continues to exceed our expectations and is our number one selling mattress brand in both units and dollars in addition our expanded mattress in a box assortment is driving our online growth in the category the same store sales within our consumer electronics category increased 28 2 over the prior year this success was driven primarily by higher tv unit sales as we leaned into the growth segments of premium picture quality and ultra large screen sizes in addition as a heavily penetrated category online tvs are benefiting from our rapid e commerce growth lastly black friday tv pricing started in october and contributed to a strong end to the third quarter from a channel perspective we ended the quarter with a record 19 2 million in e commerce sales with a 294 8 year over year increase in e commerce sales as a result of the investments we have been making to improve the functionality of our website and create a frictionless customer experience online while also leveraging our best in class next day white glove delivery capabilities we believe our long term e commerce growth opportunity is significant and we continue to invest heavily in our digital experience through increased customer conversion with year to date e commerce sales of 47 2 million we believe we are on track to grow e commerce sales to approximately 70 million this fiscal year we are in the early innings of our digital transformation and i believe we can significantly increase our e commerce penetration in the coming years to be in line with other comparable omnichannel retailers the performance of new stores is also contributing to our growth recently opened new stores added 8 2 to total retail sales growth for the quarter we ended the third quarter with 157 stores and we have opened 11 locations year to date primarily within the state of florida the performance of recently opened stores is encouraging and we anticipate accelerating our pace of store openings next fiscal year turning to our credit segment we enter the third quarter with favorable underlying credit trends reflecting the successful actions we took beginning in march of 2020 to carefully manage risk throughout the covid 19 pandemic as a result of these prudent actions we achieved a third quarter credit spread of 14 6 representing the highest spread in over 10 years as shown on slide 12 of our investor presentation since optimizing our credit strategy higher credit quality customers represent a greater percentage of conn s in house finance sales this has occurred even as these in house finance sales have increased in addition these new higher credit quality vintages are outperforming older vintages the weighted average origination credit score of sales finance has averaged 616 over the past four quarters compared to 608 for the fiscal year ended january 31 2020 our disciplined approach to risk has helped proactively manage our 60 plus day delinquency and related balances both indicators of portfolio health remain well below pre covid levels as a percent of the portfolio the 60 plus past to balance was 8 8 compared to 11 5 for the same period last fiscal year the balance of reage accounts as a percent of the portfolio was 18 3 compared to 28 2 for the same period last fiscal year while we expect delinquency and charge off trends to normalize in the coming quarter we believe they will remain below pre covid levels based on our enhanced credit strategy and current economic outlook as result i believe we are well positioned to target our credit spread of approximately 1 000 basis points going forward as you can see conn s emerged from the covid 19 pandemic stronger and better positioned for sustainable growth our confidence and our credit segment reflect the transformation we made during the pandemic to refine our credit strategy and add a new lease on partners in addition our expanded focus across a larger total addressable market of prime near prime and subprime customers is driving continued retail growth throughout all payment options this is especially encouraging as we have lapped significant growth in cash credit card and third party finance sales over the prior fiscal year in fact cash credit card and third party finance sales have increased 23 9 during the third quarter after increasing 32 7 in the third quarter last fiscal year overall i believe conn s is uniquely positioned to navigate the current macro environment and deliver strong retail and credit results next fiscal year we are entering the fourth quarter with the best credit performance in our recent history reflected by the highest credit spread in over 10 years as well as favorable 60 plus day delinquency and reage trends in addition our enhanced credit strategy which relies more heavily on our third party partners allows us to capture incremental customers regardless of where they fall on the credit spectrum to conclude in my prepared remarks we are well positioned heading into the fourth quarter because of our stable credit segment and growing retail business overall retail trends remain strong reflecting favorable consumer demand and the growth strategies we have put in place in addition providing flexible and affordable payment options is an important component of our value proposition we believe this creates a unique competitive advantage that helps our customers better navigate the current inflationary period i believe our recent results demonstrate the powerful value proposition we have created and the strong position we are in to navigate the dynamic retail and credit environment our impressive third quarter and year to date performance robust in stock inventory levels and growing e commerce capabilities are encouraging and we are on track to deliver significant revenue growth and record earnings this fiscal year as we remain focused on the future i am confident we are headed in the right direction i look forward to updating investors on our enhanced strategic growth plan and long term financial outlook at an in person investor day in houston early next year more details will be announced in the coming weeks and i look forward to sharing our exciting strategies aimed at creating significant value for our shareholders finally i want to use this opportunity to thank our team members for your steadfast commitment to conn thank you for your continued support and service now let me turn the call over to george to review our financial performance george bchara chief financial officer thanks chandra i m encouraged by the positive momentum underway in our business and our strong position heading into the fourth quarter on a consolidated basis total revenues were 405 5 million for the third quarter representing a 21 4 increase from the same period last fiscal year we reported a strong third quarter net income of 0 60 per diluted share compared to net income of 0 25 per diluted share for the same period last fiscal year looking at our retail segment in more detail total retail revenues for the third quarter were 334 8 a 28 8 increase from the same period last fiscal year higher retail revenue was driven by an increase in same store sales of 20 6 and new store growth during the third quarter conn s credit sales increased 31 which we achieved by capturing a greater share of wallet and a larger amount of higher credit quality customers within our core demographic rather than by approving applicants further down the credit spectrum cash credit card and third party finance sales grew 23 9 during the third quarter of the fiscal year 2022 this increase was driven by a 64 increase in lease to own sales as we successfully leveraged our platform of integrated partners we continue to believe we have opportunities to increase sales across all our financing options retail gross margin for the third quarter is a 36 8 decrease of 150 basis points from the same period last year the year over year decrease in retail gross margin was primarily driven by the impact of increased production costs as a result of higher freight partially offset by an increase in sales of higher margin products higher retail sales helped leverage retail sg a expense during the quarter as a percent of retail sales sg a expenses were 30 2 for the third quarter compared to 32 4 for the same period last fiscal year retail segment operating income was 22 5 million compared to 15 2 million for the same period last fiscal year due to higher retail sales and improved operating leverage partially offset by lower retail gross margin turning to our credit segment finance charges and other revenues were 70 6 million for the third quarter the 4 9 decline from the same period last fiscal year was primarily a result of the 15 2 reduction in the average balance of the customer s receivable portfolio the credit quality of our portfolio has improved significantly due in part to the prudent derisking actions we began implementing in march 2020 our strong credit results continue to show that our receivable portfolio is performing well annual net charge offs as a percent of the average portfolio balance was 8 at the end of the third quarter compared to 14 7 for the same period last year during the third quarter the credit provision for bad debts was 26 5 million compared to 27 4 million last fiscal year the year over year decline was due to an improvement in credit quality which resulted in lower charge offs during the quarter partially offset by a greater increase in the allowance credit segment income before taxes was 1 8 million compared to a 2 7 million loss for the same period last fiscal year primarily due to lower interest expense a lower provision for bad debts and improvements in our credit performance i am pleased to report that this is the fourth consecutive quarter of profitable credit segment income before taxes as our portfolio begins to grow we will continue to focus on controlling risk limiting portfolio volatility and achieving approximately a thousand basis points of annual credit spread while supporting our long term growth opportunity consolidated sg a expenses for the third quarter were 138 1 million the 15 9 million increase from the prior year period was due to a higher variable operating expenses associated with sales growth additional new stores and an increase in advertising costs as we lapped prior year reductions due to the covid 19 pandemic turning now to our balance sheet and capital position we ended the third quarter with a strong balance sheet and capital position as we continue to benefit from significant year over year growth in cash in third party finance sales and robust cash collections on our customers receivable portfolio this has produced meaningful operating cash flow over the past seven quarters which we have used to further reduce debt and strengthen our balance sheet we ended the third quarter with 424 1 million in net debt compared to 615 2 million at the end of the third quarter of last year in addition net debt as a percent of the ending portfolio has declined to approximately 37 7 at the end of the third quarter compared to approximately 48 2 at the end of the third quarter of last year in november we close our 10th abs transaction since reentering the abs market in 2015 the terms of the 2021 a transaction reflect the highest advance rate of 85 75 and the lowest all in cost of funds of approximately 3 9 since we reentered the abs market we believe completing this transaction which resulted in net proceeds of 377 8 million further strengthens our liquidity position well into the next fiscal year in addition our proven abs platform continues to demonstrate our ability to access the capital markets i am pleased with our success in strengthening the balance sheet derisking the business and executing our growth initiatives these efforts have built underlying strength in our business and driven the strong sales momentum we have experienced so far this year before we open the call for questions i want to review our expectations for the full year and fourth quarter and provide some initial thoughts on our business as we head into the next fiscal year starting with retail sales early black friday pricing combined with concerns related to product availability caused an earlier start to the holiday season which we believe pull forward some retail sales into the third quarter we believe our marketing and promotions were well positioned to capitalize on these trends and we continue to expect mid teens same store sales growth for the full year for the current fiscal year we expect finance charges and other revenues to be down year over year primarily due to a lower balance of customer receivables given the ongoing issues related to the global supply chain we now expect full year retail gross margin to be down approximately 30 to 50 basis points resulting in retail gross margin being down approximately 100 to 150 basis points in the fourth quarter we continue to believe sg a expenses will be up on a two year basis primarily driven by new stores as we anticipate continued investments in our growth strategies to be largely offset by tighter cost controls the fourth quarter provision is expected to be up versus the prior year period driven primarily by portfolio growth in addition the provision in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year benefited from an approximately 20 million reduction in our allowance primarily driven by improved economic conditions as well as a reduction in the balance of accounts that received the covid 19 deferral as we look into next year we expect to produce positive same store sales despite a fluid economic environment we also anticipate accelerating our pace of new store openings in the fiscal year 2023 above the 12 stores we will open this fiscal year retail gross margins are expected to remain under pressure next year driven primarily by the ongoing impacts of the global supply chain we anticipate our provision next year to increase primarily due to portfolio growth from higher sales of conn s in house financing and a smaller reduction in the economic reserve within our allowance we plan to provide more insight into next year s expectations as well as our long term financial and operating target at our investor day early next year overall we expect fiscal 2023 to be another strong year for conn s and i m excited by the direction we are headed finally i want to share my thanks to all our team members for their continued hard work service and dedication so with this overview chandra and i are happy to take your questions operator please open the call up to questions questions answers operator thank you at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session our first question comes from the line of kyle joseph with jefferies please proceed with your question kyle joseph jefferies analyst hey good morning guys thanks for having me on and taking my questions i just have to around e com chandra i think you talked about the growth opportunity there but longer term can you give us any sort of sense or goalposts of how you think about the e com as a percentage of sales for the consolidated business and then as a follow up to that on e com sales could you give us any sense of the financing mix does it mirror kind of the consolidated portfolio or do you see more call it prime or lease to own online chandra holt chief executive officer and president yeah good morning kyle thanks for the question we re very excited about our performance in e commerce delivering almost 300 growth this quarter and we ve invested and you can see that that growth happening and we do believe there s an opportunity to continue to invest to further drive that business and we do believe that we can be in line from a penetration standpoint with other similar retailers within our categories so we do think there s a significant upside in the e commerce business from a payment standpoint and a financing standpoint what we see online is a mix that s fairly similar to what we see in stores we see a little bit higher from a cash standpoint and a little bit higher from a con standpoint with synchrony being a little bit smaller but overall fairly similar to what we see in stores kyle joseph jefferies analyst got it very helpful and then one follow up for me just in terms of the margin pressure and go with the supply chain issues i know there s a lot of uncertainty and it s hard to predict but and any sort of visibility as to is the one you would expect those pressures i know you talked about them continuing into 2022 but is there any sort of outlook as to when you would expect those pressures to ease chandra holt chief executive officer and president yeah we do as we said in the prepared remarks we do expect international freight rates to be a headwind for next year and continue into next year we are starting to see it normalize so we re seeing an increase for quite a while and it s starting to normalize and seen a little bit of reduction but we do anticipate it continuing to be a headwind for the foreseeable future and don t have a clear line of sight as to when that will come back down kyle joseph jefferies analyst great thank you very much for answering my questions chandra holt chief executive officer and president thanks kyle operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rick nelson with stephens inc please proceed with your question rick nelson stephens inc analyst thanks a lot good morning like to follow up on the provision guidance in the 2q call about 9 weeks ago i believe you were guided to a lower provision in the second half now you re guiding to a higher provision for the fourth quarter i m curious what the drivers are there george bchara chief financial officer good morning rick this is george so the provision was down year over year in the third quarter consistent with our expectation but as we think about the fourth quarter we re now expecting a greater increase in the portfolio which is driving a greater increase in the allowance this year versus last year i would also remind you that if you look at the as i mentioned in my prepared remarks if you look at the fourth quarter last year we benefited from a fairly significant reduction in the allowance in the fourth quarter of last year that we don t expect to see this year rick nelson stephens inc analyst thank you for that also would like to give some perspective on the health of your credit customer we ve seen a customer seeing a lot of inflation with higher food gas prices and necessities rising to you have any concerns there from either a sales standpoint or a credit standpoint chandra holt chief executive officer and president yeah good question so right now credit is performing well and we continue to adapt our underwriting in anticipation of a normalized credit environment if you look on page 5 of the investor presentation you can see that we re clearly underwriting to a higher quality credit customer which reduces the volatility we re still underwriting to a 1 000 basis points of spread but it reduces the volatility because we re underwriting to a higher quality level so we feel good about our strategy in credit i think the other thing as it relates to sales i m excited about our investor day that we re gonna have at the beginning of next year i think the one thing you ll see us focus on is running a very stable credit business and utilizing a more modern value proposition to drive the sales versus increasing risk within credit to drive the sales george bchara chief financial officer the only thing i would add to that rick is that if you look at the portfolio health today we re in as good a position as we ve been in a long time with reage percent down significantly year over year tdr percentage down and 60 day delinquencies so heading into or heading out of the pandemic we re positioned from a balance sheet standpoint and a really good position rick nelson stephens inc analyst ok thanks for that i also like to follow up on the quarter sales trend you imagine some pull forward can you talk about what the same store sales are tracking here in the holiday quarter chandra holt chief executive officer and president yeah demand remains strong into the fourth quarter so our value proposition continues to work and is strong in in stock position has set us up for success in q4 and our abilities to deliver our sales guidance for the full year seems very much achievable and we feel confident that we ll deliver a good q4 rick nelson stephens inc analyst ok very good thanks a lot and good luck george bchara chief financial officer thanks rick chandra holt chief executive officer and president thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brad thomas with keybanc capital markets please proceed with your question brad thomas keybanc capital markets analyst hi chandra and george and good morning i wanted to follow up on an earlier question that touched on e commerce and chandra just as you get more time under your belt with conn i was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the investments that you think might be necessary to help accelerate e commerce growth or if you feel like the business has that in place and what that timeline might look like to help accelerate growth dovetailing off the strong momentum you have here in 3q chandra holt chief executive officer and president yeah yeah great question so when i look at the e commerce business i kind of carried upon partners two different segments so you ve got the front end of the customer facing website and then you ve got the back end with a supply chain and the delivery and when i look at our e commerce business we re already very strong from a back end standpoint we have next day white glove delivery which is very unique to us and our strong in stock position that we have at the end of q3 over 80 of the items that we have available to sell we could get customers the next day and when you compare that competitively it was a big advantage for us in q3 so i feel really good about the supply chain component and our ability to continue to utilize and replicate our supply chain going forward from a front end standpoint as where we have work to do and we ve invested in improving the functionality of our website which is what s driving a lot of the growth right now and when you look at the website there s there are two there are really three components it s traffic conversion and average order value and the big opportunity that we re focusing on is conversion and that there are things that you do to invest in conversion are around site functionality it s around the shipping speed we already have shipping pricing our retail pricing so we know all the things that we need to do to continue to drive that business and we ll continue to invest there we are in the early stages of our transformation so we had over 5 penetration so we have a ways to go but a lot of upside for the future brad thomas keybanc capital markets analyst really helpful chandra thank you and george if i could just follow up on rick s question just about the fourth quarter if we take your comp guidance mathematically at face value to be it mid teens comp for the year would imply that the fourth quarter decelerates pretty significantly and might be 9 to get you to a 16 growth for the full year is there anything you re seeing that would suggest you get that level of a slowdown in the fourth quarter and any more color that you d be able to share about how things are tracking or how you re expecting them to play out george bchara chief financial officer i mean i think as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we positioned ourselves this year for an earlier holiday season and we certainly saw the benefits of that winning in october and that was reflected in the third quarter results in november was strong it was just slower than the trends for the third quarter and were anticipating that that along with december will result in a strong fourth quarter but somewhat less strong than that than the third quarter from a sales standpoint brad thomas keybanc capital markets analyst yes sure that s helpful and then george the last one for me just as we think about sg a for 2020 any broad strokes you could help us work with as we think about how growth may play out for next year george bchara chief financial officer we didn t put out full guidance for next year brad so i mean i think we re continuing to focus on investing in new stores investing in people in the right place but we think that with the growth of the business next year we should be able to leverage sg a and we ve said that before brad thomas keybanc capital markets analyst very helpful thank you all so much and good luck this holiday george bchara chief financial officer thanks brad operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian nagel with oppenheimer and company please proceed with your question brian nagel oppenheimer and company analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions george bchara chief financial officer good morning brian nagel oppenheimer and company analyst so the first question just to follow up on brad s question there is in the comments just with regard to the pull forward in holiday demand here as you look across your store your merchandise mix you re recognizing there are certain categories are probably lend more to holiday purchases than others are you seeing as you try to size the impact of this pull forward are you seeing different trends within different categories depending on their nature relative to holiday demand chandra holt chief executive officer and president yeah so overall if you look at what happened in q3 so we saw an acceleration through the quarter so in august we posted a 17 5 comp september 18 6 in october with a 26 7 so you saw the big lift in october and when you look at the categories that drove that you re right that the categories that are more holiday sensitive did drive did have a larger acceleration than in some other categories specifically within consumer electronics tv black friday pricing went out in october which it did last year a little bit later but when earlier this year and the breadth of items that were on sale were far greater than what we saw last year so overall we saw an acceleration in october across categories but there were some more holiday sensitive categories that we saw a greater increase in october than others brian nagel oppenheimer and company analyst thanks chandra that s helpful then the second question i have with regard to the freight costs so a headwind once talked about this is obviously not unique to cost but headwind to gross margins through q3 and george you talked about being a continued headwind the fourth quarter the question is i guess how do you see this progressing and probably more importantly are there levers that conn s can pull in the nearer term to help offset or manage some of these freight costs chandra holt chief executive officer and president yeah so as we said we believe that the freight the international freight costs will continue to be a headwind to margin but the team is working very hard to mitigate as much as we can so both the utilization within our supply chain as well as sourcing activities as well as prudently passing on price increases as we feel that we can and given the market conditions we re balancing all of that along with continuing to try to drive the growth so we can leverage sg a and ultimately deliver operating margin leverage so there s a lot of puts and takes it s a fluid environment but i do believe that the team is keeping the customer at the center of their decisions as well as a shareholder and making good decisions for the business in the long run brian nagel oppenheimer and company analyst thank you i appreciate it operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question and answer session i ll turn the floor back to ms holt for any final comments chandra holt chief executive officer and president i just want to thank everyone for your time today and your interest in conn s i look forward to speaking with everyone at our investor day in houston early next year and lastly i wanted to wish everyone a happy holiday season and a happy new year thank you operator duration 41 minutes call participants chandra holt chief executive officer and president george bchara chief financial officer kyle joseph
