washington november 20 ani the us should be cautious and hesitant in delivering more military support to pakistan such as the f 16s where there is no guarantee that they will be used competently dr sajjan m gohel the international security director at the asia pacific foundation think tank and marcus andreopoulos a senior research fellow at the asia pacific foundation writing in war on the rocks wotr said that by fulfilling pakistan s wishes on the f 16 the biden administration may be hoping it will help shore up the fragile governing coalition from outside interference however it is the machinations of pakistan s military that remain constant and will continue to shape what transpires within the country the biden administration authorized the sale of military equipment worth usd 450 million to pakistan to enhance the air to ground capabilities of the country s current stock of f 16 fighter aircraft this most recent sale is the latest chapter in a decades long back and forth between washington and islamabad in which bilateral relations have fluctuated erratically said gohel and andreopoulos the contorted situation of the f 16 raises a perennial yet fundamental dilemma on whether washington can ever really achieve its objectives with pakistan regarding cooperation in preventing afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for terrorist groups curtailing nuclear proliferation ending hostilities with india and containing china s expanding clout in south asia the answers will likely turn out to be disappointing as they have in the past in part this is because multiple us administrations pass laws with the intention of taking a principled stand in holding pakistan accountable for its ties to terrorism or nuclear proliferation but then subsequently seek to find workarounds when there is an impending strategic security concern pakistan has understood this all too well reported wotr for pakistan s establishment statecraft of strategic depth outweighs the economic and social challenges that continue to engulf the country and which in turn heighten insecurity in the region the security ramifications of how the united states handles the f 16 matter carry enormous geopolitical significance ranging from nuclear conflict conventional warfare counter terrorism and containing chinese influence said gohel and andreopoulos the history of us negotiations with pakistan illustrates that the temporary tactical and transactional nature of the relationship has enabled pakistan to pursue its adversarial military doctrine of strategic depth in afghanistan to hedge against india in which the f 16s became a key tool while also furthering the ambitions of a nuclear weapons programme f 16 refurbishments are not going to resolve pakistan s crippling economic and humanitarian crisis and may instead contribute to the cycle of military opaqueness and intransigence over the stable democratic civilian rule reported wotr washington should stop using f 16s to try and leverage security and non proliferation commitments from pakistan as pakistan is mired in political economic and environmental instability the risk is that providing islamabad with more weapons will be counterproductive because they exacerbate regional tensions said gohel and andreopoulos instead washington should recognize that these sales and upgrades prop up actors in the country that sometimes work against american interests all but ensuring that clashes over the sale of this jet and other american hardware will continue long into the future moreover the nuclear risk is a by product of pakistan s instability which has occurred directly due to the troubling relationship its military sustains with violent extremists pakistan s commitment to preserve its nuclear arsenal is also configured to level the defence battlefield with india ironically instead of being a conventional deterrent the f 16 could instead be used to carry nuclear warheads expressing apprehensions over the biden administration s decision to upgrade pakistan s f 16 fleet india s external affairs minister s jaishankar implied that the primary use of the aircraft would be to wage war with india jaishankar s concerns are not without merit tensions between pakistan and india ignited in february 2019 after the jaish e mohammed terrorist group carried out a suicide bombing in jammu and kashmir that killed 40 indian security personnel pakistan had deployed f 16s against india as opposed to the chinese built jf 17 thunder that they initially claimed to have used violating the terms of sale from the united states ani

a man is suing a branson summer camp claiming its operators lied to him and his parents when they signed a settlement of sex abuse claims against a camp counselor branson mo a tennessee man filed a lawsuit friday claiming that operators of the kanakuk camps in branson missouri lied to him and his parents while persuading them to sign a settlement over sexual abuse by a camp counselor logan yandell 27 of hendersonville tennessee and his parents reached a confidential settlement with kanakuk in 2010 that included a non disclosure agreement after yandell was abused by peter newman who is serving two life sentences for sexually abusing multiple children while working for the christian summer camps the lawsuit names kanakuk ministries kanakuk ceo joe white kanakuk heritage inc westchester fire insurance company and a john doe a statement from kanakuk said the company just received the lawsuit on friday and does not comment on pending litigation we will respond further if or when appropriate the company said in the meantime we continue to pray for all who have been affected by pete newman s behavior yandell was sexually abused while attending the summer camp and other activities between 2005 and 2008 the lawsuit alleges that kanakuk officials claimed they did not know about newman s sexual abuse of children prior to his arrest but the yandell family later learned that wasn t true in december 2021 the conservative online news outlet the dispatch reported that newman s supervisor will cunningham recommended in 2003 that newman be fired because of reports of child sexual abuse including participating in several activities with children while nude counseling them in a hot tub and sleeping alone with children the lawsuit filed friday contains an affidavit from cunningham confirming that he wanted newman fired instead white overruled the suggestion and promoted newman to camp director according to the lawsuit the family would not have signed the settlement and non disclosure agreement if they had known that kanakuk officials had lied to them brian kent one of the family s attorneys said friday he said company officials took advantage of the family knowing that the yandells were really trying to deal with making sure their child is ok and getting him better this was a clear effort by joe white and kanakuk to advise them this is something they should do and they lied to them in order to get them to sign the lawsuit is not a class action but kent said it s possible more of newman s victims will file similar lawsuits because of the new information the associated press generally does not name victims of sexual abuse but yandell is named in the lawsuit and has publicly discussed his case one of the reasons the family decided to file the lawsuit 12 years after signing the settlement was to allow yandell to get his voice back and have his voice heard kent said

washington the sudden collapse of one of the world s largest cryptocurrency exchanges rattled the nation s capital this week as lawmakers grappled with the wide ranging fallout and began to confront the consequences of neglecting the surging financial sector only a few weeks ago top democrats and republicans alike had been cashing campaign checks and working side by side with the vanguards of the industry including ftx founder sam bankman fried as they labored to craft new regulation in the frenetic cutting edge digital space instead bankman fried unexpectedly became a potential case study of the costs of congressional inaction while washington dithered he appeared to place risky bets that incinerated his fortune jeopardized billions of dollars in silicon valley capital and upended an entire ecosystem of cryptocurrency start ups the lawyer tapped to lead ftx in restructuring who previously oversaw the bankruptcy of enron described the situation thursday as a complete failure of corporate controls investigators in the united states and abroad have opened probes into bankman fried and his holdings the treasury department has quietly placed calls to other large crypto exchanges to assess the risks of a broader contagion and a slew of congressional committees have readied their own reviews including a house inquiry announced wednesday that could see bankman fried testify under oath next month in the process federal policymakers have been left to ask themselves a familiar if uncomfortable question could they have prevented a crisis if they had paid close attention sooner over the years the regulators sorta invited them in these crypto companies and we ve seen the damage they ve caused said sen sherrod brown d ohio the chairman of the senate banking committee brown said he is exploring the need for comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation something that congress repeatedly has proposed as the sector grew yet time and again has failed to achieve in the face of staunch industry lobbying in that time a wide array of crypto firms have experienced meteoric rises and once unfathomable collapses on the promise of great wealth that didn t always materialize still brown remained bullish that congress could rein in cryptocurrency companies that have put investors large and small at risk they need to be held accountable in some ways the tumult around ftx tells the story of a capitol often outpaced by the deft technology giants ostensibly under its watch from the burst of the dot com bubble at the turn of the millennium to the rampant privacy mishaps at facebook decades later federal policymakers historically have been slow to anticipate the troubles of the digital age only after massive costly scandals have lawmakers and regulators been stirred to action sometimes with less than desirable results the nascent world of cryptocurrency where digital tokens replace dollars investments and payments all without the need for traders governments or banks has presented perhaps the most complicated challenge to date as an entirely new financial system has come online washington has been forced to choose whether to institute stringent rules on crypto or stay out of silicon valley s way the u s government largely has adopted the latter approach much to the relief of crypto companies executives and investors that has enabled the rapid growth and soaring valuations of bitcoin a wide array of related currencies and an entire ecosystem of firms to support them until recently that included ftx a marketplace for buying and selling tokens that boasted its own currency an exchange that at its height was the third largest in the world but the peril of that approach came into sharp relief as ftx began to unravel questions about its finances and whether bankman fried used ftx deposits in potentially illegal ways prompted large investors to sell off their ftx issued tokens known as ftt with nowhere to turn and losses mounting bankman fried filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy last week setting off a cascading effect that has hammered silicon valley venture firms and start ups that depended on ftx other crypto exchanges soon after found themselves at risk with their own assets tied up in the fallout john j ray iii who became chief executive of ftx in bankruptcy told a federal court thursday that he had never seen in his career such an absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here he couldn t figure out what assets the company owned he struggled to calculate what the firm owed and to whom he could not even cobble together a full list of employees who had worked there ray previously supervised the 23 billion dissolution of enron and its recovery of funds for creditors yet he suggested the ftx meltdown was in some ways worse from compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals this situation is unprecedented he wrote in the court filing on capitol hill the fiasco quickly captured unexpectedly wide bipartisan attention the shift began tuesday as lawmakers sorted out the repercussions of the 2022 elections at a news conference normally reserved for democratic leaders to lob political barbs and issue policy announcements rep hakeem jeffries d n y the caucus chair said the party had plenty of priorities in the waning weeks of the year and the situation related to the cryptocurrency industry will be one of them the house financial services committee led by rep maxine waters d calif on wednesday announced plans to hold a hearing on ftx potentially featuring bankman fried s testimony unfortunately this event is just one out of many examples of cryptocurrency platforms that have collapsed just this past year lamented waters describing an urgency to act across the capitol the fallout from ftx quickly overshadowed what normally might be a somnambulant hearing in the senate banking committee about credit unions sen patrick j toomey pa its soon retiring top republican seized on the moment to highlight several high profile collapses of crypto companies including one prominent example last week a reference to ftx if not explicitly by name toomey previously has purchased cryptocurrency assets his personal financial disclosures show but he focused on the repercussions when a firm like ftx which was based in the bahamas can run roughshod over the u s economy as a general matter the failure of congress to pass legislation in this space and the failure of regulators to provide clear guidance has created ambiguity that has driven developers and entrepreneurs overseas he warned and we ve just once again seen how that ends in recent years democrats and republicans at various turns have tried to regulate cryptocurrency introducing a range of measures to empower federal agencies and pursue abuses including fraudulent coin offerings and international money laundering they ve also held a number of major hearings even grilling facebook ceo mark zuckerberg in 2019 over his company s doomed crypto effort known as libra law enforcement agencies meanwhile have prosecuted some of the worst actors unveiling charges in august for example against 11 individuals allegedly involved in a 300 million pyramid scheme and president biden himself recently has been engaged signing an executive order in march that offered an early road map for how washington might approach cryptocurrency regulation but the government at times has faced blowback for acting too aggressively this march for example a bipartisan group of lawmakers known as the congressional blockchain caucus took aim at the securities and exchange commission over its attempts to gather information from unregulated cryptocurrency and blockchain industry participants its signatories included rep tom emmer r minn a caucus co chair who has argued in the past that the sec has misused its authorities to assert jurisdiction over cryptocurrency emmer is set to serve in a key house leadership role under a republican majority next year appearing at an industry conference on wednesday the gop lawmaker urged congress not to adopt a wet blanket of regulation in the wake of the ftx crisis we need to use the stage that is congress to promote all of you beyond the walls of the capitol added emmer whose comments were first reported by the publication coindesk people need to understand more out there that they shouldn t be afraid of this his office declined further comment adding to the challenge the government has faced an onslaught of lobbying from an increasingly powerful and profitable industry since january alone cryptocurrency exchanges and their advocates have spent more than 14 8 million to influence regulators and lawmakers according to lobbying data compiled by opensecrets bankman fried and other ftx leaders including ryan salame the company s co chief executive also donated more than 70 million in the 2022 election the analysis showed that made them the third largest contributor in the two year cycle opensecrets found the senate has trouble keeping up with things that lobbyists prefer the senate not keep up with said sen elizabeth warren d mass a veteran of the 2008 financial crisis after which she oversaw congressional efforts to keep watch over big banks reflecting on the reasons for congressional inaction she added i have said for a very long time now that we need better regulation in this space on capitol hill ftx and its lobbyists actively guided lawmakers in writing legislation that would govern the company and its industry rivals a regular in washington bankman fried personally provided input to sens debbie stabenow d mich and john boozman r ark who introduced a bill this year that would shift some crypto oversight to the commodity futures trading commission the cftc regulates complicated financial instruments known as derivatives as well as futures contracts for agricultural products the crypto industry generally prefers that agency over the sec which governs stock and bond markets and is perceived as more aggressive lawmakers and administration officials have split over which regulator should have jurisdiction partly a reflection of the complexity in defining crypto assets whether they are commodities or securities under law as she raced to a senate vote this week stabenow acknowledged she had solicited feedback from all the stakeholders including sam on cryptocurrency regulation a beneficiary of more than 20 000 in campaign donations from bankman fried this election the senator added she was extremely surprised of course we all were extremely surprised and disappointed at the downfall of ftx but stabenow still stood by her legislation as an antidote to the risk and abuse seemingly rife in cryptocurrency that s exactly why we need our legislation so the cftc can proactively provide regulation and transparency to consumers other lawmakers though feared that the bill had become tainted by ftx s influence brown the leader of the senate banking committee specifically acknowledged concern that bankman fried and his industry allies had too great a hand in shaping the legislation noting it needs major improvement i think you look at any of the legislation any legislation written here always the fingerprints of the big banks in this case the big crypto companies are always all over it brown continued that s the fight i make every day in this committee and it s the fight we ll make on this as the ftx collapse rippled through the crypto world the biden administration urged congress to act on wednesday treasury secretary janet l yellen issued a public warning about dangers to the economy as she called on lawmakers to fill in the remaining regulatory gaps she said the agency s prior reports had identified a wide range of risks that ultimately were at the center of the crypto market stresses observed over the past week behind the scenes top treasury officials have been in close contact with major cryptocurrency exchanges and other companies in recent days to assess the ftx fallout according to an aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the conversations some lawmakers meanwhile signaled they were exploring a raft of new proposals in the hopes of protecting americans who buy own and sell cryptocurrency sen ron wyden d ore a tech expert and leader of the tax focused senate finance committee said in an interview that he planned to put forward a consumer protection package targeting cryptocurrency in the coming days the lawmaker worked with other democrats and republicans last year in instituting the first ever tax reporting requirements for digital tokens sen mark warner d va said this week he had tried to reserve judgment given the promise of the technology but the lawmaker another top member of the banking committee stressed there s a reason we have rules around investor and consumer protection safety and soundness and the prevention of financial crime as she left the tuesday banking hearing sen cynthia lummis r wyo similarly stressed that the ftx meltdown left congress no choice but to legislate lummis who once took to the senate floor to thank god for bitcoin has put forward her own sweeping bill that would shift more oversight to the cftc i think it s really important now that senators really focus on digital assets she said in the past it s been easy to put that on the back burner and address other issues that were more front burner issues this is now a front burner issue we have put ourselves at a regulatory disadvantage
by kate abnett shadia nasralla and gloria dickie sharm el sheikh egypt reuters negotiators at the cop27 climate summit in egypt neared a breakthrough deal on saturday for a fund to help poor countries being ravaged by the impacts of global warming but remained locked over how to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions driving them with a final climate accord already more than a day overdue representatives of nearly 200 nations were anxious for an agreement they could bill as a step forward in the fight against climate change we have to be fast here now but not fast towards a bad result not fast in terms of accepting something that we then spend years regretting said eamon ryan ireland s environment minister frans timmermans the european union s climate policy chief said ministers from the regional bloc were prepared to walk away if the accord is not ambitious enough we d rather have no decision than a bad decision the outcome of the two week summit in the resort town of sharm el sheikh is a test of worldwide resolve to fight global warming even as a war in europe and rampant consumer inflation distract international attention a cop27 draft agreement released on saturday reaffirmed past commitments to limit global warming to 1 5 degrees celsius to prevent the worst of climate change but offered little evidence of increased ambition to make the emissions cuts needed to reach that goal small victory days of tense bargaining between wealthy and developing nations at the summit yielded a proposal on saturday to set up a fund to benefit countries coping with irreparable damage from severe storms floods droughts and wildfires rich countries including the united states and those in europe have for decades resisted the idea of a so called loss and damage fund for fear it would open them up to legal liability for their historic greenhouse gas emissions we are satisfied that at least there is something on the plate now pakistan s nabeel munir lead negotiator for the g77 group of developing countries said about the proposal barbados negotiator avinash persaud called the proposal a small victory for humankind that had resulted from leadership by small island nations and solidarity from the rest of the world recognizing the increasing impacts of warming now we need to redouble efforts behind an energy transport and agriculture transition that will limit these climate losses and damages in the future said persaud referring to a shift to cleaner forms of energy and sustainable farming negotiators said the idea had won broad support but would need to be coupled with increased ambition to cut the emissions that are driving global warming it is not acceptable that we will fund the consequences of climate change while not also committing to working on the actual consequences of the emissions said romina pourmokhtari sweden s climate minister china and the united states the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters have so far been mum on the proposal fossil fuels the eu had boosted the discussions earlier in the week by offering to support the loss and damage fund provided large polluters including china pay into it and that countries also ramp up efforts to cut emissions it was not yet clear if the eu s conditions would be met the cop27 draft agreement released by the u n s climate office on saturday for example did not contain a reference requested by india and the eu to phase down use of all fossil fuels it instead asked countries to phase down only coal the most polluting fossil fuel as agreed under last year s glasgow climate pact that is certainly a disappointment given the importance of doing so with all fossil fuels to stay below 1 5c said david waskow international climate director for the world resources institute during eleventh hour negotiations saturday night the united states went further to propose a phase out of fossil fuels according to three sources familiar with the matter oil and gas rich african and middle eastern countries including saudi arabia have opposed language targeting fossil fuels and were against the u s proposal in an attempt to close the yawning gap between current climate pledges and the far deeper cuts needed to avert disastrous climate change the draft also requested that countries which have not yet done so upgrade their 2030 emissions cutting targets by the end of 2023 but some negotiators are keen to see the draft require upgrades not just next year but every year for the rest of the decade to ensure emissions drop as quickly as scientists say is needed to avert the worst impacts of climate change some campaigners said the draft offered some positive elements but was still wanting in ambition complicating matters u s special climate envoy john kerry a powerful force in climate diplomacy tested positive for covid 19 on friday after days of bilateral in person meetings with counterparts from china the eu and others kerry could not attend in person negotiations on saturday but was participating in bilaterals by video phone the u s state department said for daily comprehensive coverage on cop27 in your inbox sign up for the reuters sustainable switch nyse

expected to raise its cash rate at the upcoming meeting with 15 out of 23 analysts polled by reuters forecasting a 75bps move while the rest lean towards 50bps the calls for a hike come amid hot

anz suggested the rbnz has already proven that it s not in the least afraid to go its own way and the global tilt towards slower hikes is unlikely to play a significant part in the decision we are forecasting the ocr to peak at 5 0 via another 75 bp hike in february on a let s just get it done basis if data cools more rapidly than expected the rbnz could well slow the pace at that point eurozone flash pmi wed expectations are for november s manufacturing pmi to fall to 46 0 from 46 4 services to decline to 48 0 from 48 6 leaving the composite at 47 07 vs prev 47 3 the prior report was characterised by a deeper decline into contractionary territory as both manufacturing and service industries lost ground s p global observed after a weak third quarter of pmi and official gdp data the latest survey results for the start of the fourth quarter suggest the eurozone economy is now headed for a winter recession this time around analysts at investec suggest that october s reading

october we expect economic conditions to remain weak from a policy perspective the december meeting is increasingly likely to see a step down from 75bps to a 50bps increment with hawkish policymakers doing little to talk up a 75bps move ing posits with a view to the december meeting we caution that the ecb s hawks might ask for more progress on quantitative tightening in return for less aggressive action on rates note a disappointing reading could refocus minds over the 2023 outlook which sees the deposit rate currently seen peaking at around 3 in the summer uk flash pmi wed expectations are for november s services pmi to decline to 48 0 from 48 8 manufacturing to fall to 45 5 from 46 2 leaving the composite at 47 8 vs prev 48 2 the prior report was characterised by the service sector slipping from neutral to contractionary territory whilst the manufacturing industry contracted at a faster rate than prior s p global noted the heightened political and economic uncertainty has caused business activity to fall at a rate not seen since the global financial crisis in 2009 if pandemic lockdown months are excluded this time around oxford economics suggests there s a chance that the flash pmis for november will have been buoyed by an easing in the financial market and political turmoil seen after the mini budget however the consultancy cautions that this positivity will naturally be countered by the still intense cost of living pressures and very depressed consumer sentiment from a policy perspective markets price a 50bps december boe hike at around 85 with the mpc expected to step back from the 75bps in november many desks continue to look for a scaling back of market pricing in 2023 which currently expects a terminal rate of 4 5 4 75 fomc minutes wed at its november confab the ffr target was lifted by 75bps to 3 75 4 00 as expected the statement was dovishly received by the market after it stated that the fed will consider the cumulative tightening of monetary policy the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments when determining the pace of future rate increases analysts rationalised that with rates becoming more restrictive the fed can downshift to a slower pace of normalisation to assess the impact of the 375bps worth of rate tightening unleashed since march however fed chair powell s press conference injected a hawkish bias after he suggested that it was very premature to consider pausing the course of hiking the fed chair said that the time to slow rate hikes might come as soon as the december meeting he impressed that inflation remains well above the fed s longer run goals with price pressures evident across goods and services and although longer term inflation expectations still appear well anchored the fed wants to see inflation coming down decisively and is prepared to stay the course until the job is done with the fed strongly committed to its inflation target of 2 he added that there was still some ways to go on rate hikes while the ultimate rate level might even be higher than previously expected note the committee forecast a 4 50 4 75 terminal rate in its forecasts the fed chair said the debate on how far to lift rates was the important question but there was still ground to cover before the fed can meet that test adding that there is a lot of uncertainty regarding the lagged impact of policy tightening these themes have been largely echoed by officials in wake of the november meeting and after cpi and ppi data have eased in october money market pricing implies a 50bps rate hike in december with the terminal rate expected to be a little over 5 by mid 2023 it is worth noting that for most of this week expectations of the terminal rate were sitting between 4 75 5 00 until fomc voter bullard delivered hawkish remarks where he suggested that rates were not yet sufficiently restrictive even under the most generous interpretation bullard has been a policy leader in the post pandemic era with his hawkishness coming before his other colleagues riksbank policy announcement thu the riksbank is expected to step down from its recent 100bps hiking level by delivering a 75bps increase despite guidance for a 50bp hike at the september mpr a 75bp hike is justified by the domestic inflation situation remaining hot as while the headline october metrics were below market expectations note this was almost entirely due to a drop in electricity pricing the key ex energy figure was markedly above both the market and riksbank s consensus and lifted from the prior while such an increase could be argued as meriting another 100bp hike the riksbank is unlikely to deliver tightening of this magnitude again given initial signs that the tightening undertaken thus far is weighing on the domestic economy note while 75bp is expected the likes of seb believe that the inflation release has significantly increased the chance of 100bp though they have maintained their 75bp call as it stands the policy rate is seen peaking in q3 2023 at 2 52 evidently a 75bp hike would match that forecast and thus the riksbank will likely lift its policy rate forecasts however the magnitude of this is likely to be relatively limited in size given associated tightening headwinds and the policy transmission lag bok policy announcement thu the bank of korea is expected to lift its base rate by 25bps to 3 25 with analysts suggesting that the decline in the usd krw exchange rate gives it scope for a smaller rate hike recall the sharp upside in the usd krw rate in september saw the bank implement a 50bps rate hike additionally inflation data rebounded in october seeing analysts call for continued monetary policy tightening socgen s analysts added that the slowdown in activity indicators as well as the sustained credit crunch in the corporate credit market has also dimmed the prospect of a 50bps move elsewhere within its updated projections the central bank will likely lower its view of near term growth but inflation forecasts are likely to be maintained socgen says cbrt policy announcement thu the cbrt s latest monthly survey of business leaders and economists revealed that those surveyed expect the repo rate to fall from the current 10 5 to 9 0 in the next three months previously they had expected a decline to 9 4 while the rate is seen at 15 88 in 12 months vs 15 53 in the previous poll cpi expectations over the next year are little changed with the consensus looking for consumer prices to close out this year at 68 1 y y credit suisse reminds us that the cbrt s policy decisions have not been based on conventional economics in october the repo rate was cut by 150bps to 10 50 and signalled it would cut the rate again in november despite the challenging inflation situation both the decision and the guidance at the october meeting followed president erdogan s september statement that he would like to see the policy rate in single digits by the end of this year cs notes cs thinks headline inflation will likely increase further in october november before slowing to under 70 from december owing to base effects provided that the central bank remains resourced to sell fx to manage the lira s exchange rate cs adds that authorities will probably continue to implement ad hoc measures as long as they can in order to sustain what we view as this ultimately unsustainable policy stance credit suisse continues to argue that the cbrt will need to revert to conventional policy adjustments when its ad hoc measures have been exhausted the timing of which will depend on political considerations with presidential and parliamentary elections due no later than mid 2023 ecb minutes thu as expected the ecb opted to pull the trigger on another 75bps hike taking the deposit rate to 1 5 interestingly the accompanying statement saw policymakers drop their several meetings guidance with regards to future hikes instead they now expect to raise interest rates further but without providing a timeframe elsewhere the gc opted to change the terms and conditions of the third series of tltros and offer banks additional voluntary early repayment dates furthermore the ecb opted to set the remuneration of minimum reserves at the ecb s deposit facility rate previously the main refi rate on the balance sheet despite some hopes for a tweak to guidance on qt the bank made no changes to its language regarding reinvestments for pepp and app at the follow up press conference lagarde stated that the gc may need to go beyond normalisation and despite dropping the word several from the statement she conceded that the ecb might need to hike at the next several meetings on the balance sheet lagarde noted that policymakers did not discuss substantive app issues but would pursue a discussion of the key principles of app in december thus disappointing some who may have been looking for a more timely discussion and implementation of qt in early 2023 overall the dated nature of the release will likely mean there is little for markets to shape expectations for the december meeting on which more timely interventions from ecb policymakers and source reporting suggest that the gc will likely raise rates by 50bps in december whilst commencing the discussion on qt for more research like this

or he s retconning very visible cascading costly failures as one big secret plan and people have a lot invested in propping him up you decide ben collins oneunderscore__ november 19 2022 as i understand it kara swisher is one of silicon valley s most prominent journalistic supporters so her opinions on twittermeggedon and the apartheid princeling bitchboy responsible are presumed to have weight enough so that nymag published an article just this past tuesday titled elon musk and kara swisher are no longer speaking its closing paragraphs kara swisher today hopeless he s capable of great things here he s behaving he s disappointing in how he s handling himself and in the midst of all this disappointment there s all these really good ideas it s just so bossy i m the law it s so narcissistic and the thing the other day the advertising thing someone asked about the difference between twitter and elon musk they re the same thing he can t pretend these wealthy people like to pretend they re not powerful it drives me crazy he s very powerful what he says matters he can hurt people if he wants to even if he doesn t mean to and so he s got to have a greater sense of care around what he s doing and just slightly more kindness he can still be puckish and rude and funny just like i said he s all these things like funny rude compelling obnoxious accessible easy to deal with hard to deal with always on outspoken to a fault angry charming intense and also strikingly confident you can be all those things that means you re a human being but i mean this in the nicest way elon i m not the asshole nayeema raza you want to finish that thought kara swisher that s my thought i m not the asshole but that was then today rebutting the nytimes swisher announces that she s talked to smart folks who know elon at least one of whom i personally suspect may have been wearing elon musk s socks and there s a plan i spent the last day talking to smart folks who know elon to try to grok why it feels capricious and what the method is to the seeming madness here you are for those who care and for those who don t good for you for ignoring chaos monkeys kara swisher karaswisher november 19 2022 for easier reading there s a lot of random gifs in swisher s thread i m gonna intercut swisher s tweets with replies from tom scocca professional skeptic 1 twitter will not collapse imminently probably it s a resilient system and things are backed up but it s less failsafe and more prone to attacks by hackers who have an easier target elon is a gambler and he is betting on odds that fewer staffers will handle risky obvi 2 he is also counting on users to put up with inconveniences like you can t get your archive or user count tech users are used to glitches and they might not leave yet over small jams he s probably right even if it s a sucky attitude toward consumers does he give a fuck no his signature ai system autopilot does not work at all and one of the bigger and more dangerous reasons it can t work is it can t understand human behavior so tom scocca tomscocca november 19 2022 4 all the hand waving meanness fetid stunt tweeting it makes folks come look grows usage even if it is to see the traffic accident the look at my frantic antics is called marketing or snarketing as one twitter user put it growth at all costs that sounds familiar 5 the indiscriminate firings all tech is bloated and so is twitter and he s counting on the cuts to remove those who don t revere him then he ll pack up the circus tent and move it to a more malleable state like texas where the pols will suck up like a hoover on steroids scocca not sure how this analysis applies to losing the compliance and payroll departments 6 does he care that you think he s an amateur asshole wackjob chode while doing it he does not the brand is elon and always will be that is what you know now more than ever if it works he s done it once again if not it s mostly opm and who cares if the qataris lose scocca he s frantic and visibly anguished about how he s seized the site and everyone still won t stop hooting about how bad he is at posting just an endless barrage of laughing crying emojis as he lashes out in humiliation 7 in that vein a chance to own the media critics pols who don t fellate him is an added bonus trolling works as well as inspiring your sad concerns of decorum decency do not interest the silicon valley i know move fast break things destroy things is more like it fun 8 did i mention marketing as trump uses outrage to raise money from suckers elon is doing much the same to focus the attention on twitter you can t buy this kind of advertising the crazier the tweeting the better oh let s do a poll to see if donald should return burn scocca tesla stock dropped from 220 to 180 over the past month 9 silicon valley is cheering him on whether they say it out loud or not the tech bigs have lost a step of late for reasons mostly their own fault so his obstreperous obnoxiousness is welcome encouraged he s a bloated champion but he s still swinging plus are cool scocca i guess this is true if you define silicon valley as the dickheads with the money rather than the specialized workforce 10 he still needs revenue and quick blue checks nonsense didn t work payments a zillion miles away enterprise services too advertising is even more fucked that said will tech shore up its own will bankers let him off the hook will we forget his ugliness you betcha scocca the part about how they ll just eat the losses is probably also true idk it s almost as if none of this is about business per se 11 i m still not paying 8 fuck that from the original nytimes article yesterday elon musk s twitter teeters on the edge after another 1 200 leave perhaps the most crucial question now is how twitter can keep running after the giant reduction to its work force in such a short time the effects of the cuts and resignations have played out across the company s technology teams people with knowledge of the matter said one team known as twitter command center a 20 person organization crucial to preventing outages and technology failures during high traffic events had multiple people from around the world resign two former employees said the core services team which handles computing architecture was cut to four people from more than 100 other teams that deal with how media appears in tweets or how profiles show follower counts were down to zero people wednesday offered a clean exit and 80 percent of the remaining were gone peter clowes a senior software engineer tweeted on thursday about the departures on his team 3 75 engineers stayed he said on twitter that he quit on thursday mr musk is also considering shuttering one of twitter s three main u s data centers a location known as smf1 in sacramento which is used to store information needed to run the social media site four people with knowledge of the effort said if the data center in sacramento is taken offline it will leave the company with data centers in atlanta and portland ore with potentially less backup computing capacity in case something fails twitter is still operating but it may become harder for the company to fix serious issues when they come up former employees said one former twitter engineer likened the service s current state to wile e coyote the looney tunes cartoon character as he runs off the edge of a cliff though he may still be running in midair for some time once he looks down he drops like a stone the employee reductions are coinciding with twitter s entering one of its busiest periods in terms of visitors to the site the world cup which begins on sunday is expected to bring a deluge of traffic to twitter which is the world s fourth most visited website according to similarweb a digital intelligence platform that tracks web traffic twitter gets 6 9 billion visits each month slightly more than instagram s 6 4 billion though far fewer than google youtube or facebook according to similarweb estimates if there s anything like a strategy or theory in this soup it seems to be that twitter s addicted committed user base would end up like tesla stans sticking up for his objectively busted product but why would they do that when musk didn t even build it tom scocca tomscocca november 19 2022 if she keeps hammering that note she s hoping people will stop dunking on her for telling them to put their retirement in crypto crosby stills nash bridges jakesalterego november 19 2022
in the hieroglyphic records they left behind the rulers of the classic period maya city known as tamarindito bragged about their exalted status as divine lords chosen by the gods to rule over their people but as a new archaeological study has revealed these supposedly divine beings initially ruled over a group of subjects that would have numbered a few dozen at the most maya kings sometimes exaggerated their greatness it seems the first rulers of the powerful foliated scroll dynasty of the southcentral maya lowlands were in charge of what more closely resembled a cult of true believers than an actual kingdom despite their belief in their own greatness it took them several generations to recruit enough followers to turn their personal fiefdom into an influential political entity incense burner from guatemala with a representation of an early classic maya ruler public domain this discovery is new and unexpected emerging from the work of a team of researchers led by vanderbilt university archaeologist and epigrapher markus eberl who is an expert on the sociopolitical structures of the classic period maya people the researchers have just published the results of their eye opening study in the journal latin american antiquity as they report the results of archaeological recovery operations that explored about 80 percent of the tamarindito site the team began its excavations at the ancient maya capital in 2009 under the authority of the tamarindito archaeological project tap they made a total of seven separate excursions to the site over the course of 13 years searching for ruins and artifacts that would reveal the truth about the ancient city s settlement and subsequent history the petexbatun regional archaeological project prap and the tamarindito archaeological project tap investigated tamarindito extensively the study authors wrote in their latin american antiquity article referencing their own surveys plus continuing work at the site under the auspices of prap findings suggest that earlier models fail to fully explain the site s emergence instead we propose a centuries long process of subjectification during which foliated scroll rulers built their authority while non elites subjectified themselves slowly remnants of a pyramid that was part of a ceremonial center built around the time of the founding of tamarindito m eberl the foliated scroll dynasty the foliated scroll dynasty ruled a large swath of maya territory in what is now guatemala in the mid to late first millennium ad it started its would be kingdom right at the beginning of the classic period which in the petexbatun region didn t start until around the year 350 ad this was the time when new settlers first arrived in the area in search of good quality soils suitable for agricultural activity the first kings of this fledgling dynasty founded the royal capital of tamarindito in approximately 400 ad the scientists involved in this new study say at this point however their capital would have been a tiny hamlet rather than a city comprised of a small royal court and a pair of residential clusters reserved for commoners the royal maya capital of

building on the hegemony they d enjoyed all along classic maya rulers presented themselves as divine pivots the study authors explained people revolved around them drawn in and guided by their authority the hieroglyphic texts present fully formed and unchanging royal personas royal art and writing at tamarindito and other classic maya sites certainly suggested that all maya kings wielded absolute power right from the beginning of their ascensions but the archaeological record suggests the kings who served at tamarindito didn t have things so easy carving of a maya king at the palace of the archaeological site of palenque chiapas mexico loes kieboom adobe stock the kings who served at tamarindito didn t have things as easy as some other maya kings according to eberl and his colleagues the early maya rulers of tamarindito were essentially blustering self promoters with big ambitions who commanded the loyalty of only a small band of followers their path to significant authority and influence was a long one in the case of tamarindito maya rulers had to legitimize their authority and build power likely negotiating with and convincing non elites eberl told science news eberl estimates that it took approximately 150 years or to around the year 550 before enough people chose to live in tamarindito to allow it to function as a true capital city of a small kingdom or empire from this point on the foliated scroll rulers moved quickly to expand their authority founding a smaller second capital and a handful of other settlements in the territory of what is now

divine heritage of the foliated scroll rulers were first discovered in 1958 when excavations uncovered the initial ruins of tamarindito as explorations at the site continued it became clear that the city had been built by the foliated scroll kings themselves and that no previous town or village had ever existed at that site this made tamarindito an excellent case study to determine how maya rulers would have constructed a power center and a kingdom from the ground up what excavations revealed is that the builders of tamarindito had big plans right from the beginning they started out by constructing a ceremonial complex that included a pyramid a royal palace and an expansive plaza on top of a 230 foot 70 meter high hill it would have taken between 23 and 31 laborers about 25 years to complete this construction project the researchers estimate in its initial form the plaza would have been large enough to host approximately 1 650 gatherers but it was finished long before the city

have been suitable for regional ceremonial events that would have attracted people from other nearby settlements the first mass housing projects found during excavations dated to between the years 600 and 850 this suggests it may have taken 200 years or more before tamarindito attracted enough people to turn its founders grand ambitions into something approaching reality even when it was at its most developed the city of tamarindito would have had a population numbering only a few thousand this is small by comparison to other urban complexes that were built by the maya in northern guatemala during the classic period but given the challenges that foliated scroll rulers faced in trying to build their kingdom from scratch it is perhaps not surprising that they chose not to press their luck

the holiday shopping season is again going to pack our economy hopes hordes of consumers into shops malls and onto roads the liberty bell is going to remain a practical militarized zone and while no one thinks the apocalypse is good for business there is something to be said for having your business ready for disaster wayne based business continuity services company idc partners has built a business on that reality since 1991 they help companies prepare for the worst and they re using cool local technology to do it below ginnie stouffer vice president of consulting with idc takes her 15 years of industry experience to tell us about the cool technologies they implement to keep their clients ready for the worst and just what disaster movie is the favorite of someone who thinks plenty about disaster edited for length and clarity short of building a cement bunker what do you do for a new business client we provide services at all levels to help the organization develop or improve their disaster readiness plan that s about technical services retaining your customers continuing your customer service managing accounts 24 7 and project management everything that idc does is focused on the resilience of the business and industry what we try to do is help them understand their business what does your business depend on people and technology probably a dependency on a physical location once they understand that we can help implement a plan that prepares for when those things aren t available those people that technology or your place to keep their business moving and reducing the impact of a disaster when you say disaster do we mean like bruce willis can t destroy the texas sized asteroid that is headed straight for us the old fashioned definition is a sudden calamitous event that causes destruction so that the business can t work at that location that s the old definition a new definition is any interruption that stops a business from producing whatever it is that business does this all changed in the 1990s because before then pcs weren t proliferated so we were still using green screens and mainframes the proliferation of pcs and client software creates a need to think beyond that single piece of technology and instead imagine how hr or accounting or your production line will react when their technology isn t available we have a huge dependence on technology and any disaster can remind us just that give us an example of what this looks like in practice we work in a broad range of capacities but we can talk about the hospital environment what we ve done for a large well known hospital someplace we ve been working for four years the first thing that happens is that someone reports a system outage in that hospital the system is set up so we re doing to do troubleshooting to find out say maybe a broken pipe or whatever else means that they can no longer have functional technology in that wing what do you do next how do you order the new equipment who configures it what are the steps for replacing that wing what if everything was destroyed what are some of the technology partnerships you re leveraging the move in the industry today for business resiliency is to decrease the dependence any physical location or system idc is pushing on cloud computing we have hosted voip with alteva that we manage through a web interface so we can point lines someplace else for remote officing we re using web based ticket service salesforce which offers the tools we use for managing enabling logmein rescue to work with salesforce is giving us the opportunity to manage servers and desktops remotely this is all hosted through the internet all of our systems are hosted in bethelem at dbsi a recovery vendor that provides co location and hosting service like ibm and hp it s an independent vendor with multiple locations and since we are in the valley forge king of prussia area their bethlehem location is just 35 miles drive time but out of the main area update we selected their valley forge location for our work recovery seats it is just 10 minutes from our office what company is too small to be preparing for disaster do you want me to warn my local corner store it sounds outlandish but even mom and pop companies need to think about this if you re dealing with any kind of regulation or an industry that uses regulation you don t want to lose that information and need to know how to react without it this all started in the mainframe environment in the 1970s but now yes even the corner storefront is probably using a desktop for point of sale equipment if something happens to that computer they don t know how much they have in stock they can t produce a report for regulation you d be surprised how many times people can t think before computer age they just don t know how to do it no matter your size that matters so what s really at risk here philadelphia is a target and has always been listed on a terrorist target list because of all the national interest here so philly itself is a whole lot different than scranton a terrorist attack could target just one facility but what happened in new york closed 10 square blocks for a month even if they didn t have a broken window those businesses were completely interrupted anyone with a business in philly has to have a fear of that negatively impacting your business the valley forge and king of prussia interchange is a big risk too the king of prussia mall is also a target whenever there is big holiday shopping what is your favorite disaster movie i like them all every friday technically philly brings you an interview with a leader or innovator in philadelphia s technology community see others here technically media

kivsharivka ukraine not far from this village on the east bank of the oskil river ukrainian forces have hit a wall of russian resistance as they try to extend a counteroffensive that just two months ago was sweeping across nearby lands at a stunning clip andriy a soldier with ukraine s 92nd mechanized brigade was not sure what to say on a recent day when a group of ukrainian intelligence officers showed up and asked about his unit s push toward svatove a small city in the luhansk region occupied since march how honest should i be andriy said declining to give his surname or rank because he was not authorized to speak to reporters a long pause followed it has been very hard he admitted advertisement after a string of autumn victories for kyiv the war in ukraine is grinding down to another inflection point over 2½ months ukrainian forces have impressed the world with their offensive mettle first by recapturing the northeastern kharkiv region in a stunning rout and later in the south by methodically tightening the vise on a precarious slice of occupied land west of the dnieper river forcing russia s embarrassing retreat from the city of kherson the victories have put kyiv on the front foot boosting morale and expectations of further success ukraine has every incentive to press on with its counteroffensive and retake as much occupied land as possible while russia is still reeling from personnel shortages and command woes the pentagon has vowed to continue arming kyiv alongside european allies for as long as it takes but the ukrainian force now faces obstacles that threaten to slow the advance with each side gearing up to continue the fight well into next year and neither side close to what it envisions as victory russian positions on the redrawn front in many cases are more dug in forcing the ukrainians to try to penetrate multiple lines of defense muddy conditions make maneuver warfare particularly difficult until the ground freezes in midwinter the ukrainians like the russians are contending with strained ammunition supplies and exhausted soldiers russia also managed to withdraw its best fighting units from kherson meaning they probably will appear as worthy foes elsewhere the tough fight ahead is apparent outside svatove where andriy said his unit recently tried to take a russian position in a village but found itself ambushed mixed in among newly mobilized russian troops are special forces groups andriy said those elite soldiers not only have better experience but are also supported by reconnaissance drones that target ukrainian troops attempting to advance russia may be too weak to seize the offensive but moscow has managed to bolster its defenses to some degree while also unleashing a relentless bombing campaign on critical ukrainian infrastructure it turns out they have three lines of defense now andriy said but they re just sitting there in a deep defense they re not trying to move forward the situation has led to suggestions most notably from joint chiefs of staff chairman gen mark a milley that the time could be ripe for ukraine to negotiate a political solution to the conflict with russia which almost certainly would require surrendering some territory advertisement in a news conference milley said front lines from kharkiv down to kherson are beginning to stabilize and suggested that in the longer term it is unrealistic to think ukraine could recapture the remaining 20 percent of its land held by moscow unless he said the russian army completely collapses which is unlikely the russian military is really hurting bad milley told reporters at the pentagon on wednesday you want to negotiate at a time when you re at your strength and your opponent is at weakness and it s possible maybe that there will be a political solution all i m saying is there is a possibility for it that s all i m saying defense secretary lloyd austin at the same time promised to continue helping ukraine protect its population and achieve its aims on the battlefield which ukraine s commander in chief valeriy zaluzhny has identified as retaking all ukrainian territory held by russia including crimea which was illegally annexed in 2014 austin said he didn t want to presuppose what was possible for the ukrainian force noting that it is up to kyiv to decide on a good time to negotiate officials in ukraine and elsewhere have warned against any peace talks that would give moscow breathing room at this juncture yuriy ignat a spokesman for the ukrainian air force said ukraine does not trust that russia would abide by any agreement to enter into negotiations and would use any pause in fighting to rebuild its stocks of ammunition and missiles train its newly mobilized troops and refit and replace damaged equipment russia needs a truce until spring and then they will strike with everything they have ignat said plus they will make new missiles strike us with renewed vigor and destroy us completely that is russia s foreign policy and their plan for peace kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov in recent days has accused ukraine of refusing to negotiate and has said that the city of kherson remains russian territory insisting that the illegal annexation would be accomplished despite the retreat of russian troops the ukrainian side does not want any negotiations peskov told reporters thursday the special military operation continues and its goals must be achieved he also insisted that russia s bombing of ukrainian infrastructure was for military purposes share this article share in the immediate future ukraine is likely to continue offensive operations but at a reduced scale analysts said another sprawling ukrainian counteroffensive such as an attempt to push south from the city of zaporizhzhia to sever russian supply lines could be difficult to execute quickly on the heels of recent gains and in the current weather kyiv may not be able to carry out another large scale offensive until january or february said mason clark a senior analyst at the institute for the study of war but is likely to mount smaller operations to reclaim territory by the end of the year advertisement russian forces are digging new trenches along the border of crimea and near the siversky donets river in eastern ukraine that are up to 60 kilometers behind the existing front line indicating that they are bracing for further ukrainian advances britain s defense ministry said friday the ukrainians are definitely on a roll said konrad muzyka director of the poland based rochan consulting morale is incredibly high western equipment provides the ukrainians with an edge but the russians are now well dug into their defensive positions and it is going to be harder to dislodge them than it was in kharkiv and on the approach to kherson he said there are no obvious weak spots along the russian lines that could readily be exploited as was the case earlier this fall he said now it s going to be very challenging for the ukrainians to create conditions that would ultimately result in a maneuver that would lead to a large scale defeat of russian forces muzyka said russian forces are poorly equipped poorly trained but their advantage is mass it is not looking at the quality of its forces but to hold the line fighting is likely to continue despite the adverse winter conditions as ukraine looks to press its advantage before even more mobilized russian soldiers show up to bolster moscow s defenses russia had 90 000 troops on the front lines when the conscription drive began and has since added as many as 100 000 according to an official from a european nato country who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security matters as many as 200 000 more russian forces are being trained and will arrive in the coming months probably in at least slightly better shape than the underequipped and ill prepared men who have arrived so far the official said this could help reconstitute russian fighting power heading into the spring it s a lot of men the nato country official said we all know their quality is poor they lack equipment they lack training yet there is also a certain degree of quality in quantity and speed of getting them to the front on a recent day in the kherson region capt andriy pidlisnyy whose unit was among those advancing down to the dnieper river during the recent counteroffensive said it was difficult to fathom how to continue pushing the russians back now that the front line has settled along the river if it were easy then russia wouldn t have crossed over to the other bank pidlisnyy said it is precisely because of the logistical difficulties and heavy personnel losses that they had to retreat he added to do some smaller force operations across the river is possible but a full scale big offensive is difficult at its narrowest point the dnieper is still about a third of a mile wide that means the ukrainians would need a pontoon bridge to move across it those bridges take a while to put in place and then are very quickly destroyed pidlisnyy said i think there will be some attempts he said but it s much more rational to try to move through the zaporizhzhia region and advance by land pidlisnyy said he doesn t expect the russians to attempt another assault on kherson city anytime soon they ve already moved their best units he said there s only a small part of russian paratroopers left in the area as the conflict settles into a war of attrition each side is attempting to bolster its forces equipment and ammunition the nato country official warned that while russia has lost a significant number of tanks infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers it still has thousands of vehicles in storage the official also noted that russian manufacturing plants for artillery shells are working double and triple shifts to sustain the immense amount of firepower that moscow is expending advertisement the united states and its european allies meanwhile are scrambling to keep ukraine supplied with sufficient weapons and ammunition which enabled ukraine s battlefield successes in recent months the west has got into a challenging situation the nato country official said a lot has already been given western nations need to dig deeper into their stocks the efforts needed now are more long term and more strategic despite the calls for negotiations kyiv and moscow are taking steps to prepare for continued warfare we are at a stage where both sides are tired both sides are exhausted said dara massicot a russian military analyst at the rand corp but they are not ready to stop fighting

washington november 20 ani the us should be cautious and hesitant in delivering more military support to pakistan such as the f 16s where there is no guarantee that they will be used competently dr sajjan m gohel the international security director at the asia pacific foundation think tank and marcus andreopoulos a senior research fellow at the asia pacific foundation writing in war on the rocks wotr said that by fulfilling pakistan s wishes on the f 16 the biden administration may be hoping it will help shore up the fragile governing coalition from outside interference however it is the machinations of pakistan s military that remain constant and will continue to shape what transpires within the country the biden administration authorized the sale of military equipment worth usd 450 million to pakistan to enhance the air to ground capabilities of the country s current stock of f 16 fighter aircraft this most recent sale is the latest chapter in a decades long back and forth between washington and islamabad in which bilateral relations have fluctuated erratically said gohel and andreopoulos the contorted situation of the f 16 raises a perennial yet fundamental dilemma on whether washington can ever really achieve its objectives with pakistan regarding cooperation in preventing afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for terrorist groups curtailing nuclear proliferation ending hostilities with india and containing china s expanding clout in south asia the answers will likely turn out to be disappointing as they have in the past in part this is because multiple us administrations pass laws with the intention of taking a principled stand in holding pakistan accountable for its ties to terrorism or nuclear proliferation but then subsequently seek to find workarounds when there is an impending strategic security concern pakistan has understood this all too well reported wotr for pakistan s establishment statecraft of strategic depth outweighs the economic and social challenges that continue to engulf the country and which in turn heighten insecurity in the region the security ramifications of how the united states handles the f 16 matter carry enormous geopolitical significance ranging from nuclear conflict conventional warfare counter terrorism and containing chinese influence said gohel and andreopoulos the history of us negotiations with pakistan illustrates that the temporary tactical and transactional nature of the relationship has enabled pakistan to pursue its adversarial military doctrine of strategic depth in afghanistan to hedge against india in which the f 16s became a key tool while also furthering the ambitions of a nuclear weapons programme f 16 refurbishments are not going to resolve pakistan s crippling economic and humanitarian crisis and may instead contribute to the cycle of military opaqueness and intransigence over the stable democratic civilian rule reported wotr washington should stop using f 16s to try and leverage security and non proliferation commitments from pakistan as pakistan is mired in political economic and environmental instability the risk is that providing islamabad with more weapons will be counterproductive because they exacerbate regional tensions said gohel and andreopoulos instead washington should recognize that these sales and upgrades prop up actors in the country that sometimes work against american interests all but ensuring that clashes over the sale of this jet and other american hardware will continue long into the future moreover the nuclear risk is a by product of pakistan s instability which has occurred directly due to the troubling relationship its military sustains with violent extremists pakistan s commitment to preserve its nuclear arsenal is also configured to level the defence battlefield with india ironically instead of being a conventional deterrent the f 16 could instead be used to carry nuclear warheads expressing apprehensions over the biden administration s decision to upgrade pakistan s f 16 fleet india s external affairs minister s jaishankar implied that the primary use of the aircraft would be to wage war with india jaishankar s concerns are not without merit tensions between pakistan and india ignited in february 2019 after the jaish e mohammed terrorist group carried out a suicide bombing in jammu and kashmir that killed 40 indian security personnel pakistan had deployed f 16s against india as opposed to the chinese built jf 17 thunder that they initially claimed to have used violating the terms of sale from the united states ani

washington november 20 ani the us should be cautious and hesitant in delivering more military support to pakistan such as the f 16s where there is no guarantee that they will be used competently dr sajjan m gohel the international security director at the asia pacific foundation think tank and marcus andreopoulos a senior research fellow at the asia pacific foundation writing in war on the rocks wotr said that by fulfilling pakistan s wishes on the f 16 the biden administration may be hoping it will help shore up the fragile governing coalition from outside interference however it is the machinations of pakistan s military that remain constant and will continue to shape what transpires within the country the biden administration authorized the sale of military equipment worth usd 450 million to pakistan to enhance the air to ground capabilities of the country s current stock of f 16 fighter aircraft this most recent sale is the latest chapter in a decades long back and forth between washington and islamabad in which bilateral relations have fluctuated erratically said gohel and andreopoulos the contorted situation of the f 16 raises a perennial yet fundamental dilemma on whether washington can ever really achieve its objectives with pakistan regarding cooperation in preventing afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for terrorist groups curtailing nuclear proliferation ending hostilities with india and containing china s expanding clout in south asia the answers will likely turn out to be disappointing as they have in the past in part this is because multiple us administrations pass laws with the intention of taking a principled stand in holding pakistan accountable for its ties to terrorism or nuclear proliferation but then subsequently seek to find workarounds when there is an impending strategic security concern pakistan has understood this all too well reported wotr for pakistan s establishment statecraft of strategic depth outweighs the economic and social challenges that continue to engulf the country and which in turn heighten insecurity in the region the security ramifications of how the united states handles the f 16 matter carry enormous geopolitical significance ranging from nuclear conflict conventional warfare counter terrorism and containing chinese influence said gohel and andreopoulos the history of us negotiations with pakistan illustrates that the temporary tactical and transactional nature of the relationship has enabled pakistan to pursue its adversarial military doctrine of strategic depth in afghanistan to hedge against india in which the f 16s became a key tool while also furthering the ambitions of a nuclear weapons programme f 16 refurbishments are not going to resolve pakistan s crippling economic and humanitarian crisis and may instead contribute to the cycle of military opaqueness and intransigence over the stable democratic civilian rule reported wotr washington should stop using f 16s to try and leverage security and non proliferation commitments from pakistan as pakistan is mired in political economic and environmental instability the risk is that providing islamabad with more weapons will be counterproductive because they exacerbate regional tensions said gohel and andreopoulos instead washington should recognize that these sales and upgrades prop up actors in the country that sometimes work against american interests all but ensuring that clashes over the sale of this jet and other american hardware will continue long into the future moreover the nuclear risk is a by product of pakistan s instability which has occurred directly due to the troubling relationship its military sustains with violent extremists pakistan s commitment to preserve its nuclear arsenal is also configured to level the defence battlefield with india ironically instead of being a conventional deterrent the f 16 could instead be used to carry nuclear warheads expressing apprehensions over the biden administration s decision to upgrade pakistan s f 16 fleet india s external affairs minister s jaishankar implied that the primary use of the aircraft would be to wage war with india jaishankar s concerns are not without merit tensions between pakistan and india ignited in february 2019 after the jaish e mohammed terrorist group carried out a suicide bombing in jammu and kashmir that killed 40 indian security personnel pakistan had deployed f 16s against india as opposed to the chinese built jf 17 thunder that they initially claimed to have used violating the terms of sale from the united states ani

ding ding ding clackety clack whoooooot noises first and foremost are what people remember about trains not for nothing is choo choo one of the first words most kids learn to say somewhere between mommy daddy and i won t eat broccoli but there are noises and noises it s really loud when they do the horns said calvin brown 3 covering his ears to be clear calvin likes trains his dad michael brown of burlington even got him a little engineer s cap to wear as he took an old time railroad excursion on the black river western railroad from flemington to ringoes twenty minutes each way alas the train horn loud as it is is part of that experience for many kids that age it s a bit scary also a bit fun he likes it his dad hinted he s not the only one the sound the scenery just the noise of it all i m hooked to this day said sean anderson a millville resident on his way to phillipsburg with his family courtesy delaware river railroad excursions watch postcards offer a glimpse into jersey shore vacations past not for nothing did a whole style of music boogie woogie evolve from the noises that jazzmen heard when they traveled from one juke joint to another not for nothing is the high lonesome sound key to country and bluegrass inspired by distant train whistles over the prairie trains are basic not just to american transport but american culture itself whoo whooo the look the feel but noises aren t all old railroad trains like the black river western in new jersey essex steam train riverboat in essex connecticut the new hope railroad in bucks county pennsylvania catskill mountain railroad in kingston new york and others in the tri state area that offer nostalgic day trips in antique rail carriages are also about the smell the look the feel they re about the gold painted iron seat frames an elegant feature of the black river s 1915 passenger car they re about the spitting is forbidden notice etched on the wooden molding they re about the vintage phoebe snow advertisements on the wall says phoebe snow i see you know as mothers should the way to go phoebe snow namesake of teaneck s late great singer songwriter was the mascot of the delaware lackawanna and western railroad she famously could wear spotless white on her travels that s because the dl w used clean burning anthracite coal less fortunate passengers in those days of sooty engines sometimes emerged from a long journey looking like a chimney sweep that was an issue for train travelers at the time said mike shea president of the black river railroad historic trust vintage train travel is about windows that open try doing that in an amtrak car with a delicious clackety sound to let in the breezes it s about not sticking your head out the better to see the passing farms fields rivers steel truss bridges and tree limbs that could easily take an arm off no hanging out the window announced henry shaw a black river volunteer from philadelphia as the train lurched into motion cause these things will come down and you will have a booboo all aboard who doesn t love a choo choo train for kids from 6 to 60 as advertisers used to say but they also have a special lure for two specific age brackets hard core train buffs often seem to be people who are 6 or 60 curious i know kids like things that are big and moving and cool looking said chris cotty vice president and general manager of delaware river railroad excursions as for older guys who knows it sparks their imagination he said of course anyone at any age can enjoy a lovely ride aboard a vintage railroad train especially as in the case of a weekend outing along the water courtesy of delaware river railroad excursions there is a visit to a winery at the end of it we said since covid we re going to do as much as we could on the weekends in the state said lisa laufer of hawthorne who with her husband jody boarded a vintage railroad car in phillipsburg their recent delaware excursion was on the old belvidere and delaware river railway operated by the new york susquehanna western technical historical society inc the route presently being expanded should reach riegelsville pa by the end of the year seven wonders of nj photogenic spots worthy of a visit historic buildings empire state building a symbol of optimism and resilience turns 90 to the melodious accompaniment of scott joplin via loudspeaker passengers chug chugged their way toward villa milagro vineyards one of several destinations the line offers about 40 minutes each way i like train travel but i don t get to do much jody said the laufers are a younger couple but it s little kids and certain older folks in their 60s and 70s who seem to really get the train bug the little engine that could and thomas the tank engine are the very stuff of childhood so are toy trains there was no need to talk genevieve nestlen 9 into riding in the upper berth of a caboose lackawanna railroad 1952 being drawn by a 1928 baldwin steam locomotive at the steamtown national historic site in scranton pennsylvania she was clearly into it i like riding at the top and seeing all the things out the windows said genevieve visiting with her parents rich and sarah from rochester new york mature audiences but a certain kind of older guy also likes trains usually though not always it is a guy walt disney was one a lifelong train buff he built a narrow gauge railroad at his house in holmby hills and gave his visitors free rides it was the seed that grew into disneyland others less ambitious build massive electric train layouts in their basement and if they are particularly outgoing they become one of the volunteers that are the lifeblood of steamtown the black river western and other vintage train sites i have fun coming here in the weekend said chuck hoering of oakland who drives the hour plus to phillipsburg on saturdays and sundays in order to don the garb of a trainman his preferred phrase i get to meet people from different countries i met someone from germany yesterday i ve met people from england and spain he also meets a lot of inquisitive children since he happens to bear a certain resemblance to santa claus are you or aren t you kids want to know happily delaware river railroad excursions runs a polar express train ride during the holiday season this year it s november 25 to dec 18 i just tell them you have to come out for the polar express and find out he said these scholars of the rails will be happy to tell you that the engine pulling your train is an emd gp9 general motors 1959 delaware river railroad excursions or an emd 438 from the 1950s black river western both are diesel locomotives steam engines have also been used at the two attractions but they re offline at the moment they will use terms like crossbuck the x shaped railroad crossing sign clerestory the raised middle portion of a railroad car s roof and rolling stock anything on rails and they will tend to regard train cars affectionately as a species of living thing these steam engines are just alive said dominick tardogno volunteer for the national park service who has been guiding visitors through steamtown for 20 years they have a character like a human being tardogno has served in the navy and worked for the national security agency in washington d c but in many ways trains are his real calling ticket to adventure trains beckon you to go places and see things that are different from where you live he said a railroad looks like a plane to me or an airport it s an invitation to travel then too a locomotive is in an age of bits and bytes and semiconductors a machine that can be understood by anyone the wheels rods and pistons have an elegant simplicity in recent years they ve even inspired a whole aesthetic movement steampunk these are the best biggest machines that are easily accessible to a person tardogno said to work on them for me is like being a cowboy it s like herding cattle or herding horses they re as big as dinosaurs and you manipulate them and move them around there s something fascinating about that it s at steamtown about a 2½ hour drive from north jersey that you can see the iron horses the great locomotives that are part of the romance of america s gilded era steamtown a museum since 1984 is an old roundhouse of the delaware lackawanna and western railroad at one time it routed trains to hoboken and jersey city as well as points north there was a strong connection to new york city for all the railroads in this area tardogno said it was a big market for the anthracite coal they mined in these mountains so the railroads all competed with each other at steamtown you can view locomotives dating back to 1903 and you can see vintage seats hats tokens advertisements dinnerware everything relating to a way of life that vanished when the last american steam locomotive rolled out of the shop in 1953 and yes they offer excursions the scranton limited is a 30 minute trip across the lackawanna river the caboose experience is a 15 minute ride on the back of the clown wagon as railroaders used to call it on certain days there are longer trips as well all with savvy folks like tardogno as your guides we were all little kids once and we loved trains and that s how we ended up here as volunteers he said changing times in america the classic locomotive age began in 1829 when the prototype tom thumb first chuffed its way down a section of test track in wheeling west virginia it lasted through the heady days of the transcontinental railroad completed in 1869 to the 1930s and 40s when diesel locomotives began to challenge the choo choos of yore trains famously knit the country together they did much the same for continental europe east asia and india in the days of the raj steam locomotives as it happens are still manufactured overseas the tangshan sy made in china in 1989 is expected to be back online next year in phillipsburg we used to travel a lot by train at home said lisha kallacheril who was riding the black river western with her daughters ann 15 and sona 13 home india was the scene of wonderful two day trips from kerala to delhi where they marveled at the scenery of the indian subcontinent we would travel from south to north she said we spent overnight on the train but a day trip through hunterdon county isn t so bad either especially on a broiling sunday in a lovely old rattletrap train car one whose windows blessedly can be opened i m expecting some nice views sona said ride the train here are a few of

monetary base yoy change nsa universal value advisors the evidence on inflation is quite clear it peaked in june and is now on the wane the latest data came from the producer price index ppi which rose only 0 2 in october consensus was 0 4 this is a monthly level the fed could live with 2 4 annual rate core ppi ex food and energy was flat i e 0 0 even better in the june to october period the ppi for goods has contracted at a 5 6 annual rate while services have risen at a modest 2 6 rate going deeper a look at the core intermediate goods sub index shows a 0 8 m m fall now down four months in a row at the core crude goods level price falls accelerated to 5 3 m m in october from 0 2 in september the core crude and intermediate sub indexes give us a view into where the overall ppi is headed over the next few months ppi is a leading indicator of the cpi while prices in the domestic economy have softened we even find that prices of imported goods are tumbling despite the avalanche of evidence that inflation is yesterday s story the fed continues its vocal rate hiking campaign the latest fed speakers bullard collins have indicated that the terminal fed funds rate will be much higher perhaps as high as 7 that s 300 basis points bps 3 00 percentage points higher than the current level the transparency era in past blogs we discussed the issues facing the fed in this new transparency era in this new era the financial markets immediately move interest rates and financial conditions to where the fed indicates its terminal rate will be in a new study the sf fed said that while the fed had set the fed funds rate at 3 25 in september the financial markets had tightened financial conditions to the equivalent of 5 25 since they moved rates higher in november financial conditions are even tighter this dovetails directly into our transparency thesis i e that the financial markets immediately move to the fed s indicated terminal rate as we have written this has worked out well for the fed in the initial stages of the tightening phase i e the markets did their bidding since this is the first real tightening phase in the new transparency era began in 2012 there is no history of market reaction when it comes to step down pause or pivot over the past few weeks we have seen the fed plant a story in the wall street journal about stepping down its rate increases from 75 bps at each meeting to something less and we saw november s post meeting official statement indicate that the fed recognized that monetary policy actions impact the economy with a lag again implying a slowdown in rate increases in both of those instances the financial markets immediately began to ease financial conditions only to face hostile rhetoric from the chair and members of the board of governors some think this fed is out to prick the home price inflation bubble and or to significantly reduce equity valuations that may indeed occur but we don t think that is a conscious goal the goal is tighter financial conditions so far they ve accomplished that goal but with the need to move to a less hawkish position they do not want the markets to prematurely loosen what was okay in the initial stages of tightening i e market reaction is apparently not okay when it is time to begin to ease up setting interest rates our view is simple and straightforward the fed has no business and certainly no expertise as to where the level of interest rates should be that is a function of market demand and supply implied fed funds target rate universal value advisors the track record of the fed s federal open market committee in forecasting where interest rates are going has been abysmal just look at the latest dot plot and at the yellow dots for 2024 in the graph it is apparent that there is no consensus as to where interest rates will be in 2024 that s less than 14 months away there are nine different views among the 13 participants ranging from just over 2 50 to 4 625 and these guys are setting rates holy cow we learned a long time ago that money supply growth is the key to economic growth and inflation theoretically if the economy s potential growth rate is 2 and if the money supply grows at 2 we would get an inflation free 2 growth over time for some unfathomable reason it has been decided that a 2 inflation rate is ideal so the money supply should grow at 4 in an economy with a 2 potential growth rate to produce 2 growth and 2 inflation now look at where the growth in the money supply has recently been and where it is now the chart at the top of this blog shows that monetary base grew at significant double digit rates in 2020 and 2021 and now it is contracting so it isn t any wonder that we have had a significant inflation that is now fading incoming data unfortunately the incoming data tells us that the recession has likely arrived although there still appears to be hope that we will have a soft landing retail sales these rose 1 3 m m in october with real sales up 0 8 that was much better than the 0 4 reading for september retail sales always rise in october back to school halloween pre holiday shopping but this year like the huge add from the birth death model to the payroll survey the seasonal adjustment factor for october was 1 3 percentage points more generous than the norm for the past four years this leads us to discount this as it appears out of step with other incoming data the large and important retailers all have issues target warned of a tough holiday selling season ahead walmart s revenue grew most of which was due to price increases walmart always benefits in a recession as even higher income earners look for lower prices and begin to visit the discount chains at walmart the discretionary categories home goods electronics apparel showed negative sales growth it was health wellness and groceries that grew the revenue home depot also showed up with sales increases all of which were due to higher prices 9 volumes were off more than 4 regional fed surveys the n y fed empire manufacturing index was 4 5 in november vs 9 1 in october but the headline was about the only positive in the report new orders backlogs the business outlook expected orders and inventory plans were all negative price increase plans were 32 down each month since august 44 the philly fed manufacturing index was 19 4 in november vs 8 7 for october new orders 16 2 were down six months in a row backlogs supplier delivery delays supply bottlenecks shipments the workweek and employment hiring intentions were all down the index of those planning price increases was 15 7 down from 45 0 in august it was a similar story for the kansas city fed overall index 6 for november october was 7 at mid year this index was 12 delivery delays capex intentions new orders backlogs and employment intentions were all down and pricing plans at 37 in november were off from a 51 print just a couple of months earlier overall the fed s own regional bank surveys are telling them that inflation is on the wane consumer sentiment the university of michigan s consumer sentiment survey left no doubt as to the state of the consumer s psyche overall consumer sentiment remains below the lows of the great recession and expected business conditions for the next 12 months are near those lows consumer sentiment universal value advisors home buying intentions fell to 33 in november from 43 in october this is a record low back to 1951 consumers blamed high interest rates and the fed plans more hikes buying conditions for houses universal value advisors the home resale market is now feeling the heat and home prices have started to fall mortgage purchase applications rose slightly 2 7 in the latest week as a result of financial market exuberance over the fed s disclosure that it is likely to step down its rate increases causing rates to fall the 30 yr fixed rate mortgage fell to 6 61 from 7 08 the week ended november 10 as noted earlier fomc members are attempting to jaw bone this to higher levels 30 year fixed mortgage average in the u s fred those home buying intentions are an excellent leading indicator for housing starts single family starts which have a large impact on the gdp calculations were off 6 1 in october are down in seven of the last eight months and are down nearly 21 y y single family building permits have suffered a similar fate off 3 6 in october and 22 y y new home sales are down 35 y y with new contracts signed down a steeper 43 the median marketing time for a new listing has risen 33 y y us national rent y y vs cpi oer y y zerohedge bls apartment list but it s a different story for the multi family sector while starts were off slightly 1 2 in october they are up nearly 18 y y and are at the highest level since december 1973 multi family permits were also marginally down in october 1 0 m m but are up a strong 10 6 y y these units are starting to enter the market and we have seen rents begin to fall see chart above sometime in early 2023 when bls s antiquated rent calculation finally catches up with reality we will see a very positive impact on the inflation data and it will happen no matter what the fed does to interest rates consumers aren t any more exuberant about buying cars or other large household durable goods as seen from the charts above these indicators are telling us that the 70 of the economy called the consumer isn t in a spending mood given that the retail sector isn t hiring nearly as many seasonal workers as in years past it does appear that the recession is upon us buying conditions for vehicles and large household durables universal value advisors final thoughts it appears that the inflation after all was transient financial indicators tell us that markets also believe this as the inflation outlook has moderated 10 yr tips are down to 2 28 from 2 52 at october s end it appears that on a y y basis june 9 1 will prove to have been the peak but concentrating on the y y rate is like driving a car only looking through the rear view mirror it tells you where you ve been not where you re going all the forward signs say disinflation if not deflation is in our future commodity prices are down and consumer sentiment is awful as are business expectations the fed s transparent policy coaxed markets into rapidly tightening financial conditions the dilemma is how to slow or stop the tightening process without markets prematurely and rapidly easing financial conditions general reports from the business community is that holiday hiring will be much lower than last year that inventories are still bloated stuff to go on sale and we see in the tech world the u s s main growth sector layoffs are everywhere there is one more cpi and one more employment report before the december fed meeting these reports alone could move markets to easier financial conditions whether the fed likes it or not unless the fed has other objectives for its tightening cycle besides its inflation target if indeed inflation s back is broken why does it need to continue to raise rates the answer is it joshua barone contributed to this blog

twitter turmoil staff exodus aggravate security concerns the hashtag riptwitter gained huge traction on the site after resignations poured in from employees who chose no to musk s demand that they either be extremely hardcore or exit the company washington twitter s owner elon musk has pledged the platform will not become a hellscape but experts fear a staff exodus following mass layoffs may have devastated its ability to combat misinformation impersonation and data theft twitter devolved into what campaigners described as a cesspit of falsehoods and hate speech after recent layoffs cut half the company s 7 500 staff and fake accounts proliferated following its botched rollout of a paid verification system further throwing the influential platform into disarray and raising doubt about its very existence reports said hundreds of employees chose to depart the company on thursday in defiance of an ultimatum from musk the huge number of layoffs and resignations raises serious questions about content moderation and the security of user data cheyenne hunt majer from the nonprofit public citizen told afp it is imperative that us regulators act with urgency as users could have their sensitive data exploited or even stolen given the lack of sufficient staff that remain to adequately protect it the hashtag riptwitter gained huge traction on the site after resignations poured in from employees who chose no to musk s demand that they either be extremely hardcore or exit the company twitter has plunged into turmoil as musk a self professed free speech absolutist seeks to shake up the money losing company after his blockbuster 44 billion buyout late last month debacle the site s content moderation teams largely outsourced contractors that combat misinformation have been axed and a number of engineers fired after openly criticising musk on twitter or on an internal messaging board according to reports and tweets wary brands have paused or slowed down ad spending twitter s biggest revenue source after a spike in racist and antisemitic trolling on the platform misinformation super spreaders or untrustworthy accounts peddling falsehoods saw a 57 percent jump in engagement in the week after musk s acquisition of twitter according to a survey by the nonprofit watchdog group newsguard elon musk has swiftly decimated twitter s ability to maintain the platform s integrity health and safety said jessica gonzalez co chief executive officer at the nonpartisan group free press if there is one lesson that all social media platforms must take away from this debacle it s that without protecting users from hate and lies you have no company at all in a response to critics musk on friday as he indicated a new direction for content moderation on the site while not being totally removed from the site musk said that negative hate tweets will be max deboosted and demonetized so no ads or other revenue to twitter you won t find the tweet unless you specifically seek it out which is no different from rest of internet he added but his plan fell on skeptical ears significant blow we could certainly see a spike in misinformation hate speech and other objectionable content because of musk s latest moves zeve sanderson executive director of the new york university s center for social media and politics told afp content moderation is a lot harder to do without people around to actually do content moderation in a letter to the federal trade commission a regulatory agency a group of democratic senators blamed musk for introducing alarming new features that undermined safety despite warnings that they would be abused for fraud scams and dangerous impersonation users are already facing the serious repercussions of this growth at all costs strategy they wrote in the letter published thursday noting the recent spike in fake accounts impersonating companies politicians and celebrities among the victims was drugmaker eli lilly whose stock price nosedived erasing billions in market capitalization after a parody account stamped with a verification tag purchased for 8 tweeted that insulin was being made available for free last week twitter disabled sign ups for the contentious feature known as twitter blue with reports saying it had been temporarily disabled to help address impersonation issues but not before several brands took a hit given the apparent vulnerabilities digital experts have warned activists particularly in autocratic countries of the increased risk of identity theft or their private messages falling into the hands of hackers around the world twitter is used to organize against oppression said hunt majer if musk s mismanagement kills it that would be a significant blow to freedom of information and frankly human rights in general on a global scale
a legislative commission will recommend that the governor declare a state of emergency as maine s emergency rental assistance program is approaching its final days more than 8 500 households across maine were receiving benefits as of last week under this program which was designed to distribute federal relief money to people who needed help paying their rent or utility bills during the pandemic it also put unhoused mainers in hotel and motel rooms now as federal funds for the program dry up municipalities across maine foresee a humanitarian crisis in the making recent data compiled by mainehousing for municipalities across the state show the scope of the need touching the largest cities and smaller rural towns portland had 872 households receiving benefits between sept 1 through oct 25 while 100 households in caribou were getting rental assistance in presque isle where rental assistance is going to more than 250 families deputy city manager martin puckett said many of those recipients have come in from smaller surrounding communities by having a homeless shelter and the various hotels it s led to an in migration from the outlying communities said puckett who was one of several municipal officers who spoke before the commission to increase housing opportunities in maine by studying land use regulations and short term rentals on monday some of these smaller communities simply do not have resources like we do it s difficult to pinpoint an exact end date for the rental relief program as community action agencies all have different amounts of funds remaining but municipalities say they ve heard there s enough money to keep the program running through november and state officials say they re working with community action agencies to give current rental relief recipients at least one month s notice that their benefits may soon end but municipal officials say that s not a sufficient strategy for those who may face eviction especially when there s little available housing stock to begin with the vacancy rate anecdotally what i ve heard in bangor in essence is 1 or less said city manager debbie laurie i think that s what you re seeing across the state i don t think there s much movement in housing bangor had 944 households receiving rental assistance benefits as of last week and data show that the need for help is high in the city s surrounding communities in nearby brewer 172 families are rental relief recipients with 147 and 107 households receiving benefits in old town and orono respectively mainehousing compiled this data and shared it last week with municipalities who asked the agency for a broad snapshot of rental relief recipients in effort to prepare for the program s end there must be an exit strategy and it can t fall to the burdens of municipalities who just simply won t be able to handle that level of activity laurie said once the program s funding is fully depleted beneficiaries will be directed to apply with their towns for general assistance the influx of people that will be coming to see me it s a one person show here will be incredibly overwhelming said jane maynard who works part time as saco s general assistance administrator friday alone this past friday i received seven phone calls from people who were currently staying in a hotel here in saco who found out just a few days before friday that they were going to be evicted tomorrow towns must process general assistance applications within 24 hours and if they can t the applicant can apply with the state department of health and human services for help but when that happens it s a considered a failure on the part of the municipality towns are billed for the expense and are required to pay 100 of the assistance with no reimbursement from the state even if towns can process an influx of applications in a timely manner the sheer cost of providing general assistance they say would be difficult to absorb in south portland 410 households are receiving rental assistance benefits which doesn t include asylum seekers and refugees most rental relief recipients are living in hotels at a cost of roughly 7 200 a month said south portland city manager scott morelli he estimates that if everyone currently housed in a south portland hotel today were to apply for general assistance it could cost the city more than 15 million that would be 15 times our traditional budget allocation for general assistance and we d need to raise property taxes 21 just for that portion of the budget alone morelli said it s simply unsustainable general assistance won t catch everyone who s currently receiving rental relief benefits the program has higher incomes limits compared to general assistance and most rents today are well over the maximum allowed under ga municipal officials say state officials say they re still trying to secure more federal funding and it could come through by the time the legislature convenes in january conversations continue right now said greg payne senior adviser on housing policy for the governor s office it s entirely possible mainehousing and the cap agencies are currently working to extend this and hopefully can do so by a matter of months we ll see but housing advocates say that s too late if we were to do nothing or someone doesn t do something we know we have a homelessness crisis that will blow up right before the holidays in the middle of winter said state sen craig hickman d winthrop who is the co chairman of the housing opportunities commission the panel is preparing its final report to send to the legislature which will include a recommendation to the governor to declare a state of emergency doing so could create more flexibility for towns processing general assistance applications other recommendations include providing more resources to towns to process general assistance applications and an increase in the maximum amount allowed under ga for housing hickman acknowledged that the recommendations are broad and the commission has no authority to write legislation or provide funds to address the problem we ll just throw everything on the wall and see what sticks he said the panel will also recommend that maine consider its own rental assistance program to replace the one that s ending but mainehousing warns that any state run replacement program will be expensive operation of maine s existing emergency rental assistance program costs about 500 000 a day a report with final recommendations from the housing commission is due to the legislature in november
a bond is a loan that exists in the form of a tradeable security the buyer of the bond an investor effectively lends money by purchasing the bond at terms that are set at the time of issue but they can then transfer or trade the security at any time for an agreed market price the issuer of the bond which can be a government or a bank or a company must pay interest and the principal back upon maturity or it is in default a government bond is considered one of the safest investments because it is the government that sets the rules the australian government can tax a company or a citizen if it needs money and it can issue more local currency to repay any debts key terms to understand coupon a coupon payment is the fixed annual interest rate established when the bond was issued that is paid until the date of maturity if you bought a 1000 bond with a 5 per cent interest rate or coupon rate your coupon payment will be 50 per year yield the yield compares the coupon rate to the current market price of the bond it is most relevant if you want to sell your bond before it expires if you bought your 1000 bond with a 5 per cent coupon rate last year and interest rates haven t changed the current yield will also be 5 per cent however if the price of the bond has increased to 1 100 the yield will be lower at 4 55 per cent to calculate the yield divide the coupon rate by the market price maturity this is at the end of the duration of a bond and the borrower has fulfilled its debt obligation if you have a five year bond the bond reaches maturity after five years duration the longer the maturity of the bond the more sensitive the bond s price is to movements of interest rates this sensitivity is called the duration and it measures the sensitivity of a bond s price to a one per cent change in the market rate tier ii securities these are similar to senior bonds in than interest and principal must be repaid but the bank can choose to extend the time it has to repay the amount borrowed if circumstances require for instance it can decide if a five year bond gets extended for a further five years governments sell bonds to investors to finance their deficits the buyers in the primary market are typically banks insurance companies superannuation funds and pension funds that need to invest in safe and reliable assets to make good on their promises to customers investors members and policyholders these bonds are then traded in the secondary market mainly by these same investors there are also corporate bonds which are issued by private companies since these private companies are more likely to default than the government they must compensate investors by paying a higher interest rate the credit spread is determined by the financial health of the borrower and investors rely heavily on credit ratings supplied by the likes of s p and moody s as an easy to understand measure of their financial backing advertisement bonds that have a credit rating of bbb or above are regarded as investment grade and are highly unlikely to default below that level bonds are considered to be high yield or junk bonds and are more speculative although paying a higher rate why do people invest in bonds there are two main reasons why investors would buy government bonds the first is to provide some form of insurance or back up plan if the values of riskier assets such as stocks fall as a result of a weaker economy this is because the price of stocks and bonds tend to have an inverse relationship the upside of investing in stocks over bonds is the potential for greater profits on the other hand bonds are seen as a safer investment but their returns tend to be much lower in times of economic trouble investors often ditch stocks in favour of bonds bonds and interest rates also tend to have an inverse relationship government bonds are constantly being issued throughout the year and the fixed interest rate coupon rate on offer to the investor is largely set by and in line with expectations of the central bank s cash rate at the time advertisement when interest rates rise new bonds that are issued in line with a higher interest rate devalue the older bonds with lower interest rates payments that are being traded on the secondary market because demand for them falls when interest rates fall and investors are faced with lower returns from newly issued bonds older bonds with higher fixed interest rate payments can be sold at a premium this only really matters to investors of course if they are looking to make a profit from bonds on the secondary market but there is another reason why investors might consider bonds for steady income some investors hold on to their bonds until maturity in which case the day to day fluctuations in prices are not so critical the bond s value might change but the investor will still be paid the fixed interest rate that it was issued with based on its face value what is happening in the bond market now advertisement for several years very low inflation meant many central banks around the world cut rates to near zero levels and the income offered on new bonds was basically nothing last year in october when australia s official cash rate was just 0 1 per cent the three year bond paid less than 1 per cent while the 10 year bond paid 1 7 per cent then as inflation started to rise and central banks tried to combat that with higher interest rates new government bonds were issued with a higher fixed income hurting the value of existing bonds that paid lower interest now the official cash rate is 2 85 per cent and three year bonds pay around 3 3 per cent while the 10 year rate exceeds 4 per cent advertisement how can i buy bonds on the asx and what do i look for the primary bond market is almost predominantly an over the counter market dominated by institutions some specialist brokers allow investors to buy wholesale bonds but the fees aren t always transparent and can be embedded in the price there are only a handful of bonds that trade on the asx retail investors can however more easily buy government bonds on the secondary market through the asx via instruments called exchange traded bonds the asx includes a list of bonds that can be purchased and the relevant tickers and market makers are committed to giving investors prices that are in line with wholesale markets the list of bonds can be confusing to the uninitiated because some bonds with similar maturities have large coupons and others small while others have high prices and others low the reason coupons with similar maturity are different is because of the time the bond was issued if a bond that matures in three years was issued 10 years ago and is seven years into its life the coupon may be around 3 5 per cent but a five year bond issued two years ago that has the same maturity would have had a coupon of just 0 5 per cent because at the time of the bond issue interest rates were near zero investors can buy bonds of almost any maturity from one month to 30 years banks which are considered frequent issuers also have outstanding bonds across most maturities while corporations may issue less frequently and only have a few maturities outstanding advertisement longer dated bonds tend to offer better coupon rates because investors are exposed to more risk this is because there is a greater chance that interest rates will change before they reach maturity and the bond could end up being worth less the most relevant measure for an investor is the yield the yield of a bond will change when it is sold to reflect the price paid and how it corresponds to the interest payments the investor will earn if you pay a higher price for a bond than it was originally valued the yield you will receive from the interest rate payments as a percentage not the dollar amount will be lower how else can i get investment exposure to bonds beyond individual government bonds the most accessible way to invest in the broader bond market is through exchange traded funds which offer investors a set package of assets bundled together there are several fixed income etfs tied to government bond indices and other local and international markets some etfs allow investors to target a specific part of the bond market such as corporate bonds tier ii bonds american high yield bonds australian or global hybrid securities or long dated australian government bonds there are also some bond etfs overseen by active managers the issuers of these etfs will provide details about the characteristics of the funds some key measures to look out for are the yield the average duration which measures the interest rate sensitivity and for corporate bonds the breakdown by credit rating and industry advertisement this allows the investor to understand how much credit or interest rate risk they are taking to earn a certain yield many experts consider corporate bond funds to be a safer way to invest in credit because a bond manager can cheaply and easily construct a portfolio of over 100 bonds spreading the risk of default without giving up any income bond investing is all about avoiding the downside and there is little upside from picking the best corporate bonds as they all pay a similar rate of interest while corporate bond markets are large and active retail investors apart from high net worth investors who invest the large minimum spend are largely absent from investing directly in deals an important thing to consider is that often investing in a bond is part of a broader portfolio acting as a hedge or an insurance against other investments such as equities rather than a standalone investment official interest rates deposit interest rates and bond rates are moving around dramatically so it is important to keep monitoring yields by visiting the websites of exchange traded fund issuers such as betashares ishares etf securities statestreet vaneck and vanguard as well as the asx website which contains details about etbs one important consideration is whether these securities are actively traded and accessible any opportunities presented by promoters of unlisted fixed income products targeting wholesale investors should be considered relative to what can easily be accessed through listed bonds managed funds and exchange traded bond funds
trump has said in the past that he would not rejoin twitter even if his account was reinstated los angeles elon musk reinstated donald trump s account on twitter on saturday reversing a ban that has

the last two energy crises that threatened hundreds of energy companies with bankruptcy have rewritten the oil and gas m a playbook previously oil and gas companies made numerous aggressive tactical or cyclical acquisitions in the wake of a price crash after many distressed assets became available on the cheap however the 2020 oil price crash that sent oil prices into negative territory has seen energy companies adopt a more restrained strategic and environment focused approach to cutting m a deals according to data released by energy intelligence firm enverus cited by reuters u s oil and gas dealmaking contracted 65 y y to 12 billion during the second quarter a far cry from 34 8 billion in last year s corresponding period as high commodity price volatility left buyers and sellers clashing over asset values but dealmaking in the u s oil patch is now slowly starting to recover with enverus noting that mergers and acquisitions picked up pace to 16 billion in the third quarter the most this year in its quarterly report enverus notes that the 3rd quarter was the most active quarter in oil and gas so far this year still deal value in the first nine months only totaled 36 billion significantly less than the 56 billion recorded in the same period last year companies are using the cash generated by high commodity prices to pay down debt and reward shareholders rather than seeking out acquisitions investors still seem skeptical of public company m a and are holding management to high standards on deals investors want acquisitions priced favorably relative to a buyer s stock on key return metrics like free cash flow yield to give an immediate uplift to dividends and share buybacks andrew dittmar director of enverus told reuters third quarter m a deals according to enverus the biggest m a deal last quarter was eqt corp s nyse eqt 5 2 billion purchase of natural gas producer thq appalachia i llc as well as associated pipeline assets of xcl midstream thq appalachia which is owned by privately held gas producer tug hill operating related saudis take the lead in new round of opec cuts eqt said the assets acquired include 90k core net acres offsetting its existing core leasehold in west virginia producing 800m cfe day and expected to generate free cash flow at average natural gas prices above 1 35 mmbtu over the next five years the company also doubled its buyback program to 2b and said it is increasing its year end 2023 debt reduction goal to 4b from 2 5b last year eqt unveiled a plan centered on producing more liquified natural gas by dramatically increasing natural gas drilling in appalachia and around the country s shale basins as well as pipeline and export terminal capacity which it said would not only boost united states energy security but also help break the global reliance on coal and on countries like russia and iran its latest acquisition will therefore help the company meet its goal eqt shares have nearly doubled in the year to date the second largest deal last term was german asset manager ikav s 4 billion deal for aera energy a california oil joint venture between shell plc nyse shel and exxon mobil nyse xom operating mostly in central california s san joaquin valley aera is one of california s largest oil producers at 125k bbl day of oil with 32m cf day of natural gas generating 1b in cash annually a year ago reuters reported that shell wanted to exit the venture and exxon later joined the effort assisted by financial advisor jpmorgan chase back in september oil and gas mineral and royalty company sitio royalties corp nyse str is merged with brigham minerals nyse mnrl in an all stock deal with an aggregate enterprise value of 4 8b thus creating one of the largest publicly traded mineral and royalty companies in the united states like the rest of the industry sitio and brigham have seen both their top and bottom lines expand at a brisk clip on the back of rising oil prices combining the two companies will allow the new entity to achieve significant economies of scale and become a leader in the minerals rights industry the merger created a company with complimentary high quality assets in the permian basin and other oil focused regions the combined company will have nearly 260k net royalty acres 50 3 net line of sight wells operated by a well capitalized diverse set of e p companies and a pro forma q2 net production of 32 8k boe day the deal is also expected to bring in 15 million in annual operational cash cost synergies sitio and brigham shareholders received 54 and 46 of the combined company respectively on a fully diluted basis sitio royalties recently reported a q2 net income of 72m on revenues of 88m another notable deal diamondback energy inc nasdaq fang has entered a deal to acquire all leasehold interest and related assets of firebird energy llc for 775 million in cash and 5 86 million diamondback shares with the deal valued at 1 6 billion eagle ford in focus the eagle ford was the hardest hit region in the u s shale patch and has lagged behind other regions during the ongoing ramp up in production but as energy analytics company rbn energy has noted m a and drilling have lately been surging in the shale play to wit two weeks ago marathon oil nyse mro announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the eagle ford assets of ensign natural resources for 3 billion marathon says it expects the deal will be immediately and significantly accretive to key financial metrics and will drive a 17 increase to 2023 operating cash flow and a 15 increase to free cash flow immediately enhancing shareholder distributions in late september devon energy nyse dvn closed on the 1 8 billion acquisition of privately held eagle ford producer validus energy according to devon this acquisition secured a premier acreage position of 42 000 net acres 90 working interest adjacent to devon s existing leasehold in the basin current production from the acquired assets is 35 000 boe per day and is expected to increase to an average of 40 000 boe per day over the next year earlier eog resources nyse eog announced plans to significantly expand its production of natural gas at its dorado gas play in the eagle ford eog has estimated that its dorado assets hold 21 trillion cubic feet tcf of gas at a breakeven cost of less than 1 25 mmbtu drilling activity is also up in the eagle ford with the region now home to 71 rigs compared to just 20 a year ago overall the u s shale drilling and fracking activity is showing good signs of a rebound with current rig count of 779 a good 223 rigs higher than a year ago but a full recovery is far from guaranteed eog has forecast that overall u s oil output will increase by between 700 000 and 800 000 barrels per day this year however eog s top executive has warned that next year s gains will likely trend lower pioneer natural resources nyse pxd has an even gloomier outlook predicting that u s production will only increase around 500 000 barrels per day this year one of the lowest forecasts by any analyst and fall even lower than that in the coming year advertisement whereas rbn energy has been touting the ongoing resurgence in the eagle ford looking at the bigger picture reveals the rebound is far from established and is yet to measure up to the sharp ramp up in the 2012 2015 period this applies across the entire u s shale patch as oil executives limit their expansion and prefer to return excess cash to shareholders source u s energy information administration eia a week ago the energy information administration eia released its latest short term energy outlook steo wherein it revised its 2022 and 2023 oil production outlooks the new projections have elicited mixed reactions across the board with bloomberg saying the projection suggests the pace of u s shale growth one of the few sources of major new supply in recent year is slowing despite oil prices hovering at around 90 a barrel about double most domestic producers breakeven costs if the trend continues it would deprive the global market of additional barrels to help make up for opec production cuts and disruption to russian supplies amid its invasion of ukraine recently norwegian energy intelligence firm rystad energy revealed that a mere 44 oil and gas lease rounds will take place globally this year the fewest since the year 2000 and a far cry from a record 105 rounds in 2019 according to the norwegian energy analyst only two new blocks had been licensed for drilling in the u s as of the end of august this year with no new offers for oil and gas leases originating with the biden administration itself indeed the handful of auctions that have gone ahead under biden or bled into his presidency were decided upon during the presidency of donald trump meanwhile rystad has revealed that brazil norway and india are the world leaders in terms of new

senate budget committee chairwoman patty murray d wa unveiled the first senate budget in four years murray deserves some credit for actually advancing a budget but her budget contains steep tax increases that would reduce economic growth by increasing the cost of capital investment murray s tax plan singles out corporations and individuals that are already faced with high tax rates while most industrialized nations are moving to reduce their corporate tax rates murray plans to increase america s effective corporate tax rate murray s tax increases murray s budget is clear in that it directly calls for 975 billion in new tax increases over the next decade however the budget also contains some techniques for even higher tax increases it creates special funds to offset new spending and replaces the sequestration spending cuts minority budget committee staff estimate that the new senate budget could actually raise taxes by over 1 5 trillion in the next 10 years the senate budget is only a framework document but it clearly lays out who should pay the higher taxes the democratic majority wants higher taxes by eliminating loopholes and cutting unfair and inefficient spending in the tax code for the wealthiest americans and biggest corporations higher corporate tax rates are the exact opposite path taken by most other industrialized countries the united states has the highest corporate tax rate in the world and its competitors have been reducing their corporate tax rates for example germany has reduced its top tax rate from 45 percent to 15 percent over the past 13 years overall the european union has reduced its average corporate tax rate by almost 10 percentage points since 2000 many economists deem the corporate tax as the most harmful tax to economic growth some of the larger individual income tax expenditure items listed by the joint tax committee are the mortgage interest deduction tax exclusion of health care benefits alternate rates for capital gains and dividends the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit the latter two are by definition not earned by the wealthiest americans because they are phased out as a taxpayer s income increases it is therefore likely that senate democrats would have to sharply raise the tax rate on capital gains and dividends to generate the needed higher tax revenue specified in their budget attacking capital harming the economy the tax increases in the senate budget committee proposal would likely move in the opposite direction of pro growth tax reform senator murray s tax proposal raises 1 55 trillion in additional taxes that will likely fall on the wealth households and biggest corporations we estimate the economic and budgetary effects of directing the tax increases toward wealthy households and large americans by removing some of the tax preferences related to lower rates on capital gains and dividends and to corporations slowdown in private business investment the murray tax proposal would slow private business investment substantially over the 10 year forecast period increasing taxes on capital and corporate income would slow business investment by 82 billion annually over the 10 year forecast the slowdown in business investment and capital in the u s economy contributes to a slowdown of 1 4 trillion in real economic output and an average 853 000 u s jobs over the 10 year forecast period lower household income and wealth the burden of these tax increases would not entirely fall on corporate shareholders and wealthy americans american households would have less opportunity to grow their income and overall wealth the tax increases would likely slow the s p 500 index of common stocks by an average 17 percent from baseline levels over the first five years and an average 14 percent relative to baseline levels over the 10 year period declining asset values and lower income after tax personal income would decline an average 180 billion annually would leave households with an average 1 8 trillion less net wealth annually slower growth less federal revenue the murray tax proposal would generate less federal revenue as the economy slows dynamically when accounting for the economic feedbacks of the increased taxes on personal and corporate incomes the murray proposal would achieve about 57 percent 878 billion of the 1 55 trillion static revenue estimate over the entire 10 year forecast period senator murray s tax proposal achieves less than the average annual static revenue estimate 155 billion assuming that the tax increases offsetting higher spending in the murray budget continue to balance this means the total deficit reduction in senator murray s budget would be a net 200 billion substantially less than the 1 85 trillion in deficit saving assumed by senator murray s budget salt in the wound the senate budget committee s tax hikes would harm economic growth by raising taxes on business and capital investment most other countries have chosen to reduce the tax rate on corporations in order to maximize economic growth the shortsighted budget produced by senator murray would result in 1 4 trillion less in total economic output and 853 000 fewer jobs over the 10 year forecast period it is bad enough that the senate budget committee has abdicated responsibility on fixing entitlements but the salt in the wound is the harmful higher taxes that would impact american businesses individuals and families rea s hederman jr is director of and research fellow in and john l ligon is a senior policy analyst in the center for data analysis at the heritage foundation appendix a methodology heritage analysts used the ihs global insight 2013 march short term u s macroeconomic model ihs global insight is a leading economic forecasting firm in the united states this model is used by private sector and government economists to estimate how changes in the economy and public policy are likely to affect major economic indicators the methodologies assumptions conclusions and opinions presented here are entirely the work of analysts in the center for data analysis at the heritage foundation they have not been endorsed by and do not necessarily reflect the views of the owners of the global insight model the senate budget argues that savings found by eliminating loopholes and inefficient and unfair spending in the u s federal tax code should not increase the tax burden on middle class families or the most vulnerable americans who already have sacrificed greatly in recent deficit reduction efforts therefore the savings should come only from the wealthiest americans and the biggest corporations in this analysis we assume that the static revenue estimate in the senate budget will fall on tax preferences related to capital gains income dividend income and corporate income we use 1 55 trillion in static revenue to achieve this amount we made adjustments to achieve tax rates on capital gains dividends and corporate income to raise the 1 55 trillion in revenue moreover to achieve the 1 55 trillion in static revenue we increase the rates on these income types by 8 percentage points equally divided through personal and corporate taxes on corporate income we use the handle in the model that measures the difference between the effective and statutory corporate income tax rate the change in the variable reduces the difference between the statutory and effective rate on corporate income thereby increasing the effective rate there was no change imposed on the statutory corporate income tax rate appendix b

whether trump s account should be restored the yes vote won with 51 8 previously musk had said twitter would establish new procedures and a content moderation council before making decisions to restore suspended accounts the people have spoken trump will be reinstated vox populi vox dei musk tweeted using a latin phrase meaning the voice of the people the voice of god shortly afterward trump s account which had earlier appeared as suspended reappeared on the platform complete with his former tweets more than 59 000 of them his followers were gone at least initially but he quickly began regaining them there were no new tweets from the account as of late saturday however musk restored the account less than a month after the tesla ceo took control of twitter and four days after trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential race it is not clear whether trump would actually return to twitter an irrepressible tweeter before he was banned trump has said in the past that he would not rejoin even if his account was reinstated he has been relying on his own much smaller social media site truth social which he launched after being blocked from twitter and on saturday during a video speech to a republican jewish group meeting in las vegas trump said that he was aware of musk s poll but that he saw a lot of problems at twitter i hear we re getting a big vote to also go back on twitter i don t see it because i don t see any reason for it trump said it may make it it may not make it he added apparently referring to twitter s recent internal upheavals the prospect of restoring trump s presence to the platform follows musk s purchase last month of twitter an acquisition that has fanned widespread concern that the billionaire owner will allow purveyors of lies and misinformation to flourish on the site musk has frequently expressed his belief that twitter had become too restrictive of freewheeling speech his efforts to reshape the site have been both swift and chaotic musk has fired many of the company s 7 500 full time workers and an untold number of contractors who are responsible for content moderation and other crucial responsibilities his demand that remaining employees pledge to extremely hardcore work triggered a wave of resignations including hundreds of software engineers users have reported seeing increased spam and scams on their feeds and in their direct messages among other glitches in the aftermath of the mass layoffs and worker exodus some programmers who were fired or resigned this week warned that twitter may soon fray so badly it could actually crash musk s online survey posted on his own twitter account drew more than 15 million votes in the 24 hours in which it ran musk conceded that the results were hardly scientific bot troll armies might be running out of steam soon he tweeted saturday morning some interesting lessons to clean up future polls it s not the first time he s used twitter polling to make business decisions last year he sold millions of shares of his tesla stock after asking his followers whether he should democratic u s rep alexandria ocasio cortez of new york responded to musk s poll on trump by tweeting video of the jan 6 insurrection she tweeted friday that when trump was last on twitter it was used to incite an insurrection multiple people died the vice president of the united states was nearly assassinated and hundreds were injured but i guess that s not enough for you to answer the question twitter poll it is trump lost his access to twitter two days after his supporters stormed the capitol soon after the former president had exhorted them to fight like hell twitter dropped his account after trump wrote a pair of tweets that the company said cast further doubts on the legitimacy of the presidential election and raised risks for the biden presidential inauguration after the jan 6 attack trump was also kicked off facebook and instagram which are owned by meta platforms and snapchat his ability to post videos to his youtube channel was also suspended facebook is set to reconsider trump s suspension in january throughout his tenure as president trump s use of social media posed a significant challenge to major social media platforms that sought to balance the public s interest in hearing from public officials with worries about misinformation bigotry harassment and incitement of violence but in a speech at an auto conference in may musk asserted that twitter s ban of trump was a morally bad decision and foolish in the extreme earlier this month musk who completed the 44 billion takeover of twitter in late october declared that the company wouldn t let anyone who had been kicked off the site return until twitter had established procedures on how to do so including forming a content moderation council on friday musk tweeted that the suspended twitter accounts for the comedian kathy griffin the canadian psychologist jordan peterson and the conservative christian news satire website babylon bee had been reinstated he added that a decision on trump had not yet been made he also responded no when someone on twitter asked him to reinstate the conspiracy theorist alex jones account in a tweet friday the tesla ceo described the company s new content policy as freedom of speech but not freedom of reach he explained that a tweet deemed to be negative or to include hate would be allowed on the site but would be visible only to users who specifically searched for it such tweets also would be demonetized so no ads or other revenue to twitter musk said ___ this story has been corrected to reflect that the yes vote was 51 8 not 51 2 copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast

businesses in bangladesh went through a tough time in recent months due to a dearer us dollar that pushed up their costs of raw materials and a rocketing fuel bill that contributed to the surge in operating expenses the fear of an economic slowdown because of the dragging russia ukraine war and the global energy crisis has made inflation hit people more cautious forcing them to tighten their purse strings that hurt the bottom line of companies it was evident again in the financial performance of 300 companies listed on the dhaka stock exchange in the july to september quarter of the current financial year of 2022 23 they represented almost all sectors of the economy of them 110 companies posted a reduced profit in the three month period compared to the identical quarter a year earlier thirty eight companies slipped into losses for the first time while the losses for 30 firms widened in the quarter data compiled by sandhani asset management showed some 122 companies showed higher profits despite the mounting challenges at home and abroad the performance was not surprising as the whole world is suffering because of the russia ukraine war we are also facing the heat of the global crisis said kazi iqbal a senior research fellow at the bangladesh institute of development studies firms are facing monumental challenges on both the demand and supply sides on the demand side people are buying less since their purchasing power has been squeezed for higher consumer prices which surged to a decade high in bangladesh in august people are also worried that the economy may slow down further since the factors responsible for the current global crisis and the strain facing bangladesh s economy are still there and there are little signs that they would disappear anytime soon on the supply side the cost of production has gone up for the higher global commodity prices the unprecedented us dollar rate and the fuel prices locally since november last year the government has hiked the diesel price twice sending it to tk 109 per litre from tk 65 to minimise the subsidy on petroleum products all of the factors have combined to hit the businesses iqbal said among the major sectors the banking sector did comparatively better the worst performers include electric electronic and home appliance and insurance sectors the data showed the export based companies also suffered in the july september quarter as the world economy and the export destinations of bangladesh especially are seeing high inflation so demand for imported goods in these countries has dropped said rizwan rahman president of the dhaka chamber of commerce and industry inflation in the 19 member eurozone surged to 10 per cent in september the highest since records began in the us it was 8 2 per cent in the month hovering near the highest levels since the early 1980s amid the worsening cost of living crisis nearly three quarters of european consumers are cutting back spending on everyday items including food to make ends meet according to iri a data analytics and market research company reported bloomberg recently the eu and the us together account for more than 80 per cent of bangladesh s export earnings exports from bangladesh dropped 6 25 per cent year on year to 3 9 billion in september the first fall in 14 months leading to an overall slowdown in shipment the fmcg fast moving consumer goods companies that serve the local consumers were also suffering from a lower profit since the cost of operation rose said rahman the depreciation of the local currency against the us dollar sent the raw material costs soaring the taka lost its value by at least 25 per cent versus the american greenback in september compared to a year prior amid fast depletion of the foreign currency reserves the insurance sector suffered significantly in the july september quarter as the opening of letters of credit for imports dropped providing insurance coverage to lcs is a major source of income for insurers said rahman also a director of eastland insurance company limited some large companies such as walton hi tech industries singer bangladesh runner automobiles aci ltd ifad autos and baraka power incurred losses in the first quarter of 2022 23 they logged profits in the same period a year earlier walton the largest electric and electronic items manufacturer in bangladesh blamed the war higher global inflation the price hike of materials higher freight costs vulnerable market condition and devaluation of the local currency for the decrease in profits abdul matlub ahmad a former president of the federation of bangladesh chambers of commerce and industries the apex trade body in the country said all businesses suffer due to the government s recent decision to reduce imports and the squeeze in spending by consumers in order to save the foreign exchange reserves whose level fell by 25 per cent since the war began the government has limited the imports of non essential and luxury items but since manufacturers rely on foreign markets to buy raw materials the import restriction has hit the economy said ahmad also the chairman of nitol niloy group of companies people are cash strapped so they are cautious against buying luxury items as a result the sales of the luxury items manufacturers have fallen runner automobiles said it posted losses in the first quarter for the shrinking sales higher cost of production import restrictions and the overall economic downturn it has been further compounded by the war and its fallout on the world economy it said singer bangladesh said economic activities remained depressed during the reporting period as freight energy and food price shocks continued to impact adversely these adversities have created uncertainty and consumers have deferred purchase unless it is absolutely necessary it said
non verbals are anything that communicates but it s not a word the public knows them as body language how we dress how we walk have meaning and we use that to interpret what s in the mind of the person my name is joe navarro and for 25 years i was a special agent with the fbi my job was to catch spies most of my career i spent within the national security division a lot of it had to do with looking at specific targets and it was about how to get in their heads and how to neutralize them our security is based on non verbals we look at the person through the peephole we look at who s behind us at the atm machine we know from the research that most of us select our mates based on non verbals so we may think we re very sophisticated but in fact we are never in a state where we re not transmitting the information there are a lot of myths out there the ones that stand out are if you cross your arms it s a blocking behavior that s just nonsense even when you don t like the person in front of you this isn t to block them out it s actually to self soothe because in essence it s a self hug when you re sitting at a movie and you re watching you re going to cross your arms when you re waiting for somebody you tend to cross your arms what s interesting is we do this behavior more in public than in private the other one that really stands out is as we think about something we may look in a certain way as we process the information we may look in another way it s certainly not indicative of deception and it really shouldn t be used that way all we can say is the person is processing the information the other misconceptions are that if the person clears their throat touches their nose or covers their mouth they re lying we do these behaviors as self soothers they re pacifying behaviors scientifically and empirically there s just no pinocchio effect and people who prattle that and say well we can detect deception because the person touches their nose or covers their mouth that s just sheer nonsense we humans are lousy at detecting deception don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free espionage org is often nowhere near what we see in movies and in one of the cases we had information from another country saying you have an american we think is actually a mole who somehow entered the united states is able to pass as an american but he s here working for a hostile intelligence service and just fortuitously he was video graphed coming out of a flower shop we re looking at the video and everybody in our small unit we were saying well there s not much there you know he s coming out of the shop getting in his car and i said stop the film right there just as he came out of the shop he took the flowers and most americans tend to hold the flowers by the stock so the flowers are up this individual took them grabbed the stock and then held the flowers so they were facing down and i said that s how they carry flowers in eastern europe rather than confront him about being a spy i decided to do what s called a presumptive so as i sat there with him i said would you like to know how we know and he had this look on his face and i said it was the flowers and then he confessed when i came into law enforcement i thought it was all about confession it s really about facetime in my 25 years in the fbi it was a rarity that a person didn t eventually reveal what i needed to know because we would sit down and have these very lengthy conversations i look at behaviors to do an assessment what is this person transmitting in relation to any stimuli my further questioning comes from my observing these behaviors 1 the forehead the first thing i look at is i look at the hair does it look healthy does it look well groomed the forehead is very interesting because a lot of times we reveal stress a lot of the things that we have gone through life are often etched on the forehead 2 the eyes i look at the eyes to see if they re red or not enough sleep this small area between the eyes is called the labella it s one of the first areas that reveal information to us most often when we don t like something we do that runny nose of i don t like we don t really know what our lips look like and we tend to compress them when something bothers us when something really bothers us we tend to suck them in the mandibular 3 the cheeks at the cheeks we may do something like rub our tongue against the inside of the cheek but when we try to hide it then it tells me that this person is trying to do some perception management and if they are i want to know why 4 the neck at the neck i want to see if there s any head tilt because with a head tilt the person is more relaxed the minute the head tilt goes away there s usually some issue 5 the shoulders i m looking at the shoulders you ask somebody a question and they don t know both shoulders shoot up very quickly 6 the hands then i look at the hands when something s troubling us we tend to stiffen our fingers interlace them and almost like a teepee we move our hands back and forth very slowly this is to be differentiated from when we do the steeple when something s at issue we tend to put our hands on our hips and we become very territorial this is called arms akimbo but it changes when we put our thumbs forward and then it becomes more inquisitive but i also look for any behaviors of ventilating because men tend to ventilate at the neck and we do at the very instant something bothers us 7 legs then i look at the legs to see if there s any brushing of the legs with the hands which is again to pacify and then the feet do i see any behaviors such as wiggling of the feet kicking off the feet if i asked a question and all of a sudden the feet withdraw and are crossed perhaps the person feels a little threatened by that question so when we study non verbals it s not about making judgments it s about assessing what the person transmitting at that moment it really is looking at an individual and saying what are they transmitting we re all transmitting at all times we choose the clothes that we wear how we groom ourselves how we dress but also how we carry ourselves are we coming to the office on this particular day with a lot of energy or are we coming in with a different sort of pace and what we look for are differences in behavior down to the minutiae of what is this individual s posture as they re walking down the street are they on the inside of the sidewalk on the outside can we see his blink rate don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free can we see how often he s looking at his watch i know your blink rate is around eight eight times a minute but you don t know that you re not sitting there counting all these things factor in because they re transmitting the information now it s up to us to then use that information to say okay we need to marshal resources to be on that individual right now in most western cultures the first time people touch is when they shake hands touching becomes that important because we can always remember a time when we shook hands with someone and we didn t like that it s also the first time when our bodies release these bonding chemicals that say i like this person or i don t like this person so handshaking is both necessary and essential in most cultures like during ubereats delivery actually when i was in college in the early 70s there were really no courses on nonverbal communication you quickly realize that to a great extent it s really about what you can interpret from behavior and so we talk about non verbals because it matters because it has gravitas because it affects how we communicate with each other when it comes to non verbals this is no small matter we primarily communicate non verbally and we always will this post was previously published on medium com
washington november 20 ani the us should be cautious and hesitant in delivering more military support to pakistan such as the f 16s where there is no guarantee that they will be used competently dr sajjan m gohel the international security director at the asia pacific foundation think tank and marcus andreopoulos a senior research fellow at the asia pacific foundation writing in war on the rocks wotr said that by fulfilling pakistan s wishes on the f 16 the biden administration may be hoping it will help shore up the fragile governing coalition from outside interference however it is the machinations of pakistan s military that remain constant and will continue to shape what transpires within the country the biden administration authorized the sale of military equipment worth usd 450 million to pakistan to enhance the air to ground capabilities of the country s current stock of f 16 fighter aircraft this most recent sale is the latest chapter in a decades long back and forth between washington and islamabad in which bilateral relations have fluctuated erratically said gohel and andreopoulos the contorted situation of the f 16 raises a perennial yet fundamental dilemma on whether washington can ever really achieve its objectives with pakistan regarding cooperation in preventing afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for terrorist groups curtailing nuclear proliferation ending hostilities with india and containing china s expanding clout in south asia the answers will likely turn out to be disappointing as they have in the past in part this is because multiple us administrations pass laws with the intention of taking a principled stand in holding pakistan accountable for its ties to terrorism or nuclear proliferation but then subsequently seek to find workarounds when there is an impending strategic security concern pakistan has understood this all too well reported wotr for pakistan s establishment statecraft of strategic depth outweighs the economic and social challenges that continue to engulf the country and which in turn heighten insecurity in the region the security ramifications of how the united states handles the f 16 matter carry enormous geopolitical significance ranging from nuclear conflict conventional warfare counter terrorism and containing chinese influence said gohel and andreopoulos the history of us negotiations with pakistan illustrates that the temporary tactical and transactional nature of the relationship has enabled pakistan to pursue its adversarial military doctrine of strategic depth in afghanistan to hedge against india in which the f 16s became a key tool while also furthering the ambitions of a nuclear weapons programme f 16 refurbishments are not going to resolve pakistan s crippling economic and humanitarian crisis and may instead contribute to the cycle of military opaqueness and intransigence over the stable democratic civilian rule reported wotr washington should stop using f 16s to try and leverage security and non proliferation commitments from pakistan as pakistan is mired in political economic and environmental instability the risk is that providing islamabad with more weapons will be counterproductive because they exacerbate regional tensions said gohel and andreopoulos instead washington should recognize that these sales and upgrades prop up actors in the country that sometimes work against american interests all but ensuring that clashes over the sale of this jet and other american hardware will continue long into the future moreover the nuclear risk is a by product of pakistan s instability which has occurred directly due to the troubling relationship its military sustains with violent extremists pakistan s commitment to preserve its nuclear arsenal is also configured to level the defence battlefield with india ironically instead of being a conventional deterrent the f 16 could instead be used to carry nuclear warheads expressing apprehensions over the biden administration s decision to upgrade pakistan s f 16 fleet india s external affairs minister s jaishankar implied that the primary use of the aircraft would be to wage war with india jaishankar s concerns are not without merit tensions between pakistan and india ignited in february 2019 after the jaish e mohammed terrorist group carried out a suicide bombing in jammu and kashmir that killed 40 indian security personnel pakistan had deployed f 16s against india as opposed to the chinese built jf 17 thunder that they initially claimed to have used violating the terms of sale from the united states ani
like the united states australia has been confronted by a dual crisis in its government run old age pension system benefits payments to an aging population threatened to consume ever larger amounts of australia s budget according to projections in the 1980s yet the australian social security system clearly was unable to provide an adequate income for retirees in 1986 in an effort to address these serious problems a left of center labor government began to implement an innovative retirement system based primarily on mandatory private savings in plans called superannuation funds this system which in 1992 became known as the superannuation guarantee continued to be modified and expanded and now features three key elements first workers contribute a set percentage of their income through their employer to private savings plans by 2002 when the system is fully implemented all workers will be required to set aside 9 percent of their income in a superannuation fund of their choice see appendix 1 this mandatory savings can be augmented by tax favored voluntary contributions second upon retirement workers will have accumulated a large nest egg from which to draw a secure and comfortable annual income third a safety net program guarantees that all retirees will receive an income that at least matches the income they would receive under the original government run program even though australia s private retirement savings plan is still very young it is quite popular the benefits which have begun to materialize herald a significant long term improvement in the australian economy for example more income for retirees in the future average wage workers should be able to retire with two to three times the income they would have had under the original government run system depending on the level of additional voluntary savings and the earnings performance of the superannuation funds increased national savings the overall savings rate could climb by more than 3 percent of gross domestic product gdp by 2020 already private savings in superannuation funds have skyrocketed rising from au 40 billion us 28 billion in 1985 to au 304 billion us 240 billion as of june 1997 reduced pressures on the budget because eligibility for taxpayer financed age pensions is now means tested the higher incomes made possible by privatization will lead to substantial budget savings government spending on age pensions will reach only 4 72 percent of gdp in 2050 one third less than would have been needed had the government chosen to provide an american style universal social security retirement benefit in the united states social security retirement outlays are expected to consume 5 59 percent of gdp by 2050 the united states faces many of the same challenges that australia confronted in trying to ensure an adequate retirement income for its aging population the u s social security system is expected to begin running a deficit by 2012 as the baby boom population approaches retirement policymakers grapple with a serious dilemma how can they reform social security to give american workers a comfortable and secure retirement while addressing the system s massive long term deficit as a model for reform australia s transition from a government run benefits program to a system based on private savings was a resourceful answer to the challenges the australian government faced like similar privatization efforts in chile and great britain australia s system offers legislators in the united states several key lessons for reforming the troubled social security system why australia had to reform its pension system the government run old age pension system in australia was created in 1909 to help lower income retirees the government progressively began relaxing means testing and moving toward a universal age pension after world war ii by 1983 all australians over the age of 69 received a full age pension regardless of income and the rules for men 65 to 69 years old and women from 60 to 69 years old were so lax that almost all of them qualified for a full age pension as well this social security system was just one part of a massive expansion of government s role in the australian economy between 1901 and 1983 among other things policymakers tried to promote industrial development through high tariffs and subsidies to manufacturers the government nationalized most energy telecommunications and transportation companies it also created a highly centralized system of wage bargaining known as the award system in which employer organizations labor unions and the government jointly established wages and working conditions across entire industries based on concepts of social justice rather than on market conditions the economic impact of these policies not surprisingly turned out to be negative australia s per capita gdp went from the highest in the world in 1900 to 14th by 1980 this long term decline as well as fears of a more immediate economic crisis drove the newly elected labor government in 1983 to implement fundamental changes in australia s economic policies then treasurer paul keating best summarized the challenges facing australia we must let australians know truthfully honestly earnestly just what sort of international hole australia is in if this government cannot get a sensible economic policy then australia is basically done for we will end up being just a third rate economy then you are gone you are a banana republic as part of the new labor government s comprehensive economic reform program the social security system was given a thorough re examination prime minister bob hawke and treasurer paul keating found that government policy discouraged private savings and left too many australians dependent on social security age pensions as their primary source of retirement income moreover these policies were causing adverse consequences for the nation s economy the dire problems confronting australian policymakers included the following less than 40 percent of all workers participated in public or private pension plans superannuation funds before 1983 and coverage was limited to government employees financial sector workers professionals and senior business executives accumulated retirement savings generally could not be transferred from one employer s superannuation fund to another when an australian changed employment this lack of portability along with the preferential tax treatment of lump sum distributions 95 percent of lump sum distributions from superannuation funds were tax exempt often meant that superannuation merely provided high income australians with a way to acquire virtually tax free income upon changing employment dependence on social security age pensions contributed to reduced national savings and depressed economic growth indeed australia s national savings rate had declined from an average of more than 25 percent in the early 1970s to 16 1 percent in fiscal year 1991 1992 the population was growing older from 1994 to 2051 the number of australians 65 or older will climb from 11 9 percent to about 23 percent of the total population the growth in the aging population also means that dependence on social security age pensions would threaten long term fiscal stability age pension payments consumed 3 44 percent of gdp in fy 1982 1983 and were projected to rise dramatically as the population aged potentially reaching 6 8 percent of gdp by fy 2049 2050 if australia continued on the path to a universal age pension like the u s social security program the private savings solution to address these serious problems the labor government decided to restructure australia s retirement policy policymakers decided that a new system should satisfy three goals provide more retirement income for future retirees increase national savings and reduce long term pressures on the budget the government concluded that the best way to achieve these goals was to reduce the scope of government tax and transfer schemes and instead promote greater individual reliance through a system of mandatory private savings as a result the labor government took the following steps during its 13 years in power means testing of age pensions in 1983 the labor government reversed the trend toward a universal old age pension and strengthened means testing for age pensions the existing income based means test was extended to australians age 70 or over a new asset based means test also was imposed see appendix 2 superannuation portability and penalties for pre retirement withdrawals to encourage australians to preserve their superannuation savings until retirement two new rollover vehicles were created in 1983 approved deposit funds and deferred annuities these vehicles allowed australians to keep their superannuation savings when they changed jobs in addition a 30 percent tax was imposed on lump sum withdrawals from superannuation funds before age 55 award superannuation in 1985 the labor government reached an agreement with australia s chief labor organization the australian council of trade unions to seek a universal 3 percent contribution for each employee to a superannuation fund in lieu of a general wage increase through the award system in 1986 the industrial relations commission endorsed this agreement and incorporated this employer mandate into all future labor contracts as of july 1991 72 percent of all employees were covered by award superannuation superannuation guarantee in 1992 the government introduced the superannuation guarantee sg to expand award superannuation to cover virtually all workers under sg every employer is required to contribute a prescribed minimum on behalf of each employee to a superannuation fund the required minimum contribution was set at 3 percent of an employee s earnings in fy 1992 1993 and will rise gradually to 9 percent by 2002 2003 savings in superannuation funds are fully vested and portable between employers under current law savings in superannuation funds must be preserved until retirement after age 55 in march 1996 australians elected a liberal party national party coalition government which made further reforms in the system in may 1997 these included tax relief to promote additional non compulsory private savings the tax burden was lowered on savings during the 1998 1999 fiscal year period individuals will be allowed a 7 5 percent tax credit of up to au 225 about us 177 and a 15 percent tax credit in 1999 2000 and beyond of up to au 450 us 355 these credits will apply to savings income and or additional voluntary contributions to superannuation accounts consumer choice private sector workers were given the right to choose a fund from at least five options into which their employers would deposit their superannuation savings as of july 1 1998 these options must include 1 any relevant industry superannuation fund 2 any corporate superannuation fund 3 at least one retail superannuation fund and 4 a new kind of superannuation fund the retirement savings account rsa provided by the bank or financial institution receiving an employee s pay rsas are low risk low return capital guaranteed funds offered by banks building societies credit unions and life insurance companies more retirement income to maximize the amount of savings in each superannuation account and therefore the size of the annuity that could be purchased early hardship withdrawals are prohibited and the preservation age before which no withdrawals could be made will be raised from 55 in 2015 to 60 by 2025 gender neutrality the government age pension program was modified to ensure equal treatment for men and women currently women may receive age pensions at age 61 while men must wait until age 65 as of 2013 neither sex will be able to qualify for the government safety net program until age 65 retaining the safety net although there is a strong consensus in australia that individuals should be responsible for saving for their own retirement a safety net will remain in place to ensure that no one will be worse off under the privatized system in effect every retiree is guaranteed an age pension equal to 25 percent of the average worker s wage exactly what was available before privatization moreover the means testing provisions for the government age pension are extremely generous even though almost all retirees will have some income from their superannuation savings more than 33 percent of senior citizens in 2050 will get a full age pension from the government all told a full 75 percent of the elderly population in 2050 will have their private savings income supplemented by full or partial government benefit payments these generous payments reflect australia s primary goals in adopting mandatory superannuation boosting retirement incomes and increasing national savings reducing government spending was a lower priority and while there will be significant long term budget savings they will not be nearly as large as they could have been with a stricter means testing policy a more rapid implementation of the sg savings mandate and elimination of the gap between the sg preservation age and the qualification age for age pension payments the results of successful reform by every possible measure the australian move to privatization thus far must be considered a success the labor government had committed itself to establishing a system that would satisfy three major goals providing more income for retirement increasing savings and reducing long term pressures on the budget as the following information illustrates australia is well on its way toward achieving those goals more income for future retirees increasing the level of private savings will result in significantly higher retirement income for australian workers predicting exactly how much higher is of course difficult because retirement income under the private system will depend on the earnings performance of the superannuation funds as well as the level of additional voluntary contributions yet even pessimistic scenarios show that privatization will boost old age income substantially the australian treasury s retirement income modeling task force for instance computed that average wage workers who made no voluntary contributions and earned only 4 percent in real returns each year a modest figure since the average over the last 10 years has been 5 5 percent will be able to retire with nearly twice as much income as they would have had under the old government run system more realistic assumptions such as higher average returns and some degree of voluntary savings have demonstrated that privatization easily could mean more than twice as much and perhaps about three times as much retirement income for the average australian worker as appendix 3 illustrates the benefits for different demographic examples are similarly startling increasing national savings the amount of funds in superannuation accounts has soared from 17 percent of gdp in 1985 au 40 billion to more than 55 percent of gdp in 1997 au 304 billion by 2020 superannuation assets are projected to reach more than 100 percent of gdp au 1 525 billion or us 1 202 billion policies to boost the level of voluntary savings also seem to be highly successful one third of superannuation deposits in the most recent reporting period for instance came from unforced employee contributions all told superannuation is projected to increase australia s national savings rate by at least 3 percent of gdp a reduction in long term budget pressures age pension reform and the growth of superannuation funds will have a long term positive impact on australia s fiscal position before reform australia had an almost universal age pension the australian treasury s retirement income modeling task force estimates that outlays for a universal age pension would have consumed 6 76 percent of gdp in fy 2049 fy 2050 because the labor government strengthened means testing for age pensions and initiated the superannuation guarantee however age pension outlays will be only 4 72 percent of gdp in fy 2049 fy 2050 potential future changes australian policymakers are largely satisfied with the core components of their newly privatized retirement system across the political spectrum legislators understand the flaws of the old government tax and transfer scheme and recognize that private savings can provide a more comfortable and secure retirement for the nation s senior citizens nonetheless some features of the new system continue to provoke debate and it is certainly possible that changes may be made in the near future the issues that are most likely to attract reform are the tax treatment of superannuation the coalition government announced that it will conduct a complete review of australia s tax code many lawmakers believe the tax laws are needlessly complex and impose unnecessarily harsh penalties on work savings and investment it is therefore possible that as part of comprehensive reform australia might choose to follow the lead of other nations with private retirement systems and abolish taxes on superannuation contributions and annual fund earnings taxing withdrawals upon retirement instead in other words rather than impose the 15 percent tax on workers contributions made by employers as well as the high income surcharge it might make contributions to superannuation funds tax deductible moreover both the 15 percent tax on interest and dividend income in superannuation funds and the 15 percent tax credit on withdrawals after retirement would be repealed these changes would accelerate the accumulation of assets within members superannuation funds during their working years and reduce their dependence on the age pension after retirement this approach would also ensure that the australian tax code does not put a disproportionately heavy burden on income that is saved a mandate that superannuation assets be used to finance retirement income australians can manipulate the current system in two ways to increase their age pension payments from the government first the gap between age 55 when sg benefits can be withdrawn and age 65 age 61 for women when age pension payments commence could tempt some australians to use their superannuation funds to finance early retirement and then rely on taxpayer financed age pensions after age 65 the coalition government previously agreed to raise the sg preservation age from 55 in 2015 to 60 in 2025 but this leaves a gap of five years pension experts advocate eliminating this gap to prevent citizens from double dipping in addition current law allows retirees to make large lump sum withdrawals from their superannuation funds this may tempt some workers even those who work until age 65 to dissipate their retirement funds by purchasing big ticket consumption items immediately and then relying more heavily on taxpayer financed age pensions in order to ensure that retirement savings are used for retirement income the government may decide to require that at least a portion of superannuation funds be used to purchase an annuity which would provide a minimum level of income in regular increments over time parallels to privatized retirement systems in chile and britain as various nations around the world rush to privatize their retirement systems and secure retirement income for their senior citizens americans continue to fear for the future of their social security system reformers can learn much from studying what other countries are doing and though an exhaustive comparison of the systems is beyond the scope of this paper it is worth noting how australia s system compares with those of chile and great britain two other countries whose privatization efforts have attracted considerable attention chile privatized its old age system in the early 1980s replacing a tax funded income transfer scheme with a system based on mandatory individual savings the amount of savings mandated for retirement accounts in chile is 10 percent which is quite similar to australia s 9 percent superannuation charge chile s system however has advantages and disadvantages on the positive side chile imposes a simple and neutral tax treatment on retirement savings moreover it imposes the savings mandate directly on the worker instead of using the employer as a middleman since labor economists are virtually unanimous in recognizing that employer financed benefits such as payments into pension funds come out of worker compensation the chilean approach deserves applause for its honesty however chile s pension funds are subject to excessive regulation a drawback which has the effect of limiting diversity and creating higher than necessary administrative costs as funds compete for customers on the basis on non performance criteria britain has a two tiered retirement system the first tier is an almost universal flat rate benefit provided by the government the second tier depends on earnings and workers can choose to use the government system or select a private pension alternative only 17 percent of workers have elected to stay in the government run program thus far while 73 percent have decided to divert 4 6 percentage points of their payroll tax into a private fund two differences between australia s system and britain s are worth highlighting first the system in great britain is best categorized as partial privatization though the labor government may propose more complete privatization sometime next year while australia s has been more sweeping however australia s privatized system like chile s does not compare favorably in terms of tax treatment the british government does not tax contributions to the accounts or the annual earnings of the accounts instead it imposes one layer of tax at the time of withdrawal lessons for american social security reformers the united states and australia are similar in many respects in australia 11 9 percent of the population is 65 or older compared with 12 7 percent in the united states both are high income developed countries with stable democratic governments the overall size and structure of their governments are also similar general government outlays in 1996 were 36 9 percent of gdp in australia and 35 8 percent of gdp in the united states it is therefore reasonable to surmise that reformers in the united states would draw lessons from the australian experience in reforming social security indeed when australia s labor government first embarked on this policy it faced obstacles that are not unlike those that exist in the u s it had for instance 1 6 million retirees receiving government age pensions a large majority of whom were apprehensive about any change in the existing system and a highly skeptical working age population of 8 4 million employees many of whom doubted that politicians would make changes that would enhance their retirement nevertheless australia overcame these challenges through an innovative privatization program combining mandatory contributions to private pension plans with means testing of social security age pension benefits some of the steps australian policymakers took are applicable to the united states as well to reform the social security system successfully u s policymakers should be honest about the shortcomings of the current system the labor government issued a series of reports culminating in security in retirement planning for tomorrow today in 1992 which stressed that working age australians could not expect the federal government to provide them with adequate retirement incomes in the future appeal to self interest australian leaders bob hawke and paul keating stressed that superannuation was the key to obtaining higher retirement incomes in other words working age australians needed to accumulate far greater private savings than they had in the past if they were to be secure in their retirement years appeal to national interest the labor government reminded australians about their country s low national saving rate compared to other developed countries informing them that age pension reform and the superannuation guarantee along with other macro economic and micro economic reforms would accelerate australia s economic growth and create new job opportunities protect existing beneficiaries policymakers realized that benefit reductions for existing retirees or those near retirement would be a major political liability for reform even though benefit reductions would generate immediate budget savings such outlay reductions would jeopardize the immense long term benefits to citizens and the nation from privatization avoid relying on appeals that the reform is needed to balance the government s books the fiscal benefits from introduction of the superannuation guarantee were presented almost as an afterthought in australia unlike in the united states where politicians focus on the need for individuals to sacrifice through higher payroll taxes and lower benefits to solve the federal government s fiscal problems discussions in australia stressed how comprehensive reform would benefit individuals by accelerating economic growth now and increasing retirement incomes later there are many other features of the australian system that offer valuable lessons to social security reformers because the two countries are so similar but it is also worth noting the differences between the united states and australia one big difference is that it is easier to change government policy in a parliamentary system in which one party generally controls all the levers of power than in a presidential system of checks and balances australia has a unique mixture of british parliamentary and american constitutional traditions so it is not as easy for australia to change policies as it is for other parliamentary nations such as great britain nonetheless it is still easier to make policy changes than it would be for policymakers in the united states with its presidential system of checks and balances pension reform in australia was facilitated as well by the award system of highly centralized collective bargaining indeed the unions were one of the biggest advocates of using private savings to boost retirement income although this system of collective labor negotiations has been partially deregulated since 1996 it helped the labor government to introduce mandatory private retirement savings to the workforce needless to say such a system does not exist in the united states finally the u s and australian governments fund their social security retirement benefits through different methods australia funded its old system and pays for the safety net portion of the new system out of general tax revenues in the united states social security benefits are financed through payroll taxes this significant difference actually could prove to be an advantage for reformers in the united states since policymakers could privatize the system by diverting some or all of current payroll taxes into private accounts rather than by trying to impose a new savings mandate on american workers conclusion privatization has been a huge success in australia workers will be able to retire with higher incomes the government has significantly reduced long term budget pressures and the economy will benefit by a dramatic increase in savings like other nations around the world australia recognized in the 1980s that replacing the government s tax and transfer old age retirement scheme with a private retirement system based on mandatory savings was a win win proposition because australia is in many ways politically and demographically similar to the united states american policymakers would be well advised to learn the lessons of australia s successful reforms appendix 1 how australia s superannuation guarantee sg works annual savings requirement currently 6 percent of income must be saved in a superannuation fund this rate will rise to 7 percent on july 1 1998 8 percent on july 1 2000 and 9 percent on july 1 2002 the charge is imposed on the first au 90 360 us 71 273 of pre tax cash employment compensation it is adjusted annually to keep pace with inflation see chart 6 collection of sg charge employers are responsible for withholding superannuation charges and depositing them in a fund selected by the worker the burden of the charge clearly falls on the worker since it is part of total employee compensation much as the individual income tax in the united states is a burden on workers even though it normally is withheld and sent to the internal revenue service by employers types of sg funds according to the march 1997 insurance and superannuation commission bulletin there are 137 808 superannuation funds in australia excluded funds the majority of all superannuation funds are small self managed pension plans known as excluded funds containing fewer than five members taken together excluded funds have 228 000 members and control 10 5 percent of all superannuation assets trustee managed funds in contrast 16 1 million australians are members of larger trustee managed superannuation funds there are four types of trustee managed funds corporate industry public sector and retail corporate funds typically are set up by large private sector employers these funds have 1 4 million members and control 20 9 percent of all superannuation assets the number of corporate funds is declining as more employers are meeting the sg mandate through retail funds industry funds are sponsored jointly by multiple employers and labor unions in an industrial sector these funds originally set up to receive the 3 percent award superannuation contributions now have 5 7 million members and control 6 3 percent of all superannuation assets public sector funds are established for employees of federal state and local government they have 2 55 million members and control 23 2 percent of all superannuation assets some public sector funds are not fully funded retail funds or public offer funds are provided by financial institutions such as banks insurers and securities firms sold through intermediaries to those eligible to contribute to superannuation funds or holding superannuation savings for retirement they typically are organized as master trusts allowing members to direct their contributions among a number of mutual fund investment options currently the 402 retail funds have more than 6 5 million members and control 24 2 percent of all superannuation assets annuities about 15 percent of superannuation assets are held by life insurance companies usually on behalf of retirees today most corporate funds as well as almost all excluded industry and retail funds are defined contribution plans in which the member bears the investment risk many public sector funds remain defined benefit plans in which the sponsoring employer is liable for pension payments to retirees regardless of whether accumulated contributions and earnings in the fund are sufficient to cover the pension payment liabilities in march 1997 only 16 percent of all member accounts were in defined benefit funds however because most public sector funds are defined benefit plans 52 percent of all assets held by non excluded funds were in defined benefit funds sg asset allocation and return overall sg assets are allocated under management as shown in chart 7 the insurance and superannuation commission isc reports that the average real rate of return for all superannuation funds was 5 5 percent for the 10 years ending on june 30 1996 sg regulation superannuation funds fall under the supervision of the insurance and superannuation commission to ensure that fund managers do not engage in self dealing or other forms of imprudent behavior the isc takes a light handed approach relying primarily on a high degree of disclosure of funds policies and performance to members other than a 5 percent ceiling on in house investments the government imposes virtually no regulations or restrictions on the investment decisions of superannuation funds sg taxation the tax treatment of superannuation is needlessly complex and excessive employees must pay a 15 percent income tax on employer contributions to their superannuation accounts workers earning more than au 70 000 approximately us 55 216 must pay an additional surcharge of up to 15 percent on employer contributions to their superannuation accounts workers also must pay a 15 percent income tax on any interest or dividend earnings in their accounts withdrawals from superannuation accounts upon retirement are subject to australia s income tax less a 15 percent credit this credit is designed to partially offset the taxation imposed on both the original contributions and fund earnings appendix 2 australia s government benefits payments and means testing provisions age pension benefits maximum biweekly payment single au 347 80 us 274 34 couple each au 290 10 us 228 83 age pensioners may also receive rent or residential care assistance a
