the company is floating at least 400 million worth of its common stock what happened intra cellular therapies itci 3 08 stock could have used a little financial therapy on tuesday the neurologic drugs focused biotech saw its shares decline by over 14 on the day following news that it is entering a new round of capital raising so what after market hours on monday intra cellular announced that it is floating a 400 million issue of its common stock the underwriters of the issue which include jpmorgan chase unit j p morgan and bank of america securities have been granted a 30 day option to collectively purchase up to an additional 60 million worth of the shares intra cellular gave quite a bit of detail as to how it would utilize the funds raised in the offering they will be deployed to fund the commercialization efforts of the company s caplyta a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar depression some will also be channeled toward furthering the development of its pipeline drugs the company did not specify exactly how many shares would be offered in the flotation monday s closing stock price was 52 01 at that level 400 million plus the potential 60 million for the underwriter option would equate to over 8 8 million shares now what at the moment intra cellular has nearly 81 5 million shares outstanding so while the new stock issue isn t overwhelmingly dilutive compared to others that have been floated in the biotech sector it isn t exactly small either the new financing move could also illustrate for some investors that the company is struggling with key fundamentals it continues to be in the red on the bottom line with deeper than expected losses in recent quarters

the current investor trend isn t the biotech stock s friend what happened for the second straight day the share price of otherwise popular coronavirus stock biontech bntx 0 61 fell on tuesday despite there being no direct catalysts for such a drop the shares of the german company ended the day nearly 3 5 lower so what biontech is it nearly goes without saying by now the co developer of the comirnaty coronavirus vaccine with pharmacuetical sector powerhouse pfizer pfe 1 82 the jab is the only one fully approved for use in the u s vaccines from moderna and johnson johnson s janssen currently hold only emergency use authorization eua both biontech and pfizer shares slipped on monday and tuesday which doesn t feel like a coincidence their sell offs instead appear to be part of a wider trend of investors either taking profits on the stocks and or vacating their positions in favor of titles seen to have more potential in a fingers crossed post pandemic world both companies saw their share prices rise precipitously more or less in line with the exploding popularity and widespread use of comirnaty following the food and drug administration s initial granting of an eua for the vaccine in december 2020 but lately as the world has occasionally glimpsed light at the end of the long coronavirus tunnel the two stocks have slipped from investor favor somewhat now what this sentiment is potentially more damaging to biontech than it is to pfizer the american company operates a sprawling business with a solid lineup of commercial treatments in numerous categories and a wide pipeline the relatively young european biotech on the other hand has only one product on the market and a far smaller set of treatments in development
okay yeah mhm so we re launching impossible chicken nuggets uh chicken is one of the most consumed categories of meats in the u s especially among children were launching a product that is delicious more nutritious for you lower saturated fat fewer calories and has far less impact on the environment so you can get breaded chicken now from beyond meat in the food service sector is a tender uh or you you could until it s sold out get at panda express as beyond original orange chicken and then also in a w in canada and so we have all these different outlets that are now selling the products and we re going into retail as well one of the things we re really excited about in this product is that we re using fava bean as the core protein source and what is exciting about that is that we re trying to introduce the consumer a diverse bench of proteins that we can pull from if you if you are one of these companies that are going into this with the hope and the mission of we re going to reduce human consumption of animals were going to reduce animal slaughter then you have to address chickens because you know billions of chickens are eating you know um chicken eating around the world is enormous in terms of the number of brands and a number of companies were still very much in the fighting out phase for a slice of the pie and they slice of the pie is you know the opportunity is huge advertisement kfc s new menu item tastes like chicken but isn t share copy link copy kentucky fried chicken is going to sell a new menu item that contains no chicken but tastes like it does the new plant based fried chicken nugget alternative called beyond fried chicken will be added to menus nationwide beginning monday jan 10 for a limited time it marks the first instance of a large national chain selling plant based chicken products rather than the hamburger or sausage alternatives that have become increasingly common the chain said related video above plant based chicken nuggets come to the u s market it s time said kfc u s president kevin hochman in an interview with cnn business he added that the chain s customers want to eat less animal protein but don t want to give up comfort food kfc which is owned by yum brands said in a press release that beyond fried chicken is packed with delicious flavor and the juicy satisfaction that you d expect from kfc s iconic fried chicken the new product is for customers that want to eat a little less animal based protein but that haven t become vegan or vegetarian hochman said beyond fried chicken can be ordered in a combo meal that includes a medium drink and fries or à la carte in six or 12 piece portions prices vary depending on location but start at 6 99 for six pieces and cost more for the other options kfc and beyond meat announced a partnership about a year ago to develop exclusive items for the fried chicken chain hochman said it has taken kfc a while to create a plant based recipe of its iconic chicken but its collaboration with beyond meat has helped the brand create a worthy product the taste is so good that they might choose it over regular fried chicken hochman said kfc s beyond fried chicken had a trial run in 2020 in select u s cities including los angeles charlotte north carolina and nashville tennessee a first iteration according to kfc was also sold in atlanta in august 2019 there have been a few tweaks between the different versions hochman said and the most significant change was that customers wanted dipping sauces and to have it served like a nugget rather than a boneless wing restaurants will receive beyond fried chicken already pre breaded and fried and in store employees will re fry it before serving however the new menu item is not for strict vegan or vegetarian eaters because it s prepared in the same areas where chicken offerings are made fast food chains have jumped on the plant based meat trend as a way to bring in new customers attract former customers and build excitement around brands companies are also appealing to so called flexitarian eaters looking to reduce their meat intake for health or environmental reasons the chains have been expanding beyond imitation beef too burger king is now testing out nuggets from impossible dunkin sells a beyond meat breakfast sandwich and starbucks has its own impossible breakfast sandwich this week chipotle said that it s bringing its plant based chorizo nationwide for a limited time but perhaps the most anticipated item is mcdonald s plant based burger called the mcplant which is expected to launch across the u s sometime this year for beyond meat the expanded exposure could help jolt its flailing stock shares have sunk 50 over the past year its most recent earnings report from november 2021 missed analysts expectations and the company said there s slowing demand for its products in both grocery stores and restaurants

with face mask mandates returning in some parts of the country now s the time to stock up on new masks getty images the centers for disease control and prevention s current recommendation is that fully vaccinated americans in parts of the country with substantial or high transmission of covid 19 should wear face masks indoors and right now with the number of covid cases hitting new record highs nationwide amid the omicron variant more than 99 5 of all u s counties fall into the red high transmission tier you can check the community transmission status of your own county at the cdc covid data tracker website in some places such as new york and california wearing masks indoors is again mandatory the cdc says in its most recent update on the omicron variant that vaccination is the best step the public can take to protect against severe illness and slow the emergence of new variants but the agency notes masks offer protection against all variants where can you get these important protective face masks the biden administration recently announced it would make 400 million free n95 face masks available to the american public there are some important catches to this deal

not form a proper leak free fit over your mouth and nose for optimal protection you ll want to look for an n95 mask designed to filter at least 95 of all airborne particles kn95 masks offer a similar

the u s reported a record 1 082 549 new covid 19 cases on monday according to data from johns hopkins university it s the latest in a series of staggering milestones brought on by the highly transmissible omicron variant which is sweeping across the u s and around the world the u s has broken several of its own covid 19 records in recent days last week johns hopkins reported more than 480 000 new cases in a single day more than double the number of daily cases reported during the peak of the delta surge the seven day average topped 280 000 for reference the country was averaging about 70 000 cases a day in early november monday s rise could be due to delays in reporting over the holidays and probably includes tests conducted over the weekend the 7 day daily average for infections is currently at 480 273 per day the milestone is more than twice the case count seen anywhere else in the world since the start of the pandemic according to bloomberg which says the highest number outside of the u s was when more than 414 00 people were diagnosed on a single day in may during india s delta surge as public health experts have noted the numbers we re seeing could also be a undercount with so many people testing themselves at home it s hard to capture the true number of cases as centers for disease control and prevention director dr rochelle walensky told npr last week experts also caution about putting too much stock solely in case counts and focus instead on metrics like hospitalizations and deaths which reflect the severity of illness those numbers are also rising but not at nearly the same rate experts say the number of hospitalizations is more relevant than overall cases still the number of hospitalizations is noteworthy currently 112 941 americans are hospitalized with covid 19 and 26 of icu beds are occupied by covid 19 patients only two other times during the pandemic have hospitalizations surpassed 100 000 in the u s the first time was a year ago when hospitalizations exceeded 120 000 and the second time was this past summer when the delta variant hit and johns hopkins counted 1 688 new deaths on monday down from a record 4 442 last january before covid 19 vaccines were widely available even with fewer people getting really sick hospitals are still strained npr s michaeleen doucleff explained that the perceived lesser severity of omicron compared with delta might actually be because it s infecting a large number of vaccinated people who are less likely to get really sick even two shots protect people from getting sick enough to be hospitalized by 70 she spoke with dr roby bhattacharyya an infectious disease doctor at massachusetts general hospital who cited data suggesting that omicron may be just as severe as previous variants in unvaccinated people while spreading faster which could lead to a sharp increase in hospitalizations dr anthony fauci the nation s top infectious disease expert told abc news this week on sunday that the country is seeing almost a vertical increase in cases and that even a relatively lower rate of hospitalizations could strain already overwhelmed hospitals we have got to be careful about that because even if you have a less of a percentage of severity when you have multi multi multi fold more people getting infected the net amount is you re still going to get a lot of people that are going to be needing hospitalization fauci explained and that s the reason why we re concerned about stressing and straining the hospital system the white house has ordered more doses of paxlovid pfizer s antiviral pill as the number of covid 19 cases surges president biden said tuesday that he is doubling the number of antiviral pills his administration has ordered to fight the disease biden said that the number of treatments of the pill known as paxlovid would increase from 10 million to 20 million in the coming months but the new order will not come in time to treat most of those who are now sick biden said the pills have the potential to be a game changer in the fight against covid 19 after the pill was authorized by the food and drug administration in late december the initial allocation of pills was only enough to treat 65 000 people biden said more pills would ship to states this week but said it takes months to make the pills because of their complex chemistry skyrocketing cases are disrupting all kinds of plans and industries dr natalie dean an assistant professor of biostatistics at emory university made a similar case on npr s all things considered on monday the public health impact is made up a lot of different things and we re most acutely interested in severe disease and death she said but of course infections have impacts and we think about the disruption all the people who are going to need to miss work including health care professionals and frontline workers so the numbers have meaning but it is a different public health impact when someone is mildly ill or doesn t even have symptoms than when someone is severely ill the skyrocketing case count has snarled holiday plans disrupted travel and thrown another wrench into returns to schools and workplaces the cdc has since altered its guidance to recommend covid positive people isolate for five days instead of 10 if they re no longer showing symptoms and is reportedly considering adding a negative test to that recommendation the cdc now estimates that 95 4 of coronavirus cases are caused by the omicron variant based on data for the week ending saturday just seeing the transmissibility of delta was remarkable already but this is just even beyond that dean added so i think that s something that s hard to wrap our heads around just how many people are likely to be infected over the next month is just going to be a lot of disruption unfortunately the update brings cumulative u s infections for the entire pandemic to 56 189 547 the most of any country as of tuesday afternoon a version of this story originally appeared in the morning edition live blog brian naylor contributed to this report copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

menafn asia times will 2022 be the year when the world economy recovers from the pandemic that s the big question on everyone s lips as the festive break comes to an end one complicating factor is that most of the latest major forecasts were published in the weeks before the omicron variant swept the world at that time the mood was that recovery was indeed around the corner with the imf projecting 4 9 growth in 2022 and the oecd projecting 4 5 these numbers are lower than the circa 5 to 6 global growth expected to have been achieved in 2021 but the 2021 figures represent the inevitable rebound from reopening after the pandemic lows of 2020 so what difference will omicron make to the state of the economy we already know that it had an effect in the run up to christmas with for example uk hospitality taking a hit as people stayed away from restaurants for the coming months the combination of raised restrictions cautious consumers and people on sick leave is likely to take its toll yet the fact that the new variant seems milder than originally feared is likely to mean that restrictions can be lifted more quickly and that the economic effect will be more moderate than it might have been israel and australia for example are already loosening restrictions despite high case numbers at the same time however until the west tackles very low vaccination rates in some parts of the world don t be surprised if another new variant brings further damage to both public health and the world economy as things stand the uk think tank the center for economics and business research cebr published a more recent 2022 forecast just before christmas it predicted that global growth would reach 4 this year and that the total world economy would hit a new all time high of us 100 trillion the inflation question one other big unknown is inflation in 2021 we saw a sudden and sharp surge in inflation resulting from the restoration of global economic activity and bottlenecks in the global supply chain there has been much debate about whether this inflation will prove temporary and central banks have been coming under pressure to ensure it doesn t spiral so far the european central bank federal reserve and bank of japan have all abstained from raising interest rates from their very low levels the bank of england on the other hand followed the imf s advice and raised rates from 0 1 to 0 25 in december this is too little to curb inflation or do any good besides increase the cost of borrowing for firms and to raise mortgage payments for households that said the markets are betting that more uk rate rises will follow and that the fed will also start raising rates in the spring yet the more important question regarding inflation is what happens to quantitative easing qe this is the policy of increasing the money supply that has seen the major central banks buying some us 25 trillion in government bonds and other financial assets in recent years including about us 9 trillion on the back of covid both the fed and ecb are still operating qe and adding assets to their balance sheets every month the fed is currently tapering the rate of these purchases with a view to stopping them in march having recently announced that it would bring forward the end date from june the ecb has also said it will scale back qe but is committed to continuing for the time being of course the real question concerns what these central banks do in practice ending qe and raising interest rates will undoubtedly hamper the recovery the cebr forecast for example

dovish again particularly when the continued uncertainty around covid is factored in politics and global trade the trade war between the us and china looks likely to continue in 2022 the phase 1 deal between the two nations in which china had agreed to increase its purchases of certain us goods and services by a combined us 200 billion over 2020 and 2021 has missed its target by about 40 as of the end of november the deal has now expired and the big question for international trade in 2022 is whether there will be a new phase 2 deal it is hard to feel particularly optimistic here donald trump may have left office long since but us strategy on china remains distinctly trumpian with no notable concessions having been offered to the chinese under joe biden elsewhere western tensions with russia over ukraine and further escalation of economic sanctions against putin may have economic consequences for the global economy not least because of europe s dependency on russian gas the more engagement that we see on both fronts in the coming months the better it will be for growth whatever happens politically it is clear that asia will be very important for growth prospects in 2022 major economies such as the uk japan and the eurozone were all still smaller than before the pandemic as recently as the third quarter of 2021 the latest data available the only major developed economy that has already recovered its losses and regained its pre covid size is the united states economic growth by country since 2015 oecd data on the other hand china has managed the pandemic well albeit with strict control measures and its economy has achieved strong growth since the second quarter of 2020 it has been struggling with a heavily over indebted property market but appears to have handled these problems relatively smoothly although the jury is out on the extent to which china s debt problems will be a drag in 2022 morgan stanley and others argue that strong exports accommodative monetary and fiscal policies relief for real estate sector and a slightly more relaxed approach to carbon reduction point to a decent performance as for india whose economy has seen double dips during the pandemic it is showing a strong positive trend with 8 5 expected growth in the year ahead thus i suspect that emerging asia will shoulder global growth in 2022 and the world s economic center of

menafn asia times will 2022 be the year when the world economy recovers from the pandemic that s the big question on everyone s lips as the festive break comes to an end one complicating factor is that most of the latest major forecasts were published in the weeks before the omicron variant swept the world at that time the mood was that recovery was indeed around the corner with the imf projecting 4 9 growth in 2022 and the oecd projecting 4 5 these numbers are lower than the circa 5 to 6 global growth expected to have been achieved in 2021 but the 2021 figures represent the inevitable rebound from reopening after the pandemic lows of 2020 so what difference will omicron make to the state of the economy we already know that it had an effect in the run up to christmas with for example uk hospitality taking a hit as people stayed away from restaurants for the coming months the combination of raised restrictions cautious consumers and people on sick leave is likely to take its toll yet the fact that the new variant seems milder than originally feared is likely to mean that restrictions can be lifted more quickly and that the economic effect will be more moderate than it might have been israel and australia for example are already loosening restrictions despite high case numbers at the same time however until the west tackles very low vaccination rates in some parts of the world don t be surprised if another new variant brings further damage to both public health and the world economy as things stand the uk think tank the center for economics and business research cebr published a more recent 2022 forecast just before christmas it predicted that global growth would reach 4 this year and that the total world economy would hit a new all time high of us 100 trillion the inflation question one other big unknown is inflation in 2021 we saw a sudden and sharp surge in inflation resulting from the restoration of global economic activity and bottlenecks in the global supply chain there has been much debate about whether this inflation will prove temporary and central banks have been coming under pressure to ensure it doesn t spiral so far the european central bank federal reserve and bank of japan have all abstained from raising interest rates from their very low levels the bank of england on the other hand followed the imf s advice and raised rates from 0 1 to 0 25 in december this is too little to curb inflation or do any good besides increase the cost of borrowing for firms and to raise mortgage payments for households that said the markets are betting that more uk rate rises will follow and that the fed will also start raising rates in the spring yet the more important question regarding inflation is what happens to

the u s reported a record 1 082 549 new covid 19 cases on monday according to data from johns hopkins university it s the latest in a series of staggering milestones brought on by the highly transmissible omicron variant which is sweeping across the u s and around the world the u s has broken several of its own covid 19 records in recent days last week johns hopkins reported more than 480 000 new cases in a single day more than double the number of daily cases reported during the peak of the delta surge the seven day average topped 280 000 for reference the country was averaging about 70 000 cases a day in early november monday s rise could be due to delays in reporting over the holidays and probably includes tests conducted over the weekend the 7 day daily average for infections is currently at 480 273 per day the milestone is more than twice the case count seen anywhere else in the world since the start of the pandemic according to bloomberg which says the highest number outside of the u s was when more than 414 00 people were diagnosed on a single day in may during india s delta surge as public health experts have noted the numbers we re seeing could also be a undercount with so many people testing themselves at home it s hard to capture the true number of cases as centers for disease control and prevention director dr rochelle walensky told npr last week experts also caution about putting too much stock solely in case counts and focus instead on metrics like hospitalizations and deaths which reflect the severity of illness those numbers are also rising but not at nearly the same rate experts say the number of hospitalizations is more relevant than overall cases still the number of hospitalizations is noteworthy currently 112 941 americans are hospitalized with covid 19 and 26 of icu beds are occupied by covid 19 patients only two other times during the pandemic have hospitalizations surpassed 100 000 in the u s the first time was a year ago when hospitalizations exceeded 120 000 and the second time was this past summer when the delta variant hit and johns hopkins counted 1 688 new deaths on monday down from a record 4 442 last january before covid 19 vaccines were widely available even with fewer people getting really sick hospitals are still strained npr s michaeleen doucleff explained that the perceived lesser severity of omicron compared with delta might actually be because it s infecting a large number of vaccinated people who are less likely to get really sick even two shots protect people from getting sick enough to be hospitalized by 70 she spoke with dr roby bhattacharyya an infectious disease doctor at massachusetts general hospital who cited data suggesting that omicron may be just as severe as previous variants in unvaccinated people while spreading faster which could lead to a sharp increase in hospitalizations dr anthony fauci the nation s top infectious disease expert told abc news this week on sunday that the country is seeing almost a vertical increase in cases and that even a relatively lower rate of hospitalizations could strain already overwhelmed hospitals we have got to be careful about that because even if you have a less of a percentage of severity when you have multi multi multi fold more people getting infected the net amount is you re still going to get a lot of people that are going to be needing hospitalization fauci explained and that s the reason why we re concerned about stressing and straining the hospital system the white house has ordered more doses of paxlovid pfizer s antiviral pill as the number of covid 19 cases surges president biden said tuesday that he is doubling the number of antiviral pills his administration has ordered to fight the disease biden said that the number of treatments of the pill known as paxlovid would increase from 10 million to 20 million in the coming months but the new order will not come in time to treat most of those who are now sick biden said the pills have the potential to be a game changer in the fight against covid 19 after the pill was authorized by the food and drug administration in late december the initial allocation of pills was only enough to treat 65 000 people biden said more pills would ship to states this week but said it takes months to make the pills because of their complex chemistry skyrocketing cases are disrupting all kinds of plans and industries dr natalie dean an assistant professor of biostatistics at emory university made a similar case on npr s all things considered on monday the public health impact is made up a lot of different things and we re most acutely interested in severe disease and death she said but of course infections have impacts and we think about the disruption all the people who are going to need to miss work including health care professionals and frontline workers so the numbers have meaning but it is a different public health impact when someone is mildly ill or doesn t even have symptoms than when someone is severely ill the skyrocketing case count has snarled holiday plans disrupted travel and thrown another wrench into returns to schools and workplaces the cdc has since altered its guidance to recommend covid positive people isolate for five days instead of 10 if they re no longer showing symptoms and is reportedly considering adding a negative test to that recommendation the cdc now estimates that 95 4 of coronavirus cases are caused by the omicron variant based on data for the week ending saturday just seeing the transmissibility of delta was remarkable already but this is just even beyond that dean added so i think that s something that s hard to wrap our heads around just how many people are likely to be infected over the next month is just going to be a lot of disruption unfortunately the update brings cumulative u s infections for the entire pandemic to 56 189 547 the most of any country as of

the u s reported a record 1 082 549 new covid 19 cases on monday according to data from johns hopkins university it s the latest in a series of staggering milestones brought on by the highly transmissible omicron variant which is sweeping across the u s and around the world the u s has broken several of its own covid 19 records in recent days last week johns hopkins reported more than 480 000 new cases in a single day more than double the number of daily cases reported during the peak of the delta surge the seven day average topped 280 000 for reference the country was averaging about 70 000 cases a day in early november monday s rise could be due to delays in reporting over the holidays and probably includes tests conducted over the weekend the 7 day daily average for infections is currently at 480 273 per day the milestone is more than twice the case count seen anywhere else in the world since the start of the pandemic according to bloomberg which says the highest number outside of the u s was when more than 414 00 people were diagnosed on a single day in may during india s delta surge as public health experts have noted the numbers we re seeing could also be a undercount with so many people testing themselves at home it s hard to capture the true number of cases as centers for disease control and prevention director dr rochelle walensky told npr last week experts also caution about putting too much stock solely in case counts and focus instead on metrics like hospitalizations and deaths which reflect the severity of illness those numbers are also

the international organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and its oil producing allies announced on jan 4 that they would increase oil production by a total of 400 000 barrels a day in february as it appeared that the omicron variant of the ccp chinese communist party virus would have only a mild effect on demand and the global economic recovery the 23 member oil cartel led by saudi arabia and non member russia stood by a previous decision to phase out production cuts after a slump in global demand during the pandemic today s decision would aim to reverse the deep cuts in production made in 2020 when demand for motor and aviation fuel plummeted because of the pandemic lockdowns and travel restrictions oil prices rose with the news after remaining stable ahead of the decision as brent crude rose 79 cents or 1 1 percent at 79 80 a barrel and u s west texas intermediate crude went up 67 cents or 0 9 percent to 76 75 by late morning opec announcement did not surprise most analysts as it had been expected that the organization and its allies would stick to their original plans after initially falling in q4 2021 when reports of the new variant hit in late november oil prices and stocks have since recovered as the markets calmed down analysts believe that omicron is unlikely to reduce demand for fuel as the variant appears to have little effect on commuter activity global manufacturing activity also remained strong during the holiday season with consumer demand recovering from 2020 however a few regional crises may affect opec s plans to increase production by the planned amount increasing tensions between nato and russia over ukraine are affecting oil output as european natural gas prices have soared more than 30 percent after low supplies from russia reignited concerns about an energy crunch this winter higher prices for natural gas tends to boost demand for oil as utilities switch to burning crude meanwhile the ongoing talks over iran s nuclear weapons production this year may have a further effect on market supply if economic sanctions are ever lifted the international energy agency noted that opec had missed its production targets in october and november due to the capacity constraints of some its members oil prices are being affected as some opec countries such as nigeria have not been able to keep up with their share of production limiting supply oil production in libya has been affected by civil unrest and pipeline maintenance problems adding to disruptions two weeks ago after rebels blocked operations at two of the nation s major oilfields libyan output is expected to be about 500 000 to 600 000 bpd lower in the coming weeks which will more than offset the planned monthly increase in opec production according to caroline bain the chief commodities economist at capital economics opec still forecasts a production surplus in the first months of the year compared with demand but smaller than previously envisioned according to the organization s joint technical committee
listen to this article listen to this article the omicron variant is sending oklahomans to the hospital at an unprecedented rate and almost all of the covid 19 patient surge swarming area hospitals is attributed to the unvaccinated health officials said tuesday hospitalizations are up with 965 people currently hospitalized with covid said aaron wendelboe epidemiologist and associate professor at the university of oklahoma college of public health during tuesday s healthier oklahoma coalition briefing this was a huge increase just from yesterday an increase of 130 hospitalizations in just one day wendelboe said the last time we saw an increase that steep was in august he said noting that 90 of those being hospitalized are unvaccinated in just the last few weeks oklahoma has broken its own record for new cases with more than 4 100 new cases being reported in just one day many oklahomans returned from holiday gatherings with a sore throat and are now seeking testing to see if it is covid 19 said patti davis president of oklahoma hospital association given that the omicron variant does produce mild symptoms that could be mistaken for the common cold testing is recommended she said just don t go to already crowded emergency rooms for testing the oklahoma health department announced tuesday that it is extending covid 19 testing hours at local county health departments and will offer weekend availability at select locations in response to the increase in demand for testing like other states oklahoma is seeing a rise in covid 19 cases however many other respiratory illnesses are occurring as well keith reed interim commissioner of health said in the department s statement we highly encourage anyone who is feeling ill to stay home from work school and other activities and schedule a covid 19 test or appointment with their physician reed said staying home while awaiting your appointment results and for your symptoms to clear is important for your health and will help prevent the spread of illness our hospitals are very full right now davis said health care providers are busy working with insurance companies to move patients into other care that will free up more hospital beds for those who need them most and manning those beds with staff continues to pose a challenge as many health care providers are quarantined due to a positive test or are leaving the profession to do something less stressful davis said this is not just a bad flu said dale bratzler chief covid officer with ou the covid 19 pandemic has reduced life expectancy in the united states by two years bratzler said and few states are experiencing the pandemic quite like oklahoma where the death rate is the worst or among the worst in the nation according to various sources johns hopkins shows oklahoma with a per capita death rate of 248 per every 100 000 people compared to the national average of 137 per 100 000 oklahomans tend to have higher instances of heart and lung disease which puts them at higher risk for death when they contract covid 19 due to differing calculations from different sources between 11 500 and 12 500 oklahomans already have been lost to covid 19 wendelboe said the latest antiviral treatments proven to be effective against omicron are in short supply at present said bratzler one of the state s largest pharmacy chains just reported to bratzler that they had a particular treatment available in only three or four sites in the state and no stock at all of another treatment don t think that your provider is withholding therapy they may not have access to it bratzler said
in early 2022 an online advertisement with an interesting picture of an abandoned mansion read 15 mega mansions that are now worthless however the 26 page article on moneywise com that resulted from the 15 mega mansions ad never ended up revealing information about the old building the ad was clickbait in reality the ad showed what s referred to on google maps as a palace named manor ag eliseev the estate was more than a century old and was owned by a merchant in belogorka russia we included the answer in the subheading of this story so that it could be viewed by social media users before clicking we didn t uncover any old newspaper articles about the manor however we did find unconfirmed reporting on gallerix org keeptravel com chistenkoeschool ru and in a post on the russian social media website vk com the names gregory eliseev grigory grigorievich and vera fyodorovna showed up in our research it s unclear if the old manor is indeed worthless as the ad mentioned we also located the same picture from the ad on stock photography websites in sum the abandoned eliseev manor in belogorka was used as clickbait in the 15 mega mansions ad and never appeared in the resulting article we previously reported about another abandoned building that was also mischaracterized in an online ad it involved the old bennett college also known as bennett school for girls located in millbrook new york
menafn asia times will 2022 be the year when the world economy recovers from the pandemic that s the big question on everyone s lips as the festive break comes to an end one complicating factor is that most of the latest major forecasts were published in the weeks before the omicron variant swept the world at that time the mood was that recovery was indeed around the corner with the imf projecting 4 9 growth in 2022 and the oecd projecting 4 5 these numbers are lower than the circa 5 to 6 global growth expected to have been achieved in 2021 but the 2021 figures represent the inevitable rebound from reopening after the pandemic lows of 2020 so what difference will omicron make to the state of the economy we already know that it had an effect in the run up to christmas with for example uk hospitality taking a hit as people stayed away from restaurants for the coming months the combination of raised restrictions cautious consumers and people on sick leave is likely to take its toll yet the fact that the new variant seems milder than originally feared is likely to mean that restrictions can be lifted more quickly and that the economic effect will be more moderate than it might have been israel and australia for example are already loosening restrictions despite high case numbers at the same time however until the west tackles very low vaccination rates in some parts of the world don t be surprised if another new variant brings further damage to both public health and the world economy as things stand the uk think tank the center for economics and business research cebr published a more recent 2022 forecast just before christmas it predicted that global growth would reach 4 this year and that the total world economy would hit a new all time high of us 100 trillion the inflation question one other big unknown is inflation in 2021 we saw a sudden and sharp surge in inflation resulting from the restoration of global economic activity and bottlenecks in the global supply chain there has been much debate about whether this inflation will prove temporary and central banks have been coming under pressure to ensure it doesn t spiral so far the european central bank federal reserve and bank of japan have all abstained from raising interest rates from their very low levels the bank of england on the other hand followed the imf s advice and raised rates from 0 1 to 0 25 in december this is too little to curb inflation or do any good besides increase the cost of borrowing for firms and to raise mortgage payments for households that said the markets are betting that more uk rate rises will follow and that the fed will also start raising rates in the spring yet the more important question regarding inflation is what happens to quantitative easing qe this is the policy of increasing the money supply that has seen the major central banks buying some us 25 trillion in government bonds and other financial assets in recent years including about us 9 trillion on the back of covid both the fed and ecb are still operating qe and adding assets to their balance sheets every month the fed is currently tapering the rate of these purchases with a view to stopping them in march having recently announced that it would bring forward the end date from june the ecb has also said it will scale back qe but is committed to continuing for the time being of course the real question concerns what these central banks do in practice ending qe and raising interest rates will undoubtedly hamper the recovery the cebr forecast for example assumes that it will see bond stock and property markets falling by 10 to 25 in 2022 it will be interesting to see whether the prospect of such upheaval forces the fed and bank of england to get more dovish again particularly when the continued uncertainty around covid is factored in politics and global trade the trade war between the us and china looks likely to continue in 2022 the phase 1 deal between the two nations in which china had agreed to increase its purchases of certain us goods and services by a combined us 200 billion over 2020 and 2021 has missed its target by about 40 as of the end of november the deal has now expired and the big question for international trade in 2022 is whether there will be a new phase 2 deal it is hard to feel particularly optimistic here donald trump may have left office long since but us strategy on china remains distinctly trumpian with no notable concessions having been offered to the chinese under joe biden elsewhere western tensions with russia over ukraine and further escalation of economic sanctions against putin may have economic consequences for the global economy not least because of europe s dependency on russian gas the more engagement that we see on both fronts in the coming months the better it will be for growth whatever happens politically it is clear that asia will be very important for growth prospects in 2022 major economies such as the uk japan and the eurozone were all still smaller than before the pandemic as recently as the third quarter of 2021 the latest data available the only major developed economy that has already recovered its losses and regained its pre covid size is the united states economic growth by country since 2015 oecd data on the other hand china has managed the pandemic well albeit with strict control measures and its economy has achieved strong growth since the second quarter of 2020 it has been struggling with a heavily over indebted property market but appears to have handled these problems relatively smoothly although the jury is out on the extent to which china s debt problems will be a drag in 2022 morgan stanley and others argue that strong exports accommodative monetary and fiscal policies relief for real estate sector and a slightly more relaxed approach to carbon reduction point to a decent performance as for india whose economy has seen double dips during the pandemic it is showing a strong positive trend with 8 5 expected growth in the year ahead thus i suspect that emerging asia will shoulder global growth in 2022 and the world s economic center of gravity will continue to shift eastward at an accelerated pace muhammad ali nasir is associate professor in economics and finance university of huddersfield this article is republished from the

okay yeah mhm so we re launching impossible chicken nuggets uh chicken is one of the most consumed categories of meats in the u s especially among children were launching a product that is delicious more nutritious for you lower saturated fat fewer calories and has far less impact on the environment so you can get breaded chicken now from beyond meat in the food service sector is a tender uh or you you could until it s sold out get at panda express as beyond original orange chicken and then also in a w in canada and so we have all these different outlets that are now selling the products and we re going into retail as well one of the things we re really excited about in this product is that we re using fava bean as the core protein source and what is exciting about that is that we re trying to introduce the consumer a diverse bench of proteins that we can pull from if you if you are one of these companies that are going into this with the hope and the mission of we re going to reduce human consumption of animals were going to reduce animal slaughter then you have to address chickens because you know billions of chickens are eating you know um chicken eating around the world is enormous in terms of the number of brands and a number of companies were still very much in the fighting out phase for a slice of the pie and they slice of the pie is you know the opportunity is huge advertisement kfc s new menu item tastes like chicken but isn t share copy link copy kentucky fried chicken is going to sell a new menu item that contains no chicken but tastes like it does the new plant based fried chicken nugget alternative called beyond fried chicken will be added to menus nationwide beginning monday jan 10 for a limited time it marks the first instance of a large national chain selling plant based chicken products rather than the hamburger or sausage alternatives that have become increasingly common the chain said related video above plant based chicken nuggets come to the u s market it s time said kfc u s president kevin hochman in an interview with cnn business he added that the chain s customers want to eat less animal protein but don t want to give up comfort food kfc which is owned by yum brands said in a press release that beyond fried chicken is packed with delicious flavor and the juicy satisfaction that you d expect from kfc s iconic fried chicken the new product is for customers that want to eat a little less animal based protein but that haven t become vegan or vegetarian hochman said beyond fried chicken can be ordered in a combo meal that includes a medium drink and fries or à la carte in six or 12 piece portions prices vary depending on location but start at 6 99 for six pieces and cost more for the other options kfc and beyond meat announced a partnership about a year ago to develop exclusive items for the fried chicken chain hochman said it has taken kfc a while to create a plant based recipe of its iconic chicken but its collaboration with beyond meat has helped the brand create a worthy product the taste is so good that they might choose it over regular fried chicken hochman said kfc s beyond fried chicken had a trial run in 2020 in select u s cities including los angeles charlotte north carolina and nashville tennessee a first iteration according to kfc was also sold in atlanta in august 2019 there have been a few tweaks between the different versions hochman said and the most significant change was that customers wanted dipping sauces and to have it served like a nugget rather than a boneless wing restaurants will receive beyond fried chicken already pre breaded and fried and in store employees will re fry it before serving however the new menu item is not for strict vegan or vegetarian eaters because it s prepared in the same areas where chicken offerings are made fast food chains have jumped on the plant based meat trend as a way to bring in new customers attract former customers and build excitement around brands companies are also appealing to so called flexitarian eaters looking to reduce their meat intake for health or environmental reasons the chains have been expanding beyond imitation beef too burger king is now testing out nuggets from impossible dunkin sells a beyond meat breakfast sandwich and starbucks has its own impossible breakfast sandwich this week chipotle said that it s bringing its plant based chorizo nationwide for a limited time but perhaps the most anticipated item is mcdonald s plant based burger called the mcplant which is expected to launch across the u s sometime this year for beyond meat the expanded exposure could help jolt its flailing stock shares have sunk 50 over the past year its most recent earnings report from november 2021 missed analysts expectations and the company said there s slowing demand for its products in both grocery stores and restaurants

sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news interested in getting an electric bike ebike curious about ebikes like reading stories about ebikes this article and guide includes the following sections to cover those different interests why you should consider an ebike my history with ebikes ebike tips for everyone i just turned 81 i like to say i do a pretty good impression of a 90 year old when i walk but when i ride my electric bike i feel like i m 20 the number of ebikes is getting up there too there are well over a hundred electric bike manufacturers now and it seems like it will be a thousand soon for that reason i couldn t possibly evaluate them all however to help out those who are curious about ebikes i will concentrate on basic principles that i have learned over seven years of riding two rear hub drive bikes and three mid drive bikes i have also ridden fat tire bikes as rentals which come with some tips of their own first i will explain why you really need to buy an e bike then i will go through my history with ebikes last i will lay out ebike tips for everyone why you should consider an ebike problem some people spend many thousands of dollars for an extremely light carbon fiber road bike with wheels with deep fairings to gain only a percent or two in efficiency after that you still have a bike with very narrow hard tires that rides well only on very smooth pavement and if you happen to veer off the pavement onto gravel dirt or grass you are likely to have an unhappy ending also if you hit a curb or drop off a curb you could also be in big trouble road bikes are also very prone to flats driving off pavement is asking for a thorn and a flat forget riding for even a short run on gravel it is miserable going to an ebike you have wide mountain bike tires you can have full suspension and disc brakes and you can gain not two or three percent but a 500 in assist to your muscles from the motor you can drop off a curb or hit one and hardly notice it you can veer off the pavement onto the shoulder and most likely just ride back up onto the pavement gravel roads are no longer a problem you can ride off road single track trails this was a revelation to me and i now spend at least 20 of my riding off road bottom line you get the versatility of a wide tire mountain bike with much less physical effort than a 15 000 road bike my history with ebikes there are very different types of electric bikes and they can be suited to each type of riding you just have to get the right match for you i started riding ebikes and bought my first electric car at about the same time in 2014 i put solar panels on my house in 2016 i ride my electric bike almost every day and estimate that i have ridden almost 20 000 ebike miles over the last seven years my longtime favorite bulls e stream ev fs am 45 class 3 bike has almost 8 000 miles on it i like my newest fantic bike even better and accumulated over 1000 miles in the five weeks my bulls bike was in for repairs to replace the motor that i wore out how i first learned about ebikes in 2013 i walked into a bike store in american fork utah where the owner had picked up two cannondale ebikes they were european demos from a bike show they weren t for sale and cannondale wasn t even supporting them in the us however i got some test rides and i was hooked i was soon to learn the advantages of electric bikes they virtually eliminate problems with the things you hate most about biking going up steep hills in some areas steep hills make regular bikes impossible for most people biking into a strong headwind and making that trip that is longer than your comfortable range it also makes pulling your kids or grandkids in a bike trailer a breeze rather than a miserable chore figures 6 and 7 some people are human dynamos and can do these things without a problem but they are showstoppers for the rest of us over the years i have taught a number of my children and grandchildren how to ride bikes i had a big success with my 5 year old grandson in 2015 figure 2 when i took him to a big empty parking lot gave him a little push and he rode off like he had been doing it for years four years later i got him onto an ebike in those early days when another biker would finally realize that i was riding an electric bike they would say why are you riding an electric bike don t you ride a bike for exercise i could never convince them but i would say if you want more exercise you just reduce the assist level or ride faster in fact if you reduce the assist to zero you get more exercise than you want because you are pedaling a big heavy bike i generally ride at least 20 miles and 90 minutes every day with about 4 miles of it off road and at age 81 i get a good workout for me however after riding my carbon fiber road bike again recently i was reminded that it is true that with full assist you don t get the same aerobic workout climbing steep hills as you do with a solely human powered bike in 2014 i purchased my first ebike an easymotion emotion a 27 speed class 3 rear hub powered ebike with a max speed of 28 mph it is almost an electric road bike with quite narrow hybrid width tires figure 6 shows me riding the white emotion bike and figures 7 8 show me pulling a trailer with my grandchildren it has no suspension caliper brakes and the battery in the down tube it is my only electric bike with a throttle which my grandchildren love i never ride with a throttle so don t miss throttles on my other ebikes however a throttle is useful when trying to start your bike going up a steep hill with an extra battery that i carried on a carrier attached to my seat post i could now do the alpine loop side story in lindon utah we live at the foot of 11 752 ft mt timpanogos on our back property line in lindon the marvelous 18 mile long murdock bike trail now runs from provo canyon to the point of the mountain in lehi when we moved to lindon in 2005 it was the murdock irrigation canal five years ago the federal government buried the canal in a 10 5 ft pipe and put the gorgeous murdock bike trail over the top if you take the murdock trail 3 miles then up the provo canyon parkway 6 miles continue on highway 189 three miles and turn onto the ultra steep grade 2 2 miles to the sundance ski resort that is a struggle even with an ebike carry on up a little less steep grade 4 miles to the timpanogos trail trailhead then in the early spring you lift your bike over the road closure gate and proceed up the steep grade 4 miles to the summit at 8077 ft since there is no other traffic i once encountered a juvenile moose resting on the road in front of me see figure 9 below on the way down the north side in early spring you have to push your bike across several snow drifts that haven t melted yet see figure 8 then you are headed down american fork canyon at speeds over 40 mph back to the murdock trail completing the loop back to our house in 33 miles i once did the loop on my human powered road bike nearly died on the ultra steep sundance section my second ebike a 2015 stromer st1 was a class 3 bike with a max speed of 28 mph it had a swiss made rear hub drive with front suspension and disc brakes because it is a heavy bike with rear hub drive like my easymotion ebike it has a front derailleur with 3 gears and 9 on the back for a total of 27 combinations see photo of my brother with the black stromer figure 11 this is a deluxe very well built bike made in switzerland however even with 27 gears the steep part of the alpine loop was still a struggle because even at full electric motor assist you need considerable human power on the grade although with a single bigger battery i could make the whole 33 mile loop without running out of power if i rode the level sections at low assist unfortunately after five years the stromer bike stopped working i purchased a new battery for 400 but that wasn t the problem crazy lenny s electric bikes in madison wisconsin wanted another 1500 for a new motor by then i was not a fan of rear hub motors so i abandoned the bike my third ebike was a 2016 class 1 7 speed mid drive i zip vibe with a max speed of 20 mph it had caliper brakes and no suspension see photo of my wife mary with the red i zip figure 12 this was my first mid drive bike and an eye opener to me with a mid drive both the rider and the motor get the mechanical advantage of the rear derailleur note seven gears are plenty on this bike in a rear hub drive ebike only the rider gets the mechanical advantage of a derailleur which limits your climbing ability although this is an inexpensive step through beach bike it climbs like a mountain goat it handles steep grades better than even my most recent 6 000 mountain ebike as a step through it is the one bike my wife mary feels comfortable riding while it does not have full suspension it has quite wide tires and it can be used for level 1 single track off road trails i have a compromised vestibular system from a water ski accident in 2017 it is so bad that walking on uneven ground is a challenge for me also i have just turned 81 the amazing thing is that even with a compromised balance system i do not feel compromised on a bicycle in fact i can even still ride some fairly difficult single track off road trails on my bike for reasons i don t understand balance is not a problem and the electric motor makes up for my severe loss of leg strength that come from years of pinched nerves in my back my fourth ebike was a 2018 class 3 bulls e stream evo fs am 45 mid drive mountain bike purchased november 13 2019 as a demo for 3000 from salt lake ebikes it has full suspension disc brakes aluminum frame 2 2 tires with a brose 350 w mid drive motor with 90 nm of torque and up to 380 of support as well as a big 648 wh battery i didn t realize what a wonderful bike i had just purchased but over 8 000 miles of riding i have come to love it it feels great under you handles the difficult sections of single track off road trails extremely well and has a big battery as a class 3 you get assist up to 28 mph downhill and on the level if you are strong enough the full suspension softens the ride even on the murdock trail on the transitions across city streets as well as off road and gravel both wheels on this bike are 27 5 this bike still has a two gear front derailleur and 9 gears on the back for a total of 18 combinations this bike weighs about 50 lb my fifth and latest ebike a 2021 fantic xmf 1 7 a class 1 bike with a max speed of 20 mph a brose 250 watt s mag 90 nm mid drive motor and a 720 wh battery the mountain bike has full suspension disc brakes and is my first bike with a drop seat i had just driven 100 miles to the bulls dealer at cycle city outdoors in escanaba michigan only to learn it would be several weeks for the brose motor on my favorite bike to be repaired it would need to be sent back to seattle to be rebuilt i ride every day and couldn t live for weeks without a great bike to my amazement cycle city had a wonderful fantic mountain ebike in stock so i broke the bank and paid 6000 for the bike the italian fantic company is famous for competition motorcycles but is new to ebikes it s also a wonderful bike and while it is limited to 20 mph you can ride up to that speed with less effort the drop seat has a lever you push that drops the seat several inches this is mainly used for extreme downhill mountain biking but it is also handy for setting the seat to a lower level for a shorter person the bike has 2 2 tires with a larger front wheel that is 29 in diameter the back wheel is the standard 27 5 inches the larger front wheel makes it a little easier to ride over large rocks roots etc when riding off road on the latest mountain ebikes the front derailleur has been eliminated but the rear derailleur has 12 gears and a large range this bike also weighs 50 lb ebike tips for everyone safety obviously every biker is going to wear a helmet but how do you keep safe riding on a highway in utah all of my riding is done on bike paths so wearing bright yellow and vigilance are sufficient in three lakes wisconsin it is necessary to ride a short distance on a moderately busy highway to get to the delightful blacktop back roads like the military highway and highway x on the highway i use a blinking red tail light in addition to wearing bright yellow having once been hit from behind on a bike i take extra care there is a 2 ft shoulder on the highway which is not wide enough to use as a bike lane i take my legal right to ride on the highway and ride just inside the white line i have a rearview mirror on my bike handlebars so i can watch cars approaching from behind i make sure they are giving me a wide birth if a car was to drive too close i would have time to take evasive action even riding off the road if necessary i am aware that riding on a highway is not entirely safe even taking all precautions but i am willing to take the risk battery care those of us with electric cars know that lithium ion batteries last longest if you restrict the depletion and charging to a range of 20 80 my tesla has software that makes that easy and the battery is big enough to make it practical a replacement battery for a tesla costs on the order of 20 000 so i have no lack of motivation however with my nissan leafs there was no software to make it easy and the range was so short that you needed to charge fully to make most trips what about ebikes they also have lithium ion batteries so the same rules apply however you need the total range of the battery and there is no software to help you a replacement battery is not extremely expensive at 500 800 i always charge to 100 and i don t worry about it the batteries would last longer if you could find a solution for charging only to 80 also lithium ion batteries do not do well if you leave them all winter in bitter cold temperatures i have left my izip ebike in my unheated garage in wisconsin all winter with temperatures often well below zero i do not have access to a heated garage for it the izip battery is still good after four winters however my spare emotion battery is dead and the original battery has lost capacity my stromer battery had also lost capacity for cold winter storage i would advise you to find a heated garage for your ebike or remove the battery and keep it in a warm place other maintenance it s important to use ebike chain wax on the chain every 50 miles or so if not you can expect to replace an expensive chain and cassette after not too many miles with the new very narrow chains and 12 narrow gears on the cassette these can run into hundreds of dollars fortunately with the thick knobby 2 2 tires on a mountain ebike you don t have to pump the tires on each ride and flats are rare this is especially important when riding deep in the woods if you are not a bike mechanic it would also be wise to have someone check over your bike once a year to true the tires etc fat tire ebikes 4 fat tire ebikes are very popular and have a number of advantages you can ride better in deep sand or snow also if you reduce the tire pressure you get a softer ride and may be able to do without a full suspension bike however you give up maneuverability and they are much heavier i can barely lift my 50 lb bikes you must use a tray type bike rack for these big heavy bikes i manage by lifting one wheel at a time onto the rack advice on your purchase you will want to buy a bike that will meet your personal requirements if you always ride on smooth and nearly level trails then a relatively low power rear hub drive bike with no suspension will be satisfactory if you ride in an area with steep hills then a mid drive bike is a big plus having the motor as well as the rider get the mechanical advantage of the rear derailleur gives it much better hill climbing ability full suspension is very desirable for off road riding do a test drive there may be rear hub drives with very powerful motors that will be just fine for hill climbing price my simple izip mid drive beach bike cost me only 1500 on an end of the season special my bulls class 3 with full suspension disc brakes mid drive and a large battery cost me 3000 as a once in a lifetime demo special i didn t have a chance to shop for bikes when i bought my latest fantic ebike it is a class 1 and has full suspension disc brakes a very large battery and a drop seat it cost 6000 i had headlights and taillights installed on both my bulls and fantic bikes what is the lowest price electric bike that you could buy today you can order some bikes from alibaba for as little as 200 but they re an unknown quantity if you want to order an electric bike with a little more confidence rad power bikes offers incredible value you can buy its rad mission 1 bike at an incredible 1199 and its rad runner bike 1 for 1499 the rad mission has a 500w rear hub motor and 504 wh battery at a price that can t be beat the rad runner 1 is a fat tire hardtail 750w rear hub drive bike with a large 672 wh battery if you under inflate the fat tires you can partially make up for the absence of full suspension i have personally ridden the rad runner 1 as a rental in st george utah and found it to be very satisfactory with the big motor it climbs steep hills very well even though it is not a mid drive i hope this article has given you some insight on the various factors that will inform your purchase of an electric

nextier stock jumps as frac demand swells revenue houston bloomberg nextier oilfield solutions inc soared more than 20 after the frac provider disclosed higher than expected quarterly sales signaling an acceleration in u s shale drilling the houston based provider of pumps that blast water sand and chemicals underground to crack open oil soaked rocks said fourth quarter revenue more than doubled to at least 500 million almost 3 above the average of analysts forecasts in a bloomberg survey the shares jumped to 4 64 at 10 14 a m in new york for the biggest intraday gain since november 2020 we expect many others also experienced this trend during q4 analysts at tudor pickering holt co wrote tuesday in a note to investors the improved performance was likely driven less by pricing gains and more by better than expected activity levels through the holiday weeks months into year end while activity in u s oilfields typically slows during the final three months of the year explorers are racing to frack wells in the permian basin and elsewhere before an expected uptick in costs in coming months nextier also said in a late monday statement that worker absenteeism is on the rise as the latest covid 19 variant spreads
the 2022 housing market could see some interesting changes as people establish new work from home schedules during the pandemic remax of southeastern michigan president jeanette schneider says many commercial spaces are going to be hit the hardest long term and it s possible some of these properties could be turned into more residential spaces cities that are little more established and landlocked they don t have green space to put in a lot of new construction schneider said it s going to have to come from the existing stock and that certainly opens the door if you ve got some different space like that that you can covert and repurpose schneider says we have already seen an example with the former dearborn hyatt which was purchased by a company planning to turn the building s hotel rooms into upscale apartments schneider says buyers aren t quite as likely to get caught up in as massive of bidding wars and appraisal waivers as last year
by joseph ax and lisa shumaker reuters the united states reported nearly 1 million new coronavirus infections on monday the highest daily tally of any country in the world and nearly double the previous u s peak set a week ago as the spread of the omicron variant showed no signs of slowing the number of hospitalized covid 19 patients has risen nearly 50 in the past week and now exceeds 100 000 according to data collected by reuters marking the first time that threshold has been reached in a year the latest surge which forced waves of cancellations from commercial airlines flights to broadway shows in recent weeks was disrupting plans for public schools to welcome students back from winter vacation chicago public schools the nation s third largest school district said it would cancel classes on wednesday after the teachers union voted in favor of a return to remote learning in los angeles county the presiding judge of one of the country s largest court systems ordered a two week postponement of criminal trials due to the latest wave of infections nationally the united states has seen a daily average of 486 000 new cases over the past week a rate that has doubled in seven days and far outstrips that of any other country the 978 856 new infections documented on monday included some cases tallied on saturday and sunday when many states do not report the average number of u s covid 19 deaths has remained fairly steady throughout december and into early january at about 1 300 a day according to a reuters tally though deaths typically lag behind case numbers and hospitalizations omicron appears to be far more easily transmitted than previous iterations of the virus the new variant was estimated to account for 95 4 of cases identified in the united states as of jan 1 the u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc said on tuesday the world health organization said evidence suggested omicron is causing less severe illness nevertheless public health officials have warned that the sheer volume of omicron cases threatens to overwhelm hospitals some of which are already struggling to handle covid 19 patients primarily among the unvaccinated maryland governor larry hogan declared a 30 day state of emergency on tuesday and mobilized 1 000 national guard members to pandemic response operations as covid 19 hospitalizations in the state hit a record high of more than 3 000 up more than five fold in seven weeks hogan said the truth is that the next four to six weeks will be the most challenging time of the entire pandemic hogan told reporters he said projections show covid hospitalizations could surpass 5 000 far higher than maryland s previous peak of 1 952 last year delaware illinois ohio virginia and washington d c have also reported record numbers of hospitalized covid patients in recent days unlike anything we ve seen in kentucky where tuesday s total of 6 915 new cases was the highest daily figure since the start of the pandemic governor andy beshear urged residents to get vaccinated and wear masks omicron is causing a surge unlike anything we ve seen and at this rate our hospitals will fill up he wrote on twitter nyse the unrelenting surge has prompted more than 3 200 schools to close this week according to the website burbio which tracks school disruptions schools that have remained open are facing staff shortages and renewed concerns about virus spread in boston where more than 54 000 students returned to class on tuesday following the holiday superintendent of schools brenda cassellius told reporters there were 1 000 staff members out including 461 teachers and 52 bus drivers it does make for a difficult start to the day she said rank and file members of the chicago teachers union voted 73 in favor of working remotely after the union s house of delegates voted 88 in favor of the resolution earlier the union urged its members to stay out of the classroom and work remotely through jan 18 or until the city reaches minimum health safety thresholds set last year as a condition for in person learning whichever comes first the union has called for more rigorous covid 19 safety protocols including school based coronavirus testing and mandatory student vaccinations district chief executive officer pedro martinez said the school system would agree to further covid 19 safety measures but he said classes for chicago s 340 000 students would be canceled on wednesday if teachers voted against reporting to work with no remote instruction being made immediately available the union has cited data showing that vaccination rates remained especially low among minority students with just 7 of black youngsters and 13 of latino children aged 5 11 fully inoculated but school officials said hospitalization rates of children are low and that distance learning has hit minority and poor students particularly hard as many depend on school based meals and have working parents with fewer childcare options dr allison arwady chicago s public health commissioner joined district officials and mayor lori lightfoot in pressing to keep classrooms open arwady cited data showing chicago averaging just seven pediatric covid 19 hospitalizations a day out of 550 000 children who live in the city more than 325 000 covid 19 cases among children were reported in the united states for the

more than a year after voters approved legalizing marijuana for recreational use in montana anyone older than 21 can now walk into a dispensary and buy cannabis that has medical marijuana user joylynn mane wright worried wright lives in prairie county the state s fifth least populated county with nearly 1 100 people she already drives about 35 minutes to get to the marijuana dispensary nearest her home which is 2½ hours northeast of billings and now she wonders how much more difficult it will be to get the cannabis she uses to relieve the chronic pain she developed after a 2017 spinal surgery i m really worried about supplies and what it s going to cost she said for wright and the approximately 55 000 other montanans who hold medical marijuana cards and use cannabis for cancer glaucoma crohn s disease central nervous system disorders and other ailments the question is how will recreational marijuana affect their ability to access their medicine other states have had shortages soon after their recreational marijuana markets opened in january 2020 when recreational marijuana became legal in illinois some dispensaries had to close their doors or impose limits on purchases the same thing happened in colorado and washington when the recreational market opened in those states pepper petersen president and ceo of the montana cannabis guild and a medical marijuana provider in helena said he s been telling his patients to stock up because he thinks the state s dispensaries will run out of pot in the short term we are going to have cannabis shortages access will be a problem until supply can catch up with demand petersen said how can we produce enough product for thousands of new users in january the answer is we can t in wright s case stocking up isn t an option because of her fixed income she said she wonders how high the price of a pre rolled joint which now costs nearly 8 will rise and whether she ll have to drive even farther to get her medicine jared moffat a campaign manager for the marijuana policy project said a state s market usually takes six to 12 months to stabilize after recreational cannabis becomes legal one reason marijuana markets are unstable is that possessing and distributing the drug remain illegal under federal law so moving products across state lines is not an option for dealing with a shortage everything that is sold in a state must be grown in that state adding to the potential supply chain problem is that montana has restricted who can sell cannabis at least initially the legislation that set up the framework for montana s recreational marijuana market gave existing dispensaries an 18 month head start on new producers meaning newly licensed sellers can t get into the market until july 2023 that leaves medical marijuana customers to compete with recreational users for a limited supply of cannabis about 80 dispensaries just 18 of montana s 451 licensed dispensaries plan to exclusively serve holders of medical marijuana cards according to czelsi gómez spokesperson for the montana department of revenue which oversees the state s marijuana programs the rest plan to cater to both recreational and medical users or to only recreational users some states that have legalized recreational cannabis including new jersey and illinois have required dispensaries to maintain enough stock to ensure that medical users can get what they need montana has not instituted such a rule but gomez said the 80 dispensaries that will serve only medical marijuana users will protect patients we believe the medical only establishments are the safeguard for ensuring medical marijuana is available to registered cardholders gomez said some dispensary owners said they will reserve some of their supplies to ensure medical customers don t run out but others said they don t plan on holding back arguing that would be bad for business barbie turner a co owner of alternative releaf a dispensary with locations in missoula polson and libby said she is worried about where medical users will get their cannabis she said that if serving medical customers requires her to stop selling cannabis to recreational users she will not only do our medical patients have a need they re the ones who built up these businesses they re the ones who built this industry she said so i think we have an ethical responsibility to take care of them just like they have taken care of us how big the recreational marijuana market will be is unclear a university of montana study cited survey results from 2017 and 2018 that found about 14 of montana adults said they used cannabis in the previous month compared with 9 of adults nationally petersen and others said more people might become recreational users once cannabis products that can be smoked or eaten become easier to buy turner said that she and her employees have been working for months to make sure they have enough marijuana but that she s still worried about the supply there are limits both legally and financially on how much a provider can grow she said shops will get some help she said when the state s wholesale market opens in january meaning that dispensaries will be able to sell to one another in bulk although many dispensaries especially in college towns such as missoula and bozeman are bracing for shortages this month erin bolster said she thinks the real test of marijuana supplies will come in the summer when millions of tourists visit yellowstone and glacier national parks bolster owns tamarack cannabis in the flathead valley a popular tourist destination not far from glacier national park last summer long before dispensaries could sell recreational cannabis bolster said she would get one or two walk ins and two or three calls a day from tourists who had heard montana had legalized adult use marijuana and wanted to see if they could buy come summer she thinks the number of customers will skyrocket that could mean even more competition for montana s medical marijuana there and in other popular destinations we ve been able to expand production bolster said but the question is did we expand enough khn kaiser health news is a national newsroom

the u s reported a record 1 082 549 new covid 19 cases on monday according to data from johns hopkins university it s the latest in a series of staggering milestones brought on by the highly transmissible omicron variant which is sweeping across the u s and around the world the u s has broken several of its own covid 19 records in recent days last week johns hopkins reported more than 480 000 new cases in a single day more than double the number of daily cases reported during the peak of the delta surge the seven day average topped 280 000 for reference the country was averaging about 70 000 cases a day in early november monday s rise could be due to delays in reporting over the holidays and probably includes tests conducted over the weekend the 7 day daily average for infections is currently at 480 273 per day the milestone is more than twice the case count seen anywhere else in the world since the start of the pandemic according to bloomberg which says the highest number outside of the u s was when more than 414 00 people were diagnosed on a single day in may during india s delta surge as public health experts have noted the numbers we re seeing could also be a undercount with so many people testing themselves at home it s hard to capture the true number of cases as centers for disease control and prevention director dr rochelle walensky told npr last week experts also caution about putting too much stock solely in case counts and focus instead on metrics like hospitalizations and deaths which reflect the severity of illness those numbers are also rising but not at nearly the same rate experts say the number of hospitalizations is more relevant than overall cases still the number of hospitalizations is noteworthy currently 112 941 americans are hospitalized with covid 19 and 26 of icu beds are occupied by covid 19 patients only two other times during the pandemic have hospitalizations surpassed 100 000 in the u s the first time was a year ago when hospitalizations exceeded 120 000 and the second time was this past summer when the delta variant hit and johns hopkins counted 1 688 new deaths on monday down from a record 4 442 last january before covid 19 vaccines were widely available even with fewer people getting really sick hospitals are still strained npr s michaeleen doucleff explained that the perceived lesser severity of omicron compared with delta might actually be because it s infecting a large number of vaccinated people who are less likely to get really sick even two shots protect people from getting sick enough to be hospitalized by 70 she spoke with dr roby bhattacharyya an infectious disease doctor at massachusetts general hospital who cited data suggesting that omicron may be just as severe as previous variants in unvaccinated people while spreading faster which could lead to a sharp increase in hospitalizations dr anthony fauci the nation s top infectious disease expert told abc news this week on sunday that the country is seeing almost a vertical increase in cases and that even a relatively lower rate of hospitalizations could strain already overwhelmed hospitals we have got to be careful about that because even if you have a less of a percentage of severity when you have multi multi multi fold more people getting infected the net amount is you re still going to get a lot of people that are going to be needing hospitalization fauci explained and that s the reason why we re concerned about stressing and straining the hospital system the white house has ordered more doses of paxlovid pfizer s antiviral pill as the number of covid 19 cases surges president biden said tuesday that he is doubling the number of antiviral pills his administration has ordered to fight the disease biden said that the number of treatments of the pill known as paxlovid would increase from 10 million to 20 million in the coming months but the new order will not come in time to treat most of those who are now sick biden said the pills have the potential to be a game changer in the fight against covid 19 after the pill was authorized by the food and drug administration in late december the initial allocation of pills was only enough to treat 65 000 people biden said more pills would ship to states this week but said it takes months to make the pills because of their complex chemistry skyrocketing cases are disrupting all kinds of plans and industries dr natalie dean an assistant professor of biostatistics at emory university made a similar case on npr s all things considered on monday the public health impact is made up a lot of different things and we re most acutely interested in severe disease and death she said but of course infections have impacts and we think about the disruption all the people who are going to need to miss work including health care professionals and frontline workers so the numbers have meaning but it is a different public health impact when someone is mildly ill or doesn t even have symptoms than when someone is severely ill the skyrocketing case count has snarled holiday plans disrupted travel and thrown another wrench into returns to schools and workplaces the cdc has since altered its guidance to recommend covid positive people isolate for five days instead of 10 if they re no longer showing symptoms and is reportedly considering adding a negative test to that recommendation the cdc now estimates that 95 4 of coronavirus cases are caused by the omicron variant based on data for the week ending saturday just seeing the transmissibility of delta was remarkable already but this is just even beyond that dean added so i think that s something that s hard to wrap our heads around just how many people are likely to be

the bonds of inequality debt and the making of the american city by destin jenkins credit and debt two sides of the same proverbial coin place a bet on time credit makes money mobile and funds the future soon enough however it becomes debt with the lender demanding from the borrower returns with interest that threaten to constrict the possibility of further credit personal debt masquerades as moral obligation a contract freely chosen yet at the heart of the promise debt creates is not social reciprocity as the late david graeber wrote in debt the first 5000 years but a simple cold and impersonal market transaction as nothing more than a matter of impersonal arithmetic debt requires shame and ultimately the threat of force to fulfill its terms and realize the returns for creditors it promises it lodges coercion at the heart of the supposedly free market the squeeze is only intensified in the seemingly impersonal world of institutional finance if debt ensures stability and solvency for some the economic growth it propels fuels dependency and inequality for others not only between creditor and debtor but also further down the line as the borrower passes on the costs of debt to those with less power to control the terms of the deal this devil s bargain is particularly true when it comes to municipal debt argues the stanford university historian destin jenkins in the bonds of inequality his new book on the power the bond market has leveraged over san francisco and other us cities the debt financed spending that cities have long used to spur growth jenkins contends has also underwritten the racial and income inequality of the post world war ii metropolis while funneling profits to bankers and reinforcing city dependency on finance capitalism this unequal compact hid in plain sight until the 1970s when the urban fiscal crises of the era revealed that cities were deeply in hock to financial institutions but debt was just the way business was done and banks and other lenders saw no reason to ease the terms of this deal preferring instead to underwrite the continued hollowing out of the american metropolitan landscape the bonds of inequality jumps off from 40 years or so of work by urban historians exposing the platitudes conservatives and liberals used to explain the urban crisis that began in the 1960s not long ago the conventional wisdom about urban life in the years after world war ii unfurled in a series of overdetermined catchphrases cities peaceful and prosperous through the 1950s and early 60s went downhill after the riotous long hot summers and white flight of the late 60s the cause of this urban collapse conservative and liberal piety of the 80s and 90s assured us was not a lack of money in cities but too much overeager liberals looking to usher in lyndon johnson s great society with war on poverty programs welfare payments and other instruments of social engineering supposedly created a permanent underclass living in a culture of poverty the only way to end these so called cycles of dependency was as bill clinton did in the 90s to end welfare as we know it and get tough on crime urban historians have long shown these easy judgments to be disconnected from life on the ground taking their cues from neighborhood and labor organizers civil rights lawyers and fair housing campaigners as well as many in the black and latinx community who have resisted the ill effects of this consensus all along these historians have unearthed the fact that white americans working and middle class alike were the primary recipients of postwar government dollars they followed federal subsidies to the suburbs while government policy neglected black and latinx neighborhoods far more important than government welfare was government support for urban deindustrialization urban renewal and slum clearance highway building and segregated and underfunded public housing less the beneficiaries of federal largesse black and latinx urban dwellers were simply left behind by a postwar welfare state that systematically overdeveloped suburbs and underdeveloped cities leaving behind the racialized and bifurcated metropolitan landscape of george floyd s america the real story of postwar metropolitan inequality has gradually made its way into the public eye displacing the older conservative and liberal accounts of urban decline along the way however a new kind of simplification has begun to take hold even as we learned to understand the continuing power of race in shaping america s unequal democracy the culprit in the popular story of metropolitan inequality has too often been winnowed down to one malign malefactor the federal government the forgotten history of postwar cities as the subtitle of richard rothstein s the color of law tells us can be summed up as the story of how our government segregated america what was once a simple tale of federal government overreach threatens to become a simple one of federal government corruption jenkins s new book lays the groundwork for a third story by following the money he turns our attention away from federal malfeasance alone and toward the capital markets and financial instruments that floated 20th century city building in the first place the true source of urban and racial inequality he argues can be found in the cities structural dependence on the municipal bond market once they became markets for investment and commercial banking jenkins argues cities were little more than supplicants to capital relying on a system of debt fueled finance that would in time come to require urban officials to put the needs of bankers above the well being of their most vulnerable constituents government jenkins contends in his innovative book only made urban inequality with the help of capital markets
the 2022 housing market could see some interesting changes as people establish new work from home schedules during the pandemic remax of southeastern michigan president jeanette schneider says many commercial spaces are going to be hit the hardest long term and it s possible some of these properties could be turned into more residential spaces cities that are little more established and landlocked they don t have green space to put in a lot of new construction schneider said it s going to have to come from the existing stock and that certainly opens the door if you ve got some different space like that that you can covert and repurpose schneider says we have already seen an example with the former dearborn hyatt which was purchased by a company planning to turn the building s hotel rooms into upscale apartments schneider says buyers aren t quite as likely to get caught up in as massive of bidding wars and appraisal waivers as last year

last year around this time i published five words to predict 2021 s economy growth k shape relief equity and vaccination looking back i d grade myself with a b on the combined prediction certainly there was plenty of growth last year fueled significantly by the federal government s unprecedented economic relief 5 7 trillion of covid related legislation joe morrison my predictions around equity and increased efforts to combat different outcomes in the u s based around race is less clear i m aware of some specific legislation that passed also there s some data that the second round of covid relief funds reached society more broadly i d argue though that in general the discussion that our nation collectively had around equity of opportunity and vastly different social outcomes based on race in 2020 declined in 2021 advertisement advertisement as for the continuation of the u s k shaped economy economic winners at the top the struggling at the bottom and a shrinking middle class in between this might be the prediction that was the most off yes we still have an economy with large wealth and income disparities but if anything a shift might have started in 2021 we know there s rapacious demand for worker hiring across nearly all industries now more than ever in recent times workers have power and the middle class options that leaves us with one word vaccination let s do some 2022 predictions and come back to that at the end sadly brake the u s economy the largest in the world is now a speeding train consumers have cash in hand and the values of homes and stocks are soaring since the pandemic s initial recession in march 2020 the federal reserve is conscious of the need to begin the counterbalance with plans to cut their emergency asset buying program in half immediately and end it in 2022 resulting in fewer newly introduced dollars perhaps more relevant to us all two thirds of the fed s open market committee forecast three interest rate hikes next year and an additional three in 2023 expect higher rates i do predict the fed will apply these economic brakes sensitively and lightly given the ongoing covid 19 pandemic and the general unpopularity of efforts that slow down the economy inflation of course the reason we need to apply the brakes is because the scourge of central bankers is back in november the consumer price index was up 6 8 percent the largest year on year increase since 1982 energy and food prices are up significantly while prices for some goods like new and used cars have rocketed but consumers have money want things and are willing to pay companies raise their prices for a variety of reasons including this once prices go up they can be hard to bring back down advertisement advertisement with average worker pay up nearly 5 percent in 2021 you can see the start to a pattern that s a big increase but still potentially behind inflation workers are in high demand we re paying them more because there are fewer of them prices continue to increase meanwhile we still need workers to keep the ones we have find new ones and pay for those increased costs we pay them more and you get the idea gaps which brings us to this prediction if we are using the analogy that the economy is a speeding train there are now gaps in the tracks that haven t been there before in our recent economic history examples include a too small workforce a snarled up global supply chain and not enough housing for the population when the pandemic hit 2 4 million women left the workforce consider that also 3 million baby boomers have retired when it comes to housing a second quarter analysis said the nation was short 6 8 million units and it s difficult to produce housing quickly to meet demand as for supply chains while there s been some headway made against the backlog increased costs to bring products to market exist and snarls remain my prediction is that none of these gaps will be ironed out in 2022 most will take multiple years to address and will continue to define much of the american economy digitization covid doesn t appear to be going away anytime soon and as such we will continue to live in an increasingly digital society the tools that have enabled global commerce to continue during a pandemic and for many of us to keep doing our jobs remotely will grow especially with in person interactions still limited look for at best a continued slow return to the office with continued productivity from workers in virtual environments and thanks to other technologies look for more of our entertainment to come from the likes of amazon netflix apple and disney plus delivered at home look locally even when you walk into your neighborhood restaurant more places will allow you to use your smartphone to launch a qr code see the menu and order online with food brought to you near interaction free as for all the other things we want to do whether that s attend an event or travel via plane look for digital applications like clear and others to help us manage or verify our health status advertisement advertisement endemic the last and biggest word all of the above economic outcomes are being shaped by the globe s ongoing collective health crisis a word in my 2021 predictions was vaccine and that it would be the answer to lead us out of this crisis and get the u s economy back on track maybe it could have if vaccines were more widely adopted we lost out on a summer of freedom in 2021 where the country s enviable position to obtain rapid vaccine access might have led us to a quick immunity like other countries we were hammered by the delta strain of the virus now we re on to our second notable mutated strain one year omicron the good news is that everything ends every pandemic in global history has ended and this one will too the bad news is that doesn t mean it s happening anytime soon four in ten americans remain not fully vaccinated two thirds of americans haven t received a booster shot the most effective way to protect against omicron my prediction is that in 2022 the covid crisis will continue this kind of life may be our new normal for quite some time until this fire burns out that s it notice i haven t mentioned the word correction as part of these predictions while it s on my mind i left it off largely because if the u s economic response to covid has been historic our economic trajectory will rise for the near term but yes corrections are an indisputable part of the economic cycle and i m not convinced i can mentally match up the ongoing health crisis with our current financial lives and the u s economy saying that it all fits and makes sense but we will look at the potential for correction and the outcomes of these five words as my predictions next year

we should add to cook s managerial success something that has nothing to do with apple as such abundant central bank money printing has put a rocket under virtually all asset prices but particularly the big american tech stocks which have benefited hugely from the compounding effects of indexation with apple now worth around 7 per cent of the entire s p 500 the big has begotten the even bigger with tracker funds driven to buy apple shares in ever greater amounts simply to keep up with their growing weight in the index there is admittedly some reason in the underlying madness some of the biggest commercial winners from the pandemic have been the us tech giants and especially apple whose products are tailor made for home working and social distancing the success of tech giants stands in contrast to the dysfunctional state of american society yet these are not the only malign forces at work here the other is monopoly where the tech giants have again led the way creating a second gilded age of staggering wealth built on ever more concerning concentrations of market power betraying a once proud history of trust busting the growth in monopoly been almost deliberately sanctioned by us policymakers predatory takeovers and abusive market practice have been widely tolerated in a way that would have been unthinkable 50 years ago and has led to a steep decline in the number of viable competitors not just in tech but across sectors looking at the origins of this most un american of trends it can be traced back to the late 1970s and publication of a hugely influential book by a former solicitor general robert bork called the antitrust paradox this argued that competition law should not be concerned with protecting individual competitors but instead with promoting pro consumer business efficiency it has been the refrain of the new monopolists ever since that economies of scale and market power allow them to offer cheaper prices to consumers providing cover for a great raft of predatory practice ironically european union regulators have been much more aggressive in keeping the tradition of us style trust busting alive than american counterparts among whom there is an understandable tendency to regard the tech giants as american success stories under attack from a jealous and protectionist europe yet possibly as a result of this old style approach to competition policy the cost of mobile and internet access is generally lower in europe than the us only quite recently has the tone of political debate in the us begun to shift back towards a more traditional antitrust mentality for the time being however the politicians remain a threatening but otherwise not particularly troubling cloud on apple s horizon stock markets don t yet take the possibility of enforced breakup of the tech titans that seriously perhaps they should for on multiple fronts so called fangs and their ilk find themselves in growing conflict with large segments of us popular and political thinking some of them are already very much part of the culture wars that destructively afflict american society already this week the house minority leader kevin mccarthy has torn into twitter for permanently suspending the personal account of his fellow republican marjorie taylor greene over postings she made about covid 19 vaccines other social media companies have likewise found themselves accused of trampling over free speech by removing content from known right wingers deemed inappropriate or misleading in any case the commercial and global success of the tech giants stands in marked contrast to the increasingly dysfunctional state of american society politics and the constitution and might despite their economic success even be deemed a part of that sickness

the opening day of the trading year found only a portion of the global markets online and what areas were trading were doing so on thinned volume a record high for a few of the us indices suffers the same question of confidence we ended last year on in trend development while the dollar s own rally seems more seasonally motivated as markets fill out in the days ahead the docket will shift our focus back onto the traditional fundamentals with the ism manufacturing survey from the us a first stop menafn dailyfx dow s p 500 dollar and eurgbp talking points an uneven risk appetite to start 2022 the confetti seemed to still be falling monday as us indices extended the incredible 2021 climb for the asset class with a fresh record highs for both the dow jones industrial average and the s p 500 hitting that threshold looks remarkable in black and white print on the financial journals but traders keeping tabs of the market backdrop and taking a casual look at the charts would remain less than convinced that we have slingshot higher to start the year first the charts while on a close over close basis both the dow and spx may have earned the distinction of a new peak there is technical overhead like december 30th s swing high for the former more troubling is the uneven reflection of risk appetite across different regions and asset types rest of world equities i prefer the veu etf is still trading 5 5 percent off its own high emerging markets eg eem junk bonds eg hyg and commodities like crude remain far from their own peaks meanwhile carry trade actually faltered through monday s session though pairs like eurjpy gbpjpy and audjpy are rallying into tuesday s asia session chart of dow jones industrial average with 20 and 200 day smas daily chart created on tradingview platform ultimately my principal concern around the intent of the market s uneven appetites is the backdrop for liquidity this past session saw much of asia offline and a number of european and american countries also observing the weekend new years day holiday on monday where markets were open there was still an unmistakable curb on volume and open interest turnover for the s p 500 spy etf crude oil and treasury futures was still running at levels commensurate with the past two weeks holiday activity a slow pick up to the year is part of the seasonal assumptions volume and volatility derived from the s p 500 show that the opening week of the calendar year takes time to thaw which ultimately contributes to the averaged performance of the underlying index through the same period historically the opening week is the strongest for the us index and there are so far no active systemic threats for which the market is actively fleeing which would suggest 2022 will be pushed as an outlier year average weekly s p 500 performance by calendar week chart created by john kicklighter with data from s p 500 the speculative outliers apple and tesla as remarkable as the dow s record high may be its tempo was still extremely underwhelming when liquidity is an encumbrance it can be a universal one many of the 2021 favorites for retail speculative appetites are struggling entering the new year meme stocks like the gamestop and etfs like buzz were treading water the top cryptocurrencies are struggling for altitude spacs have cased and even the tech appetite is tepid with the nasdaq to dow ratio struggling two stand outs to start the year though had very prominent means for concentrating traders attention apple shares rallied 2 5 percent on marginally higher volume to hit a record encouraged by the reports that the company was the first public listing to hit the previously unthinkable 3 trillion market cap intraday meanwhile newer tech favorite tesla posted its biggest single day rally 13 5 percent in six weeks after reporting far greater deliveries in q4 than were anticipated these are impressive milestones but not likely to lead to certain follow through on these individual tickers much less for the market at large chart of apple overlaid with the company s market cap and volume daily chart created on tradingview platform the dollar s rally is more digestible but just as suspect us indices weren t the only markets making headlines in otherwise quiet conditions the greenback earned a leer of its own from fx traders the dxy trade weighted dollar index rallied 0 6 percent for the second biggest single day rally in two months we have seen similar moves from this index not translate broadly to performance across the majors but this isn t one of those instances the dollar gained ground against the british pound japanese yen and australian dollar among other pairings of course the eurusd s own reversal from 1 1385 was the most technically impressive but most of the pairs ultimately registered the same thing a push back into range the two months congestion is unmistakable through the dxy and eurusd but it is also there in form with most of the other pairings that

it wasn t much of a rally but we did get a santa rally the second trading day of the new year marks the end of the santa rally and more importantly the latest updates over how quickly global supply constraints are easing but sadly that might not last due to omicron us stocks could not hold onto earlier gains as tech stocks got pummeled over fears that treasury yields will go much higher wall street knows the first quarter of the year will be all about ramping up fed rate hike expectations as investors assess the impact of elevated energy prices surging treasury yields and the neverending focus of new covid variants ihu the new b 1 640 2 variant risk appetite fizzled out after both a softer than expected ism manufacturing report and jolts job openings suggested wages will have to rise not helping sentiment was the latest update from washington dc punchbowl news reported that senator manchin has not yet had any conversations about build back better since his statement a few weeks ago rotation tuesday trade was all about jumping back into energy stocks as oil prices are poised to remain elevated financials got a boost from surging yields and expectations for build back better to get done supported industrials and material stocks us data the ism manufacturing report delivered a headline miss but most traders focused on the drop in prices paid as pipeline pressures improved the headline ism manufacturing index dropped 2 4 points to 58 7 a miss of the consensus estimate of 60 0 and also the lowest reading in a year prices paid plunged from 82 4 to 68 2 a big miss of the analysts estimate of 79 3 this massive drop in prices paid could be a sign that peak is in for inflation omicron will undoubtedly contribute one last hurdle to a complete return to normal factory activity but the optimism is growing that pricing pressures could be steadily improving the jolts the jolts report showed a record number of quits while the total number of job openings dropped the great resignation is complicating the fed s goal to recover all the jobs lost due to covid the november job openings fell to 10 56 million a miss of the 11 08 million consensus estimate the quits rate rose 3 0 to a series high at 4 5 million the key takeaway from the jolts report is that the great resignation means wages are going higher fed one of the more dovish fed members neil kashkari said he supports two rate increases this year which might mean pricing in three rate hikes this year might not be enough kashkari conceded that inflation has been higher and more persistent tomorrow the fed will release their minutes to the december 15th policy decision on thursday we hear from the hawkish fed s bullard and on friday fed s daly talks about monetary policy and fed s bostic speaks on diversity content is for general information purposes only it is not investment advice or a solution to buy or sell securities opinions are the authors not necessarily that of oanda business information services inc or any of its affiliates subsidiaries officers or directors if you would like to reproduce or redistribute any of the content found on marketpulse an award winning forex commodities and global indices analysis and news site service produced by oanda business information services inc please access the rss feed or contact us at info marketpulse com visit to find out more about the beat of the global markets 2023 oanda business information services inc

boston jan 04 2022 globe newswire aveo oncology also known as aveo pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq aveo a commercial stage oncology focused biopharmaceutical company today highlighted its recent progress and outlook for 2022 i am proud of the entire aveo team this year as we accomplished several key milestones in the face of what remains a challenging environment with the ongoing covid 19 pandemic said michael bailey president and chief executive officer of aveo our commercial team has executed our go to market strategy for fotivda tivozanib with tenacity since we launched at the end of march 2021 we are focused on our goal of continuing to deliver quarter over quarter growth and we expect that the sales ramp should continue to increase even as we persevere through the covid 19 environment our team continues to enhance their outreach methods to educate oncologists about the tivo 3 data that demonstrate fotivda s robust efficacy and favorable tolerability profile in patients with relapsed or refractory r r renal cell carcinoma rcc mr bailey added in addition to our progress with fotivda s launch we continue to be pleased by the progress the team is making in advancing the development of our clinical pipeline with a number of key milestones announced throughout 2021 that we believe represent significant opportunities to build long term shareholder value in 2022 and beyond for tivozanib these milestones include initiation and continued enrollment of the phase 3 tinivo 2 clinical trial in advanced refractory rcc and the presentation of data for the first line cohort of the phase 1b 2 deductive clinical trial in unresectable locally advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma hcc at american society of clinical oncology asco gi for ficlatuzumab we have initiated the scale up for the manufacturing run expected in the second quarter of 2022 we recently announced a supply agreement with merck kgaa and we gained fast track designation from the u s fda for the investigation of ficlatuzumab and erbitux cetuximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma r r hnscc these milestones position us well for a potential registrational trial that is expected to start in 2023 in addition we completed the phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers for av 380 and expect to present results in mid year 2022 and plan to initiate the phase 1b clinical trial for this program in cancer patients at that time in summary we believe this progress is further proof of our team s ability to execute and develop therapies that address high patient need key recent program updates and anticipated 2022 milestones fotivda tivozanib update successfully launched u s commercialization team for fotivda the team executed the u s commercial build out by hiring and training field teams and building infrastructure including distribution patient access and securing broad reimbursement market penetration for fotivda has continued to increase since its commercial launch at the end of march 2021 feedback from the field team suggests fotivda has been well received by oncologists treating r r rcc noting both the durable responses and tolerability profile they have observed as attractive for their third line patients as with other launches during the covid 19 pandemic the sales team s access to oncologists and their staff has been limited which the company believes has potentially slowed the launch trajectory this headwind continued in the fourth quarter of 2021 with the emergence of the delta and omicron covid 19 variants despite these access challenges aveo expects to have continued quarter over quarter net revenue and underlying prescription demand growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 in addition as is typical with launches in the relapsed refractory oncology setting physicians will tend to prescribe newly approved therapies for later line patients and following positive experience with a new therapy will prescribe to earlier line patients to date the majority of the patients prescribed fotivda have been 4th line or later we expect later line patients to generally exhibit higher early discontinuation rates with slower account access due to covid 19 related restrictions the company believes that broad product adoption in earlier lines of treatment may continue to be protracted aveo continues to believe fotivda has the potential to become a standard of care for patients that have received two or more prior systemic treatments data from a long term efficacy follow up and additional tolerability analyses from the tivo 3 trial comparing tivozanib to sorafenib in r r advanced rcc following two or more prior systemic therapies were presented at the asco 2021 annual meeting these data included updated durability of response dor and overall survival os results as well as an analysis of treatment emergent adverse events teaes across trial arms tivozanib demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in overall response rate orr and dor compared to sorafenib in highly relapsed or refractory rcc patients in the tivo 3 trial in addition the long term os relative to sorafenib continued to improve with a hazard ratio of 0 91 as presented at asco 2021 patients in the tivo 3 trial demonstrated a longer duration of treatment exposure with tivozanib than sorafenib 11 9 cycles vs 6 7 cycles but fewer all grade and grade 3 teaes the observed teaes were generally similar with tivozanib and sorafenib patients receiving tivozanib in the tivo 3 trial required fewer dose reductions and the time to dose reductions were longer with tivozanib than sorafenib these data included updated durability of response dor and overall survival os results as well as an analysis of treatment emergent adverse events teaes across trial arms data from a key subgroup and quality of life analyses from the phase 3 tivo 3 study of tivozanib in rcc presented at the asco 2021 genitourinary gu cancers 2021 symposium data highlighting outcomes of the subgroup of tivo 3 patients who received tivozanib following prior axitinib therapy suggests that tivozanib a potent and selective vascular endothelial growth factor receptor vegfr tyrosine kinase inhibitor tki is more active following prior vegfr tki therapy than sorafenib a

isn t to be one and done kfc s parent company yum brands which also owns taco bell and pizza hut has entered into an agreement with beyond meat to launch more products including a plant based carne asada at taco bell the partnership is a sign of the fast food sector s continued interest in plant based meat alternatives despite several short lived trials like dunkin pulling its beyond sausage from thousands of locations and little caesar s failed trial of impossible sausage though the chain is now experimenting with meat free pepperoni hochman says he isn t worried will there be blips when there s an onset of a pandemic of course he said we do think that ultimately this idea of more and more plant based protein being consumed is a fait accompli it s going to happen it s really about when the kfc launch comes at a time when beyond meat needs some good news amid supply chain issues revenue shortfalls and increased competition in the plant based protein category the meat free darling has struggled on the stock market its stock price fell 38 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 from 105 to 65 last year wasn t so good to other plant based meat giants like maple leaf foods and morningstar either both companies fell short of earnings goals amid signs that the rapid growth the plant based sector experienced in recent years is slowing down impossible foods has experienced a huge spike in sales during the pandemic reporting 85 percent growth in retail year over year though much of that spike can be attributed to the fact that pre pandemic impossible s retail footprint was tiny beyond meat s kfc partnership as well as chipotle s announcement this week that it s trialing an in house veggie chorizo nationwide will be important tests for the plant based food industry as a whole it remains to be seen if it can mature from a curiosity to a sector that can actually compete in a meat market still dominated by the real thing but how does beyond fried chicken actually taste i first tried beyond meat s chicken tenders last summer when the company launched the product in a few hundred restaurants i thought it was good but not great something i d happily eat again and have but it didn t mark the same leap in quality that its burgers showed compared to traditional vegetarian offerings beyond fried chicken is a different story the breading is designed to resemble what s used in kfc s conventional fried chicken and features more flavor and crunch than beyond s retail product but the biggest improvement is in the faux chicken itself most plant based meat including beyond s retail tenders is made with chop and form technology meaning food producers take a lot of ground up plant protein form it into a nugget or tender and bread and fry it but beyond fried chicken is made using whole muscle technology meant to better imitate whole muscle cuts of meat like a chicken breast or a ribeye steak that means its texture is notably firmer we began the company with plant based chicken over a decade ago so we ve had in our dna this notion of creating that muscle structure that s unique ethan brown ceo of beyond meat said but it s taken time to make a plant based chicken that doesn t just taste but also feels like chicken from animals kfc s hochman thinks they ve nailed it with the beyond fried chicken but for beyond fried chicken to take off the over 90 percent of americans who regularly eat meat also have to agree not just vegans like myself so i took a six piece box of beyond fried chicken over to a non vegan neighbor s house to get their thoughts the results were mixed having not ever had a plant based meat product before it s good but it doesn t taste like a chicken nugget my neighbor lynn rose told me if i was personally invested in staying away from meat products this would be a good product it s something i d order and be satisfied at a fast food restaurant but it s a very different taste than any kind of meat her 24 year old son braeden disagreed i really love the texture of it it s more sturdy and tastes more like meat the taste is good i m really enjoying these this is probably one of the better plant based proteins i ve had lynn s husband kevin came down to try the last one the breading s good he said it has a chicken breast texture to it it s pretty dense eating this without the breading though it doesn t really taste a lot like chicken that still might be enough white meat chicken by itself is fairly bland the breading spicing and oil impart much of a kfc chicken product s flavor and the plant based meat industry is still quite young beyond meat launched in 2009 and it ll take more research and development to replicate the flavor of chicken and other meats as closely as possible a great deal is at stake with these efforts animal agriculture accounts for about 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and the meat industry subjects tens of billions of animals to cruel factory farm conditions each year but despite growing awareness of those facts global meat consumption is on the rise and moral suasion alone is unlikely to change that better more realistic plant based products that appeal to meat eaters could help and over the last few years there s been a rush of new startups trying to up the ante on plant based meat especially meat free chicken the race for a better plant based chicken is accelerating until last year the plant based meat market mostly consisted of beef and sausage alternatives with just a few chicken products many mediocre and a few pretty good then last summer beyond meat launched a chicken tender product and a few months later so did impossible foods both were fine but didn t represent a big step up in quality the way their burgers did for faux beef in recent years a number of new startups focused entirely on plant based poultry have emerged to fill that void one of those new entrants is rebellyous foods based in seattle its vegan chicken is available in a few hundred grocery stores and the company is intent on making its products cost competitive with the real thing nuggs a startup with marketing catered to the extremely online gen z set has products sold in walmart as are chicken products from la based startup daring foods gardein a company that s been around since 2003 recently started selling a new filet product essentially a big breaded faux chicken patty and retailers like target whole foods wegman s and kroger have launched their own vegetarian chicken products in recent years it s a third wave if you will says zak weston food service and supply chain manager of the good food institute a group that advocates for meat and dairy alternatives there were burgers then sausages and now chicken how the pandemic has scrambled plant based retail from 2019 to 2020 total plant based meat sales rose a whopping 45 percent which was twice as fast as conventional meat but that growth came from a very low baseline plant based meat still makes up less than 1 percent of the total us meat market as data from market research firm iri shows over the last year that growth began to reverse in november 2021 sales of refrigerated plant based meat alternatives dropped 6 6 percent compared to november 2020 anne marie roerink food industry analyst and president of market research and consulting firm 210 analytics analyzed the iri data and told me over email that this deceleration can be attributed in part to the pandemic as many restaurants remained shuttered in 2021 she said a lot of the food service demand moved to retail for a substantial part of the year as a result more stores started carrying refrigerated plant based alternatives and or added more items to the case roerink told me without a lot of new product launches or new distribution and with vaccinated customers returning to restaurants and fast food franchises maintaining the rapid growth of 2020 and early 2021 was unrealistic however she says brands are doing all the right things to drive sales bringing down prices increasing promotions and making improvements to taste and texture the question is whether that s enough to make plant based protein a serious contender in the meat aisle and in fast food franchises
one day after georgia representative marjorie taylor greene s twitter account was suspended over covid 19 misinformation rand paul announced that he s fed up with big tech to emphasize his fist shaking he declared he d be joining a donald trump backed video streaming platform called rumble why rumble adored by the far right rumble is a canadian video sharing platform that launched in 2013 but saw serious growth during the covid 19 pandemic the company s monthly viewership soared from 1 6 million users in fall 2020 to 31 9 million by the end of 2021 s first quarter it s a bit of a mishmash of viral clips of cute animals doing funny things political commentary and conspiracy theories about where society is headed although anti vaccine propaganda runs rampant on rumble as does liberal disdain it labels itself as a neutral platform and it just keeps getting bigger in may narya capital invested in rumble narya was co founded by german american billionaire peter thiel the republican venture capitalist who co founded paypal invested early in facebook and spent millions to fund hulk hogan s bankrupting lawsuits against gawker and author j d vance who followed up his memoir hillbilly elegy with a run for the ohio senate seat on a far right ticket colt ventures the family office of former trump adviser darren blanton also invested at that time according to the wall street journal former trump administration lawyer michael ellis joined rumble as its general counsel and corporate secretary in november around the same time russell brand gave the platform a celebrity boost coming aboard as a creator and agreeing to give the platform first access to all of his videos as well as exclusive content popular on rolling stone on dec 1 rumble announced plans to go public and claimed to be valued at 2 1 billion rumble is designed to be the rails and independent infrastructure that is immune to cancel culture ceo chris pavlovski said in a press release about joining with nasdaq we are a movement that does not stifle censor or punish creativity and believe everyone benefits from access to a neutral network with diverse ideas and opinions on dec 14 donald trump announced that his work in progress social media app truth social had partnered with rumble editor s picks though rumble is all about a free and open internet as pavlovski would go on to say in his statement it did threaten to sue another youtube competitor odysee over a tweet that alleged rumble misled its investors while odysee withdrew the statement in question as requested it then posted what appears to be a screenshot of the cease and desist and tweeting again we are very sorry for suggesting that rumble would ever fake traffic to mislead their investors there is nothing suspicious about their average user leaving after only 1 minute despite it being a website for long form video content we retract our prior tweet now rumble is not the first social media platform to say they prioritize free speech over everything else as yotam ophir an assistant professor in university at buffalo s communication department points out even reddit kind of started as a company that tries to break the rules and get censorship off the map you know until charlottesville which pushed reality back in their faces he says we ve seen it before and it usually ends badly he brings up the likes of parler and gab which lean heavily to the right i m getting tired of hearing about all those freedom of speech heroes that are going to open the new platform that changes the rules only to learn a month from now that they can t actually do it because the lawsuits will start coming in the public pressure will start coming in and advertisers won t want to stay on a platform that s full of hate speech and misinformation rumble s terms and conditions do state that the platform doesn t allow for videos that incite violence and utilize hate speech but it s unclear how loose their definitions may be and how strict they are about such moderation when asked how rumble polices the spread of misinformation particularly misinformation regarding vaccines and qanon theories a rumble representative responded to rolling stone with an email that sort of skirts around the question unlike other platforms rumble doesn t amplify content by sharing it with groups outside of your followers they write instead we use a chronological feed that treats all uploads equally this design removes the incentive to produce and amplify extreme content to gain views in addition to our terms we believe this approach creates a healthier society without resorting to editorial restrictions on content we disagree with when a video posted on rumble gets significant views more than the follower count in nearly all cases it is not because of our platform but because people share the content on other websites and platforms these platforms have algorithms incentivizing engagement and amplify content to a wider audience related stories the chronological approach may be valid however rumble does have a trending section which must operate via some sort of algorithm moreover as ophir mentions twitter instagram and facebook all started with chronological feeds when you had 10 friends you pretty much saw everything they did he recalls but when you follow 45 000 people you cant see everything that s happening he predicts that rumble will be forced to adapt as it grows that s when matters may snowball even more or the whole thing falls apart if and when conservatives move from youtube to rumble or from twitter and facebook to other free speech platforms like parler and gab this could create hyper echo chambers according to yini zhang a colleague of ophir who studies social media and the spread of misinformation such chambers can radicalize people and make them more extreme in their attitudes and beliefs and the idea of there being corners for liberals and conservatives to huddle in she thinks just deepens the divide the migration reminds her of the late eighties and early nineties after the fcc fairness doctrine was repealed that s when we saw the rise of cable news with fox news on the right and msnbc on the left she says highlighting the creation of an increasingly partisan media environment people with strong political opinions and convictions know which cable news channel they should watch and they know which channel will offer them the correct or truthful information a social media parallel is what she fears most adding that it s not impossible to imagine a liberal equivalent launching in the future liberals and conservatives she worries will then completely insulate themselves in a very homogeneous information environment that just caters to their existing views

we should add to cook s managerial success something that has nothing to do with apple as such abundant central bank money printing has put a rocket under virtually all asset prices but particularly the big american tech stocks which have benefited hugely from the compounding effects of indexation with apple now worth around 7 per cent of the entire s p 500 the big has begotten the even bigger with tracker funds driven to buy apple shares in ever greater amounts simply to keep up with their growing weight in the index there is admittedly some reason in the underlying madness some of the biggest commercial winners from the pandemic have been the us tech giants and especially apple whose products are tailor made for home working and social distancing the success of tech giants stands in contrast to the dysfunctional state of american society yet these are not the only malign forces at work here the other is monopoly where the tech giants have again led the way creating a second gilded age of staggering wealth built on ever more concerning concentrations of market power betraying a once proud history of trust busting the growth in monopoly been almost deliberately sanctioned by us policymakers predatory takeovers and abusive market practice have been widely tolerated in a way that would have been unthinkable 50 years ago and has led to a steep decline in the number of viable competitors not just in tech but across sectors looking at the origins of this most un american of trends it can be traced back to the late 1970s and publication of a hugely influential book by a former solicitor general robert bork called the antitrust paradox this argued that competition law should not be concerned with protecting individual competitors but instead with promoting pro consumer business efficiency it has been the refrain of the new monopolists ever since that economies of scale and market power allow them to offer cheaper prices to consumers providing cover for a great raft of predatory practice ironically european union regulators have been much more aggressive in keeping the tradition of us style trust busting alive than american counterparts among whom there is an understandable tendency to regard the tech giants as american success stories under attack from a jealous and protectionist europe yet possibly as a result of this old style approach to competition policy the cost of mobile and internet access is generally lower in europe than the us only quite recently has the tone of political debate in the us begun to shift back towards a more traditional antitrust mentality for the time being however the politicians remain a threatening but otherwise not particularly troubling cloud on apple s horizon stock markets don t yet take the possibility of enforced breakup of the tech titans that seriously perhaps they should for on multiple fronts so called fangs and their ilk find themselves in growing conflict with large segments of us popular and political thinking some of them are already very much part of the culture wars that destructively afflict american society already this week the house minority leader kevin mccarthy has torn into twitter for permanently suspending the personal account of his fellow republican marjorie taylor greene over postings she made about covid 19 vaccines other social media companies have likewise found themselves accused of trampling over free speech by removing content from known right wingers deemed inappropriate or misleading in any case the commercial and global success of the tech giants stands in marked contrast to the increasingly dysfunctional state of american society politics and the constitution and might despite their economic success even be deemed a part of that sickness

i ve seen how cannabis destroys neighbourhoods for sadiq khan to decriminalise it is a lethal mistake writes andy cook ceo of the centre for social justice more teenagers were stabbed or shot to death in london in 2021 than ever before two of the total of 30 were killed last thursday night a talented 15 year old musician in south london and a boy just one year older in boris johnson s uxbridge constituency it s an appalling toll one that shames britain and brings untold grief to families and while we may not ever know for certain the reasons behind these tragic deaths it is an inescapable fact that in a vast number of cases the cannabis trade is to blame sadiq khan reportedly wants to end the prosecution of young people caught with cannabis some of these dead children are members of drugs gangs others are innocents in the wrong place at the wrong time or victims of mistaken identity but the burgeoning drugs economy is the real killer yet the response of the mayor of london sadiq khan has not been to crack down on drugs and protect the citizens in his charge but to do the opposite and start to decriminalise these substances delusional under a new scheme police in lewisham bexley and greenwich boroughs will be told not to arrest young people caught in possession of cannabis it is also understood that the amnesty may extend to all class b drugs including ketamine and dangerous amphetamines like speed i cannot fathom what khan thinks he is doing it staggers me perhaps he imagines he can break london s endless cycle of crime he seems unable to get a grip on by simply decriminalising the peddling of drugs because if it s no longer illegal the pushers by definition will not be criminals but that is plainly delusional the reality is that criminal gangs will see their turnover soar as trade increases and that will attract more crime not less the gangs already control a highly organised network stretching across the whole of britain the so called county lines gangs which rely on children to transport the drugs out to the provinces khan s policy will only encourage and strengthen them as head of the centre for social justice csj i am no advocate of hardline bring back flogging punishment we have argued for a long time that heavy handed sentencing is a completely impractical solution to drug crime for young offenders like those on the fringe of gangs the best answer is to encourage them into better lives through rehabilitation education and family support all the evidence shows that young people with full time jobs have immeasurably better life chances but it is impossible to steer people on to that right path if the alternative is being openly promoted as legal and attractive by london s mayor and its police the very people who should be enforcing the law i know how destructive cannabis is because for 12 years i ran a charity in the midlands called twenty twenty targeting disadvantaged young people with broken lives from the poorest parts of derby leicester and loughborough we did everything we could to turn their lives around at best it was a difficult job but when the kids turned up stoned it was impossible under a new scheme police in lewisham bexley and greenwich boroughs will be told not to arrest young people caught in possession of cannabis stock photo a report in the statistical journal significance in 2013 listed symptoms of cannabis psychosis hallucinations difficulty thinking a reduced ability to solve problems apathy and a distorted sense of reality there is also a wealth of evidence linking the drug to increased risk of heart attacks infertility and a range of other psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia that mirrors exactly what we saw witnessing the enormous damage it could do both in the disruption to the daily slog of school and in the long term damage to young brains i used to visit the inner city estates and discuss individual problems with the families especially the mothers their frustration and despair was heartbreaking many told me that if they ever caught their children with drugs they would go ballistic but what use was that when the police were turning a blind eye families often expressed a desire to see more stop and search on the streets their children were dying far better for teens to be subjected to the inconvenience of a search if that meant there were fewer knives and handguns mr khan s big idea runs directly counter to what those families wanted and needed it will amount to no more than a wishy washy middle class pipe dream imposed on communities that often feel powerless to protect their own children and desperately desire more help from the police not less a major deterrent to drug abuse is the threat of legal penalties if people fear the chance of arrest some will of course ignore it but many will think twice addictive a 2018 survey by the csj found that if cannabis is decriminalised in britain as it has been in some u s states such as colorado and oregon around a million new people will try it they don t currently use it and the chief deterrent is the fact that it is illegal figures differ on how addictive cannabis can be our data suggests about one in ten users become hooked but that is a cautious estimate a survey by the u s substance abuse and mental health services administration found one in five teenagers who smoked the drug casually for three years developed an addiction even at the lower end of those projections that means decriminalisation equates to roughly 100 000 new addicts putting a greater burden on our already overstretched health service the only people who would benefit from khan s plan are the gangs families suffer young people see their prospects and their health wrecked and society bears the cost it is hard enough for youths with limited job prospects and no money as it is they see a chance to earn more cash than they could ever imagine in a way that won t affect their benefits and they do not understand or care how dangerous it could be dramatic but if you believe that if the police catch you you will have a criminal record and you could even go to prison perhaps some will think it s not worth it the power of that argument is wiped out by the mayor s plan other countries have tried this experiment and suffered the repercussions in a public clean up campaign in 2020 amsterdam s coffee shops famed for decades for trading in cannabis and a popular attraction for tourists were barred from selling to non residents the effect on public safety was dramatic the shops had started drawing undesirable visitors to the city what a dutch government report called a motley crew of drugs criminals a ring of hustlers and parasites middle men and extortionists khan s plans risk attracting exactly that kind of drug tourist to london he seems to feel it is a risk worth taking but he has not spent the years i have meeting children and young adults in addiction clinics and pupil referral units or in police and prison cells their lives destroyed by drugs and those are the ones lucky enough to be alive any policy that promotes drug use is a risk too great to take and when faced with the reality of those damning teenage murder statistics the reality of lives cut short and families ripped apart is that really too hard to understand
