numerous proposals were floated for the montana class ships though they all had one thing in common they were considerably larger than the iowas here s what you need to know the u s navy never built more battleships after the iowa class let alone larger ones the montana class battleships were obsolete before the steel was cut for them tragic for battleship fans but proof that the navy was heeding trends and choosing to spend resources wisely during a turbulent and stressful time the five montana class battleships leviathans designed to dwarf even the giant iowa class battleships were authorized for construction but never built victims of the ascendance of naval aviation nearly as large as a modern supercarrier the montana class like all battleships was made obsolete by the success of the aircraft carrier in the late 1930s the u s government recognizing the deteriorating world situation sought to rebuild u s naval power the crash of the stock market in october 1939 as well as the washington and london naval treaties had slowed the growth of the u s navy and reduced its tempo of peacetime operations by 1940 however with fighting raging in asia and europe it was clear the united states needed to beef up its defensive capability to deter attack or to prosecute a war if it were dragged into conflict in 1940 the federal government authorized the famous two ocean navy capability that laid the groundwork for the wartime u s navy that followed one set of authorized ships five montana class battleships to complement the iowa class battleships america s shipyards would split the work between the philadelphia navy yard two new york navy yard two and norfolk navy yard one numerous proposals were floated for the montana class ships though they all had one thing in common they were considerably larger than the iowas the iowa class battleships were 860 feet long displaced 58 000 tons fully loaded and featured nine 16 50 caliber main guns secondary armament was in the form of twenty 5 38 caliber dual purpose guns capable of firing on targets in the air on land and at sea speed would have been 28 knots slower than the iowa class 33 knot top speed the montanas montana ohio maine new hampshire and louisiana would be slower than the iowas but much more heavily armed and armored one of the first designs of the class which never made it off paper was for an 860 foot long warship with a displacement of 52 000 tons with a trial displacement of 64 500 tons the ships would have been armed with twelve 16 50 caliber guns giving them twenty five percent more firepower in the main battery the twelve guns would have been installed in four three gun turrets two forward and two aft to the iowa classes two forward and one aft secondary armament would consist of twenty 5 inch 38 caliber dual purpose guns capable of anti ship amphibious landing support and anti air defense by march 1940 navy ship architects floated a new even bigger design a battleship 1 050 feet long with a waterline beam of 120 feet the ship would have a standard displacement of 70 000 tons and a trial displacement of 80 000 tons the main battery would have stayed the same but the secondary battery would feature twenty 5 inch 54 caliber guns the longer barrel length on the new 5 inch guns resulted in a higher velocity and longer range thus increasing the size of the battleship s protective bubble against aircraft officially the u s navy states the montanas would have been a compromise between the two designs though on the high end the navy s statistics for the ships include a length of 921 feet a beam of 121 feet and the same armament of twelve 16 50 guns and twenty 5 inch 54 caliber guns top speed would have been the same as previous ships maxing out at 28 knots the navy states that the third design featured improved armor against shellfire and torpedo attacks over previous battleships and would have been the only new world war ii era u s battleships to be adequately armored against guns of the same power as their own the montana class battleships would have served on the u s navy s battleship line prepared to duke it out with the opposing navy s own fleet of battleships in a decisive battle unfortunately for the battleship community the reign of the battlewagon was already coming to an end the attack on pearl harbor on december 7th 1941 and the destruction of the royal navy s force z on december 10th 1941 made it painfully clear that aircraft including aircraft carriers had eclipsed battleships as the primary weapon at sea the sinking of the battleship hms prince of wales and battlecruiser hms repulse for the loss of only three japanese aircraft demonstrated how much large surface ships were at the mercy of air power the montana battleships were initially delayed to prioritize new aircraft carrier construction then cancelled outright in 1943 the u s navy would not build a ship as large as the proposed montanas until 1955 when the supercarrier uss forrestal entered service like montana forrestal was approximately 900 feet long and had displaced 80 000 tons fully loaded unlike montana however it could pack up to eighty five aircraft of various types on its flight deck and hangar giving it a much greater striking range flexibility in adapting to various missions and the ability to rapidly replace lost combat power by simply adding more aircraft the u s navy never built more battleships after the iowa class let alone larger ones the montana class battleships were obsolete before the steel was cut for them tragic for battleship fans but proof that the navy was heeding trends and choosing to spend resources wisely during a turbulent and stressful time had the navy stubbornly pushed ahead and built the montanas a lack of carriers could have extended the length of the war and cost even more lives ironically had the montanas been built we might look back on the battleship era with considerably less pride and

when jeff bezos returned to earth after a trip to the edge of space there were sighs of relief and it s likely some of them were from board members of the 1 8 trillion company he started 27 years ago for amazon s founder and executive chairman the trip on tuesday aboard a rocket from his venture blue origin may have been the realization of a childhood dream but for corporate boards any time a top executive does something dangerous it ends up posing a major risk to the the company s bottom line yet as more executives continue to push the envelope boards recognize there isn t much they can do take mark bertolini the former chairman and ceo of health insurance company aetna a person with a self described adrenaline drive bertolini got his first dirt bike when he was 8 years old and today he owns three harley davidson motorcycles and a ducati bertolini also loves downhill skiing that was certainly a worry for aetna s board when i was first named ceo and chairman and was asked to look at a contract they had skiing and motorcycling in there as exclusions bertolini remembers i told them that wouldn t work for me justin sullivan getty images getty images former aetna chairman and ceo mark bertolini speaks at conference in san francisco in 2015 bertolini is an avid motorcyclist and skier and he fended off aetna s efforts to limit him from those hobbies aetna s board had good reason to try to hold bertolini back just a few years before he was named ceo in 2010 bertolini had been skiing in vermont he looked over his shoulder to check something he hit a tree and dived headfirst into a river bertolini spent two hours in the icy water with five broken vertebrae and ended up in coma yet even in the middle of a long difficult recovery bertolini who was then a top executive told aetna s board he didn t intend to stop skiing or riding motorcycles i said that you know i would continue to be careful and take the appropriate precautions he says but my life was my life and i wasn t willing to give those up zuckerberg grooves to music on his hydrofoil surfboard bertolini is not alone in his push for thrills in 2001 when general motors asked auto executive robert lutz to return as its vice chairman the company wanted to limit what he did in his free time like bertolini lutz was an avid skier lutz also liked to ride motorcycles as well as race cars he even owned and flew two military jets stan honda afp via getty images afp via getty images robert lutz now former vice chairman at general motors says companies should welcome risk taking executives lutz hasn t forgotten what he told the board i m happy to rejoin the company he recalls but i need absolute freedom as far as my hobbies are concerned eventually the board relented and lutz took the job incidentally he flew those planes until he was 87 when he failed an eye exam i encountered these restrictions my whole career says lutz who also held senior level jobs at ford and chrysler but he adds that he never took them very seriously and got away with it for 47 years corporate governance experts say founders of companies especially seem to enjoy a certain kind of impunity bezos for example followed in the footsteps of virgin group founder richard branson who made his own trip to the edge of space just days earlier and on the fourth of july facebook ceo mark zuckerberg posted a video on instagram of him riding on a hydrofoil surfboard holding an american flag to john denver s take me home country roads hillary sale a professor of law and management at georgetown university says there should be an open dialogue about an executive s hobbies a good board talks about it thinks about it and prepares for it she says when tragedy hits a company s leader and there s good reason for that accidents do happen it took a year for micron technology s stock to recover after its ceo steve appleton died piloting a small plane in 2012 yet boards are often unable to rein in their top executives activities even if they are aware of the risks to companies it s a bigger question whether a board can really say to somebody like their ceo absolutely not you cannot do that according to sale that s where executives and corporate governance experts say succession planning comes in joe jaszewski ap ap inspectors examine of the wreckage of a lancair experimental aircraft that crashed in february 2012 killing micron ceo steve appleton these days bertolini is retired from aetna and he sits on a handful of boards he is on the other side of the table now and bertolini says that has given him a different perspective on the role an executive plays in the success of a company you never want to be in a place where that person is indispensable to the success of the company he says nor do you want to if publicly traded to have a huge impact on market cap bertolini says even as ceo he was mindful of the risks to the company his activities posed at aetna he says he discussed succession planning at every board meeting for executives having that plan in place helps mitigates some of the risk to companies and they believe that having daredevil ceos is not a bad thing after all lutz for example believes companies would be more successful with ceos who like taking risk as opposed to you know calm peaceful guys who never want to put themselves at risk always drive the speed limit and drive a minivan as their only vehicle who the heck wants a person like that to lead a corporation or to be in a leadership position at a corporation he asks copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
when we think about interest rates within our collective consciousness they are generally perceived as something that is extremely slow to shift direction like a giant supertanker that takes miles to change direction once a course in the direction of rates has been set there is a great deal of inertia propelling them in that same direction for years to come this has been very true of australia s own reserve bank after raising rates for the last time in november 2010 the course of interest rates has been on a downward trajectory for almost a decade without fail related sign australia is heading for disaster interest rates have been on a downward trajectory however with the rba s cash rate sitting near 0 per cent eventually there comes a time when a course in the opposite direction must finally be considered so far reserve bank governor philip lowe is charting a supertanker like course which will see rates begin to rise around three years from now in mid 2024 despite building inflationary pressures in the united states and elsewhere that are pressuring central banks to change course so far lowe appears steadfast in his resolve to keep rates where they are interest rates in new zealand just across the tasman the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz appears to be charting a very different course an approach which resembles the agility of a fast moving powerboat rather than the supertanker style course taken by the rba but this wasn t always so at the beginning of the year a survey of bloomberg economists expected that the rbnz would cut rates even further and by the end of 2021 they would sit at 0 per cent in late may the rbnz projected that interest rates would remain on hold until at least september 2022 rbnz governor adrian orr emphasised that the projections were highly conditional on the kiwi economy recovering as well as expected in a press conference that followed mr orr further tempered the rbnz s projections with caution we are talking about the second half of next year who knows where we will be by then he said related why property price madness won t end adrian orr governor of the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz picture birgit krippner bloomberg in mid june anz brought forward its projection of the first rbnz rate rise to february 2022 on the back of strong gdp growth now just a few weeks later things have changed course almost entirely investors and financial markets are now pricing in a 90 per cent chance of interest rates being hiked by the rbnz at their very next meeting in august despite the rbnz forecasting that it would be 16 months before rates would rise higher inflation and market expectations of a rate hike could see them moving up in a matter of weeks but the rate hikes are not expected to stop there according to forecasts from westpac economists rates are predicted to go up in august october and november this would raise the rbnz cash rate by 0 75 per cent from its current record low of 0 25 per cent to 1 per cent in a little over six weeks from the rbnz cautiously confirming no rate hikes until september 2022 the rbnz s approach to interest rates has been completely transformed if that happens new zealand will become the test case for rising interest rates throughout the western world what this all means for house prices while the strong economic recovery new zealand has so far experienced is expected to continue in the longer term there are concerns that rising interest rates could begin to drag significantly on the kiwi economy but perhaps the biggest test will be for the property market after seeing the median price of a residential property in new zealand increase 28 7 per cent from 637 000 in june 2020 to 820 000 in june 2021 there are concerns about the impact rapidly rising rates may have nz interest rate hikes will mean higher mortgage payments which in turn could affect sale prices picture nca newswire joel carrett according to one analysis by interest co nz journalist david hargreaves if anz s forecasts of 1 5 per cent in rate rises by november 2022 are realised the monthly amount a first homebuyer must make in repayments on the median first homebuyer mortgage would rise by 17 5 per cent over the life of a 30 year loan including expected interest costs and fees that s an increase of up to 78 9 per cent compared with what they are paying currently interest rates in australia despite their similarities the rba has a very different viewpoint on interest rates when contrasted with the rbnz particularly after the recent changes made by the new zealand government to include housing prices in its mandate however the fact remains that conditions are changing rapidly and this could cause the rba to raise rates years earlier than expected prior to the lockdowns in south australia nsw and victoria this is exactly what interest rate futures markets were pricing in according to an analysis done in early june by us investment bank j p morgan the interest rate futures market expected around 0 4 per cent worth of rate rises over the next two years 1 per cent over the next three years and roughly 1 5 per cent over the next four years naturally the lockdowns and growing levels of uncertainty about the future of the economy will impact when the rba will raise rates but if inflation continues to rapidly rise and spends a protracted period outside the rba s 2 per cent to 3 per cent target band the rba may be forced out of its supertanker style course into one more resembling its more agile sister across the tasman because as the world continues to grapple with the pandemic government stimulus and their knock on effects any and all plausible outcomes are very much on the table tarric brooker is a freelance journalist and social commentator

here s what you need to remember the north korean people s army type 88 rifle is similar to the soviet era ak 74 with one key difference unusual helical magazines that carry up to five times as many rounds as conventional 30 round magazines one of the largest armies in the world has adopted one of the most unusual variants of the ak series of assault rifles the north korean people s army type 88 rifle is similar to the soviet era ak 74 with one key difference unusual helical magazines that carry up to five times as many rounds as conventional 30 round magazines over the past sixty years the korean people s army kpa has consistently ranked as one of the largest armed forces in the world the size and strength of the kpa has fluctuated over time and are not made public but are thought to number today an estimated 1 19 million men and women under arms the vast majority of the kpa belongs to the ground forces with the air force and navy a distant second and third the kpa was trained and equipped in the late 1940s by the soviet union and received considerable support throughout the cold war like most communist bloc countries north korea manufactured and fielded its own version of the ak 47 the ak 47 itself became the type 58 assault rifle while the improved akm became the type 68 rifle both rifles used the 7 62x39 round simplifying logistics considerably and requiring the country to stock only a single common rifle caliber in vast quantities according to small arms historian edward clinton ezell the rifles were manufactured at the number 61 and 65 small arms factories at an annual rate of 150 000 a year the latest north korean assault rifle is the type 88 the type 88 is a copy of the ak 74 assault rifle whose primary advantage over the ak 47 was the adoption of the smaller lighter 5 45 millimeter round exactly when the type 88 was adopted is not clear but the type designation in this case may indicate the year of adoption 1988 the rifle is now a staple of north korean military parades and is frequently seen in the hands of north korean special operations troops and leader kim jong un s bodyguards as a copy of the ak 74 the type 88 s performance is likely identical to the original soviet and now russian rifle the ak 74 is approximately 37 12 inches long though a north korean rifle could have a shorter overall buttstock and overall length to suit shorter north korean soldiers the lighter recoil and weight of the 5 45 millimeter round over the older 7 62 millimeter round was likely considered enough of an advance to warrant changing calibers the ak 74 weighs 6 5 pounds and has a rate of fire of approximately 600 to 650 rounds per minute unlike previous rifles which were blued steel with wooden furniture the type 88 is all black in appearance likely a purely cosmetic feature meant to give it a modern look like south korea s daewoo k2 and american m4a1 carbine the rate of issue for the type 88 can only be guessed at although previous north korean assault rifles were produced in prodigious quantities the collapse of the north s economy in the 1980s probably slowed production unlike the type 58 and type 68 pyongyang does not appear to be producing the type 88 for export sufficient numbers of type 88s have probably been produced for the country s 200 000 special purpose and special operations forces including army and navy sniper brigades airborne units light infantry brigades and commando units and perhaps the country s mechanized infantry units given the country s relative poverty and the diversion of funds to the nuclear program combat service support and other rear area troops as well as reservists almost certainly still carry type 58 and 68 rifles beginning in 2010 north korean troops with type 88 rifles were photographed with a strange new accessory helical ammunition magazines the cylindrical magazines were larger the traditional 30 round banana magazines and estimated to carry between 100 and 150 rounds that s up to five times more firepower than conventional magazines how reliable this new magazine is anyone s guess but one thing is for sure it will certainly be heavier a 100 round magazine will add 2 pounds in ammunition alone and probably another two to three pounds in magazine body spring and follower suddenly the 6 5 pound type 88 is a 11 pound weapon a difficult weapon for a 150 pound soldier to carry why the new magazine the end of the cold war shut off the flow of new arms technology to north korea and since then the country has sought to maximize the use of existing tech the kpa for example mounts anti tank guided missiles on main battle tanks to increase their killing range and man portable surface to air missiles to armored personnel carriers more firepower is always better the helical magazine may be a similar attempt to increase firepower for ground troops especially in the suppressive fire role during infantry attacks another new innovation appears to be mating the type 88 with a bolt action grenade launcher and a new previously unseen optic north korea s arms industry is poor and backward but full of surprises pyongyang s infantry and special operations forces make up a disproportionate amount of its armed forces and a major part of its offensive capability giving it considerable incentive to provide new technology when possible the type 88 rifle will probably see further improvements in the coming years but how much new tech north korea can sustain across hundreds of thousands of rifles remains to be seen kyle mizokami is a defense

remembering councilman dick ladd as one who served with councilman dick ladd i would like to recognize two of his memorable traits his meticulous review of the issues and his courage in the face of stiff opposition no issue was more challenging or significant than the stormwater management legislation to restore damaged streams and reduce polluted stormwater runoff councilman ladd joined the administration and councilmen chris trumbauer and john grasso to co sponsor the legislation and withstand the fallacious rhetoric of the bill s opponents giving the county council the final fiscal authority to approve county police arbitration awards also required fortitude anybody can steer a boat when the waters are calm dick ladd helped steer the county during the rough seas of a bone crushing recession and had the backbone to stand up to the special interests on behalf of county taxpayers john r leopold pasadena leopold is a former anne arundel county executive if reparations are required the english crown should share cost regarding the recent discussions of reparations on the face it s not a bad idea however who would get the grants and who should pay for it when the colonists who numbered less than a million asked the crown for help they were obliged by sending over a million slaves from scotland wales ireland and europe mostly anemic from hundreds of years domination by the english many of the slaves died en route over the sea many more died in the fields and a host escaped when to colonists complained the english kings then cut a deal with african warlords thus in fairness the subject reparations of should come from the english royalty but how will it be determined who is entitled to those reparations dave aland annapolis housing affordability crisis as the chair of the apartment and office building association of metro washington s maryland legislative committee i have witnessed firsthand a massive increase in demand for rental homes throughout prince george s county something occurring nationwide this demand paired with lagging construction and aging housing stock has placing upward pressure on renters our nation is in a housing affordability crisis and the undersupply of housing near walkable transit served locations is making it worse the house of representatives recently passed the invest in america act and included two important provisions aimed to help combat this crisis the build more housing near transit act and the promote affordable housing near transit act both pieces of legislation would help promote the development of affordable housing near transit served areas which would not only help house renters who need quality affordable housing but would also help individuals access public transportation for work and social purposes spurring economic activity the large surface transportation bill has now moved to the senate where the senate banking committee will have jurisdiction over what is included in the legislation now is the time for the committee to do their part to help solve the housing affordability crisis and ensure these provisions are included in their version of the bill harald mangold alexandria virginia incompetent dangerous bridge management monday at 2 30 p m i was traveling westbound while the left signs were red on a third way into the bridge the signs turned green many cars then filled the left lane three quarters into the drive the lights turned red again to the dismay of lots of cars now traveling in the left lane it s an accident waiting to happen david murphy annapolis pelosi s days as speaker are numbered on july 21 house minority leader kevin mccarthy referred to house leader nancy pelosi as a lame duck does he know something we don t yes she s done stick a fork in her she knows it s over but she just hasn t announced it yet pelosi will be 82 years old in 2022 and she can see the writing on the wall about the upcoming election while she could win her congressional seat democrats in the house are going to get destroyed in the upcoming midterm elections pelosi knows this and does not want to end her career on mammoth losses in the house and surrender her gavel again and she certainly doesn t want to revert to just the minority leader in the house either age elections hubris no one is immune goodbye to the wicked witch of the west and i hope she enjoys her retirement in san francisco dodging piles of human excrement on the sidewalk homeless camps rampant crime and confiscatory taxes don t let the door hit you on the way out dennis mcgee arnold
it appears democrats are successfully keeping their coalition together and are intent on running out the clock on this special session example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video dallas the big political news remains in the house chamber at the state capitol we are entering week three of texas house democrats in washington d c covid has now become a distraction but it appears democrats are successfully keeping their coalition together and are intent on running out the clock on this special session to kill another republican bill to change how and when texans vote dems in d c state rep gene wu d houston spoke to inside texas politics from the washington hotel where he and his colleagues remain in their self imposed exile he said that the democrats goal in going to d c was to have the public woken up to what he called the slow erosion of the public s right to vote and on this halfway point of the special session wu said he believes that goal has been accomplished when we started here we said we need to change the narrative of what s happening throughout the nation we need to bring awareness to the situation we need to get people woken up about what is going on wu said however over the past week that messaging got muddled after headlines turned to the handful of texas democrats testing positive for covid 19 it killed their messaging explained ross ramsey with the texas tribune they were trying to concentrate on getting congress to pass voting legislation that would preempt what they don t like in in texas and instead they spent the week talking about covid they re going to have to get attention back to get anywhere with their program ramsey added but the next plot twist in the texas house democrats fleeing to d c could happen at the state s supreme court justices are being asked to decide whether gov greg abbott can legally veto salaries for the legislative branch abbott did that because democrats left in may whatever the supreme court of texas decides it will have political implications will the supreme court do abbott a favor by upholding his veto power or by giving him an out from this stalemate changing political landscape the republican party of texas is officially under new leadership lt col allen west resigned to run for governor the new chairman is a known name among texas conservatives it s matt rinaldi he is a former state representative from dallas county rinaldi originally endorsed one of abbott s challengers raising the question how he will work with the governor rinaldi acknowledged that there are splinters in the texas gop but said those same splinters exist in any organization or business he said those differences can be overcome by treating people with respect hearing their views and allowing everyone to have a voice that approach could be essential going forward in future elections and there s one bright spot for republicans here the rio grande valley the southern tip of texas we ve talked a lot on inside texas politics about how presidential races are getting closer and closer in texas but over the last three to four years republicans have chipped away at this democratic stronghold and the city of mcallen just elected its first republican mayor in decades mayor javier villalobos spoke to us from mcallen city hall about the change his election represents and whether republicans are making a mistake about not being more inclusive in the party i can t speak for that but i can speak for what i did villalobos said and what worked for me was to be inclusive for everybody if you re republican and you re trying to gain support you re not going to get it from other republicans you re going to get it by bringing in people there s no reason to be adversarial he added covid 19 the delta variant is beginning to put young texans in the hospital but abbott says masks will not be required again even in public schools do counties and cities and schools have many options politically is this tough talk helping him with the far right of the party i think that what you re going to see is those county commissioners and those city council people and all those they re going to get the message out to get vaccinated and encourage the schools and the teachers to encourage the parents to have masks on their children and put masks on because these governmental agencies they can t do too much because of what abbott has done wfaa political producer berna dean steptoe explained on the show

as philip morris bids for british inhaler firm tobacco boss in takeover row says we ll stop selling cigarettes in the next ten years the boss of tobacco giant philip morris international has mounted a staunch defence of its controversial deal to buy a british inhaler company and pledged to stop selling cigarettes in the uk within the next ten years jacek olczak said his bid to take over wiltshire based vectura is a crucial part of his plan to become a healthcare and wellness company philip morris international struck the controversial 1billion deal earlier this month trumping an offer from us private equity firm carlyle but the deal for ftse 250 listed vectura which provides inhaled medicines and asthma treatments sparked a backlash from healthcare campaigners and politicians critics allege that it is unethical for a company that sells cigarettes also to sell medical devices used by people suffering the consequences of smoking mps have written to business secretary kwasi kwarteng and health secretary sajid javid calling on them to block the deal speaking to the mail on sunday olczak responded there are some critics saying why is philip morris going into pharmaceuticals i want to allow this company to leave smoking behind if i don t do alternatives to smoking what do you want me to do there s a lot of emotions however if i bring some logic to this whole thing what i m actually doing is helping philip morris to get faster out of cigarettes i think in the uk ten years from now maximum you can completely solve the problem of smoking asked if that meant philip morris would stop selling cigarettes in the uk within the next ten years he replied absolutely olczak said the marlboro brand was likely to disappear altogether from britain where it was established in the late 1800s before being registered in new york in 1908 the name was a nod to the then british company s great marlborough street factory in soho central london the modern day philip morris international now an american headquartered multinational that sells tobacco products across the world has invested vast sums in alternatives to smoking including e cigarettes or vapes and heat not burn devices heating tobacco as opposed to burning it generates a nicotine containing vapour without many of the chemicals usually associated with smoking it is considered less harmful to the health than smoking traditional cigarettes olczak said of the marlboro brand it will disappear the first choice for consumers is they should quit smoking but if they don t the second best choice is let them switch to the better alternatives if the cost is that marlboro is going to disappear i absolutely will not blink an eye i can build another brand it is worth doing this if we solve the problem of smoking on the vectura takeover itself olczak said the company which has its headquarters in chippenham would be run at arm s length from philip morris international and would not be subsumed into the bigger tobacco business we intend to operate vectura as an autonomous business unit because it has nothing to do with nicotine products he said i m actually building another part of philip morris a company like vectura is an important component of accelerating my path despite the political backlash a source close to the government said ministers were unlikely to intervene because there was no clear legal argument for blocking the deal vectura s investors are also expected to support the takeover two of the firm s top 20 shareholders told the mail on sunday that they are backing the bid because their responsibility is to get the highest investment returns for their clients however fund managers have been branded as hypocritical for banging the drum about ethical and socially responsible investing while backing the sale of a health company to a tobacco giant giving up jacek olczak wants to get away from cigarettes and into wellness vectura s shareholders include the world s largest asset manager blackrock and legal general which manages 1 29trillion of its customers money globally alan miller founder of wealth manager scm direct said the hypocrisy of blackrock and legal general is breathtaking and the takeover of vectura is just the latest example neither has objected to this takeover even though both their chief executives espouse the virtues of environmental social and governance esg investing and green principles generally legal general has also linked bonuses for executives to esg targets from 2021 axa investment managers is another vectura shareholder that has found the proposed takeover by philip morris at odds with its investment ethics its parent company the french insurance giant axa has a large healthcare business axa has signed the tobacco free finance pledge and claims on its website to be leading the fight against tobacco a source close to axa said it was stuck between a rock and a hard place on the vectura deal because accepting the philip morris bid would likely be the best outcome for shareholders one fund manager said that the cash bid meant he would not be left holding equity in a tobacco stock although he admitted that his fund would be profiting from the sale to a tobacco company he pointed out that philip morris needs to make such deals if the company is to transition into a health and wellbeing company just as oil giants are attempting to shift away from fossil fuels olczak said it s like saying if i m producing oil i cannot go electric telling me the way i am solving the problem is creating the perception i m hypocritical would you not rather have a cigarette company that cares about solving the problem

us private equity giant apollo is closing in on an agreement to join forces with a group of foreign bidders for morrisons supermarkets tightening the consortium s grip on the grocery chain fortress which is backed by japanese investment giant softbank has teamed up with american businessman charles koch and the canada pension plan investment board to agree a 6 3billion offer for the bradford based chain talks to bring apollo on board are progressing towards a conclusion putting immense pressure on rival bidder clayton dubilier rice to walk away or top the existing bid in vogue interest in supermarket chain morrisons follows a swoop on asda last year sources said the chance of apollo aligning with fortress was now highly likely the agreed 2 52p a share bid is 42 per cent higher than the share price in june before private equity interest in morrisons emerged the offer also includes a commitment to pay a 2p a share dividend morrisons shares on friday closed at 2 67 city sources said apollo joining the group would make it harder for rivals to swoop in with a higher offer and added that its expertise in global credit markets could reduce the cost of completing the bid apollo said last week it was considering uniting with fortress and its partners and was holding early stage discussions but with no certainty of an agreement sir terry leahy the much vaunted former chief executive of tesco and a former colleague of morrisons chairman andy higginson and chief executive david potts is advising rival bidder cd r the mail on sunday reported last week that jpmorgan had emerged alongside goldman sachs advising cd r a third bank bnp paribas was named days ago cd r has until august 9 to make an offer just a week before morrisons shareholders are due to vote on the fortress consortium bid cd r would have to top the existing bid and most likely match or improve upon a string of assurances published on the london stock exchange to have any chance of support from the morrisons board the assurances which must be observed for 12 months after the completion of any deal include maintaining the firm s head office in bradford keeping existing agreements with suppliers and not weakening the chain by selling off chunks of its property for a quick profit and then renting them back one veteran city source said it s difficult to see how bidders can go much higher than the current price without doing the very things fortress has committed not to do squeezing suppliers flogging off the property but another warned there may be considerable wriggle room within the commitments one strategy would be to create a separate property company still owned by an over arching parent group but separate to the food retailing operating business once a separate division had been created it would then be easier to strip out parts of the property portfolio over time or sell larger groups of store assets in the future under new owners the sources said this is all about the dark arts of private equity where anything becomes possible and nothing is ever straightforward said one source morrisons shareholder jo hambro has called for the chain s suitors to raise their bid price to 270p a share although it has already sold part of its shareholding for less than that price it is likely many of morrisons existing shareholders would cave in at the existing price interest in morrisons follows a swoop on asda last year by two little known businessmen the issa brothers and their private equity backers tdr capital it was reported last month that the new asda owners sold its distribution network for 1 7billion sparking more speculation that private equity firms may look to strip out saleable assets from other supermarket chains there has been speculation of a bid for sainsbury s whose share price has surged 23 per cent in 2021
here s what you need to remember why haven t we seen a substantial increase in gdp the largest component of gdp is consumption which represents final transactions of goods and services in an economy from february 2020 to may 2021 consumption rose by approximately 781 9 billion as of late many media outlets have been reporting abnormal levels of inflation which is absolutely accurate information generally the federal reserve aims to keep inflation around an annual target of two percent from february 2020 to may 2021 the u s dollar has experienced 3 758 percent inflation this represents an increase in the real cost of consumer goods and services in the united states that is pretty noticeably above the target level undoubtedly many media correspondents have been saying that this is dangerous and that the fed must proceed with caution but have any of them explained where this inflation has come from or why americans should care recent inflation can be attributed to two main sources the first reason is an increase in the cost of production across the board which is a result of the turbulent nature of the global pandemic secondly the money supply has increased substantially since early 2020 this is primarily due to the need for stimulus packages without which the united states economy would have presumably collapsed under the weight of the pandemic the cares act was passed on march 27 2020 and the american rescue plan was passed on march 11 2021 the fact that two diametrically opposed administrations both passed relief packages should convey how dire of a situation we were in it should be accepted that these stimulus packages were necessary albeit uncomfortable for the federal government to agree on and yet we face an issue that stems from the implementation of these stimulus packages that issue being inflation so could this extra inflation have been prevented despite claims to the contrary a labor shortage or calls for better wages are not contributing to higher levels of inflation some media pundits and politicians claim the united states is experiencing cost push inflation which means it is experiencing higher prices due to higher costs of supply and production some may blame this inflation on lazy workers but labor force participation has only dropped by 1 7 percentage points from february 2020 to june 2021 in reality supply chains have been an absolute mess because of the pandemic the united states has seen a massive increase in the cost of supply due to general disruption in the supply chain for americans things are potentially beginning to stabilize thanks to vaccination efforts but this is not the case for the rest of the world many countries lack the resources of the united states and have been unable to vaccinate substantial portions of their populations and so shutdowns and all the other harsh realities of the pandemic continue around the globe because of this the global supply chain and economy are effectively in disarray we will not see a stabilization in producer prices until the whole world can say they are safe from covid 19 so what happened with the money supply the answer lies in the velocity of money in short the velocity indicates how fast money moves through the economy as in how often currency is used in purchases of goods or services the velocity of money is an essential component in understanding monetary policy and inflation for the first quarter of 2020 the velocity of actively circulating money was 5 247 and for the first quarter of 2021 the velocity was 1 198 the velocity is a ratio based on economic activity think gdp as a numerator divided by the supply of money think m1 or m2 money stock as a denominator the velocity of money in the united states has tanked since the start of 2020 of course this is primarily due to the pandemic which has greatly hindered people s ability to live their daily lives referring of course to their ability and desire to buy things when the money supply increases inflation is not necessarily a problem unless there is not a comparable increase in economic activity the abysmally low velocity of money indicates that the money pumped into the economy via stimulus packages was not properly utilized the government has created all this money to get people through these hard times but most of that money wasn t actually spent so where did it go since the start of 2020 disposable personal income has overall not increased substantially but has seen several spikes which coincide with stimulus packages on the other hand gdp dipped tremendously then recovered gradually to pre pandemic levels so even though the federal government increased the money supply via stimulus packages the country has not seen any sort of substantial increase in its usual indicators of economic activity add on inflation and these indicators have definitely stagnated this is understandable due to the tumultuous nature of the pandemic in general but this bodes poorly for the economy when we factor in the increase in the money supply if these indicators were to rise substantially the country would see an increase in the velocity of money which would then indicate a reduction or stabilization in levels of inflation the fed wants to stabilize inflation or else the money in americans pockets is worth less so how do we increase income well obviously if you increase wages you directly increase income often you ll hear it argued that increasing wages increases costs but these arguments don t consider the accompanying increase in demand referred to as the income effect think of it like this businesses might have to pay more to produce each item but they can sell a higher volume of items because there are more buyers with more income which results in increased or unchanged profits for businesses the profit margin on individual units may decrease but overall profit is unchanged or potentially increases the real difference is more money is spent velocity increases and more people have better access to goods and services why haven t we seen a substantial increase in gdp the largest component of gdp is consumption which represents final transactions of goods and services in an economy from february 2020 to may 2021 consumption rose by approximately 781 9 billion the cares act provided individuals with cash payments totaling 300 billion and the american rescue plan provided individuals with cash payments totaling 424 billion together this means americans have received 724 billion worth of cash stimulus since the start of 2020 meanwhile during this same period the m2 money supply has risen by 4 921 6 billion representing over a thirty percent increase the cares act of 2021 s total cost was approximately 2 2 trillion and the american rescue plan of 2021 total cost was approximately 1 9 trillion which added together comes out to 4 1 trillion tracking consumption shows that the actual spending of stimulus money is far below the amount of money created for the stimulus packages and this is where we have a big issue while it was important to ensure businesses would not collapse under the weight of supply and demand shocks brought about by the pandemic it is also important to recognize that the massive increase to the money supply to fund stimulus packages did not result in equivalent increases to economic activity economists see an increase in consumption coinciding with cash payments but they have yet to see any other substantial increase in macroeconomic activity resulting from stimulus packages the rest of 2021 will show whether or not we will recover from higher than target levels of inflation as it stands though the misallocation of funds within stimulus packages may have caused an irreversible increase in the level of inflation to summarize america isn t out of the woods yet there will be continued disruptions in the global economy due to the covid 19 pandemic which will probably only cease once a majority of the global population is vaccinated this is just an unfortunate reality we all must accept did the stimulus packages save us or screw us we won t really know for sure until some more time has passed and we can feel a little more of a return to normalcy in the meantime don t be afraid to spend your money and don t disparage others for wanting better wages the more you fear inflation the more you feed into its growth and negative effects we re americans we shouldn t let an unapproachable and complicated concept within economics scare us brendan lesko has a bachelor of science in applied economics from the university of rhode island and has previously worked as an analyst for the rhode island state government policy office

in june 2020 amendola family cigar co announced it would be moving production of its entire portfolio out of tabacalera kafie in danlí honduras to a combination of different nicaraguan factories a group that would eventually include aganorsa leaf s tabacos valle de jalapa s a factory la zona cigar factory and both of aj fernandez s factories as part of the move amendola announced a new line of cigars under its signature series being produced at la zona that are designed to be paired with coffee or after dinner drinks like a dessert the first release in that series was cannoli red the name is a reference to the company s founders italian american heritage a 5 1 2 x 42 box pressed corona vitola made up of a mexican san andrés wrapper covering nicaraguan tobacco used in both the binder and filler the cigars carry a retail price of 9 each and debuted in december 2020 packaged in 20 count boxes the cannoli series is a special project for jeffrey and me said christopher monaco principal of amendola family cigar co in a press release we made a promise to incorporate our italian american heritage into every blend we create the cannoli red was followed by the cannoli green which is made up of a sumatran wrapper along with a nicaraguan binder and nicaraguan fillers and the cannoli white which is covered in an ecuadorian connecticut seed wrapper both of these were released in may featuring the same 5 1 2 x 42 vitola and 9 msrp as the cannoli red cigar reviewed amendola signature series cannoli red amendola signature series cannoli red country of origin nicaragua nicaragua factory la zona cigar factory la zona cigar factory wrapper mexico san andrés mexico san andrés binder nicaragua nicaragua filler nicaragua nicaragua length 5 1 2 inches 5 1 2 inches ring gauge 42 42 vitola corona corona msrp 9 box of 20 180 9 box of 20 180 release date december 2020 december 2020 number of cigars released regular production regular production number of cigars smoked for review 3 visually the amendola signature series cannoli red is covered in an extremely rustic and mottled reddish brown wrapper that is fairly smooth to the touch but covered in large protruding veins there is very little oil present and it is nicely spongy when squeezed while the box press is easily discernible the aroma from the wrapper is a combination of leather dark chocolate and oak while the foot smells of hay generic wood peanut shells fondant and raisin sweetness the cold draw brings flavors of dense creamy oak sweet hay cocoa nibs espresso beans and generic nuts along with a touch of both black pepper and vanilla sweetness starting off the cannoli red features some slight spice on my tongue though it begins to dissipate almost immediately along with a primary combination of rich espresso beans and dark chocolate interspersed with secondary flavors of creamy oak hay barnyard leather peanuts and slight citrus the vanilla sweetness from the cold draw is present on the retrohale along with some black pepper but neither are very strong at the moment construction wise the draw is excellent after a simple straight cut and the smoke production is about average off of the foot but the burn has some minor issues almost immediately causing a quick correction body is close to medium while the strength starts out closer to the mild mark it does begin increasing by the time the first third comes to an end the combination of espresso beans and dark chocolate along with some black pepper remains on top of the profile during the second third of the amendola but the vanilla sweetness that was present on the retrohale in the first third has all but disappeared from the profile by the halfway point additional notes of gritty earth oak generic citrus leather tack nuts and slight vegetal flit in and out at various points while the spice that was present on my tongue is long gone never to return in terms of construction the draw continues to give me no issues and the burn has evened up nicely while the smoke production is about average coming off of the foot strength wise the amendola signature series cannoli red increases a bit but falls just short of medium by the time the second third ends unfortunately the final third of the signature series cannoli red is full of the same flavors as the previous thirds coffee beans and dark chocolate continue to be the main flavor combination followed by leather earth hay peanuts toasted bread and slight cinnamon my hope that the vanilla sweetness or really any sweetness would return to the retrohale was sadly in vain but some black pepper does remain until the end of the cigar both the burn and the draw continue to give me no problems but the smoke production has seemed to wane just a bit although it is still within normal levels finally the strength manages to increase enough to hit a point just over the medium mark as i put the nub down with about an inch remaining final notes for those that may be unaware a cannoli is an italian pastry made up of tube shaped shells that are filled with ricotta cheese sometimes sweetened with powdered sugar sometimes not before being fried while living in germany as a child i remember visiting italy a number of times to see sites including the canals in venice the leaning tower of pisa which we climbed to the top of multiple times something that you could not do for more than a decade after that although it is now allowed again after a renovation to stabilize it and st mark s basilica on such trips we would always make stops at local coffee shops where cannolis were a popular choice for a snack for the record these cigars taste nothing like a cannoli italian or otherwise having said the above the company does make a flavored cigar called the amendola dessert a 6 1 2 x 44 lonsdale with an undisclosed blend that has been aged and infused with hazelnut while the cap has been sweetened with sugar the band on these cigars is chock full of italian references along with a small italian flag on the back the words lealta rispetto and fatto are printed around the outside which translate from italian to loyalty respect and made or fact respectively in addition the word onore is printed on the inside of the band which translates to honor the cigars smoked for this review were purchased by halfwheel final smoking time averaged one hour and 26 minutes for all three samples if you would like to purchase any of the amendola signature series cannoli red cigars site sponsor atlantic cigar has them in stock here 85 overall score from what i recall i have not smoked many or any amendola cigars before while the signature series cannoli red is an enjoyable introduction to the brand it is not without its issues the blend is very linear with espresso bean and dark chocolate notes easily topping the profile from the first puff to the last while there was some nice vanilla sweetness in the first third that flavor completely disappeared around the halfway point construction is decent overall the excellent draw is the high point in that regard as each of the samples had to be touched up at least once and the strength is well integrated but those looking for massive complexity or significant flavor transitions will not find it here

with carollers a christmas tree fake snow a gift exchange and even a surprise visit from santa claus himself the camp it was explained continued the tradition each year and slowly the tradition began to take off in the south and eventually spread around the country according to other explanations christmas in july has become popular in the southern hemisphere where warm and cold seasons are the opposite to countries in the north people wanted to experience a winter feel for christmas and started celebrating in july in the peak of their winter it has been gaining popularity locally with various events and sales having been held in pre covid times also keeping the celebration alive in 2021 is the green market santa cruz they will host their christmas in july theme next saturday july 31 from 6 am we re motivated by a lot of trinis who come home during the summer holidays when their children are out of school and they express how they miss all the seasonal treats that are not available at this time so that s what we re hoping to offer with christmas in july a taste of all those treats the sorrel black cake ponche de crème and we re bringing out christmas decorations and trying to create a really festive atmosphere to make it an enjoyable experience the market s digital content lead rhonda chan soo told sunday guardian at its home upper saddle road santa cruz the green market has brought together local farmers growers food vendors artisans and consumers for almost a decade promoting positive attitudes towards locally produced goods and services and supporting sustainable livelihoods prior to the pandemic the open air community atmosphere had been a magnet for families on saturdays the market s special themes like easter eggstravaganza and honey festival throughout the year provided an extra treat with sellers tweaking their ingredients or entire product to match the particular occasion sellers are always innovating and building relationships with customers a process which continued during the recent lockdown as the market opened from 6 am to 1 pm on saturdays at reduced capacity with farmers garden growers and vendors carrying pre packaged products chan soo said indicating that food would be the main attraction at their event on saturday due to pandemic restrictions she said only takeaway would be offered and strict covid guidelines would be followed the month of july has come to be associated with food the green market has also featured christmas pastelle competitions jezue correia of correia s catering ltd won the competition in 2018 and 2020 with his family s recipe for beef and pork pastelles and came in second in 2019 speaking with sunday guardian he said that the month of july has come to be associated with food especially christmas favourites the best flavours come around christmas time so why not have that more than once a year he said tracing the experience of his grandmother and mother correia said his family s business boasts over 40 years in catering and more than ten years in pastelle making their beef pork and beef chicken fish and lentils and spinach pastelles are also carried at premium supermarkets he said vegan pastelles have stood out in recent years chan soo informed bethany kay da silva and her family of sproutst t will participate for a second time in christmas in july at the market they entered the pastelle making competition last year and decided to create a vegan pastelle to set themselves apart from the traditional meat pastelle makers made with lentils mushrooms which they sell at the market and their organic home grown beansprouts according to da silva the pastelle has all the flavours of a classic beef pastelle as well as a similar texture and was well received at the competition they do orders for vegan pastelles at present which pair nicely with their chutney daddy brand sorrel chutney another product they will be bringing to the market on saturday the sorrel chutney started as a family tradition for christmas and my grandmother asked if my father would make a batch to sell during christmas in july since then sales of the savoury slightly sweet and spicy chunky relish have taken off da silva said adding that they were looking forward to the festivities though different this year we really enjoy the fanfare and festivities dressing for the occasion decorating our products and keeping our table lively and spirited she said meanwhile patricia neptune plagued by persistent digestive issues years ago while vacationing in florida her host recommended kombucha a fermented tea said to have health benefits and she found relief come saturday neptune of international beauty and wellness will be bringing her stocks of sorrel kombucha to patrons at the market operating out of her store at arouca and at pop up markets she has made organic kombucha for 18 years and her products are also carried by pharmacies the relief i felt in such a short time drove me to embrace the opportunity to accept a training programme on my return i decided that since we have such exotic local fruits why not use them to enhance the original formula the feedback from customers suggests that s what sets our kombucha apart she said her regular flavours are mint mauby ginger original and she produces sorrel mango berry and soursop seasonally patrons of the market have also been snapping up refrigerator and oven handle covers by jillian anthony of ibukun designs anthony typically designed jewelry for women and men using natural and recyclable materials but started making handle covers after a friend gifted her some for her fridge and commented that she should try doing them anthony recalled asking neighbours and friends to measure their fridge oven and microwave handles so she could do different sizes and she has garnered favourable responses at a number of craft markets in which she participates the covers go on and come off easily as they have velcro snaps and anthony has also made reversible ones people have been lapping them up because they are practical for keeping fingerprints watermarks and even rust caused by hands which may have salt or other corrosive substances off appliances especially ones made of stainless steel and they also make excellent gifts she said i worked at a company for 22 years and they didn t make me permanent so i decided i would just leave and follow my passion craft she said anthony who said it has been tough not being able to see her two sons who left to live abroad in 2019 said she welcomed christmas in july as a time to commemorate the season she adores most she said trinidadians in general love christmas and the ambience at the market during the christmas in july event kindles the spirit of the larger festive december season for one and all vendors become inventive a curious delicacy first created by candace chow of yu wan mai gourmet at christmas has been catching on at the green market santa cruz the reaction to it when people eat it is always the same they just stop in their tracks and either close their eyes or moan she laughed many customers liken it to a chinese doubles i ve had people before covid stand up right in front me burst it open and eat it and i see the delight in their faces inspired by the taiwanese gua bao chow makes baos which roughly mean bread or buns a flour casing that is steamed like pow and turns out like a soft fluffy cloud unlike pows baos are open faced and filled with meat and condiments based on the customer s requests after the dough is cooked chow fuses asian ingredients like five spice chinese cooking wine and sweet and savoury hoisin sauce with local seasonings like chadon beni in her pork chicken and vegan versions she serves up her baos with sauces and condiments including home made chow chow sorrel relish and chinese pickles for the christmas in july event she will do a herbed mushroom stuffing for her vegan baos i myself am a fusion my father is from hong kong and my mother is a trini chinese spanish callaloo i grew up in a household with two cultures she said her father who came to trinidad around 1973 when he was 13 did not like trini food initially overtime he started adapting and ended up falling in love with local cuisine he began doing his own spin on local dishes and that is where i got it from in the 80s there was a chinese tv show called chin chow s kitchen so he would have had the first chinese cooking show in trinidad my both parents are actually really good chefs and i learned to cook from my grandmother chow launched her asian fusion baos in 2018 at a christmas fair at napa offering ham baos with chow chow slaw and turkey baos with a sorrel relish the passionate home cook who is proud that her food is made with meat from local farmers has since built up a following on social media as well as regular customers at the green market as people are always telling friends about her baos she said she often finds herself having to explain what they are to new customers chow said she loves christmas traditional christmas carols and classic local christmas music and celebrates christmas in july by listening to sweet 100 which promotes the theme while making her products for the market what it means to me is a nice break from the monotony of the year to just be cheerful and child like that innocence it just takes you back to that time while i m preparing the food i play the music so it s almost as if the food gets infused with the christmas vibes at the green market it s fun to see what the vendors come up with in terms of the christmas flavours and how inventive they get i also challenge myself as to how i am going to use the traditional trini flavours and add a twist it s fun other asian fusion dishes like hoisin bbq wings and seasonal fruity iced teas are part of chow s menu when she appears at other pop up markets and food fairs the pandemic gave her the impetus to produce more consistently a friend kept encouraging her to go along and she has missed only a couple saturdays at the green market she said she admitted that it has been scary to take the full leap and start up a business and there have been challenges supplying fresh food at the market means prepping at least two days in advance and getting up at 2 am every saturday so it s a labour of love but the customers have been supporting and the journey has been satisfying the older i get i realise you have to do what you love of course you have to make money you have to be smart in what you do but when you do something you love it doesn t feel like work the 40 year old said she said while she is still observing how the re opening of food places and increasing prices of ingredients will affect her sales she has her loyal customers and is open to catering and other opportunities it s a very volatile time nothing is predictable anymore you go and see what the day brings and every day it s something new you just have to keep pivoting

skip to comments posted on by seekandfind on the global news front i have been watching one event with special attention mainly because it seems like almost no one else is i am speaking of course about the social and economic collapse in south africa that has been escalating over the past couple weeks what is strange to me is that certain parallels between south africa and the us are being summarily ignored basically the south african situation is a more exaggerated version of what is happening in america and we need to consider if it is merely a preview of future events as the extra financial protections in the us begin to fall away cultural marxism and social unrest the reparations con south africa s government under the anc african national congress was already going full communist in 2018 2019 before the covid pandemic under proposed amendments to the constitution they demanded that reparations be taken from white farmers in the form of land grabs which would then be redistributed to black citizens this is the classic critical race theory argument that because colonialism once existed all beneficiaries and their supposed descendants owe dues to the descendants of indigenous people who lost their lands the problem is only the descendants of white colonists are required to pay dues this is exactly the same path that socialists marxists in the democratic party are pursuing in the us with some states and cities demanding reparations for blacks be written into law because of slavery nearly 200 years ago the reparations movement is tiny but like all other social justice initiatives it is gaining power because politicians and corporations are supporting it artificially why that s easy it s all about divide and conquer i think my take on it is simplified but i feel this needs to be said because crt and social justice lunatics tend to over complicate issues in order to distract from certain fundamental realities black and brown people invaded each other s lands and enslaved their neighbors for thousands of years before white people ever showed up on the scene white people were made slaved within certain civilizations for many centuries as well and yes it was just as bad for them as it was for black slaves in america slavery and colonialism has never been relegated to only one race or ethnicity this is historic fact but that s all forgotten in the bizarre justifications of critical race theorists why are white people the only people that are supposed to pay reparations when the whole world has been killing each other for land and resources since the beginning of recorded history frankly if your ancestors lost a bunch of land centuries ago to colonists then perhaps they should have fought harder for it you don t get to suddenly wave your hand and magically claim it back centuries later by default through government enforced eminent domain just because your ancestors sucked at self defense go back in time and tell your great great great grandparents to get good of course today s communists don t really fight for anything at least not directly i might respect them a little if they did rather they loudly whine that they are victims even though they are not and then demand they be given free stuff for life even though they never earned it and since free stuff has to be taken from somewhere the people that have things are attacked through color of law even when they did nothing wrong and earned every cent they own communists steal from others through government proxy and by claiming victim group status they work hand in hand with the very politicians and corporate oligarchs they say they despise the governments and corporations do it because they can use the marxist mob as a social weapon to strike fear in their ideological adversaries conservatives and the sjws do it because they can feed on the scraps from the big boy s table and use government to forcefully redistribute wealth into their own pockets it s kind of a win win at least for a while eventually the low level commies get nailed to a wall or sent to a gulag when they are no longer useful but that s a tale for another time as international outrage developed over the proposed land confiscation mandates and accusations of reverse racism started to spread the anc dialed back their rhetoric and adjusted legislation to confiscate land that was abandoned unused or posed safety risks let s set aside the fact that these requirements are arbitrary and could still be abused by the government to take away land from white owners for now we just need to acknowledge that racial tensions were high in a country which has been working hard to deal with its recent segregationist history the social justice communists made things much worse not better as is always the case as we saw last summer with the 1 billion in damages caused by the mostly peaceful blm riots racial conflict is an effective weapon for the elites to create chaos after all blm received most of its initial funding through the ford foundation and george soros open society foundation they are a fabricated movement built around false critical race theory claims but they are enough of a movement to enact violence on a nationwide scale covid lockdowns and vaccine totalitarianism the south african government s response to covid is brutal and ongoing the lockdowns are some of the most strict in the world with curfews zero gatherings indoors or outdoors alcohol bans and restrictions on travel through certain areas a large majority of the population has been blocked from participation in the normal economy the public has been awaiting economic relief for over a year but the hype and fear mongering around the delta variant has dashed all hope lockdowns returned in full force in june there is no evidence that the delta variant is as deadly or more deadly than the original iteration of covid and covid s overall ifr infection fatality rate is a paltry 0 26 according to the cdc and other independent studies meaning draconian lockdowns are still being implemented over a virus that 99 74 of people will easily survive riots in johannesburg and elsewhere erupted with over 200 dead and billions in property damage and theft in this case it is hard to outright condemn the looting because the government continues to block citizens from earning a living in the name of stopping covid this is on top of south africa s already high poverty level and the fact that unlike the us with its world reserve currency south africa does not have the same ability to print stimulus checks from thin air to placate the masses and hide the damage

president biden discusses the economic recovery at the white house on july 19 demetrius freeman the washington post washington a resurgence in coronavirus cases is threatening the biden administration s promises of a swift economic recovery with wall street getting battered early this past week and some leading forecasters beginning to rethink their extremely rosy projections the biden administration is closely monitoring the economic risks associated with the delta variant and senior u s officials have in recent days suggested local restrictions may have to be reimposed in response to the pandemic this virus doesn t have to hold you back any longer it doesn t have to hold our economy back any longer but the only way we put it behind us is if more americans get vaccinated president biden said last week as the vaccination campaign progressed through spring and summer the white house touted predictions that the u s economy would roar back to life as consumers quickly returned to pre pandemic spending biden has repeatedly stressed that the economy is set to grow at its fastest pace in almost four decades but the delta variant may challenge those heady expectations threatening the recovery along several dimensions the ongoing pandemic could dampen consumer spending if fears reemerge about the safety of returning to some activities the variant s proliferation abroad has already hurt u s supply chains and shortages could exacerbate inflation by increasing the price of production and a jump in hospitalizations and deaths among the unvaccinated poses a particular challenge for the biden administration in more conservative parts of the country where resistance to new restrictions is strong and federal relief aid is starting to expire these tensions played out in public this past week with biden emphasizing his infrastructure package the white house s first big non covid legislative priority amid headlines showing financial markets getting clobbered by renewed fears about the coronavirus our economy has come a long way over the past six months we can t slow down now biden said last monday s 726 point decline in the dow jones industrial average was the worst one day retreat in 2021 the s p and nasdaq also fell sharply among the hardest hit were sectors of the economy sensitive to virus related concerns such as hospitality leisure and travel the dow rebounded as the week progressed the index has climbed more than 13 over the past six months fears are in particular intensifying over whether the delta variant will hurt the global economy which could in turn complicate the u s recovery indonesia faces a catastrophic surge in the virus threatening to overwhelm its medical system british prime minister boris johnson went back into quarantine after his health secretary tested positive iran s government announced a week long lockdown in its capital cases globally have risen markedly since june the global economy is barely surviving on life support and another wave of infections may spur lockdowns that could signal the death knell for the tenuous recovery said peter essele head of investment management at the commonwealth financial network other leading analysts are also beginning to get nervous it s a serious threat no doubt about it said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics and one of the economic voices most trusted by the white house i haven t marked down my forecast yet but i m on the cusp of doing so economists diverge on the extent to which the delta variant poses a danger to the u s economy just under half of americans are vaccinated and the evidence is overwhelming that the vaccines prevent hospitalizations and deaths few people expect there to be the political appetite for renewing the kind of shutdowns that put the economy into a deep freeze at the pandemic s outset that will probably limit the amount of damage the delta variant can inflict on the economy even with the renewed concerns many economists stressed the u s economic growth outlook is stronger than it has been in years federal policymakers poured trillions of dollars in federal aid into the economy including biden s 1 9 trillion relief plan funding that is now propelling higher demand from consumers eager to resume normal life one senior biden administration official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking said officials still see key economic indicators such as frequency of flights and restaurant spending climbing back to pre pandemic levels white house press secretary jen psaki said monday that 99 5 of people who are being hospitalized or dying of covid are not vaccinated and she continued to urge more americans to get the shots she stressed that the administration remains confident in a swift economic recovery we certainly have seen the movements in the stock market we also know that unemployment is down economic growth is up job creation is up psaki said we can assure people we are still at war with the virus even if we have made progress over the last several months still major concerns persist already orders are delayed for months on furniture appliances and microchips and other home building and manufacturing supplies u s home builder confidence fell to an 11 month low in july largely because builders are struggling to get the materials they need the delays aren t just causing headaches they are forcing some builders to halt construction putting business and jobs at risk in the united states there is unlikely to be any supply chain relief until early next year at the earliest warns phil levy a former bush administration economist who is now chief economist at freight company flexport containers that were supposed to ship this spring are still sitting in many asian ports a recent coronavirus outbreak at the popular yantian port in china caused a massive backlog of containers more disruptions from the delta variant or another version of the virus could be even more problematic because the shipping industry is about to hit its peak time to move goods so they arrive in time for the all important holiday shopping season there s not relief right around the corner levy said this is rush hour all the time for moving goods around a little accident during rush hour has even bigger effects jason furman a former obama administration economist noted that the delta variant s spread across europe did not appear to lead to major declines in mobility trends a gauge of consumer patterns the rise of delta is potentially a human tragedy i don t expect it to be hugely consequential macroeconomically furman said the u s economy is going to grow strongly every quarter this year will it be a little less strong because of this maybe but i still expect economic growth to be above its pre pandemic the rest of this year and i don t think that changes that fundamental fact dean baker a liberal economist agreed that the impact of lingering coronavirus concerns would probably amount to tenths of a percentage point in terms of economic growth but he cautioned that this would not be true should a variant emerge that the existing vaccines do not fully protect against that possibility could upend the global economy creating major head winds in the united states we have been so cavalier about vaccinating the world and we could have done so by now that s the real danger baker said we have to take it very seriously the priority to get the whole world vaccinated as quickly as possible

saturday s ufc fight night main event between tj dillashaw and cory sandhagen lived up to the lofty expectations surrounding one of the most anticipated fights of the year dillashaw emerged victorious by split decision potentially setting himself up for a future shot to reclaim a title he never lost inside the cage but should his suspension for epo doping prevent dillashaw from being able to hop right back to the top after paying the price of two years in the prime of his career the main card was tight throughout with an additional majority decision and split decision among the results maycee barber claimed that split decision over miranda maverick and it was far from the clear victory she was after but was it enough to put barber back on the right track in her career finally on a night of top prospects two stood out dillashaw served his time now it s time for a title shot tj dillashaw right had one way to shift the focus from his suspension at least temporarily and that was by winning a big fight which he accomplished jeff bottari zuffa llc raimondi dillashaw cheated he injected himself with epo got caught was stripped of his ufc bantamweight title and was handed a two year suspension from usada dillashaw admitted he used the prohibited substance and that he did so in order to drop from bantamweight to flyweight that issue is likely to hang over dillashaw s head for the duration of his career every opponent will likely bring it up no one is saying that it should be forgotten or that dillashaw was treated unfairly he was not but he also served his time and after his performance saturday a split decision win over sandhagen dillashaw deserves another shot at the title he never lost in the octagon maybe that s an unpopular take but dillashaw s résumé as it stands now is arguably the best out of any bantamweight in mma history sandhagen was ranked no 3 in the division by espn the only men above him were aljamain sterling the champion and petr yan the next challenger and the former champ the math on that says one thing dillashaw put himself in pole position for the winner of that sterling yan title fight which is currently being targeted for october dillashaw was not perfect saturday night sandhagen had many positive moments some felt he was the rightful winner including judge derek cleary who scored the second fourth and fifth rounds for sandhagen but all the credit in the world has to be given to dillashaw who experienced zero ring rust he fought through a knee that sandhagen injured with a leglock attempt in the first round he fought through a bad bloody deep cut sandhagen opened up in the second round dillashaw was the fresher more active fighter late in the fight when dillashaw was suspended in 2019 he was the best bantamweight in the world two years have passed and his reputation has been forever damaged but the truth is dillashaw still might be able to stake that claim as the best in the world at 135 pounds in his next fight the polarizing scrapper should get the opportunity to prove or disprove that as for sandhagen he lost the fight but he s just 29 years old and was one or two big blows away from taking a victory home with him to colorado he doesn t lose much stock here the one problem he might face in the immediate future is that he has lost to dillashaw and sterling taking two of the top bantamweights in the world out of play for the time being a fight next against a fellow up and comer such as rob font could be very interesting barber gets an emotional victory but not a decisive one maycee barber left stopped a two fight skid with a razor thin decision victory over miranda maverick jeff bottari zuffa llc legaspi barber got the win she needed but definitely not the one she wanted after the first two losses of her career against roxanne modafferi and alexa grasso barber left the midwest and is now training under urijah faber at sacramento s team alpha male two judges saw her win the second and third rounds and that should get a lot of pressure off her back because she claimed herself to be the future of the 125 pound division and an 0 3 streak would have been devastating for that reputation she clearly took the third against maverick but the second was really close and the small crowd at the ufc apex showed surprise after hearing the official decision far from a robbery but it s still a split win against a prospect with less experience under the ufc banner that shouldn t be enough to get her back into the top 10 of the flyweight rankings barber did look a lot more relaxed during fight week and has a lot to learn in her new camp the results of that work will be visible in her next couple of appearances in the octagon she feels she recovered the joy in training for a fight and we ll have to see if the confident barber is back soon prospects show out play 0 52 adrian yanez stuns randy costa with round 2 tko adrian yanez forces the referee to stop the fight after pummeling randy costa with punches late in round 2 coppinger saturday night s action in las vegas featured some bright young ufc prospects but adrian yanez and nassourdine imavov shined brightest with a second round tko of randy costa in a brutal bantamweight clash yanez became the first man ever to win his first three ufc fights by knockout at 135 pounds and below the finish came courtesy of a sneaky right uppercut that floored costa before a flurry of strikes on the ground ended matters the stoppage was the 27 year old s seventh consecutive victory and now the texan appears on the brink of a meaningful opportunity but he wasn t the only one who stood out imavov delivered too with a second round tko of ian heinisch announcing his arrival as a fighter to watch at 185 pounds sure heinisch entered the octagon having lost three of his past four fights but all those defeats came via decision two of those setbacks came against top 10 light heavyweights derek brunson and kelvin gastelum so it s especially impressive that imavov was able to finish heinisch and with relative ease too a knee was the beginning of the end before the 25 year old connected on a plethora of punches along the cage forcing the referee to intervene imavov who was born in dagestan and now trains in france started boxing at age 10 and it showed the punches flowed seamlessly and the jab was pinpoint accurate throughout the fight imavov had to settle for a majority decision loss to phil hawes in february but after saturday s win he s once again one of the hottest prospects in the ufc training alongside heavyweight contender ciryl gane at the mma factory in france imavov is clearly ready for an even tougher test in his next outing in the octagon

economic voices most trusted by the white house i haven t marked down my forecast yet but i m on the cusp of doing so economists diverge on the extent to which the delta variant poses a danger to the u s economy just under half of americans are vaccinated and the evidence is overwhelming that the vaccines prevent hospitalizations and deaths few people expect there to be the political appetite for renewing the kind of shutdowns that put the economy into a deep freeze at the pandemic s outset that will probably limit the amount of damage the delta variant can inflict on the economy even with the renewed concerns many economists stressed the u s economic growth outlook is stronger than it has been in years federal policymakers poured trillions of dollars in federal aid into the economy including biden s 1 9 trillion relief plan funding that is now propelling higher demand from consumers eager to resume normal life one senior biden administration official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking said officials still see key economic indicators such as frequency of flights and restaurant spending climbing back to pre pandemic levels white house press secretary jen psaki said monday that 99 5 of people who are being hospitalized or dying of covid are not vaccinated and she continued to urge more americans to get the shots she stressed that the administration remains confident in a swift economic recovery we certainly have seen the movements in the stock market we also know that unemployment is down economic growth is up job creation is up psaki said we can assure people we are still at war with the virus even if we have made progress over the last several months still major concerns persist already orders are delayed for months on furniture appliances and microchips and other home building and manufacturing supplies u s home builder confidence fell to an 11 month low in july largely because builders are struggling to get the materials they need the delays aren t just causing headaches they are forcing some builders to halt construction putting business and jobs at risk in the united states there is unlikely to be any supply chain relief until early next year at the earliest warns phil levy a former bush administration economist who is now chief economist at freight company flexport containers that were supposed to ship this spring are still sitting in many asian ports a recent coronavirus outbreak at the popular yantian port in china caused a massive backlog of containers more disruptions from the delta variant or another version of the virus could be even more problematic because the shipping industry is about to hit its peak time to move goods so they arrive in time for the all important holiday shopping season there s not relief right around the corner levy said this is rush hour all the time for moving goods around a little accident during rush hour has even bigger effects jason furman a former obama administration economist noted that the delta variant s spread across europe did not appear to lead to major declines in mobility trends a gauge of consumer patterns the rise of delta is potentially a human tragedy i don t expect it to be hugely consequential macroeconomically furman said the u s economy is going to grow strongly every quarter this year will it be a little less strong because of this maybe but i still expect economic growth to be above its pre pandemic the rest of this year and i don t think that changes that fundamental fact dean baker a liberal economist agreed that the impact of lingering coronavirus concerns would probably amount to tenths of a percentage point in terms of economic growth but he cautioned that this would not be true should a variant emerge that the existing vaccines do not fully protect against that possibility could upend the global economy creating major head winds in the united states we have been so cavalier about vaccinating the world and we could have done so by now that s the real danger baker said we have to take it very seriously the priority to get the whole world vaccinated as quickly as possible
fourth generation mexican american writer james carlos blake delivers short fiction that s long on style and substance by jim carvalho borderlands short fictions by james carlos blake avon paper 12 50 james carlos blake s middle name isn t just a gimmick to garner border cred he was born with both in the autobiographical essay opening his fine new collection borderlands blake outlines this colorful family history robert blake the author s great great great grandfather was an englishman who fathered a child in new hampshire before heading to the gulf of mexico to become a pirate he was captured and executed by the mexican government in 1826 his son john blake became u s consul to the mexican state of jalisco he liked the country stuck around and established a successful mill named hacienda americana which was run by the family until the revolution of 1910 john blake fathered three sons before being stabbed to death on the steps of a church one of those sons carlos married a creole a mexican of pure spanish blood and was the quintessential patrón one of carlos sons juan married a creole and was a colonel in the mexican army one of juan s sons carlos was a civil engineer who built roads all over northern mexico and married a mexican girl from brownsville texas their first child james carlos blake was born in tampico and raised in texas the family later moved to florida not surprisingly blake s family history has had a profound effect on his writing style and his choice of subject and setting blake first placed himself on the literary map with two acclaimed historical novels the pistoleer and the friends of pancho villa his third novel in the rogue blood is an unabashed homage to cormac mccarthy s blood meridian it also won the los angeles times book prize for fiction blake once said he wanted to write the most violent book in american literature and with blood he may have succeeded a fourth novel red grass river a legend also garnered critical praise now a resident of el paso blake describes himself as an outsider neither mexican nor american but a product of that nebulous third country the borderlands between the u s and mexico his writings are packed with the influences of that region especially noteworthy is his command of regional language whether it comes from a sonoran hacienda or a brownsville barrio an orange grove or a boxing ring the stories in borderlands are narrated by a gang of characters from different places geographically culturally and historically and blake pulls off their integration with aplomb under the sierra is a comic depiction of rural mexican life involving an earthquake a lost old man and a pulque bash referee and runaway horses share the common theme of revenge referee is a contemporary saga of the strained long term friendship between two barrio boxers runaway horses is about a patrón who sustains his miserable existence with grandiose plans of revenge against the men who destroyed his family in referee the revenge is sweet in runaway horses it s anything but three tales of the revolution and la vida loca are strikingly similar structurally and best display blake s mastery of the very short story la vida loca was originally titled small times and that is the better title especially now that ricky martin has turned the phrase la vida loca into a cliché aliens in the garden and the house of esperanza are so similar they could be chapters of a longer story both are tales of illegal mexican immigrants their arduous journeys from texas to the agricultural fields of florida and the sometimes comic sometimes tragic results of ignorance but the true ace in this deck of high cards is the novella texas woman blues which chronicles the rough life of the tragically doomed dolores stock dolores is tough sexy enterprising tenacious and as colorfully complex as the female leads in jim harrison s best novellas and she s utterly believable academic feminist types may bristle at some of dolores confessions but they ll get over it dolores is just too compelling the climax of texas woman blues contains what may be the most beautifully written and grimly enthralling depiction of violence ever conceived its impact on the reader will dispel any concerns about dolores having taken the easy way out and because blake s deft hand forces us to invest so much in dolores the final grisly act is all the more powerful emotionally blake s borderlands are gritty and glorious and his borderlands collection is a work of brilliant style and remarkable substance texas woman blues alone is worth the price of admission

her brother drunk it out of fear and desperation this is what she repeated over and over again to all the journalists that interviewed her gloria ríos lost her brother juan andrés ríos 51 years old on august 11th 2020 after he drunk chlorine dioxide in the town of san pedro in the province of jujuy according to gloria her brother bought the substance from someone in town that promoted it on social media as a miraculous cure for different illnesses chlorine dioxide is not authorized as medication in argentina by the national administration of drugs foods and medical devices anmat as for the spanish acronym or any other food regulatory agency in the world to treat coronavirus or any other disease even though it is promoted by journalists and celebrities see box or even representatives of the national congress while the substance is not authorized it s sold anyway it s promoted by people that present themselves as alleged bishops and leaders of a church who have open court cases even politicians and influencers promote something that can be deadly chlorine dioxide is a derivative of sodium chlorite a chemical substance used as bleach in paper and textile industries water treatments and as disinfectant for inert surfaces however it s been promoted for years as a cure for several diseases like cancer malaria and als among others and it s sold illegally in argentina and all over the world in the peak of the covid 19 pandemic and due to its uncertainty chlorine dioxide is sold to hundreds of people every day who are distressed and like gloria s brother fall into the scam juan andrés ríos family explained that he developed an allergy for drinking chlorine dioxide the doctors told the family that his glottis closed and he died of bronchoaspiration he never took a pcr test and there was never an official confirmation that he had coronavirus in fact after he passed away all the people that lived with him got tested and their results came back negative however out of fear and desperation in the middle of a pandemic ríos decided to buy chlorine dioxide and drink it we know that people that sell these substances that promise to be cures or miraculous salvations like almost all conspiracy myths start from a fact but from there they drift into completely unreal situations the truth is that chlorine dioxide is a disinfectant due to its strong antioxidant power said aldo saracco toxicologist member of the scientific committee of the argentine toxicology association ata and member of the ibero american society of environmental health if we apply it in vitro in a laboratory experience it destroys every organic substance by harming its protein cover that s how it destroys bacteria and viruses as well as any other cells healthy or sick generally and randomly when we apply it in vivo to a person it does the exact same thing it denatures viruses and bacteria as well as any other cells with which it comes into contact that s how it harms normal protein structures in the digestive tract or at the blood and the rest of the body added saracco this means that chlorine dioxide destroys the virus and the body at the same time without differentiating who s behind the selling of this substance in argentina the number of offers and prices in argentina is surprising chlorine dioxide is offered in different formats bottles of 250 ml and packs of 5 l that cost between 700 and 7000 the equivalent of around us 7 to us 70 if one would rather make it at home kits which include chlorine dioxide and the activator hydrochloric or citric acid cost between 600 and 3500 the equivalent of around us 6 and us 36 prices rise if the kit includes the pipette for preparation or reactive stripes and it also varies according to the material of the packaging plastic or pet glass like argentina mexico and colombia don t have a homogeneous profile of chlorine dioxide suppliers and since it s not authorized or regulated by any health authorities there is no homogenization in relation to how or how much should be taken dealers often boast of following formulas and instructions from andreas kalcker s official website a german pseudoscientist that defines himself as the creator of the chlorine dioxide solution cds a substance based on the miracle mineral solution mms such is the case of máximo from mendoza who sends by e mail a copy of kalcker s book forbidden health with every product he sells guidelines to prepare the product other sellers include explanatory videos many sellers however know that they are dealing with a controversial substance like a dietitian in cordoba who doesn t promote it on social media but admits to sell it on whatsapp another dietitian in martinez province of buenos aires is careful and asks how someone got their phone number before providing information they claim to sell natural products on facebook but once you gain their confidence they d admit to offer cds although they clarify that they are out of stock chequeado doesn t mention the names of these places or any other chlorine dioxide sellers in this article to avoid the diffusion of substances that are not authorized by the anmat since we contacted them as potential buyers to prove how easy it is to buy this toxic substance and we didn t identify ourselves as journalists seller profiles vary stella in mar del plata who has a profile picture of the stars makes the chlorine dioxide herself but is very careful with the information she shares she will give advice via whatsapp but she doesn t send protocols or deliver her products with the tag on we need to be very careful she admits on a voice note similar cases were found in dissimilar places like recoleta in the city of buenos aires and paraná in the province of entre ríos the business network crosses borders let me send you the number of our distributer in argentina quickly suggests a seller with a colombian phone number hidden behind the name water of life a euphemism used for chlorine dioxide they clarify that they use that euphemism because facebook deletes any mention of that substance when consulted by chequeado facebook representatives confirmed to delete any content related to covid 19 that can cause imminent physical harm like consuming chlorine dioxide false prevention measures and claims that deny the existence of the virus this applies to both the organic content and the ads for this they combine technology human revision and community reports although many supporters of this chemical substance know that they are being watched they still take advantage of new technologies like rodolfo from tucuman who specifies that delivery orders are shipped nationwide from the laboratory of the pharmacy and payment methods include mercado pago bank transfer bank deposit or pago fácil in mexico and colombia dealers even offer to send the package via uber or didi if buyers are in the same city for the hundreds of people that consume this substance there are various groups in whatsapp telegram and facebook that explain how to make it or drink it according to one s illness and medical history this is why dealers also offer training courses classes are given on zoom all year long and cost us 30 when clients have doubts about the product some sellers try to persuade them of its benefits you need to decide if you d rather have the tv on or make cds it s up to you how easily influenced you are and how much fear they put on you advises gabriel when asked about the risks of drinking it outside social media a simple google search shows that there are many websites available that sell the substance secretly one of those sites which chequeado won t reveal the identity of sells the product in argentina and claims to be managed by an argentine researcher that has over 50 internet domains registered destined to sell the same substance in peru this argentine assures to be part of sinergia 8 a group that asserts to include researchers doctors and therapists from many south american countries that in the last ten years have researched alternative protocols for real and permanent cures his youtube channel was deleted for breaking the platform s rules while on his facebook page where he has more than 1 000 followers he shares testimonies of people that drunk chlorine dioxide and posts about the benefits of the substance according to cdsperu net kalcker is a member of one of the groups that are part of sinergia 8 chequeado confirmed that at least one of the phone numbers available on the page that offer cds is in the province of mendoza a person on the other side of the line recommended to get in touch with the world coalition for health and life comusav as for the spanish acronym an organization that gathers doctors and health professionals and that aims to awaken the conscience of all people according to its website and that offers free advice for coronavirus cases the representative of this group in argentina is fabiana guastavino who openly declares that more and more doctors and politicians drink dioxide see box some of them however are already facing legal problems the head of mms com ar another website that sells kits to produce this substance leonardo daniel binello was denounced by lawyer victor catillejo arias before the ufima agency unidad fiscal para la investigación de delitos contra el medio ambiente which investigates medical crimes chlorine dioxide prophets facebook groups are full of images of kalcker but who is he his full name is andreas ludwig kalcker on his website he calls himself a biophysical researcher his title was certified as doctor of philosophy in alternative medicine and natural biophysics by the open university of advanced sciences a naturist university accused of selling titles online the university has an address in barcelona and a fiscal address in miami it detaches itself on its website from kalcker and assures that it doesn t have any links to the church genesis ii or supports the medical or therapeutic use of mms settled in switzerland kalcker published two books cds health is possible and forbidden health he claims to begin promoting chlorine dioxide after drinking it himself to cure his arthritis his record is not spotless in 2012 while he was in ibiza giving another one of his talks to promote and sell mms he was detained by the spanish civil guard for an alleged crime against public health he usually gives conferences about its benefits even in universities and he also visited argentina in december 2019 months before the lockdown started in argentina kalcker gave a conference at the bauen hotel and another one at the cyan hotel de las americas both located in the city of buenos aires about oxigenative therapies tickets were between us 25 and us 100 per person depending on the day and the conference he also has legal problems in argentina last august he was denounced by castillejo arias before the fiscal public ministry where the legal complaint was ratified in mid january before the national criminal and federal correctional court no 4 preceded by federal judge ariel lijo the criminal investigation accuses kalcker and other argentines of allegedly selling and distributing chlorine dioxide as part of the case last march a clandestine laboratory was found and raided in mar del plata by order of judge lijo representatives of lijo s courtroom confirmed to chequeado that so far there are four defendants in the investigation tasks are also being performed in two different addresses and during the last raid kalcker s books were seized which the defendant used to sell businessbishop ilustraciones alina najlis y santiago quintero among the sellers of chlorine dioxide one person stands out luis enrique garcía who introduces himself as a bishop and the only authorized distributer he offers his sacrament via email but the price changes if it s for personal or family use and if it s sold in combo packs or with the activator hydrochloric acid parcels can be delivered by post and payment options include bank transfers or mercado pago regardless garcía is careful he clarifies that for obvious reasons he doesn t use ecclesiastic tags on his products anymore and that his bottles are wrapped in a white paper without mentioning the genesis ii church that he claims to represent the genesis ii church of health and healing was founded by jim humble the creator of mms and mark grenon the church s leader who retired in 2017 grenon and his son were arrested and extradited in colombia and sent to miami under the request of the american justice department accused of making promoting and selling tens of thousands of bottles containing the miracle mineral solution as a treatment against several diseases like autism malaria and cancer they know they re crossing the line as soon as you open the website a disclaimer warns people about the substance being forbidden attention mms and cds are forbidden by the anmat and the fda the information on this site was published before the prohibition and for the people that want to contribute with the incarcerated bishops we do not sell mms cds or any elements to make them do not insist another disclaimer reads attention mms and cds were forbidden by the anmat in argentina and the fda in the united states its use is not authorized in human beings the information on this site was published before the prohibition the website includes several tags with protocols depending on the disease and user experiences and questions about the consumption of chlorine dioxide which date back to 2011 where can i buy mms in the city or the province of buenos aires asked a user named roberto on may 27th 2011 hi roberto you can buy it in the city of buenos aires or in merlo province of san luis argentina you can also collect it yourself we can do whatever is more convenient for you once you buy it we ll send you the details by post stay healthy luis in other parts of latin america the church is also represented according to the chilean website el dinamo for example this church has at least two bishops and over 200 ministers chequeado tried to contact garcía as journalists but at the time of publication hadn t received any answers when health is put on trial as vendors proliferate so do deaths juan andrés ríos wasn t the only one after his death in august 2020 the country was in a state of shock by the death of a five year old boy in plottier province of neuquén after ingesting chlorine dioxide according to the hospital s chief medical officer rafael palomino the boy s parents confessed to have given him the substance as a precaution the medical report confirmed that the boy died due to multiple organ failure and that results concur with the ingestion of chlorine dioxide the public fiscal ministry explained to chequeado that more complementary studies were requested although as of the date of this publication no one had been put under arrest for this death five months later in january 2021 chlorine dioxide was once again on the public agenda this time it was due to a controversial intervention of the justice department as a precautionary measure judge javier pico terrero head of the federal civil and commercial court n 7 authorized treatment with chlorine dioxide for a critically ill 93 year old patient of the sanatorio otamendi who passed away after receiving the substance the family s lawyer martín sarubbi confirmed that the autopsy and histopathology report i e an analysis of the tissues had already been done but there is one complementary study left before confirming the cause of death after a lot of back and forth between the justice department and the sanatorio otamendi neurosurgeon dante converti administered the substance to oscar garcía rúa however the doctor is now in the middle of an open investigation of the ministry of health that found several irregularities when someone takes an illegal substance who prescribes it who sells it where can we find it those are the questions said santiago palma pharmacists biochemist and researcher of the national scientific and technical research council conicet as for the spanish acronym to chequeado it s different when there s a petition for judiciary protection that requests a legal treatment that s not covered by any health insurance because in that particular case the treatment is approved and can therefore be found legally if through the judicialization of medical treatments a judge promotes the ingestion of an unapproved substance then it will have to be purchased illegally because there aren t any safe places where to buy it he added an unauthorized substance argentina s national administration of drugs foods and medical devices anmat as for the spanish acronym confirmed to chequeado to have deleted over 700 ads in mercado libre within the framework of an agreement with the platform valid since 2012 but this isn t enough chequeado identified several facebook groups that exchange chlorine dioxide dealers numbers which are promoted between the users chlorine dioxide is not authorized as a medical treatment by the anmat or any other regulatory agency in the world because there s no evidence of its efficiency according to a number of regulatory and scientific bodies in argentina like the anmat the argentina society of infectious diseases and the argentine toxicology association and the rest of the world like the pan american health organization the spanish agency of medicines and medical devices and the u s food drug administration taking chlorine dioxide can irritate the esophagus and stomach and cause abdominal pain nausea vomits diarrhoea and severe intoxication which may include severe hematologic cardiovascular and renal disorders as well as breathing complications like chronic bronchitis and dental erosion bolivia is the only country that authorized it in a way the plurinational legislative assembly alp as for the spanish acronym approved a law that allowed the production commercialization distribution and use of chlorine dioxide to prevent and treat covid 19 which was promulgated by the president of the alp despite multiple observations presented by the executive power regarding the lack of scientific evidence former bolivian minister of health edgar pozo considered the substance to be permissible as alternative medicine however nowadays or until april 22nd 2021 chlorine dioxide is no longer in the health records of the bolivian state agency for medicines and health technologies the substance is used worldwide as bleach in paper and textile industries water purifier in water treatments and disinfectant in inert surfaces according to the united states environmental protection agency epa chlorine dioxide should not exceed its maximum residual disinfectant level of 0 8 mg l in water otherwise it s no longer fit for human consumption however in the mms the amount recommended by protocols is 200 times more than the maximum daily intake explained patricia lucero to chequeado biochemist specialized in toxicology a legal biochemist of the faculty of chemical sciences and member of the argentine toxicology association in argentina chlorine dioxide is approved as a surface disinfectant chemical agent generally of the food industry ed like bleach and other chlorine derivatives for that specific use only and it s regulated by the anmat but its ingestion is clearly and absolutely contraindicated this is the same recommendation made for any other chemical substances just like it s recommended not to drink fuel bleach or the silical gel that comes in shoe boxes or purses because they are not fit for human consumption explained saracco it s very hard to have a fleet of inspectors available that s only done after complaints if the substance s clandestine it s very hard to find because we don t know how it s being made and produced all medications have to be explicitly approved after clinical trials designed for a specific use if it s not authorized then it s forbidden concluded ignacio maglio head of the department of legal medical risks for muñiz hospital and coordinator promotion of rights for huésped foundation on facebook many users that consume and promote this toxic substance argue that they d been taken it for years and it doesn t affect them because according to them it s not toxic and it s a disinfectant many of those videos mention posts that have nothing to do with the potential therapeutic efficiency but its use as a substance in this case a disinfectant therefore there isn t a solid pharmacological hypothesis that would make us think that it can be used as medicine besides its consumption can have toxic effects said palma to chequeado the argument that they give is that if it works in vitro it should work in vivo or even worst if it worked for me without any clinical trials it works this is extremely dangerous when something that isn t clinically valid becomes popular many people would quit conventional scientifically approved treatments to use other allegedly miraculous cures that a group of people claim to have benefited from it is not a clinical study it s not scientific concluded palma juan andrés ríos fell for the scam he belongs to the long list of people that are deceived daily with miraculous cures meanwhile science is tirelessly trying to develop proven and tested solutions for coronavirus and other illnesses in the desperation of finding a quick solution people like gloria s brother fall for disinformation that taking advantage of fear and uncertainty can become even more harmful for their

professor stephen reicher a behavioural expert from the university of st andrews said additional support could be put in place as well as just asking people to try to keep in the fresh air as much as possible speaking on bbc radio scotland yesterday he said it could be part of proportionate measures to keep levels of the virus down such as wearing face masks in crowded places and social distancing where possible there should be much more i think support for ventilation that could take various forms he said so for instance in belgium they are talking about putting co2 monitors which tell you whether you need to ventilate or not in public buildings in new york they are talking about putting air purifiers in every school room so we could be doing much more to ventilate and to help people with ventilation reicher who is a member of the scientific advisory group for emergencies sage subcommittee on behavioural science also warned the focus on the so called pingdemic was treating the symptom as the cause the reason why there are a lot of pings is because we are in contact with a lot of people who are infected he said and the reason why we are in contact with a lot of people who are infected is because infection rates are so high yesterday it emerged around 50 000 people stopped using scotland s covid tracking app in july which now has around 902 000 users reicher said it was true that people are deleting the app but argued most people were being sensible and cautious yes it is concerning but the danger is if you overstate the extent to which people are not complying it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy he said people begin to think well if no one else is doing it why should i do it so i think it is important to point out that overall actually the population are following the science the population are seeing the risks and the population are being careful and yesterday scotland recorded a further 11 coronavirus deaths with the number of people in intensive care with covid also increasing another 1307 new cases of the virus were also confirmed in the previous 24 hours before yesterday morning with 6 1 of tests coming back positive there were 60 people in intensive care with the virus on friday a rise of three from the previous day s total however the number of people in hospital with recently confirmed covid 19 was down from 502 on thursday to 478 the figures also show that 3 994 883 people in scotland have now received the first dose of a covid vaccination with 3 064 441 having had both jabs mps have warned taxpayers will be facing the costs of covid for decades while an inquiry will not come quickly enough to learn the lessons needed from the pandemic two reports from the commons public accounts committee pac said the taxpayer would be exposed to significant financial risks for decades to come and already the estimated cost of the government measures had reached 372 billion while the committee also remains concerned that despite spending over 10bn on supplies the ppe stockpile is not fit for purpose the pac said that as of may this year out of 32 billion items of ppe ordered by the department of health and social care some 11bn had been distributed while 12 6bn are stored in the uk as central stock some 8 4bn on order from other parts of the world have still not arrived in the uk but mps were concerned the stockpile was costing around 6 7 million a week to store with potential waste levels unacceptably high meanwhile health secretary sajid javid said he has made a full recovery after testing positive for covid
president joe biden waves during his walk to marine one on the south lawn of the white house on july 21 washington post photo by demetrius freeman washington the rapid increase in coronavirus infections driven by the delta variant over the past month is turning the country s attention back to the pandemic and threatening to subsume president joe biden s agenda just as the white house and its allies hoped to move on from the virus and focus on promoting the administration s other accomplishments inside the white house top officials are growing increasingly anxious about the state of the pandemic and are gravely concerned about the situation spiraling out of control in some areas of the country with low vaccination rates according to two people who work in the administration and two others in close touch with the white house biden s team had always expected to see additional coronavirus outbreaks but the white house assumed the increases in infections would be mounds and not peaks according to one top administration official who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal private discussions officials are now looking at models that predict anywhere from a few thousand new covid cases to more than 200 000 every day in the fall one new forecast also estimates the united states could see three times the number of daily deaths from the coronavirus by october compared to now the current seven day average is about 250 deaths per day stock markets have already shown jitters over the variant with the dow slumping more than 700 points monday before rallying later in the week globally hospitals are filling up including in the united kingdom which is experiencing an outbreak so severe that the united states warned against traveling there if you have hundreds of thousands of americans getting sick that s problematic for any president said cornell belcher who was one of former president barack obama s pollsters it does become all consuming for the president because he s the president more focus on covid leaves the president fewer opportunities to sell the stimulus package that congress approved earlier this year or travel the country pressuring lawmakers to back his infrastructure plan other priorities that risk being squeezed include shoring up voting rights a policing overhaul gun control and new immigration rules biden s cnn town hall this week was dominated by questions about the virus a marked change from his first formal news conference during which the pandemic did not come up at all americans are growing more concerned about the state of the pandemic in an axios ipsos poll conducted july 16 19 39 of americans said that returning to their pre coronavirus life right now would be a risk up from 28 in late june the white house has sought to place blame elsewhere with biden accusing social media platforms of killing people by allowing misinformation to spread on their platforms and allies have pointed out that the biggest infections increases are coming in republican led states another way of deflecting from the administration top officials say biden isn t going to let up from his push for vaccinations and controlling the pandemic even he works to make a spending deal with congress getting the pandemic under control protecting americans from the spread of the virus has been continues to be his number one priority white house press secretary jen psaki said thursday it will continue to be his priority moving forward there s no question one white house official who was not authorized to speak publicly said administration health experts don t expect hospitalizations or deaths to reach the same levels seen during the height of the pandemic the white house has also been heartened that in recent weeks vaccination rates have risen faster than the national average in some states with high infection rates such as nevada and florida the person said still the delta variant surge is a serious enough threat that top white house officials and other administration officials are debating whether to urge vaccinated americans to wear masks in more settings people familiar with the discussion said this past week top white house aide mike donilon told reporters that the virus has been a primary focus from the time he came into office and hasn t let up he hasn t taken his eye off the ball there donilon said and he sought to cast biden s spending proposals as part of the covid response these investments that he s proposing will make a big difference in terms of pushing forward donilon said he has a lot on his plate and he s fully focused on all of this still the president s allies and top advisers have also been clear that they want to draw attention to other parts of his agenda including making a strong case for the infrastructure proposals via amped up travel and events in his call with reporters donilon walked through a slide show aimed at promoting biden s infrastructure proposals when people focus on how this agenda is paid for support for it actually increases donilon said it also rises as they learn more and more about the individual components top officials at unite the country a pro biden super pac warned donors and surrogates earlier this month that focus groups with swing state voters revealed that even many biden supporters know little about his accomplishments there is a real lack of information about the specifics of the biden agenda according to a memo from the super pac that was obtained by the washington post there is a need to communicate with voters even among high information biden supporters according to the memo there wasn t a ton of knowledge about the components of the biden plans the memo issued before the delta variant spread widely didn t directly mention covid but there was one nod to a possible political benefit of a raging virus since 1992 the sitting president has avoided significant midterm losses just twice in 1998 and 2002 and in both cases it was because the president was able to harness energy around a national crisis to remain popular according to the memo indeed voters give biden high marks for his handling of the coronavirus crisis and they re more comfortable with his performance there than on other issues such as his handling of the economy or immigration biden consistently sees higher ratings on his handling of the pandemic than his overall approval sixty six percent of americans say he s doing a good job handling the coronavirus according to a recent cbs news yougov poll in the same poll 58 of respondents approve of his performance as president if anything when covid is not on the agenda when people are not focused on covid his numbers tend to settle a little bit because people think who would be better on the next thing said celinda lake a democratic pollster who did work for biden s presidential campaign still republicans see the next phase of the pandemic as a potential weakness for the president the biggest thing that the average person knew was that everything was going to be over by july 4 said corry bliss a republican strategist now we re a couple weeks past july 4 and the message from the white house is we have no idea what s going on bliss said the white house looks lost and message less they declared mission accomplished and the new slogan should be mission incompetence bliss said the only part of getting back to normal was the vaccine rollout which was a direct result of the trump administration and operation warp speed it s unclear that they ve done a single thing to advance the ball on covid biden targeted the fourth of july as his goal for when the country would begin to mark our independence from this virus as he put it in march and americans could safely gather in small groups in may as millions of americans were vaccinated the cdc changed their guidance to say vaccinated people could shed masks in most circumstances the mood at the white house was jubilant as the president and staff removed their masks and celebrated the country s progress in curtailing the virus as july fourth approached however administration officials nervously watched as the delta variant wreaked havoc in countries around the world the president still gave a victory speech of sorts on independence day declaring the virus is on the run and america is coming back but officials familiar with the planning of the event said the speech was toned down to reflect the uncertainty around the variant biden s overall low key approach to the virus worries observers taking a longer view of his presidency douglas brinkley a presidential historian noted that franklin delano roosevelt traveled nonstop when he was president despite a physical disability why can t biden be more mobile and out there talking to people no president can be above the fray in a pandemic brinkley also said that biden s first six months in office became dominated by a swirl of non covid issues including voting rights and infrastructure there came a false sense of security on the covid front brinkley said people will think in history that biden needed to be doing regular addresses to the american public that this was such a large emergency with so many deaths on the line that he need to be beating the drum more forcefully biden may have a chance to rectify this stance in the fall experts have cautioned that the delta variant which first emerged in india and now represents more than 83 of u s coronavirus cases is far more transmissible than prior strains of the virus leading to a sharp uptick in new infections the daily average of confirmed coronavirus cases has roughly quadrupled in the past month from about 11 000 per day in late june to 44 011 now according to the washington post s seven day average of coronavirus cases variant linked cases also have fueled a 59 increase in hospitalizations in florida and a 76 increase in louisiana in the past week disproportionately among unvaccinated americans it is one of the most infectious respiratory viruses we know of and that i have seen in my 20 year career centers for disease control and prevention director rochelle walensky told reporters on thursday urging holdout americans to get vaccinated only about 49 of all americans have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus according to the post s tracking the covid 19 scenario modeling hub a research consortium that incorporates analysis from johns hopkins university columbia university and other academic teams also released new projections this week that account for the delta variant s potential spread the models incorporate factors such as vaccination levels and the speed at which the virus is spreading under one particularly dire projection the resurgent outbreak would peak in october with roughly 240 000 new cases per day and 4 000 deaths across the united states bleak numbers roughly on par with the outbreak that biden inherited in january while i think it s possible things could get that bad i don t think it s likely said justin lessler a university of north carolina professor who has helped coordinate the models we d never reach that worst case scenario because we would react we don t just tend to sit there and wait to die lessler said that the research hub s consensus projection is that cases will peak in october at around 60 000 cases per day but he cautioned that projection was based on data collected before the recent surge of variant linked cases the last two weeks have been quite bad compared to where we were thinking lessler added i worry and maybe think that it s going to be slightly worse than our consensus projection based on trends michael osterholm director of the center for infectious disease research and policy at the university of minnesota and an epidemiologist who served on biden s coronavirus advisory board during the transition said that he and his team had reviewed kaiser family foundation data on how many americans are still at risk for the spreading virus we still come up with 100 million people in this country who have not been vaccinated nor have they had covid 19 and retain lingering immunity osterholm said that is more than enough human wood for this coronavirus forest fire to burn and that s going to happen the washington post s anne gearan and emily guskin contributed to this report white house press secretary jen psaki said battling covid remains president joe biden s number one priority during a press briefing at the white house on july 23 washington post photo by demetrius freeman

mercurial it doesn t want to cooperate i have to taste it constantly and keep stirring 7 10 and counting down let s put in the truffle he is still tasting the risotto it s still a little al dente faraon pours on some more seafood broth praying it will get done in time gourdet has been working on the crabmeat let s put the crab on first then the caviar and the grand finale to symbolize greed faraon sprinkles gold leaf lavishly around the dish 5 4 3 2 1 hands up the judges send the contestants out of the room and savor the dishes slowly while they discuss the final verdict the judges comment on the risotto could have used a little more seasoning a different plate to showcase all of the ingredients a little more cooking to get all of the kernels or rice done but overall an excellent dish but when the scales of fortune are weighed it is the vegan dish that takes the day rodney laments i join the list of chefs who have succumbed to the risotto curse and he says he knew when he had a vegan chef as his opponent it would be tough because to get this far they have to be excellent chefs faraon says he was glad the challenge worked out the way it did if i d gotten the radish like the previous episode i don t know what i would have done but when he got this particular seven sins challenge he knew he could create a narrative around an idea he says he chose risotto based on an experience he had in a previous life i was sitting across the table from a very wealthy man and we didn t speak each other s language so it was mostly grunts and looks over food he decided risotto was clearly an expensive food he needed to pay attention to faraon explains one of the judges makes dishes that are simple but well executed i knew i had to do this without a mistake while faraon concentrated on the risotto he says greg is a great chef and he was giving me advice about what else to put in as well as tips on technique i wanted to add cream but he suggested mascarpone which we added at the end to add creaminess looking back faraon says it could have used more liquid but it tasted great all things meshed well together he says gourdet was skeptical about putting the caviar and truffles together but the balance was just right and gregory was pushing me to use more salt faraon explains that he has cut back on salt in his own cooking but one difference between home chefs and restaurant chefs is that restaurants use more seasoning that s what makes them great chefs right when he isn t at his day job as a partner and chief creative officer at an international intelligence consulting company he is cooking new cuisines to discover what kind of flavors different cultures love i feel like i got a lot of intellectual curiosity from my time at the cia one of the great things about living in this area is that we are beyond the culinary renaissance there are so many great chefs
bloomberg investors bullish on the u k pound have gotten used to brushing off concerns about covid 19 infections and the post brexit future now a sudden rethink on the global recovery is bringing those worries back into focus sterling is on course for its first back to back monthly declines versus the dollar since march 2020 when the coronavirus became a pandemic and spurred turbulence in

in containing covid 19 based on the proportion of fully inoculated people the weekly change in vaccine distribution and the rolling seven day average of new infections renewed skittishness about brexit is adding to the mix the european union s refusal to renegotiate the deal governing northern ireland has put the bloc on a fresh collision course with the u k as johnson s government warns it

swings in the pound heading into the meeting lifting the currency s implied two week volatility to its highest level since early may while policy makers have been sending mixed signals dovish comments this last week from the boe s jonathan haskel and catherine mann triggered the biggest rally in favor of euro calls in five months we don t buy into that positive outlook for rates and so we feel that support for the pound will disappear said john roe head of multi asset funds at legal general in london with covid numbers and economic activity still somewhat subdued more hawkish policy would be very hard to follow through on yet there are signs that the pound could be near a turning point especially if the bank of england tightens rates faster than its peers money markets are pricing in a

in his best selling book ten lessons for a post pandemic world farid zakaria makes an interesting point he says that since the early 1990s global inequality had been showing a marked decline both between countries and between people in a particular country this he says was caused in large part by sustained economic progress in china india and other developing countries which grew much faster than developed countries narrowing the gap and lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty globally the number of people in extreme poverty dropped from 1 90 billion in 1990 to 650 million in 2018 he regrets however that with covid 19 much of this progress could be reversed we can see this regression playing out in india with the contraction of the economy massive job losses and ruinous medical expenditures it has been estimated that as many as 220 million people in india have dropped below the poverty line in the last 18 months adding to the almost 200 million already there this has wiped out the gains of the last two decades in combating inequality but there have been huge gainers during and because of the pandemic high tech firms e commerce entities pharmaceutical and serum production companies pathology labs hospitals and nursing homes in india this gain has come with the added and familiar flavour of cronyism the latest bloomberg billionaire index revealed that ms ambani adani and four other indian billionaires added us 44 75 billion to their wealth in the first half of 2021 when the vast majority of the population was simply struggling to survive the sensex which adequately represents that 1 of our population which owns 54 of all wealth in the country rose more than 11000 points during the pandemic from 41 385 on 1 1 2020 to 52 445 on 1 7 2021 there is more good news according to the swiss national bank deposits by indians in swiss banks which were rs 6625 crores in 2019 went up to rs 20 700 crores during the pandemic it was business as usual for big capital and should have been good news except for a couple of factors this grotesque inequity obscene islands of prosperity in a sea of penury and misery represents what noam chomsky the american philosopher terms the face of savage neo liberalism he goes on to state that the script of this has been dictated to governments by their corporate masters and that authoritarian states are quite compatible with neo liberalism this fits in squarely with the economic policies adopted by the nda government both before and during the pandemic the government by the admission of its own finance minister is in dire straits it has told the supreme court it has no money to compensate for covid deaths or to implement the swaminathan formula for payment of msp to farmers it has no money to pay its employees the arrears of the three da instalments it had frozen last year it has no money to disburse cash relief to those rendered unemployed by the pandemic it can extend only credit guarantees and not subsidies to millions of suffering msmes and small traders and she is not wrong gst has failed to live up to its promises the guaranteed gst compensation to states is in huge arrears and central tax revenues as a percentage of gdp has declined from 10 1 in 2013 14 to 9 9 in 2020 21 in such circumstances what would any sane economist expect a government to do to make up for these losses tax the profits of corporates and the windfall wealth of our billionaires and millionaires right wrong our government is doing just the reverse under the garb of ease of doing business which is a fig leaf for rank cronyism the government is introducing policies which blatantly enrich corporations while the fiscal burden is passed on to the common man in 2019 it reduced corporate taxes losing annual revenues of rs 200 000 crores this was an inexplicable decision because as aunindyo chakrabarty points out in an article in the tribune in the last ten years the share of corporate tax in the total tax receipts has gone down from 36 to 23 while that of indirect taxes has gone up from 45 to 53 as any economist even one educated in nagpur will tell you the higher the contribution of indirect taxes to an economy the more inequitable it is the justification was that the companies would invest these savings in increasing production this as expected never happened the money was used to clear balance sheets or squirrelled away in some foreign tax haven thereafter the pandemic provided the perfect opportunity to further enrich the corporates interest rates were kept deliberately low to help industry and divert savings to stock markets whereas the middle classes were forced to witness a sharp drop in their fixed deposit rates capital gains taxes from shares were also kept low benefitting the big investors and the handful of companies which control the bourses labour laws were quietly amended in order to reduce their security of service and bring them in line eia environmental impact assessment rules were amended to make it easier to set up industry at the cost of the environment without even an eia approval farm laws to corporatise agriculture were promulgated in the middle of the second wave of covid hoping this insidious move would go unnoticed disinvestment proposals are being floated on a large scale rs 200 000 crore estimated receipts in this fiscal knowing fully well that we are in a recession quotes will be depressed and there are only a few buyers in the market the predictable result will be that the same favoured cabal of corporates will corner these public assets at throwaway prices the writing off of corporate npas has become an industry in itself rs 2 54 lakh crores were written off in 2018 19 and another rs 1 53 lakh crores in 2020 21 this is the public s savings subsidising private profits this is the time as i said to tax these corporates and billionaires who are milking this man made calamity for all it is worth and to use these funds to provide succour to the vulnerable sections of society most countries are following this precept in the usa joe biden is funding his revival package by a 3 60 trillion tax hike on corporates and high net worth individuals top income tax rate has been increased from 37 to 39 6 capital gains tax on persons earning in excess of 1 million per annum has been increased from 20 to 39 taxes have also been hiked on income from sale of investments and transfer of assets on death corporate income tax has been increased from 21 to 28 tax breaks will no longer will be available for polluting industries the g 7 group of the world s richest countries at its recent conflab has also resolved to maintain a minimum level of corporate tax the uk has announced measures similar to that of the usa but our government is doing nothing in this direction and continues to tax the common man instead the economic path being followed by mr modi and his onion eschewing finance minister is absolutely incomprehensible if they are devoid of any ideas of their own they can certainly pick up a few from other better governed countries for the last thing we need after the pandemic is a double dose of post covid capitalism avay shukla is retired from the indian administrative service cover photograph i stock

the reason for the gop qanon s success in spreading misinformation about covid 19 is the failure of public education especially in the ignorance rich red states to adequately teach biology an alarmingly large number of americans seem to have virtually no knowledge of viruses in general and how they spread and mutate in particular and no clue on how vaccines work even though even most of the most fanatical trumpers have been vaccinated for something say as a condition for school admission their ignorance willful or otherwise has lately spread the delta variant of the disease much faster and wider than otherwise would have been the case which in turn has undermined our freedom to move around and get back to normal life it s the anti vaxxers who are taking away our liberty not those health officials and others who are desperately urging people to get their shots meanwhile most establishments now have signs telling folks they can enter without masks if they ve been vaccinated but virtually no one is asking for proof what a joke the throngs of unvaccinated people suggest that new covid 19 variants besides delta and delta plus may be poised to cause trouble will they be even more contagious and dangerous than the delta variants in any event even if you re one of the relatively few folks who get the virus even after vaccination the shots will almost certainly save you from getting very sick as for teachers healthcare workers and other public facing personnel fire em if they refuse to be vaccinated of course the war to undermine vaccination hurts the

favor the very rich so praise is due to maine u s senator angus king an independent who caucuses with the democrats and iowa republican charles grassley for coming up with a bill to address this issue and get more money flowing faster to nonprofits it is natch complicated pretty much everything is in the u s tax code by far the world s most complicated but its essentials include creating two new kinds of daf accounts one reports the associated press would give donors an immediate income tax deduction for money they agree to give to a charity within 15 years another says the ap would let them delay the distribution of their money for 50 years but with no income tax deduction until then still they would get to enjoy capital gains and estate tax savings for donating stocks or other gifts into a daf community foundation sponsored dafs with less than 1 million would be exempt from the requirement but donors with more than 1 million in such accounts would qualify for upfront tax benefits only if they distributed at least 5 percent of their assets annually or gave their money to a charity within 15 years under current law assets can remain in a daf indefinitely tax free the bill strikes me as a good start to address what has become a growing abuse of the tax laws by the privileged please hit this link view larger the tenth anniversary on july 21 of the death of the late rhode

i have headaches not the low grade annoying i ve got a headache sort of headaches i get those too most everyone does and they are a drag no when i say that i get headaches i mean that at intervals that are largely unpredictable a knot of pain rises deep inside my head invariably sensed behind my right eyeball it then swiftly clicks up through the intensity scale racing past that dull ache you might get from staring at the screen too long leapfrogging over that doozy you had the morning after your brother s wedding skipping past the agonising but fleeting stab of an ice cream headache and arriving within a matter of minutes at a pain so piercing and sustained that i can only grip something sturdy rock back and forth and grunt until it subsides mine are what doctors call one of the primary headaches recurring and often excruciating disorders that are not by products of another condition or self inflicted by last night s cocktails but relentless and in many ways still poorly understood disorders unto themselves we know them by common names like migraine which affects tens of millions of people disproportionately women i suffer from another flavour known as cluster headaches technically a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia and there are others with myriad and imperfectly drawn lines distinguishing them if you experience migraines or cluster headaches and research suggests that more than a billion people worldwide do you probably know something about shuttling from doctor to doctor looking for someone who gets it you know what it s like to gladly gobble up pills that don t really work and that leave you miserable in other ways and you might even know the same sort of incredulous exasperation that has driven me to wonder from my fetal position on the bathroom floor how is it possible that science can t fix a damn headache where is the fix i won t go so far as to say we re anywhere near a fix in many ways we re farther from understanding these disorders than we ought to be given the billions of dollars they extract in health care costs and the outsize toll they take on people usually during what ought to be their most productive and creative years but i can also say with some confidence there s probably never been a better time to have a headache in march one of the most coveted prizes in neuroscience the 1 5 million brain prize went to four scientists who often working independently of one another and beginning roughly in the 1980s set about revolutionising our understanding of migraines and similar headaches their work and that of many others has been slow but steady overturning long prevailing and facile notions like the migraine personality a derisive category primarily aimed at women or the idea that stress and a weak constitution were the cause they re not rather primary headaches are true neurobiological disorders and i know this because on a sunny day last spring and after a few weeks of imperfectly managing excruciating pain with lousy drugs and haggling with doctors and insurance carriers i stood in my kitchen hiked down my trousers and administered into my bottom three still very expensive injections of a new elixir a monoclonal antibody designed to inhibit a neuropeptide called cgrp short for calcitonin gene related peptide cgrp discovered only in the 1980s is a key component in the nervous system s head pain pathway and appears to be intimately involved in the generation of migraines and clusters scientists now believe these headaches arise in part when cerebral structures linked to head pain signalling become hyperactive a sort of neurovascular communication gone awry for illustrative purposes only image credit agency and while the brain itself does not feel pain it can respond to this errant activity by sending severe sensations of pain to parts of the head that can quite likely the membranous layers of tissue between the skull and the brain called the meninges when this happens patients can also experience increased sensitivity to light sound and smell as well as nausea and even vomiting this can continue unabated for hours and sometimes days for some people living with migraine new class of medication this new class of medication the first of which was brought to market by amgen and novartis and collectively called cgrp inhibitors is changing the lives of many headache patients and it is no exaggeration to say that a direct line can be drawn between the research honoured with the brain prize and events in my kitchen that day last spring can i say unequivocally that it worked for me maybe i think so my headaches abated shortly after though it s characteristic of clusters to go into periods of remission anyway only to reappear but even if it did work and welcome as these advances are any neurologist working today will readily admit that we remain in the stone age with regard to many aspects of these most common and debilitating disorders that is probably the result at least in part to historical biases as joanna kempner an associate professor of sociology at rutgers university nimbly laid out in her 2014 book not tonight migraine and the politics of gender and health migraine headaches in particular have been given inadequate consideration by the medical and scientific establishments this dismissal dr kempner argues was at least partly tied to the fact that migraines surface more often in women whose physical pain was often ascribed a psychological or emotional origin and while those diagnoses have now mostly been discarded by the medical establishment she suggests that gender biases in headache treatment have not to be sure our brains are unfathomably complex organs and they are difficult to study but the dynamics that dr kempner identifies almost certainly helped to prolong scientific ignorance of headache mechanics and treatment for decades and for everyone consider after all that the amgen novartis antibody was the first drug ever approved in the united states to specifically prevent migraines the and that was a mere three years ago side effects so far generally appear uncommon and mild though the long term picture remains to be seen eli lilly secured approval for its version of a cgrp inhibitor to treat cluster headaches only in 2019 and new classes of cgrp drugs are still emerging but since the dawn of drug regulation every other pharmacological dollop aimed at preventing these diabolical headaches a menagerie of beta blockers anti epileptics antidepressants and other drugs were researched developed and designed for other diseases they simply seemed to help some people with headaches as a side effect and so doctors just gave them a go in my work as a journalist exploring the modern evolution in headache science i ve spoken to many patients who suggested that ignorance both clinical and cultural persists as with so many other pain disorders black patients are far less likely to have their head pain properly diagnosed than their white counterparts and while the world health organisation places headaches among the leading causes of disability and lost productivity on the planet our knowledge of headaches like that of so many other diseases skews toward the rich world leaving incidence and impact in the developing world vastly understudied at the same time the new drugs while remarkably effective for some people are yet another heartbreaking failure for others suggesting that a more fundamental neural trigger or target remains elusive these medications are also not cures and many patients must continue to take them periodically even though they can cost more than 600 for a single injection many headache sufferers are finding that their insurers will refuse to cover them enormous social costs for all the recent progress funding from the national institutes of health for basic research into headache disorders remains incommensurate with their enormous social costs and far too few young doctors see headache specialisation as fertile ground for a career one young medical student with an interest in neurology told me she was taken aback that her studies focused so heavily on unusual brain disorders given that headaches are so common and still so mysterious we got so much teaching about other things which are important too but way less common she said i was surprised by that look i get it in a world troubled by all manner of disease and unrest it can seem absurd to complain about headaches but this too is what makes the path of a chronic headache sufferer or really anyone with any sort of chronic pain a uniquely lonely one the pain won t kill us sure but we can receive prolonged physical beatings without explanation at any moment a merciless cycle that some studies have shown can increase suicide risk some headaches are even thought to be capable of administering one of the most extraordinary sensations of pain known to the human body but they occur in a location that makes them entirely invisible to puzzled onlookers and for most of history to scientists too and all such pain bears a name headache so common so boring and so utterly diluted by its resonance with other lesser things that sufferers are often too ashamed to even mention it but ask any people who suffer from migraines or similar headaches about the months spent being dismissed or misdiagnosed by unenlightened doctors or the years spent swallowing or inhaling or injecting hand me down off label drugs that make them sleepy or stupid that embrittle their bones or race their hearts or present a litany of other side effects they are in your family or you work with them no they won t die but they are very often experiencing inscrutable exhausting bouts of pain or living in fear that it s just around the corner again the most painful thing to me aside from my physical pain is the incredible feeling of loss migraines have brought me a young headache patient just 22 at the time told me i know i am smart but my schoolwork does not mirror it i know i am social a good daughter a good friend but i worry my life does not mirror this either she said i guess the loss i feel is the loss of what i could have been or could be or could do without migraines in march patients and advocates for headache science once again made an annual appeal to congress for additional funding for research and other headache treatment initiatives the yearly migraine world summit offers patients and practitioners around the globe online access to experts working at the bleeding edge of research headache research centers are busy studying these disorders from texas to denmark there s a growing market potential in still newer drugs and clinical trials for other potential therapies from psilocybin to vitamin d are in the works this upswing in therapeutic interest in headaches is exhilarating and full of anticipation and the swashbuckling science being done is extraordinary it really is a fine time to have a headache but it s also disheartening that a condition that brings such regular anguish to so many people remains so mysterious and so undertreated tom zeller jr is an

words used in the poughkeepsie underwear factory on thursday are generally reserved for disasters of biblical proportions tidal wave tsunami crisis i appreciate the language expressing the level of concern said eli berkowitz poughkeepsie organizer for community voices heard and also just a reminder that evictions are not an act of god at the end of next month new york s eviction moratorium which has been a key element of assistance afforded to thousands throughout the covid 19 pandemic is scheduled to end with roughly 40 days more to prepare housing and community advocates are hoping for the best but bracing for the worst the moratorium was extended previously berkowitz said it s not a fait accompli that it does not get extended in august there are people in this room that could have the power to change that reality berkowitz spoke thursday at a housing event attended by new york attorney general letitia james and roughly 20 public officials and advocates from around dutchess and ulster counties assistance when will ny distribute rent relief funds what tenants and landlords need to know future what happens to poughkeepsie housing rentals services as it grows study to provide answers housing some hudson valley builders have stopped constructing single family homes here s why more than commiserating over what is feared to be an impending wave of evictions those in attendance including representatives from hudson valley legal services and hudson river housing and mayor rob rolison discussed issues with the system as it stands and solutions berkowitz put forth the possibility of a housing diversion program in which if a landlord wants to enter an eviction case into court they are required to seek mediation however the biggest problem that most in that room could agree to where there isn t a near term solution is the availability of affordable housing people are looking to move and transition without becoming homeless and there is nothing available either because of the price the condition of it just plain availability said justin haines an attorney for legal services of the hudson valley which provides free services to people who can afford a lawyer multi faceted issue dutchess county s 2020 housing survey which focuses on larger rental complexes found the vacancy rate fell to 0 9 a 40 decrease from 2019 and the lowest vacancy rate since 1980 county executive marc molinaro who attended the start of the meeting said the county is working on ways to increase the housing stock and also working with the municipalities on inclusionary zoning which would require developers to include affordable housing in their projects legal services is preparing for the onslaught of eviction cases expected after the moratorium is lifted but is also working on those cases which have been backlogged because of the pandemic the organization s team also brought up other issues including the need for more lawyers trained to handle eviction and housing court cases landlords using tactics to get tenants out such as calling code enforcement on their own property or cutting of services and how town and village courts are sometimes not prepared to handle eviction cases james said her team is compiling a report for the legislature regarding the village and town courts and some of the issues they are facing i am of the opinion based upon my review of all of the issues that were brought to my attention that something needs to happen she said advocates also brought up issues with the emergency rent assistance program which requires both tenant and landlord to apply for the tenant to receive relief if one party doesn t apply which is sometimes the case if they are not communicating the relief isn t processed but the voices missing from the table were that of the landlords many of whom are having difficulty paying mortgages because they have not been collecting rent for over a year now the challenge as leaders is that we ve got to get the balance right said state assemblymember didi barrett saba ali sali1 poughkeepsiejournal com 845 451 4518

market kurly ceo sophie kim courtesy of market kurly by kim jae heun the korea exchange krx the country s top bourse operator has decided to request market kurly s major shareholders to exercise joint ownership of the company s shares while limiting them from selling stocks following the online grocery service s initial public offering ipo the krx wants to make it clear that the online retailer s initial public offering ipo here is possible as long as kurly s ceo can maintain management control market kurly ceo kim seul ah or sophie kim only holds 7 percent of the company s shares and the bourse operator isn t ruling out the possibility that foreigner shareholders who have invested in kurly with the hope of its successful ipo may sell off their holdings right after the listing local and overseas private equity funds pefs are even said to be bracing for the possibility of a hostile takeover of market kurly if the company s management continues to falter and thus becomes unstable investors could suffer financial and monetary damage when it gets listed based on that rationale the krx hopes kurly to form a joint ownership and restrict shareholders from selling shares individually a source from an investment bank said the bourse operator usually asks a joint owner to possess 20 percent of the shares however specific shareholding percentages have not been set for market kurly shares owned by major investors will be kept at the korea securities depository and an individual party will not be able to sell its stocks unilaterally the krx sees kurly ceo kim s management control to become more vulnerable as other major shareholders hold bigger or at least equal amounts of shares sequoia capital china and hillhouse capital both from the mainland of china own 13 84 percent and 12 03 percent of market kurly s share respectively aspex capital from hong kong also holds a 7 6 percent of stake russian venture capital dst global and euler capital from the united states own 10 69 percent and 7 81 percent stakes respectively meanwhile kim s share fell below 6 percent after receiving a series f investment of 225 4 billion won recently but some view the kurly ceo will likely keep her management rights as the company s major shareholders are mostly financial rather than strategic investors currently the board of directors trusts kim s capability of running the company and there is a system such as a joint management agreement that alleviates concerns over kim being deprived of her ceo position a market kurly official said

bharat biotech may be in a hotter soup in brazil the brazilian government s inquiry into bharat biotech which has developed and manufactures india s homegrown covid 19 vaccine covaxin has intensified over the past two weeks the brazilian parliamentary commission looking into the company s deal to sell vaccines in the latin american country will now also investigate an alleged payment of 200 000 from bharat biotech to the india brazil chamber of commerce the wire reported these questions have been raised as part of an ongoing investigation against bharat biotech and the alleged irregularities in its contract to sell india s coronavirus vaccines to the country though the brazilian health ministry did not definitively find irregularities in bharat biotech s agreement it suspended the 324 million contract with the company as a preventative measure on june 29 while suspending the contract one of bharat biotech s first outside india the ministry said there were complaints that it felt the company did not address satisfactorily it also opened up a probe into the contract as part of a larger investigation into president jair bolsonaro s alleged mishandling of the covid 19 pandemic now with a 200 000 payment to a private lobbying organisation the company will need to answer some tough questions surrounding what is now being called covaxingate in brazil latest allegations the india brazil chamber of commerce according to its website is a private non profit organisation that has been working to promote trade and cultural relations between india and brazil since 2003 according to the wire s report suchitra ella co founder and joint managing director of bharat biotech and precisa medicamentos the indian firm s representative in brazil are both a part of the india brazil chamber of commerce two top office bearers of the india brazil chamber of commerce board are also honorary consuls of india for two brazilian cities the connection becomes more complicated given that covaxin the covid 19 vaccine has been developed by bharat biotech in collaboration with the indian government s indian council for medical research in response to questions from the wire the india brazil chamber of commerce explained these payments as thus as a policy the chamber refrains from commenting on its business relations with members or associate members however in this specific case it may be mentioned that any transfers made from precisa medicamentos to the india brazil chamber of commerce correspond to its contributions to the institution as part of membership and to the sponsorship of events and initiatives of ibcc in 2021 while the investigation has not led to any conclusive faults on the part of bharat biotech its brazilian partner or the india brazil chamber of commerce the timeline of the agreements and the payment made to the india brazil chamber of commerce have raised the commission s suspicions it appears that bharat biotech may now be in trouble elsewhere troubles in paraguay the vaccine maker s contract to supply 2 million doses of covaxin to the government of paraguay could also be under the scanner now it links back to madison biotech bharat biotech s partner in singapore which sent a 45 million invoice to the brazilian health ministry krishna ella founder of bharat biotech is a director of the singapore firm in a press release the indian vaccine maker on june 30 said that madison biotech is one of the 13 such companies that it has founded or acquired for the purposes of research development sales or marketing of vaccines globally the investigation into bharat biotech expanded when brazilian whistleblower luis ricardo fernandes miranda revealed on june 23 that he had in march flagged the irregularities in the invoice to the president and said he was being pressured into clearing the payment at first the brazilian government said that ricardo miranda had forged the documents but it was later found that the invoice in question was not forged when investigations into the madison biotech invoice began emanuela medrades the executive director of precisa medicamentos told the brazilian commission that both bharat biotech and her company had followed normal procedure the wire reported medrades reportedly cited the covaxin deal in paraguay as an example of this norm this alerted the brazilian government which has since contacted its counterparts in its neighbouring country to look into its own covaxin contract the contract was already in trouble in paraguay because bharat biotech had not delivered its promised doses as part of a 4 million doses contract that was due by march 17 both brazil and paraguay had signed up to pay 15 per dose to bharat biotech another element of the contract that has become a bone of contention issues with ocugen bharat biotech s partner for marketing and selling covaxin in the us and canada is now facing a class action suit in the us ocugen a pennsylvania headquartered biotechnology company is now facing charges of violating us federal securities laws pomerantz an american law firm announced its class action on july 19 stating that ocugen made materially false and misleading statements regarding the company s business operations and compliance policies all of these allegations pertained to ocugen s reported filing for an emergency use authorisation for covaxin with the food and drug administration on february 2 ocugen had announced its tie up with bharat biotech under which it would have exclusive rights to develop manufacture and commercialise covaxin in the us in its securities filings on february 5 the company detailed how it would apply for an emergency use authorisation with the food and drug administration instead on june 10 ocugen said in a press release that it would apply for biologics license application and not the emergency use authorisation this license amounts to full approval and is in essence a far longer and more tedious process while ocugen s share prices soared after the february press release the announcement of its full license plan brought a drop of over 28 to its stock price pomerantz alleges that it was never ocugen s plan to apply for an emergency use authorisation and it misused this nugget of information for financial gain meanwhile ocugen which is bharat biotech s partner in north america has begun a rolling submission to health canada it said in a securities filing on july 15 a rolling submission is canada s accelerated approval process for vaccines in emergency use this article first
