s is home to thousands of advisors that can meet your specific needs based on the methodology outlined below smartasset identified these financial advisor firms as among the top 5 financial advisor firms in the u s rank financial advisor assets managed 1 714 587 898 072 2 173 418 270 044 3 46 803 858 104 4 94 617 046 882 5 19 851 537 239 methodology to find the top financial advisors in the u s we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure firms with a fee only as opposed to fee based compensation structure are ranked higher these stats are updated annually and accurate as of may 25 2023 this list may include firms that have a business relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please carefully review the methodologies employed in the vanguard whitepaper to receive a copy of the whitepaper please contact compliance smartasset com the value of professional investment advice is only

i see a lot of things going on in the background i list them here usa the west sullivan says a communication link has been opened with moscow to talk about what if you take the official washington line there is nothing to talk about moscow must give up is washington preparing for a different conversation after the accusations that russia is considering nuclear weapons blinken made it clear that no preparatory signs had been seen somewhat of a toning down of rhetoric zelensky applied for fast track nato membership and was instantly slapped down by sullivan at a different time weariness is visible three recent american polls show a desire for diplomacy less concern and that ukraine doesn t make the list i m reminded of a comment by gonzalo lira that russia should just make the war boring to americans the economic effects of the boomeranging sanctions are inexorably tightening in europe we re now hearing about possible bank collapses and reading cheerful pieces on how to keep mold out of cold damp houses with nordstream out of contention no improvement is visible time is on russia s side at some point the european population will have had enough protests are growing the overwhelming rejection in the german parliament of increased support for ukraine points this way america is better off but is also feeling the boomerang inflation is rising and what will happen to gasoline prices a huge concern when they stop draining the strategic oil reserve and if china dumps a lot of us currency the situation will get worse western arms running out the west is running out of arms to send ukraine a cnbc report speaks of america being out of 155mm guns and ammunition manufacturers are being sought it has already sent ten years production of javelins the latest himars sent haven t been built yet similar stories from europe the available stock of ex soviet equipment is gone 28 modernized 20 years ago t55 tanks scrounged from slovenia are the latest wonder weapon the west does not have the industrial capacity to sustain modern war everything that has been sent to ukraine so far has been from existing stocks western militaries must either start cannibalizing their standing armies or stop then what western weapons made the september offensive possible international the west s mojo isn t working scholtz received little support from his gulf visit and neither did biden from saudi arabia china india and brazil abstained on the american unsc motion to censure russia s absorption of the four regions 90 of the world isn t following the lead of the so called international community many countries see the world changing and have picked their side or are waiting to see how it plays out egypt and saudi arabia are feeling out the sco for example russia there are many videos of trains carrying heavy equipment west i ve seen tanks mstas bm 21s iskanders and lots of bmps nothing suggests that russia is running out of anything this suggests preparations for a large scale russian army armored offensive along traditional deep penetration doctrine the status of the new four regions opens the possibility of more forceful actions by the russian armed forces as such because they are defending the motherland there is a good deal of plausible speculation that the 300 thousand man call up may free up soldiers in the rear if so the effect of the extra troops may be felt sooner than many expect as far as razputitsa распутица winter and other things beloved of tv commentators it s not the ussr in 1941 there are a lot of paved roads and russians are well equipped and experienced for fighting in winter therefore there is no guarantee that things will be quiet for four or five months we call on the kiev regime to immediately cease fire and all hostilities to end the war it unleashed back in 2014 and return to the negotiating table said putin a couple of days ago was this his last offer before a much more powerful attack premonitions of what in short the western plan is not working the sanctions cost the west more it s running out of weapons to send and there are signs of softening if moscow s plan was to move slowly and wait them out then it s working one should not rule out the possibility of a negotiated settlement and it may be that nato realizes in time that it has painted itself into a corner from which that is the only exit but it s hard to see given all the hyperbole how the west s present rulers could admit to such an enormous failure electoral replacement while happening is too slow and why would moscow ever trust anything the west says a unilateral surrender by kiev is possible but the only way i could see it is if zelensky were overthrown therefore i rate a negotiated ending as not impossible at the moment but of very low probability but time is on russia s side and october s improbability may be march s desperate desire more likely to me is to use a world war ii analogy that now that kiev s operation citadel in the kursk salient is petering out it s time for a really powerful mechanized offensive accompanied by strikes deep in the rear with no holding back one must remember that putin said they hadn t really started i think we re about to see what he meant and sooner i would guess rather than later i can t imagine that anyone in moscow wants this thing still going on next february

crimea would prompt judgment day devastating video footage showed a volley of missiles rain down on residential block in zaporizhzhia southeast ukraine as putin launched his first retributive strikes on ukraine a series of explosions rocked the city in the early hours of the morning sending towering plumes of illuminated smoke into the sky and triggering a series of secondary explosions putin s furious response came after it was widely reported that ukrainian forces launched an explosive laden aquatic device possibly a drone that brought the road bridge connecting russia and crimea crashing into the sea putin pictured addressing an audience in the kremlin last month is expected to escalate war ukrainian president zelensky told viewers of his nightly telegram video address that ukraine s prospects were sunny in stark contrast to the smoky clouds over crimea after the blast the russian leader ordered the fsb intelligence service to monitor security on the bridge a potential sign of a spat between the army and the secret service as russia s war effort continues to falter putin received pyramids of melons from the president of ally tajikistan for his birthday he was also given a tractor by belarusian president lukoshenko meanwhile ukrainian president and ex comedian volodymyr zelensky rediscovered his comic chops in a tongue in cheek weather report following damage to a key strategic bridge between russia and moscow annexed crimea the kyiv leader poked fun at the humiliating attack on putin s supply line making the audacious comments in his nightly video address posted on telegram zelensky said today was a good and mostly sunny day in our country over most of the territory it was about 20 degrees celsius and sunny dramatic cctv footage showed the moment the deadly bridge blast took out a key supply line satellite images also showed the damaged bridge continue to burn hours after the detonation unfortunately it was cloudy in crimea although it was still warm but however the clouds are ukrainians know what to do and they know that our future is sunny this is the future without invaders on all our territory in particular in crimea three people were killed when the apparent truck bomb took down a chunk of the bridge between russia and the ukrainian region stolen by putin in 2014 the explosion took place just hours after putin s 70th birthday with one of zelensky s aides joking happy birthday mr president the plot thickened when a mysterious wave was caught on video fuelling speculation that ukrainian special services used a boat or explosive laden drone to launch an attack that has damaged putin s supply lines moscow furiously claimed a truck bomb caused the blast which killed at least three people but did not apportion blame while the speaker of crimea s kremlin backed regional parliament accused kyiv of being behind the explosion putin responded to the embarrassing attack by ordering tightened security at the bridge in a decree issued hours after the bridge was damaged by a blast putin said the fsb security service would be responsible for strengthening protection measures the kremlin had claimed the bridge which was opened personally putin in 2018 to much fanfare in russian state media was being protected by a maximum security operation which even included attack dolphins russian law enforcement has identified samir yusubov 25 from the krasnodar region in russia as the alleged owner of the red coloured international prostar truck which according to investigators exploded on the crimean bridge they are still investigating who was driving the truck when it exploded workers are pictured repairing the railway line section of the bridge over the kerch strait this evening on putin s orders the rail bridge from russia to the crimean peninsula can be seen engulfed in flames on the right while a huge section of the road bridge has collapsed into the sea cars are pictured below the damaged bridge connecting crimea to russia tonight hours after a massive explosion but the so called wave which appeared under the bridge before it was destroyed has led to speculation that it was attacked using a boat or explosive laden drone ukrainian officials have repeatedly threatened to strike the bridge and some lauded the destruction but kyiv stopped short of claiming responsibility however a top aide to president zelensky boasted that putin should be happy not everyone gets such an expensive birthday present and the prime minister of estonia suggested that the attack was committed by ukraine the attack could cut supplies to putin s forces as ukraine makes more advances in the south towards kherson a section of the bridge has collapsed into the sea and seven oil tankers on a train caught fire in the blast long fuel lines are already forming in crimea despite russian claims to have enough supplies to last two weeks officials at the bridge opened the doors of the truck before sending it on its way despite claims it was guarded with a maximum security operation images appear to show movement in the water under the bridge a split second before the explosion which brought down the road bridge and set fire to oil tankers the kerch bridge is the only direct link between russia and crimea and is a crucial supply line for russian forces in ukraine the explosion is the latest setback in russia s invasion of ukraine with putin s forces struggling to hold ground in the past few months the fire continued to rage on the rail bridge following the explosion as russian state media said several fuel tanks were on fire eyewitnesses said the enormous blast could be heard from miles away and a column of smoke could be seen rising over the black sea russian propaganda had claimed the crimean bridge was impossible to attack because of 20 different kinds of security protecting it including military dolphins speculation is mounting that a drone was used to blow up the bridge this image handed out by the russian ministry of defence shows what was claimed to be a mystery ukrainian drone found near crimea the 12 mile bridge across the kerch strait linking the black sea and the sea of azov opened in 2018 and is the longest in europe the 3 2billion project is a tangible symbol of moscow s claims on crimea and has provided an essential link to the peninsula which russia annexed from ukraine in 2014 crimea holds symbolic value for russia and is key to sustaining its military operations in southern ukraine while russia seized areas north of crimea early on during the invasion and built a land corridor to it along the sea of azov ukraine is pressing a counteroffensive to reclaim them the russian defence ministry said troops in the south were receiving necessary supplies through the land corridor and by sea the energy ministry said crimea has enough fuel for 15 days and it was working on ways to replenish stock the bridge has train and road sections the blast and fire caused the collapse of one of the two links of the road bridge while another link was intact russia has released this picture of samir yusubov 25 believed to be the truck s owner the russian transport ministry said train traffic across the bridge would start again shortly after quick repair works vehicle traffic resumed on saturday afternoon on one of the two links that remained intact from the blast with the flow alternating in each direction and vehicles undergoing a full inspection procedure crimea s russia backed regional leader sergey aksyonov wrote on telegram rail traffic was resuming slowly two passenger trains departed from the crimean cities of sevastopol and simferopol and headed toward the bridge on saturday evening passenger ferry links between crimea and the russian mainland were being relaunched sunday mr putin was informed about the explosion and ordered the creation of a government panel to deal with the emergency the speaker of crimea s kremlin backed regional parliament blamed ukraine for the explosion but downplayed the severity of the damage and said the bridge would be promptly repaired leonid slutsky head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of russian parliament said consequences will be imminent if ukraine is responsible gennady zyuganov head of the russian communist party which is nominally in the opposition but votes in line with kremlin wishes in parliament said the terror attack should serve as a wake up call the long overdue measures haven t been taken yet the special operation must be turned into a counterterrorist operation he said sergei mironov head of the just russia faction in parliament said moscow should respond by attacking key ukrainian infrastructure including power plants bridges and railways the parliamentary leader of ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky s party on saturday stopped short of claiming kyiv was responsible but appeared to cast it as a consequence of moscow s takeover of crimea russian illegal construction is starting to fall apart and catch fire the reason is simple if you build something explosive then sooner or later it will explode david arakhamia the leader of the servant of the people party wrote on telegram the secretary of ukraine s national security and defence council oleksiy danilov tweeted a video with the kerch bridge on fire alongside marilyn monroe singing her famous happy birthday mr president pictures in the aftermath of the explosion show the devastation it caused on the crucial road and rail bridge later this morning smoke could still be seen billowing out over the sea as the bridge was closed to all traffic the fire could still be seen burning from miles away from a suspected fuel tank on a train was hit by the explosion the road section of the kerch bridge was severely damaged by the blast it is not known how long it could take to repair a helicopter was used to drop water in an effort to extinguish the flames on the bridge earlier this morning people posed for photos with a giant postage stamp of the bridge on fire today following the explosion the blast has been welcomed by many in ukraine as the latest blow against putin s regime as his forces continue to suffer setbacks member of putin s inner circle directly confronts vladimir over ukraine war mistakes and mismanagement as kremlin insiders reach breaking point us intelligence report claims vladimir putin has been confronted by one of his inner circle about his handling of the failing war in ukraine us intelligence has said the insider complained to putin about mismanagement of the war effort and mistakes being made by those executing the campaign it is alleged it is the clearest indication yet of rebellion among russia s elite over the war and the first evidence that putin has been directly confronted about it meanwhile russian business executives linked to moscow s political class described the situation inside the kremlin as being at breaking point and said in fighting will break out soon if the tide of war keeps flowing in ukraine s direction the news emerged after ukraine scored a series of battlefield victories over russia forcing putin to announce a deeply unpopular mobilisation to shore up the front line annex occupied territories and threaten anyone who intervenes with nukes advertisement the blast on the bridge occurred hours after explosions rocked the eastern ukrainian city of kharkiv early on saturday sending plumes of smoke into the sky and triggering a series of secondary explosions ukrainian officials accused russia of pounding kharkiv ukraine s second largest city with surface to air missiles and said at least one person was wounded the strikes targeted two largely residential neighbourhoods the regional governor oleh sinehubov said huge queues appeared at petrol stations in crimea in the wake of the bridge s destruction soon after the russian puppet authorities said there was petrol for 40 days other sources said there was only 15 days of fuel as panic buyers queued for hours locals were also rationed to 3kg of essential groceries amid fears for supplies according to reports on the peninsula a video shows a russian man in crimea saying we ve had a good life but it was short lived the ways are now cut off pro putin military correspondent yuri kotyonok joined a wave of demands for overwhelming russian attacks on ukraine he said the answer for blowing up the bridge should be crushing the question is not about revenge but about punishment and our capacity as a state responding to terrorist attacks the crimean bridge will certainly be restored i hope that they will do it promptly within a few months he asked for answers on why targets in kyiv are still intact yuri podolyaka a popular pro rus blogger said it looks like this is the prelude to the main strike of the ukrainians in the south if over the next few days ukraine does not plunge into darkness and strikes are not carried out on the bridges across the dnieper i personally will consider it a sign of an vladimir rogov chairman of we are together with russia movement and a key official in occupied ukraine said the crimean bridge has been blown up both the road and railway lines have been cut the terrorist entity must be destroyed he published exact map coordinates of targets he wanted hit in ukraine kharkiv mayor ihor terekhov said the early morning explosions were the result of missile strikes in the centre of the city he added that the blasts sparked fires at one of the city s medical institutions and a non residential building there were no immediate reports of casualties russian officials said they faced an emergency on the bridge with the train on fire a russian telegram channel said it is likely that an improvised explosive device hidden in any of the passing vehicles was detonated oleg kryuchkov aide to the kremlin appointed head of annexed crimea said according to preliminary information a fuel storage tank is on fire navigable arches were not damaged it is too early to speak about causes and consequences work to extinguish the blaze is under way russian controlled crimean railways said a fuel tank at the tail of a freight train caught fire the locomotive with some carriages was brought to kerch station ukraine in recent days has grown more ambitious in its predictions that it will retake crimea annexed by russia in 2014 rybar a pro russian telegram channel reported there was an explosion at around 6am on one of the sections of the crimean bridge according to official reports a fuel tanker caught fire road services and the emergencies ministry are working at the scene of the fire and traffic has been temporarily suspended however photos and video footage show one of the vehicles being put out of action which in no way could have happened due to a simple fire it is likely that an improvised explosive device hidden in any of the passing vehicles was detonated advertisement pro kremlin war reporter andrey rudenko asked what kind of power did the explosion have to for a span of the bridge to go under water it is quite possible to assume that the main explosion was underwater at the beginning of the year there were reports that the west had supplied ukraine with underwater kamikaze drones vladimir rogov chairman of we are together with russia movement and a key official in occupied ukraine said the terrorist entity must be destroyed army general sergey surovikin is reported to have taken charge of putin s war in ukraine after a series of setbacks for russian since it invaded in february the british ministry of defence said in june for over thirty years surovikin s right career has been dogged with allegations of corruption and brutality ukraine has been launching a successful counter offensive against russia in the last few weeks claiming miles of territory ukraine has won back hundreds of settlements and

start of the invasion but us stockpiles of some equipment are reaching the minimum levels needed for war plans and training and restocking to pre invasion levels could take years mark cancian of the center for strategic and international studies wrote in a recent analysis washington is learning lessons from the conflict about ammunition needs in a great power war which are far greater than expected a us military official acknowledged on condition of anonymity some us provided equipment has become emblematic of the war in ukraine such as javelin anti tank weapons which were widely used by kyiv s forces to blunt the russian advance on the capital and himars a precision rocket system now playing a key role in counteroffensives against moscow s troops in the east and south but us stocks of ammunition for himars which fires gps guided rockets known as gmlrs with a range of more than 80 kilometres 50 miles are dwindling if the united states sent one third of that inventory to ukraine as has been the case with the javelin ukraine would receive 8 000 to 10 000 rockets that inventory would likely last several months but when the inventory is exhausted there are no alternatives said cancian who previously worked on weapons procurement for the us government production is about 5 000 a year although the united states is working to increase that amount and money has recently been allocated for that purpose it will take years he said adding that older equipment could help fill the gap 8 07am imf announces 1 3 billion in emergency aid for ukraine the

mobilised almost 13 billion in emergency funding for ukraine 11 billion of which has already been disbursed the us congress approved a new 12 3 billion aid package for ukraine also on friday including

archived document may contain errors 10 april 1979 the anti defense lobby part i center for defense information executive summary of the many organizations currently active in the united states and which are regarded by some observers as the anti defense lobby one of the most prominent is the center for defense information cdi led by retired rear admiral gene r larocque who has served as the organization s director since its founding in 1972 is an impor tant part of the apparatus of the fund for peace a left oriented tax exempt instrumentality with headquarters in washington d c near the u s capitol in a facility purchased in 1974 by general motors heir stewart r mott a major financial backer of an assort ment of leftist projects and groupsd organizations within the fund complex which interlock closely with cdi include the center for na tional security studies one of the nation s principal anti intelligence community operations and an organization whose personnel show a pattern of interrelationship with the far left institute for policy studies the center for international policy some of whose principal activists have also had close ties to ips in the public interest a project designed to counteract the onslaught of right wing broadcasting with information gathered by cdi cnss and cip and made available through the efforts of a large group of 11peace movement activists members of congress and others and the fund itself the former president of which has been identified with activities of the world peace council a soviet controlled in ternational communist front organization cdi s program reflects larocquels view that the military has become far too pervasive and powerful and basic cdi literature stresses the theme that it is necessary to ensure that the military in this country does not overreach civilian control primarily through its regular newsletter the defense monitor th6 center publicizes the results of its research and analysis on such de fense questions as development of the b 1 bomber the value of the cruise missile development of nuclear weapons the size of the pentagon budget and the value of u s military installations in the i ndian ocean and the philippines all from a negative standpoint at the same time cdi material has downplayed the question of soviet versus u s naval strength and has argued against anti communism as the dominant theme of u s foreign policy for thirty years the center is among those groups currently arguing strongly for a u s soviet strategic arms limitation salt agreement a basic point being that such an agreement s most significant result could be the slowing of new nuclear weapons developments in both the united states and the soviet union as part of its anti nuclear weapons emphasis cdi conducted the first nuclear war conference in washington d c during december 1978 in conjunction with ips the center claims that some significant successes have resulted from its work a march 1978 cdi letter stated that cdi analyses played a key role in cancellation of the b 1 bomber nuclear strike cruiser and additional heavy attack aircraft carriers and that jwe influenced the slow down in development of the new land based mobile icbm mx and the reduction of the u s arms sales over seas in cdi s view none of these reduces the security of our nation one iota a view that is apparently shared by such political leaders as u s senators mark hatfield and adlai e stevenson iii who have said that we need this independent privately funded source of information on military matters cdi material is regularly distributed to members of congress and to appropriate offices in the executive branch of government and cdi personnel have appeared regularly to lecture at military war colleges and at the state department foreign service institute two members of the cdi board of advisors paul newman and harold willens served on the united states delegation to the recently concluded united nations special session on disarmament which was also addressed by cdi director larocque operating on a budget estimated at approximately 300 000 cdi solicits contributions from concerned citizens among whom have reportedly been paul newman and stewart mott a major source of funds however has been a group of tax exempt foundations princi pally in new york city including especially such institutions as the field foundation and the compton foundation foundation support for the fund for peace and its projects including cdi since 1972 has amounted to a minimum of 2 299 495 the largest grantor has apparently been the field foundation 1 073 800 with compton the second largest 816 695 the largest grantor to cdi insofar as the available information indicates has been the field founda tion with a minimum total of 530 000 field has also granted op erating funds to such groups as the lawyers military defense com__ mittee which has worked closely with the national lawyers guild and the bill of rights foundation the latter grants being to sup port the political rights defense fund an adjunct of the trotskyite communist socialist workers party to which mott has also given sup port at present the fund for peace complex is bringing into being a new project which interlocks with cdi and other fund projects the campaign for peace and campaign for peace media center sup posedly scheduled to become operational in late april or early to mid may 1979 the media center has developed from a june 5 1978 meeting convened by mott and former u s attorney general ramsey clark in washington d c to discuss an international campaign for peace draft material currently being circulated indicates that the central theme of the center is to be the dangers of the arms racen and that its program is designed to achieve maximum media impact around such issues as military spending salt foreign arms sales budget priorities detente nuclear technology economic conversion and the test ban the cfp s proposed budget for 1979 has been projected at 106 400 it being expected that the budget will increase to 117 410 during 1980 minutes of a november 16 1978 meeting of the cfp executive committee state that mott has pledged 50 000 a year for two years providing there was a 2 to 1 match for each of his dollars he has also stated however that he would contribute the first 50 000 with out a match so the media service center could begin cfp s board of directors includes several people with ties to other parts of the fund for peace complex and includes at least two prominent 11peace activists currently listed as members of the soviet controlled world peace council center for defense information introduction there are active in the united states today a number of organiza tions which are viewed by some observers as forming in the aggregate the anti defense lobby of these one of the most prominent is the center for defense information cdi self described in its pro motional literature as a project of the fund for peace a left oriented operation which maintains offices at 122 naryland avenue n e washington d c in a building purchased in august 1974 for some 375 000 by general motors heir stewart rawlings matt to house the fund for peace and several avowed fund projects this arrange ment was discussed by stephen isaacs in a detailed article published in the august 10 1975 edition of the washington post matt said he paid 375 000 for the house last august he rents 80 per cent of it to the fund for peace and some of its member organizations and uses the other 20 per cent for two of his own washington employees and for space for himself when he is here five or six days a month mortgage payments and upkeep on the house run 43 000 a year and the tenants pay 35 000 of that mott said but that 35 000is more than made up by the 50 000 he gives them he is chairman of the executive committee of the fund for peace mott s tenants are organizations consisting mostly of former government officials who have become disaf fected oppositionists they are the fund for peace s center for national security studies a left wing think tank set up to in vestigate the use of intelligence and national security claims to justify the growth of government power which is headed by robert borosage the center for defense in formation set up to scrutinize the department of defense headed by retired rear adm gene r larocque the twen tieth century fund s national security study headed by morton halperin the one time aide to henry a kissinger who has sued kissinger for tapping his telephones a media project in the public interest which prepares material for newspapers and radio stations and the institute for international policy set up to publish a foreign affairs newsletter edited by carl marcy who was top assistant on the senate foreign relations committee when it was headed by then sen j w fulbirght csic7 the center for defense in 3rmation regards its location as being of key significance since it is at the hub of washington s legis lative life adjacent to he u s senate office buildings and only 2 blocksfrom the capitol itself the white house and most major government offices are minutes away and easily readhed from the center s headquarters origin and purpose the center was formed in 1972 with help from mott and from the fund for peace cited by john pierson in the april 24 1972 issue of the wall street journal as kicking in enough money to get things started according to representative les aspin d wis in remarks inserted into the may 1 1972 edition of the congressional record announcing cdi s formation the center for demse information gas been organized in order to gither and disseminate information about military programs american strategy and alternatives to the penta gon s position such a statement would not necessarily seem to connote a specifically anti military predilection on the part of cdi although a passage in the pierson article quoting retired rear admiral gene laracquewho has served as cdi s director since the or ganization s inception is less neutral in tone than aspin s characterization the military has become far too pervasive and powerful continues adm laracque defense tells state it wants a part for ships in greece and state arranges it that s so sailors can be near their families but hell sailors ought to be serving the nation not the other way around specifically the admiral and his crew plan to chal lenge basic assumptions underlying current defense thinking for example does the u s really need to de fend other countries to defend itself i d like to see what share of the defense budget goes to defending the 50 states he says maybe 25 more recent cdi literature explicitly raises the spectre of a military establishment grown so powerful that it threatens to subvert traditional civilian control a letter circulated in march 1978 for example speaks darkly of the need to ensure that the military in this country does not overreach civilian control and warns that 11continued unchecked investment in military force poses a threat the threat that excessive concern for security will overwhelm those very democratic values the military is designed to preserve and pro tect this theme is carried through at greater length in cum s basic promotional brochuref which asks the question who will watch the watchmen and proceeds t a set forth what is apparently the or ganization s operating rationale which is worth quoting in full as an indication of whatever bias may properly be charged to cdi and its staff throughout this century democratic societies have been challenged by the twin evils of authoritarianism and militarism in response even the most liberal democracies have them selves resorted to standing military establishments of unparalleled size and destructive power america has entrusted its military with great authority powert responsibility and treasure to its credit and the safety of our democratic institutions the american military honors the concept of civilian control nevertheless the need for continuous investment in mili tary forces poses a threat the threat that excessive concern for security will overwhelm the democratic values our military forces are designed to preserve and protect this threat was recognized even by our founding fathers who addressed the question in the federalist papers nore recently the threat has been escribed in terms of the garrison state whether in ancient roman term in the words of the founding fathers or in contemporary political analysis the problem is the same how do we insure that the mili tary and the interests which coalesce around it do not outrun the institutions intended to direct and control them only continuing watchfulness can guard against unwar ranted military influence this was the objective in creating the center for defense information in 1972 and it remains a vital task for all americans the question of objectivity as a non profit non partisan public interest organization the center avows its dedication to making available continuing ob jective information and analyses of our national defense information which is free of the special interest of any government military political or industrial organization such a statement is re miniscent of raracquds statement as quoted by pierson in the 1972 wall street journal article that he was going out of his way to fend off peaceniks who are anti military and people who ve left the military in anger whether cdi has avoided involvement with peaceniks who are anti military is perhaps open to argument cer tainly as will be seen subsequently cdi and its associated groups mrithin the hatt backed complex have maintained close working relation snips with for example the far left institute for policy studies and as observed by pierson the reality of such an enterprise is that objectivity may be an impossible goal a sentiment echoed in larocque s statement that any group that tries to challenge the mili tary power is going to be of a liberal bent to which he added we ve got to accept that we re not going to get any money from the barry goldwaters and i don t think i want any along the same lines it is perhaps noteworthy that according to pierson l aracquenhas al ready been dubbed the ralph nader of the military an analogy used by larocquehimself in expressing his desire for long term effective ness we don t want to be a flash in the pan it took ralph nader six years of just hard slogging to get established i think it will take us just as long program after better than six years of slogging n cdi has an ex tensive and varied program of activity all of it geared to the cen ter s avowed policy which it is claimed supports a strong defense but opposes excessive expenditures or forces it holds that strong social economic and political structures contribute equally to national security and are essential to the strength and viability of our country the center s program as outlined in cd1 promotional material includes u239 95 the cd1 library a growing specialized collection of basic data and analyses essential to the work of our analysts and available toresearchers in the washington area u239 95 the defense monitor cdi s newsletter published 10 times a year with each issue devoted to a specific defense issue according to a cdi promotional letter dated november 15 1978 we send out over 8 000 copies of the defense monitor each month at a cost of 25 000 annually and there are no subscription or service charges assessed cdi s basic brochure issued prior to the november 1978 letter but subsequent to the election of president carter in 1976 specifies that the monitor is sent to over 7 000 individuals and or ganizations 500 to the media including 25 magazines 115 newspapers and to most major wire services the newsletter has been quoted or referenced in news features and editorials across the nation while mili tary war colleges regularly reproduce monitor material as does the pentagon which provides cep ies to the ad mirals and generals stationed in the washington d c area 11 furtherf it is claimed that more than 5000 copies are rece4ved by congressional offices including those of 85 senators and 200 representatives at their re quest the monitor is regularly reprinted in the concres sional record special studies consisting of occasional papers mono graphs and analyses originated by the center or developed in response to special requests some of them generated by members of congress government agencies independent organizations and individuals in addition cdi analysts frequently write articles for wide circulation publi cations both magazines and newspapers a series of books started in 1976 with continued output on at least an annual basis cdi reports that current issues in u s defense policy the first of this series is already being used as a standard text in many college courses 11 the center s reference service characterized as less immediately visible than publications although equally important since clients are heavily concentrated among decision makers and opinion leaders which provides de fense information in response to individual requests cdi claims that inquiries come from england india germany australia france denmark and sweden and other countries as well as from members of congress congres sional offices and committee staffs the press governmental offices other organizations independent researchers and scholars students and private individuals radio programs for rebroadcast by local stations across the country and television appearances which contribute to the continuing expansion of the center s audiences in addition assistance and coordination have also been supplied for the production of t v documentaries concerning defense issues more recently this aspect of the center s activities has been expanded by the release of a cdi film war without winners characterized in the february 1979 issue of the defense monitor as an exploration of the danger of nuclear war in today s world the film examines such issues as the power of nuclear weapons expected deaths from nuclear war how nuclear war would start the size of u s and soviet nuclear arsenals who is ahead in the nuclear arms race the spread of nuclear weapons and the consequences of salt treaties directed by academy award winning film maker haskell wexler the film was produced by cdi board of advisors member harold willens and was made in cooperation with the members ok congress for peace through law education fund u239 95 various conferences seminars meetings speeches and lectures which as another major aspect of the center s work range from participation by single staff members to broader staff participation in convocations and conferences extending over several days cdi em phasizes that center members regularly lecture at mili tary war colleges and at the state department foreign service institute the other side of the coin is that the cimter itself is frequently the site of conferences and seminars participants range from established experts to student groups and visiting classes u239 95 ispecial courses for career groups as part of what the center calls its neducational activities an example being a national security seminat in conjunction with the university of maryland for congressional legislative aides a similar effort consists of cdi intern fellow programs in conjunction with most major universities and colleges which are conducted on continuous basis at the center u239 95 appearances of center personnel by request to provide expert testimony before congressional committees and executive bodies such as the arms control and disarmament agency and the department of state given the repeated emphasis on the influencing of the legislative and ex ecutive branches of government that appears in cdi publi cations it is hardly surprising that the ceater character izes this as probably the most significant of all aspects of its work and regards it as indicative of its growing recognition sta ff cdi s leadership both with respect to key personnel and with regard to their basic point of view on defense matters has remained relatively constant over the years in 1972 for example according to pierson there were some 37 consultants including dr william corson a retired marine lieutenant colonel and author of the betrayal a highly critical study of u s counter insurgency in vietnam leslie gelb compiler of the pentagon papers morton halperin who quit henry kissinger s white house staff over policy matters and dr ralph littauer of cornell co editor of another critical book the air war in indochina in assessing the potential for objectivity present in the roster of cdi consultants and staf pierson observed that most of the people who are joining the staff of the center or signing up as consultants are dedicated pentagon budget cutters and well known doves as previously noted retired rear admiral gene r larocque has been cdi s director since the organization s inception the most re

textbook the major indexes at bear market lows rebounded strongly from deeply oversold conditions on monday tuesday but the stock market rally attempt quickly hit resistance at the 21 day line while treasury yields and the dollar bounced back the selling intensified friday with the strong jobs report the market rally attempt is in force until the major indexes undercut their recent lows but the dow s p 500 and nasdaq are not far from doing so a follow through day could still come at any time to confirm the market uptrend but investors should remain cautious especially if the indexes stage a ftd below their 21 day lines also a follow through before thursday s consumer price index carries extra risks new bear market leg meanwhile the risks are high that the bear market will break lower the market bounce came amid renewed hopes of slower fed rate hikes falling job openings and australia s small rate increase bolstered that case but fed officials insist they are not backing off while the jobs report was too hot ultimately the already high odds of a fourth straight 75 basis point rate hike in november strengthened last week markets are close to locking in at least 50 basis points in december with a small but rising chance of 75 basis points earnings season could be a minefield amd and cvs followed several other high profile warnings with earnings season about to kick off markets

bad news for the broader market higher gas prices complicate the fed s task of reining in inflation gas prices had already jumped especially in california on various refinery issues some biotech and drug names are still acting well somewhat insulated from economic concerns but can they make much headway if the broader market heads to new lows meanwhile some tech and medical products names that

week ago was plausibly close to an entry point dived toward 2022 lows apple stock microsoft and other tech titans aren t leading the downside but aren t bolstering the major indexes tesla vs byd which ev giant is the better buy what to do now the arguments for being all or entirely in cash remained strong even at last week s highs and are even stronger now with the market rally attempt reeling if

beijing china saturday criticized the latest u s decision to tighten export controls that would make it harder for china to obtain and manufacture advanced computing chips calling it a violation of international economic and trade rules that will isolate and backfire on the u s out of the need to maintain its sci tech hegemony the u s abuses export control measures to maliciously block and suppress chinese companies said foreign ministry representative mao ning it will not only damage the legitimate rights and interests of chinese companies but also affect american companies interests she said mao also said that the u s weaponization and politicization of science and technology as well as economic and trade issues will not stop china s progress she was speaking after the u s on friday updated export controls that included adding certain advanced high performance computing chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to its list as well as new license requirements for items that would be used in a supercomputer or for semiconductor development in china us aims to hobble china s chip industry with sweeping new export rules the u s said that the export controls were added as part of ongoing efforts to protect u s national security and foreign policy interests u s china relations have deteriorated in recent years over technology and security issues the u s has implemented a raft of measures and restrictions designed to prevent china from obtaining chip technology while china has earmarked billions for investment into the production of semiconductors the tensions have impacted semiconductor companies in the u s and globally which either export chips or manufacture chips in china semiconductor companies such as nvidia and amd have seen a 40 decline in stock price over the past year we understand the goal of ensuring national security and urge the u s government to implement the rules in a targeted way and in collaboration with international partners to help level the playing field and mitigate unintended harm to u s innovation the semiconductor industry association which represents u s semiconductor industry said in a statement
there are so many threats to british agriculture too much sun not enough rain rising costs for fuel and fertiliser catastrophic labour shortages and shockingly low profit margins which have left farmers scrabbling to survive or selling up entirely so self inflicted wounds on top of these are a serious matter i m talking in particular about the rush for net zero at least as it applies to agriculture net zero is the aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 but what this means in practical terms is farms have been told to abandon the tried and trusted aids to food production pesticides and chemical fertilisers that have done so much to feed the nation since the war farmers have also been urged to pull out of traditional meat production in the cause of cutting methane in the atmosphere who is demanding these changes bureaucrats of course namely the department for environment food rural affairs plus the vestiges of diktats from the european union what means in practical terms is farms have been told to abandon the tried and trusted aids to food production pesticides and chemical fertilisers that have done so much to feed the nation since the war above emissions from the smokestacks at the jeffrey energy center coal power plant as the suns sets near emmett kansas i ve spent 40 years growing food and today run a mixed farm in aberdeenshire with grass fed beef cattle barley for the scotch whisky industry and wheat for chickens so i know that what has been proposed is simply unworkable pesticide and fertiliser reduction targets for between 2030 and 2050 are not so much ambitious as impossible impossible that is if we want to continue feeding the country i realise there s plenty of support for green virtue signalling mainly from people who have never set foot on a farm but let s get real about organic food which is what the net zero drive is demanding we produce that is to say livestock and crops raised without the benefit of pest control and chemical fertiliser eu officials have been pushing an unworkable farm to fork plan which involves a 30 per cent rise in such food by 2030 despite brexit we seem to be adopting this i believe the organic movement is no more than a fad it is certainly not a national food plan for a country of 67 million organic farming is suitable only for gardening at home for allotments and for the rich who choose to spend a lot more money for conventional farmers like myself it is clear organic production requires significantly more land and therefore is hugely inefficient it s not that i am anti environment where green schemes are practical and appropriate we put them into practice on our farm there s mixed woodland to encourage wildlife and we leave natural corridors across the land to help small mammals escape the plough i realise there s plenty of support for green virtue signalling mainly from people who have never set foot on a farm pictured an exhaust pipe of a car is pictured on a street but anything other than smart modern farming is self indulgent low yield and unsustainable retreating to the methods of the 1940s cannot be part of the plan for any farmer it will punish the poor and leave us dependent on foreign food supplies a state of affairs thrown into clear focus by putin s monstrous invasion of ukraine food prices in britain have risen by nearly 12 per cent this year mostly as a consequence of an event a couple of thousand miles away the cost of fertiliser which depends on petrochemicals has gone through the roof no wonder civil servants are scrambling to redraw the more fanciful plans for green conformity to say we have been caught with our trousers down is a gross understatement then there is the fashionable war on meat driven partly by the methane myth this is the claim that livestock such as cows and sheep damage the environment by burping and farting cows in particular are accused of being a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions each year one cow can produce up to 200kg of methane which as joe biden has lectured us all is one of the most potent greenhouse gases with more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide is this true recent research from munich university suggests that the methane contribution from livestock could be overstated by a factor of three or even four it is also the case that methane unlike carbon dioxide is broken down entirely after a few years this war cannot be dismissed as some deep green fad a recent editorial in the guardian newspaper went so far as to suggest it is time to put official limits on the amount of meat sold recent research from munich university suggests that the methane contribution from livestock could be overstated by a factor of three or even four stock image of billows of smoke at a chinese plant never mind the weight of evidence that grass fed british meat is sustainable or that the fields themselves remove vast quantities of carbon from the atmosphere or the fact that without artificial fertiliser the arable production so prized by teenage vegans is impossible without the excrement from animals to enrich the soil that is i have long suspected that a drive towards synthetic meat production and the money making opportunity it promises is a hidden factor in this disgraceful attempt to abolish animal husbandry does anyone really want to eat synthetic meat sadly the public is as confused as it is misinformed by zealots blinded by self important activism it s not just a british problem in germany half the population think back to nature farming can fight global hunger it cannot the world bank and the un are part of the problem their left wing views dominate and give credence to anti meat reports they declare adopting alternatives to meat produces progressive outcomes such as rewilding i am convinced we can protect our landscape and produce more quality food for our own needs critics of modern farming often disparage current systems as industrial or intensive but it is only by producing more food from fewer hectares that we can keep the population fed and leave more land for biodiversity and wildlife why not support more farming in cities where technology allows crops to be grown indoors or do more to develop policies which avoid unnecessary ploughing and the consequent release of carbon dioxide locked in the earth the world s sheer diversity of crops terrains and weather systems means we will always need not just traditional farming skills but modern methods too that s why it is essential that british agriculture finds a way to promote farming systems that encourage biodiversity and production whimsical concepts such as fertiliser free food or rewilding will salve the consciences of the well to do but what good is that if millions go hungry

united states may soon be unable to provide ukraine with certain types of ammunition that are critical to kyiv s battle against russia s invasion as supplies are being used up faster than they can be replaced washington has become by far the largest supplier of arms to ukraine since russia launched its invasion on february 24 with more than 16 8 billion in military assistance provided since the start of the invasion but us stockpiles of some equipment are reaching the minimum levels needed for war plans and training and restocking to pre invasion levels could take years mark cancian of the center for strategic and international studies wrote in a recent analysis washington is learning lessons from the conflict about ammunition needs in a great power war which are far greater than expected a us military official acknowledged on condition of anonymity some us provided equipment has become emblematic of the war in ukraine such as javelin anti tank weapons which were widely used by kyiv s forces to blunt the russian advance on the capital and himars a precision rocket system now playing a key role in counteroffensives against moscow s troops in the east and south but us stocks of ammunition for himars which fires gps guided rockets known as gmlrs with a range of more than 80 kilometres 50 miles are dwindling if the united states sent one third of that inventory to ukraine as has been the case with the javelin ukraine would receive 8 000 to 10 000 rockets that inventory would likely last several months but when the inventory is exhausted there are no alternatives said cancian who previously worked on weapons procurement for the us government production is about 5 000 a year although the united states is working to increase that amount and money has recently been allocated for that purpose it will take years he said adding that older equipment could help fill the gap 8 07am imf announces 1 3 billion in emergency aid for ukraine the

mobilised almost 13 billion in emergency funding for ukraine 11 billion of which has already been disbursed the us congress approved a new 12 3 billion aid package for ukraine also on friday including

michel martin host by now you ve seen photos of the damage wrought by hurricane ian in southwest florida some of the worst the mobile home parks blown to smithereens it s a perennial problem during hurricane season older mobile homes built to lower standards are acutely vulnerable npr s john burnett tells us more john burnett byline a man in his 70s eyes red rimmed holding a budweiser surveys the ruination that was once his happy home john boren ph is a retired construction worker from massachusetts his decapitated mobile home is in gasparilla mobile estates the name coming from the famed barrier island just offshore john boren how do you describe it i mean it s gone you know it s demolished burnett it s as if a giant took a weed wacker to this community of 178 mobile homes roofing and siding and skirting and decking strewn about in a frightful mess boren that one was so strong i mean i ve never seen anything like it they claim it was stronger than charley i believe it now burnett before ian the hurricane of record was charley in 2004 it was also a category 4 with 150 mile per hour winds but it spared gasparilla life went on boren would motor out to the island in his skiff and he and his wife would collect shells and fossilized sharks teeth they had a 40 year old trailer the rent on their lot was only 580 a month on his 2 500 a month social security check they got by on their little piece of paradise boren these trailers have been here 40 years i mean it s a 72 trailer thousands of dollars and they won t pay it because it s a 72 you ain t going to pay nothing very few people here have insurance and they ve lost everything burnett as did he boren she used to crying excuse me crying burnett john boren s story epitomizes florida s affordable housing dilemma in 1994 two years after hurricane andrew pulverized the homestead area the federal government toughened wind standards for mobile homes and the industry started calling them manufactured housing they became more expensive today for a low income buyer older mobile homes are decidedly cheaper jaimie ross they re living in these mobile home parks because there is not an affordable housing stock available to them in the community that they could live in boren jaimie ross is ceo of the florida housing coalition an advocacy group ross they should not be there because it is not stable housing in a state like florida this is what happens these tragedies boren but tell that to the retirees on fixed incomes like john boren the low wage earners the farm workers who can t afford any place else in a booming state like florida where pricey condos stand shoulder to shoulder along sugar sand beaches gladys cooke is the coalition s director of disaster recovery gladys cook the pressure on affordable housing in florida is just excruciating we ve had land costs and construction costs go up 30 in just the last couple of years burnett old mobile housing stock is everywhere in florida of 822 000 mobile and manufactured homes in the state almost two thirds of them are pre 1994 vintage major storms like ian are culling so to speak the old structures jim ayotte every time there s a hurricane we see a number of our older homes that suffer catastrophic failures burnett jim ayotte ceo of the florida manufactured housing association says the industry suffers from an age old image problem in many florida cities and towns ayotte they would rather see a mobile home park gone they see it as a blight on the community they don t really look at that as a affordable housing source they say let s get rid of it burnett if you don t believe him believe jimmy buffett soundbite of song migration jimmy buffett singing yeah they re ugly and square they don t belong here they look a lot better as beer cans burnett he sings that they re ugly and square they don t belong here and they look like beer cans but the fact is they re not beer cans anymore modern manufactured housing is built to withstand 150 mile per hour winds in the last 30 years if they re towed to the florida coast they have to have double studs double roof trusses double tie downs sturdier walls the list goes on just ask bob murphy president of the residents co op at park hill estates in punta gorda he s riding around the development checking on friends danny hi bob bob murphy hi danny how are you danny i m well murphy you re doing ok your house fared very well didn t it danny it did i can t complain murphy oh good burnett eighteen years ago hurricane charley decimated park hill estates most of the older mobile homes were a total loss residents bought new homes built to modern wind standards with more robust tie downs ian blew off the clubhouse roof but on the whole the community from the shuffleboard court to the boat slips on alligator creek is pretty much intact bob murphy is 82 he watched ian blow in on the weather channel from his summer home in cincinnati when he arrived here on thursday he was hugely relieved murphy well the structures themselves seem to be pretty durable compared with this hurricane ninety nine percent of the structures are standing so i mean we have some siding off we have some roof damage we have the skirting off of a number of them but for the most part they held up pretty well burnett still murphy says he s too old to go through a third major storm like charley or ian he ll be done with the sunshine state john burnett npr news punta gorda fla transcript provided by npr copyright npr
artificial diamonds produced by henan huanghe whirlwind co ltd in changge city henan province xinhua a trending hashtag henan province has become the largest producer of cultured diamonds in the world has become popular on multiple social media platforms recently in 2021 global lab grown diamond output reached 9 million karats of which 4 million was produced in zhecheng a county in henan as the name suggests lab grown diamonds are diamonds that are produced in a lab using the same extreme forcesâ temperature and pressureâ that form naturally created diamonds there is no chemical optical or physical difference between a lab grown diamond and a natural one lab grown diamonds are manufactured using either the high pressure and high temperature hpht process or the chemical vapor deposition cvd process both use a tiny seed diamond the cvd method places a tiny diamond seed inside a chamber that can be taken to extremely high temperature and pressure carbon rich gases are pumped into the chamber with the extreme heat breaking the molecular bonds in the gases releasing the carbon which then attaches directly onto the seed diamond the surface of which provides a template for the arrangement of the carbon atoms into new layers of diamond the hpht method places a tiny diamond seed into the center of high purity source of solid carbon which is then heated and compressed the resulting molten carbon then forms new layers of diamond on the seed in a similar manner to the vaporized carbon atoms of the cvd method american corporation general electric created the first batch of cultured diamonds in 1954 artificial diamond products produced by a graphite factory in jixi heilongjiang province xinhua strong technological foundations why has henan become the world s factory for lab grown diamonds the province in central china has solid technological foundations for producing artificial diamonds in the 1950s zhengzhou capital of henan was assigned by the central government to develop the abrasive industry zhengzhou research institute for abrasive and grinding zzsm established in 1958 was a leader of the industry as one of the hardest materials in nature diamond is an important industrial material in addition to being prized as jewelry in the 1950s china relied on imports of diamonds for industrial use to shed the reliance on imports the country launched a research project to develop artificial diamonds in 1963 the zzsm developed a press a machine for creating diamonds in december that same year china succeeded in producing its first created diamond using the machine in 1965 the institute developed a new press which has production efficiency 10 times higher than the one developed in 1963 which made it possible to carry out the industrialized production of artificial diamonds in the 1980s feng jinzhang an engineer with the zzsm returned to his hometown the aforementioned zhecheng to start a diamond factory the factory produced micron diamond powder an ideal material for griding and polishing super hard materials such as optical glass later more micron diamond powder factories were established in the county making it a major producer of the material by 2000 and forming the foundation for the artificial diamond industry today since 2009 a batch of factories have been introduced to the county establishing a complete artificial diamond industrial chain in september last year the county s henan liliang diamond co ltd went public on the shenzhen stock exchange and in july this year the county s huifeng diamond co ltd went public on the beijing stock exchange in addition to companies in zhecheng the zzsm also cooperates with artificial diamond companies in other parts of henan such as zhongnan diamond co ltd in nanyang market prospects cultured diamonds are gaining more recognition globally in 2018 the u s federal trade commission issued a new guideline saying lab grown diamonds are diamonds too and now steers clear of the words synthetic and lab grown that same year technological advances led to retail prices of artificial diamonds being greatly reduced now the cost of cultivating 1 karat of diamond is around 3 000 yuan 419 4 10 times less than the cost in 2018 according to brilliant under pressure the global diamond industry 2020â 21 report released last february by american management consulting firm bain company in collaboration with the antwerp world diamond center the retail price difference between natural and synthetic stones has widened yet again the

michel martin host by now you ve seen photos of the damage wrought by hurricane ian in southwest florida some of the worst the mobile home parks blown to smithereens it s a perennial problem during hurricane season older mobile homes built to lower standards are acutely vulnerable npr s john burnett tells us more john burnett byline a man in his 70s eyes red rimmed holding a budweiser surveys the ruination that was once his happy home john boren ph is a retired construction worker from massachusetts his decapitated mobile home is in gasparilla mobile estates the name coming from the famed barrier island just offshore john boren how do you describe it i mean it s gone you know it s demolished burnett it s as if a giant took a weed wacker to this community of 178 mobile homes roofing and siding and skirting and decking strewn about in a frightful mess boren that one was so strong i mean i ve never seen anything like it they claim it was stronger than charley i believe it now burnett before ian the hurricane of record was charley in 2004 it was also a category 4 with 150 mile per hour winds but it spared gasparilla life went on boren would motor out to the island in his skiff and he and his wife would collect shells and fossilized sharks teeth they had a 40 year old trailer the rent on their lot was only 580 a month on his 2 500 a month social security check they got by on their little piece of paradise boren these trailers have been here 40 years i mean it s a 72 trailer thousands of dollars and they won t pay it because it s a 72 you ain t going to pay nothing very few people here have insurance and they ve lost everything burnett as did he boren she used to crying excuse me crying burnett john boren s story epitomizes florida s affordable housing dilemma in 1994 two years after hurricane andrew pulverized the homestead area the federal government toughened wind standards for mobile homes and the industry started calling them manufactured housing they became more expensive today for a low income buyer older mobile homes are decidedly cheaper jaimie ross they re living in these mobile home parks because there is not an affordable housing stock available to them in the community that they could live in boren jaimie ross is ceo of the florida housing coalition an advocacy group ross they should not be there because it is not stable housing in a state like florida this is what happens these tragedies boren but tell that to the retirees on fixed incomes like john boren the low wage earners the farm workers who can t afford any place else in a booming state like florida where pricey condos stand shoulder to shoulder along sugar sand beaches gladys cooke is the coalition s director of disaster recovery gladys cook the pressure on affordable housing in florida is just excruciating we ve had land costs and construction costs go up 30 in just the last couple of years burnett old mobile housing stock is everywhere in florida of 822 000 mobile and manufactured homes in the state almost two thirds of them are pre 1994 vintage major storms like ian are culling so to speak the old structures jim ayotte every time there s a hurricane we see a number of our older homes that suffer catastrophic failures burnett jim ayotte ceo of the florida manufactured housing association says the industry suffers from an age old image problem in many florida cities and towns ayotte they would rather see a mobile home park gone they see it as a blight on the community they don t really look at that as a affordable housing source they say let s get rid of it burnett if you don t believe him believe jimmy buffett soundbite of song migration jimmy buffett singing yeah they re ugly and square they don t belong here they look a lot better as beer cans burnett he sings that they re ugly and square they don t belong here and they look like beer cans but the fact is they re not beer cans anymore modern manufactured housing is built to withstand 150 mile per hour winds in the last 30 years if they re towed to the florida coast they have to have double studs double roof trusses double tie downs sturdier walls the list goes on just ask bob murphy president of the residents co op at park hill estates in punta gorda he s riding around the development checking on friends danny hi bob bob murphy hi danny how are you danny i m well murphy you re doing ok your house fared very well didn t it danny it did i can t complain murphy oh good burnett eighteen years ago hurricane charley decimated park hill estates most of the older mobile homes were a total loss residents bought new homes built to modern wind standards with more robust tie downs ian blew off the clubhouse roof but on the whole the community from the shuffleboard court to the boat slips on alligator creek is pretty much intact bob murphy is 82 he watched ian blow in on the weather channel from his summer home in cincinnati when he arrived here on thursday he was hugely relieved murphy well the structures themselves seem to be pretty durable compared with this hurricane ninety nine percent of the structures are standing so i mean we have some siding off we have some roof damage we have the skirting off of a number of them but for the most part they held up pretty well burnett still murphy says he s too old to go through a third major storm like charley or ian he ll be done with the sunshine state john burnett npr news punta gorda fla transcript provided by npr copyright npr

to become a viable electric vehicle stock ford will have to prove one thing and early signs are positive it seems all but certain the world will switch to electric vehicles evs and the change could happen sooner than we anticipate that has sent waves of investors jumping into stocks for electric battery technology and charging station infrastructure among other opportunities but ford f 3 01 remains an afterthought for ev investors and that could be a huge mistake trucks will remain key for automakers among the major questions facing detroit automakers was how the companies would transition from traditional combustion engine large trucks to electric versions and would consumers buy in these large trucks haul a majority of the bottom line profits for detroit and losing that or even hindering it would be catastrophic for investors the early signs from f 150 lightning sales are strong and we have evidence that the electric version of popular models could even outsell the traditional sooner than we imagined what does the data show starting from the top ford s ev sales outpaced the overall segment with a 197 jump in september compared to the prior year another angle ford s share of the ev segment jumped 310 basis points or 3 1 percentage points to 7 of the industry looking at hybrids in particular ford s sales totaled over 74 000 vehicles through september which was a year to date jump of 22 6 compared to the prior year its popular maverick which sells in the hybrid version almost 50 of the time is driving off dealer lots in an average of just six days as previously mentioned perhaps the most important model to watch the f 150 lightning was america s best selling electric pickup in september and continues to impress since its june launch the electric truck continues to fly off the lots turning inventory in just eight days a success story or two a question for investors remains will the electric version of the f 150 ever sell to the volume its traditional model has only time will tell but we have evidence from a similar ford product that shows it s clearly possible another model that consumers and investors questioned whether it would excel as an electric is the mustang the iconic muscle car seemed to be at the other end of the spectrum from an ev but looking at sales you d never guess there was reason to doubt its potential year to date sales of the mustang mach e are up 49 to over 28 000 units through september not only are those numbers reaching mainstream levels for a major automaker they re also closing the gap on outselling its traditional counterpart which sold just under 36 600 units through september another reason for investors to be optimistic about the f 150 lightning can be seen in ford s maverick truck which has the previously mentioned popular hybrid option maverick sales reached nearly 52 000 vehicles sold through september and while not completely apples to apples in comparison due to its smaller size topped the ranger s 46 293 units sold through the same period and more than 80 of maverick customers are first timers in the truck segment with 62 new to ford entirely these are huge wins in the highly loyal automotive industry the potential is tantalizing there are plenty of intriguing investments as the world s roads fill with evs but investors would be making a mistake to overlook ford s potential the folks at the blue oval have proved they can develop electric and or hybrid versions of iconic muscle cars and trucks and sell them at mainstream volumes if they can replicate the sales success of the mach e and maverick with the f 150 lightning it will likely open the doors for ford s historic profit machine to keep on hauling the big bucks for decades to come

alpine s decision to sign pierre gasly for 2023 and beyond came as no surprise to the formula 1 paddock the frenchman s departure from scuderia alphatauri was one of its worst kept secrets as was his replacement at the faenza based squad nyck de vries while gasly s appointment at alpine is no great surprise it does beckon the obvious question why him what does the frenchman have that others on the market and potentially at a more affordable price did not daniel ricciardo immediately springs to mind but there are others like nico hulkenberg or even the likes of de vries had it been quick enough so what does gasly have that the others didn t and what makes him worth the money according to alpine team principal otmar szafnauer there were three criteria the team wanted the three things we wanted was naturally speed a fast driver one with experience and also youth at the same time he explained adding those all three things up there aren t many people that have all that and pierre definitely does gasly is 25 years old having made his formula 1 debut in 2017 with toro rosso as it was then known he was rushed into the senior red bull team for 2019 but struggled and was sent back to toro rosso mid season it was a harsh move one which had the potential to end his formula 1 career but instead it arguably made it in brazil at the end of the year he recorded his best result in f1 to that point with second place the following year he won the italian grand prix he has been something of a standout performer whose potential has been stymied by a car underserving of his talents only clearly red bull didn t think so else he d have landed the drive alongside max verstappen which instead went to sergio perez at that point the writing was on the wall if gasly was to succeed in formula 1 he had to leave the red bull system with alpine offering his first real opportunity but why would alpine make the effort to secure the race winner especially at what speedcafe com understands came with an eight figure release fee the enstone operation was in fairness desperate it lost fernando alonso and oscar piastri both arguably through mismanagement at a senior level szafnauer has publicly carried the can for that the american is a shrewd operator and by being the public face during the crisis has done his stock no harm whatsoever especially within the halls of renault s head office indeed sources have suggested that it was the way in which szafnauer was pushed into that position that scared off at least one potential driver who was left concerned at what seemed a toxic environment among key staff that alpine was willing to stump up the cash to pay for gasly s release serves only to reinforce its desperation it could have had ricciardo for a fraction of what it paid red bull or de vries or a handful of others for that matter two factors seemingly came into it the first is that all the drivers on the market were not prepared to drive for alpine or alpine was not prepared to sign every driver on the market from that we can infer that ricciardo was not on the list of potential candidates which side of the ledger the decision fell is somewhat irrelevant but an enstone reunion was unlikely from an early stage despite it making strong sense but that wasn t one of the team s stated criteria but then again nor was nationality that gasly is french will have helped his cause no end alpine and renault are parochial despite their position globally renault is a french company and it likes to employ french personnel add in the fact that gasly ticks all three other boxes though the question is whether those criteria were written pre or post signing is an open question and it makes a great deal of sense from a nationalistic standpoint he is young but has a wealth of experience he is a race winner he has strong potential for the future he was also motivated to leave the clutches of red bull weigh that against his rivals excluding ricciardo who we ve already deduced was never a serious consideration the others offered little competition de vries for instance is slightly older than gasly but has just one grand prix start to his name he meets two criteria but not the third he s also dutch so there s an invisible cross against his name there in comparison to gasly too hulkenberg is another who meets the experience criteria and quite probably the speed requirement too the problem is he s a decade older than gasly and has never stood on an f1 podium beyond that there are precious few in the market jack doohan was suggested as a possibility for a time but in reality the australian would benefit from another year in formula 2 he s young and fast but doesn t have the experience his future is still unwritten though there are strong indications that he ll be formula 1 material in future he s not ready just yet given that stance all other formula 2 drivers could be lumped into that bucket theo pourchaire is tied up with alfa romeo sauber frederik vesti with mercedes dennis hauger with red bull as is liam lawson while champion elect felipe drugovich has just signed with aston martin logan sargeant is a front runner for a berth at williams then who else there are precious few in the market meaning alpine had little choice but to buy out gasly for its next driver there was simply nobody else who fit its mould there s just one issue his fractious relationship with esteban ocon childhood friends the pair fell out during their junior career they put on the happy family persona for the publicity shots for gasly s announcement but tensions will be raised in the garage next year it will be curious to see how the pair interact and react to each other on track do they put their own or the team s ambitions first formula 1 drivers do not need to be friends to work with one another but team mates cannot be actively at war with one another we saw it with prost and senna hamilton and alonso and more recently hamilton and rosberg gasly was the only man to fit alpine s criteria for a replacement driver what we don t know and won t until a few races into 2023 is if that criteria was right

mark mobius a veteran emerging markets investor and co founder of mobius capital partners has said that the world will have to live with high interest rates and that this doesn t mean the stocks will be affected the legendary investor spoke to udayan mukherjee global business editor business today at a time when the global financial markets are in a state of turmoil and the central banks across the world are trying to tame inflation by hiking rates edited excerpts by shagun walia q this is not just the first bear phase that you are witnessing in your career you have seen so many of them from 2008 the global financial crash to the tech bust in 2000 where would you rank this period in the scheme of the great problem patches that you have to negotiate in the stock market over the last many decades well this is relatively mild when you look at it from the perspective of history you must remember we were dealing in the markets in brazil when inflation was 2000 per cent and in argentina and places like that the history of india also was checkered in those areas and of course you had the asian financial crisis which was very severe so i would say this downturn is relatively mild at least at this stage and we can pretty much handle them q the caveat in your answer is at least at this stage the fear is that it might be looking mild now the way central banks are acting it might get out of control very easily next year what would you say is the probability of that i think the good probability of higher interest rates is still there the fed in america leads the world in terms of interest rate hikes except china but if you look at the fed they desire to tame inflation which is now running the cpi at about 8 per cent their playbook says if you want to tame inflation interest rates have got to be higher than 8 per cent that means they are going to 9 per cent so when you talk about 3 4 per cent it is a big problem things will go much higher if cpi stays at this level q so do you think that the fed is panicking about inflation at this point in time it realises that it might have made mistakes in the last year trying to compensate for it yes i think they realised it late they should have moved much earlier and now they are trying to catch up the problem they are facing however is that unlike in the past they didn t have cryptocurrencies running around i had a recent trip to the us visiting various states and people are spending like crazy and one of the reasons is of course that they still have money leftovers from the handouts they have taken place from the covid crisis the current administration releasing oil from the strategic oil reserves means that gasoline prices can come down and that makes people very happy and very rich in america because gasoline is very important don t forget the cryptocurrency it probably represents 2 per cent of the money supply and the velocity is very high and people are spending another interesting note in america is that the unemployment rate is so low that we have noticed a lot of companies and restaurants are looking for people they are not just around what does that mean that means people don t want to work they have got enough money to spend and live without having to work so it is going to be very difficult for the fed to tame inflation in my view q you have a long memory mark and you have been around financial markets in the 1970s at that point inflation reigned for many years and the fed was unable to tame it and all of us have read how bad at that time the economic and financial markets were then do you think what you said about inflation we are at risk of that kind of protracted inflation or would it be alarmist to think about it at this point i think it is not alarmist to think we have to live with high interest rates and by the way high interest rates did not necessarily mean a downturn in the stock markets it can be temporary of course as the stock markets are now reacting negatively to the possibility of higher rates but if you look at history the stock markets were able to do well even with high interest rates that means you got to find companies with pricing power they are able to raise prices with higher inflation but there is no question that fed got much higher and that could have more pain ahead provided that the cpi stays at this level and even goes higher q your point is not necessarily about a stock market downturn but the way interest rates are going up this time it seems most economies may go into a recession and that has ramifications for the stock markets at least for the foreseeable future do you see that as a real risk do you think recession might be averted in some of the major economies yes i mean i think the possibility of recession is definitely there in fact if you take the official definition of recession we are already in a recession in the us because you ve had two quarters of negative growth so we are in a recession but a recession does not necessarily mean that people feel poor you re going to find that these two things are quite different in many ways and yes the recession is hitting companies q what does all this mean for currencies mark i mean the stock market is one part of the equation but you know there is a huge flux going on in the currency well in london the pound has collapsed over the last one month we are seeing many such reactions even in the euro versus the dollar how do you think this part of the equation will play out between the dollar and the other major currencies that s quite remarkable when you could think about not only the pound sterling but the euro where the euro went it s quite remarkable what does that mean it means that imports for these countries in europe and the uk have become a lot more expensive and more difficult because usually these imports are denominated in dollars it means that the us of course can import a lot more cheaply and the rest of the world of course is under pressure because you see all these currencies are weak against the us dollar the indian rupee has been holding up fairly well but if you look at other countries it s been pretty much of a disaster for many you must remember that even in situations like this you have companies that can do quite well for example in turkey companies that can export and receive dollars and their costs are in turkish lira which is evaluated massively against the u s dollar these companies can do quite well so it s not a complete disaster for everyone but certainly something that s quite remarkable when we see the major currencies decline against the us dollar to such an extent q the fear at such times is that one part is how the macro plays out and the other is what is going on in the world of interest rates in the world of currencies that at some point part of the world there will be a financial accident you know this kind of collateral damage do you see the fear of that some kind of accident which dislocates the system and something like a 2008 situation pans out definitely when you see prices move in such a remarkable fashion where interest rates and where currency rates move in such a fashion then there s a possibility of a big accident happening i know you ve heard rumors about credit suisse being in trouble yes it could happen where credit suisse has been gambling on farm reserves on currency interest rates in some ways you know with all these derivatives banks can get into big trouble if they play with these instruments so yes there s a possibility of an accident i m not saying that credit suisse is in trouble but i m just saying that you could have a major bank like that having a real problem and then that would create a panic q what about geopolitics the ukraine war has been raging for some time now the market might have priced in quite a bit of it where you sit there is always the china taiwan thing that is simmering do you think something might explode on that front and bring geopolitics back into play as one of the key risks for the market sometime in the next few months well i think it s a very important point you make and that is that these geopolitical issues are really at the top of the agenda i mean we can talk about interest rates we can talk about the stock market etc but when you have a war going on in europe and the possibility of russia using nuclear weapons then you really got a crisis that could wipe out everything that we ve worked for the last 50 years so it s a real problem and of course the china taiwan situation has simmered down and has quietened down a little bit but there s no question that continues to be an issue going forward i don t see the chinese taking military action against taiwan in the foreseeable future but the threat is always there and particularly if russia is successful in ukraine then it might encourage other countries to try out the same thing q what are your thoughts on china mark because you know we re talking about a global economic slowdown the numbers coming out of china over the last quarter or so are not very comforting where do you stand on how china the chinese story will play out in the next year or so first of all you can t ignore china it s exactly equal to or a little more or less than the us economy so you just can t ignore china and you can t ignore chinese companies you continue to look at chinese companies and see where the opportunities are but as you mentioned some of the numbers don t look very good they should know that they ve had a property or housing crisis recently and one of the reasons why chinese investors are somewhat depressed is that most of their assets are usually in property not in the stock market and when property prices go down they feel poorer so all of these issues including the covid lockdown have hit china foreign investors have been burnt badly american investors had a lot in china as you know the chinese market represented or still represents about 30 per cent of the major indices and over 50 per cent of investors in the emerging markets going into these index funds so when china goes down they all get badly burnt and of course russia being eliminated from the index somewhat means that they ve lost 7 8 per cent of their portfolio overnight so all of these factors make people very wary of china but that does not mean that there are no opportunities q what do you think large global investors are thinking at this point in time you ve run billions of dollars as a global investor you know would they be thinking that this is not the time to be adventurous and up allocation to emerging market equities maybe it s better to be in the safety of home in the us dollar assets where bond deals are inching higher would there be a propensity to take money back into the home ship at this point in time yes that s already happened if you know one of the reasons why these interest rates have been attracting people back to the us market is because with us dollar deposits they can get a lot more and equal to what they ve been getting anywhere else but the other important factor is that people in other countries that were holding local currency debt or local currency assets want to get rid of those assets and move into us dollars so that s the reason why you see this incredible strength of the us dollar the other factor that you must look at is that a lot of people have been burnt in the market and therefore don t want to talk about investing more in the market we haven t really reached the end however i think there s still considerable optimism in the market and i think it probably would take another leg down to really make people very despondent so they re in the process of selling despondently in other words giving up completely on the market we haven t seen that yet but this could come so it s a very interesting phenomenon that we have nowhere as i mentioned at least in america people feel quite wealthy they re traveling and so forth even in london if you look at the hotel rates and prices in general they have not come down they ve gone up so there is still a considerable flow of money so we haven t reached that point where people are giving up completely and saying look that s it but there s definitely a move or has been a move into us dollars q you ve just said that sentiment indicators according to you are not indicating a bottom that you have not seen the kind of pessimism yet which is consistent with markets having bottomed out we re now in bear markets in most markets around the world but i don t think we ve seen the end there in other words true bear markets when people have really given up and i just dumping everything into the market and saying look never again i don t want anything to do with stocks and so forth we haven t reached that yet q are you talking about the s p out here are you talking about the nasdaq because the nasdaq was the first to lead the fall and there the stock price collapse has been quite brutal has the nasdaq made a bottom do you expect tech stocks to lead the slide like last year no i think techs already had it they ve already had a big downturn you must remember that nasdaq has outperformed the s p for a number of years so even those that have seen this downturn are probably above what they would have been if they were just in the s p 500 let s say but i would say nasdaq has already had it we have already seen that decline and the next leg will be with the s p by the way don t forget bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies bitcoin would have to go down quite a lot if pessimism continues and increase and that could be a very good leading indicator let s put it away for what s happening in the stock market so we watched the bitcoin prices very carefully because we just don t know where they re going to go we re now roughly at about 19 20 000 but it could go down to 10 000 and that would be really a very pessimistic scenario for many people q how would gold do in a scenario like this the one that you re painting bitcoin down to 10 000 another leg down for the s p 500 how do you see gold fairing i think gold will do fairly well and that d be fairly steady i m not saying go through the roof but i m saying that gold will probably hold its own and perform better in such an environment q now you know sitting in india a lot of people are actually very enthused by the relative outperformance some see it as a risk that india has not fallen anywhere close to how much even the s p 500 has fallen this year but some take comfort from the fact that india is actually standing out and being so resilient as a market how do you see this cookie crumbling do you see the relative outperformance continuing or valuations actually acting against india in the next leg down which you expect to come i think india will continue to outperform not that the market won t go down if there s a global downturn then india will be affected but india definitely will outperform and part of the reason of course is the fundamentals of the indian economy the reserve bank rbi has done a fairly good job in managing the money supply and so forth most importantly the government has moved to improve investment conditions so they re attracting more and more high tech manufacturing that is now in china and elsewhere in india and this so called gati shakti programme to speed up approvals and speed up the government bureaucracy in india is going to be incredible it s going to have a big effect and a very positive effect on the indian economy q where would you be positioned mark as an investor in india i mean if you were running emerging market money now and you said this is an outperforming market i want to be here what would you buy because traditionally large global investors like you have bought it and banks the two big sectors in india but it has come under the clouds because of the global headwinds what would be the right way to be positioned at this point well we still like indian software you know india is a leader globally in the software market i think they will continue to improve and there ll be lots of opportunities in that area the other is infrastructure related stocks stocks that deal with pipes and tubes stocks in the supply of high tech kinds of things for the construction industry i think that would be a good area to be because a lot of the infrastructure projects in india will be accelerated as we ve offered the new government policies so i would say those would be the two areas and possibly in healthcare more and more indians are taking advantage of better healthcare and they have the money to do so and that will be a growth area q when you say healthcare do you mean hospital chains diagnostic companies those names or pharmaceutical companies diagnostic in hospitals most importantly and a few selected pharmaceuticals q what is your base case assumption that this over the next 12 months it still is a market where it s difficult to make money for equity investors that this bear market actually extends through the next 12 months because the last 12 months have been flat for equity market investors they have not made any money do you expect one more year of paying ahead i think perhaps a half year of pain is ahead but you must remember even in this painful situation there s money to be made as i mentioned if you have companies that have good pricing power strong balance sheets and so forth they re going to take market share away from their competitors and they re going to do very well so you know if the index is going down it doesn t mean that all the stocks have to go down but generally speaking yes there s probably more pain generally in the index ahead and one of the reasons for that of course is the ukrainian situation you must remember that the ukraine situation could get worse before it gets better and that can have a global impact in many different directions there are winners and losers there as well because although russia is going to be selling less gas and oil to europe other countries will be selling more so that probably is one of the reasons why the us dollar is strong because the dollar has become an important currency to buy oil and gas from the us
menafn jordan times ithaca the post covid recovery has run out of steam the latest update to the brookings financial times tracking indexes for the global economic recovery shows that growth momentum as well as financial market and confidence indicators have deteriorated markedly around the world in recent months and as the global economy stalls amid heightened uncertainty and rising risks many countries are either in or on the brink of outright recession some wounds have been self inflicted misguided policies like china s zero covid strategy and the united kingdom s reckless mini budget have made it harder for policymakers to respond to ongoing supply chain disruptions and the protracted war in ukraine high and persistent inflation worldwide and the actions central banks have taken to rein it in are also depressing economic activity weakening household and business confidence and roiling financial markets in major advanced economies like the eurozone japan and the uk sluggish and tepid policy responses have compounded the effects of external shocks knocking growth trajectories off track consequently many developed countries now face the challenges that have long characterised periods of economic and financial stress in emerging market economies steep currency depreciations relative to the us dollar rising government bond yields strained public finances and tightening policy constraints the us economy for its part is rife with conflicting signals on the positive side consumer demand remains strong and employment has continued to grow at a reasonably healthy pace at the same time gdp growth is anemic while inflation remains high by any measure leaving the federal reserve with little choice but to hike interest rates further despite the tightening of financial conditions caused by a strong dollar and falling asset prices in europe energy supply disruptions are fueling inflation and constraining growth stoking fears of energy shortages in the winter and undermining private sector confidence the recent plunge in the pound s value is emblematic of the many challenges facing the uk economy including adverse external circumstances the ongoing fallout from brexit and the country s undisciplined fiscal policies in many other european countries populist policies could increase the risk of fiscal and financial instability japan is the only major advanced economy that has the luxury of maintaining an easy monetary policy thanks to its low inflation rate this could help the country sustain stable albeit low growth as the yen s rapid depreciation has not had any appreciable negative effects thus far while emerging market economies face similar challenges including high inflation and depreciating currencies they generally have better growth prospects than their advanced economy counterparts still weak demand worldwide and tighter financial conditions will increase pressure on developing economies with current account deficits but barring a few exceptions like turkey sri lanka and venezuela where rampant economic mismanagement has precipitated currency collapses most emerging markets do not seem to be heading toward a balance of payments crisis that said china is facing a raft of problems resulting from the government s rigid adherence to its zero covid policy a faltering real estate sector and unsustainable financial system pressures while inflation remains under control the renminbi s depreciation relative to the us dollar has limited the people s bank of china s pboc ability to cut interest rates the government and the pboc have implemented several fiscal and monetary stimulus measures but these have had limited effect on private consumption and investment export growth too is likely to be restrained by weak global demand india s economy on the other hand remains a bright spot the country is likely to register strong growth this year and in 2023 as exports rise owing to the rupee s depreciation and the beneficial effects of various reforms undertaken in recent years but the reserve bank of india s ongoing struggle to rein in high inflation is a constraining factor meanwhile russia s economy has been battered by the economic and financial sanctions that western powers have imposed since its invasion of ukraine although rising export revenues and weak imports have softened the blow by strengthening the ruble latin american currencies have done surprisingly well this year but brazil and many other countries in the region face challenging political environments which could dampen domestic demand and growth scare off foreign investors and foment economic instability governments and central banks no longer have the luxury of stabilising growth and offsetting adverse shocks with unfettered fiscal and monetary stimulus at a minimum governments must avoid poorly targeted fiscal measures and other unhelpful populist policies do what they can to overcome supply bottlenecks and support central banks as they strive to restore price stability an ineffective policy response endangers those hit hardest by food and energy price increases the world s poorest economies and the poorest households in every country with little room for maneuver policymakers must coordinate fiscal and monetary measures to alleviate short term inflationary pressures and focus on reforms that can improve long term growth in addition to mitigating labour supply and trade constraints they must create incentives for investment in green technologies and other types of

menafn jordan times by raghuram g rajan and viral acharya chicago new york the malfunctioning of the government bond market in a developed economy is an early warning of potential financial instability in the united kingdom the new government s proposed mini budget raised the specter of unsustainable sovereign debt and led to a dramatic widening in long term gilt yields recognising the systemic importance of the government bond market the bank of england boe correctly stepped in both pausing its plan to unload gilts from its balance sheet and announcing that it will buy gilts over a fortnight at a scale near that of its planned sales for the next 12 months markets have since calmed down but as commendable as the boe s prompt response has been we must ask what blame central banks bear for financial markets current fragility after all while long term gilt yields have stabilised gilt market liquidity judging by bid ask spreads has not improved and across the atlantic the market for us treasuries is also raising liquidity concerns many metrics are flashing red just like at the onset of the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 and in the aftermath of lehman brothers failure in 2008 after two years of quantitative easing qe when central banks buy long term bonds from the private sector and issue liquid reserves in return central banks around the world have begun to shrink their balance sheets and liquidity seems to have vanished in the space of just a few months why has quantitative tightening qt produced that result in a recent paper co authored with rahul chauhan and sascha steffen which we presented at the federal reserve fed bank of kansas city s jackson hole conference in august we show that qe may be quite difficult to reverse because the financial sector has become dependent on easy liquidity this dependency arises in multiple ways commercial banks which typically hold the reserves supplied by central banks during qe finance their own asset purchases with short term demand deposits that represent potent claims on their liquidity in tough times moreover although advanced economy central bank reserves are the safest assets on the planet they offer low returns so commercial banks have created additional revenue streams by offering reserve backed liquidity insurance to others this generally takes the form of higher credit card limits for households contingent credit lines to asset managers and non financial corporations and broker dealer relationships that promise to help speculators meet margin calls demands for additional cash collateral the speculators are not limited to hedge funds as we recently learned in the uk rather they also include normally staid pension funds that have engaged in so called liability driven investment to compensate for the qe induced low return on long term gilts they increased the risk profile of their other assets taking on more leverage and hedging any interest risk with derivatives while their hedged position ensured that an interest rate increase would have an equal impact on their asset and liability values it also generated margin calls on their derivative positions lacking the cash to meet these calls they were reliant on bankers with spare liquidity for support in sum during periods of qe the financial sector generates substantial potential claims on liquidity effectively eating up much of the issued reserves the quantity of spare liquidity is thus much smaller than that of issued reserves which can become a big problem in the event of a shock such as a government induced scare our study also finds that in the case of the united states qt makes conditions even tighter still because the financial sector does not quickly shrink the claims that it has issued on liquidity even as the central bank takes back reserves this too makes the system vulnerable to shocks an accident waiting to happen during the last episode of qt in the us even relatively small unexpected increases in liquidity demand such as a surge in the treasury s account at the fed caused massive dislocation in treasury repo markets that is exactly what happened in september 2019 prompting the fed to resume its liquidity injections the onset of the pandemic in march 2020 was an even larger liquidity shock with corporations drawing down credit lines from banks and speculators seeking help in meeting margin calls central banks duly flooded the system with reserves one can only imagine the scale of the intervention that would have been needed if the shock had been as bad as the one in 2008 an even deeper crisis would have prompted some depositors to dash for cash causing some banks to hoard spare liquidity to meet unexpected claims on the deposits they had amassed during the boom times put differently the larger the scale and the longer the duration of qe the greater the liquidity that financial markets become accustomed to and the longer it will take for central banks to normalise their balance sheets but since financial real and fiscal shocks do not respect central banks timetables they often will force fresh central bank interventions as we saw in the uk monetary policymakers thus find themselves in a very difficult position a central bank may need to raise rates to reduce inflation but if it also must simultaneously supply liquidity to stabilise government bond markets it risks sending a mixed message about its policy stance not to mention raising concerns that it has become a direct financier of the government not only does this complicate policy communication it also could prolong the fight against inflation while central banks have always had a duty to provide emergency liquidity doing so on a sustained large scale basis is an entirely different kettle of fish our findings suggest that qe will be quite difficult to reverse not least because qt itself increases the system s vulnerability to shocks while the boe deserves praise for riding to the rescue central banks more generally need to reflect on their own role in making the system so vulnerable raghuram g rajan former governor of the reserve bank of india is professor of finance at the

oklahoma s two wealthiest members of congress became a lot wealthier last year and all seven current members appear to be better fixed financially than their nov 8 opponents according to their most recent federal financial disclosure reports the reports cover calendar year 2021 and were filed this past summer they are required of all current members as well as non incumbent candidates who have raised or spent more than 5 000 on their campaigns the reports include assets and transactions involving congressional spouses and dependent children jointly or individually because asset values are reported in broad ranges the reports provide only a broad financial picture in all cases oklahoma incumbents personal wealth greatly exceeds that of their challengers or at least appears to 10 candidates on next month s congressional ballot including three democrats have not filed financial disclosures the largest advantages are enjoyed by 2nd district congressman and republican u s senate nominee markwayne mullin and 1st district congressman kevin hern both are multimillionaires whose pockets appear to have gotten much deeper in 2021 hern reported assets worth between 39 8 million and 142 7 million a year earlier hern reported a range of 28 2 million to 97 8 million mullin meanwhile saw his reported assets balloon from a range of 7 3 million to 29 9 million at the end of 2020 to a range of 31 6 million to 75 6 million hern s general election opponent democrat adam martin hasn t filed a financial disclosure even though his federal election commission reports indicate he s spent about 23 000 on his campaign martin said this summer that he works for a roofing company mullin s democratic opponent former 5th district congresswoman kendra horn lists assets of between 67 000 and 181 000 and a student loan balance of 15 000 50 000 she also reported being paid 135 000 in consultant fees in 2021 including 95 000 from the chickasaw nation mullin s big jump in reported assets apparently results from the sale of his plumbing related companies to hometown services a multi state residential heating air conditioning plumbing and electrical company the sale is not specifically listed under transactions for 2021 but a stake in hometown valued at 1 million 5 million and an investment of 25 million 50 million in a cash management fund both dated dec 10 2021 are separately the report lists the asset value of five plumbing related businesses as none but with income including capital gains of at least 8 2 million however the income from one of those companies mullin plumbing inc is listed listed only as over 5 million in 2020 mullin reported the value of the five companies mullin environmental mullin plumbing east mulling plumbing west mullin services and mullin plumbing inc as between 3 5 million and 16 5 million mullin plumbing east had a listed value of 1 001 15 000 with no income in 2020 but with no value and 100 001 1 million in income a year later rights to the mullin plumbing trade name were transferred to hometown in may according to oklahoma secretary of state records mullin has been reluctant to talk about the sale citing confidentiality agreements requests for comment have not been answered it is not unusual for members wealth to increase during their time in office just as it would not be unusual for any americans wealth to grow during their lifetimes in a june fox business interview though mullin and commentator maria bartiromo questioned how democratic speaker of the house nancy pelosi and her husband paul pelosi were able to accumulate tens of millions of dollars during her 35 years in congress i tell people that the worst business investment my wife and i ever made was us coming to washington d c because we re not trying to take advantage of it mullin told bartiromo mullin came under scrutiny for insider trading after he bought a biotech stock touted by colleague chris collins of new york mullin denied the accusation and wound up selling the stock at a loss kendra horn mullin s democratic opponent said mullin thinks the rules don t apply to him this fits right in with the pattern of corruption and self dealing that markwayne used to make himself 10 times richer while in congress the sale of businesses his last remaining mcdonald s restaurants also seem to be a factor in hern s apparent increase in wealth his report says the restaurants owned jointly with wife tammy hern were sold for 25 million 50 million on april 26 2021 ranked among the wealthiest members of congress hern is by far the oklahoma delegation s most active investor and is still involved in several businesses mostly with his wife his report also includes information on trusts under the names of his three children by way of comparison hern s 2021 financial disclosure report is 72 pages the other six oklahoma members range from three to 14 at least four of oklahoma s seven current members are millionaires but one of those

in honor of hispanic heritage month one writer delves into the history of the old spanish trail and outlines how best to visit the trail today getty images antonio armijo had a vision in 1829 at just 25 years old antonio armijo set out to find a new path westward he led a party of 60 men and 100 mules across the vast landscape between what is now santa fe new mexico and los angeles at the time of his journey this region was still part of northern mexico in the hopes of discovering prosperous land for himself and his community what he found was much larger than the 61 people who set out on the expedition ultimately he created a path for hundreds of others to follow the old spanish trail courtesy of nps the old spanish trail lets us reframe the way we think of american history guy mcclellan ph d and historian for the national trails office of the national park service told travel leisure it s important to recognize the northern expansion of spanish culture he explained that while many consider only the united states migration in the 1800s from east to west it is more accurate to also acknowledge the northern frontier expansion of mexico and new spain armijo s journey which came in at just over 1 000 miles began in sante fe headed west to abiquiu new mexico and then onto page arizona las vegas barstow california and finally los angeles the path used by subsequent traders eventually forked into three trails armijo s path then two additional smaller trails that head farther north to destinations like taos new mexico but eventually reconnect with the original trail these three pathways now make up the official 2 700 mile national historic trail william dummitt getty images armijo s trek was a significant one for hispanic heritage though it also presents challenges for researchers as he kept a diary some call aggravatingly brief about the experience as it finally realized the long held dream to connect santa fe and l a for trading purposes the route was not entirely unknown to armijo or his contemporaries in fact it had been traveled for years prior by indigenous people making their way to the california coast and other hispanic explorers attempting their own journeys west he had the knowledge of both his ancestors and others before him working in his favor but his efforts enabled travelers to traverse back and forth along a more direct path between present day new mexico and california creating commerce and community building opportunities they settled in california it wasn t a one and done angélica sánchez clark ph d and fellow historian with the national trails said some of the family members come back to new mexico and others make a concerted effort to settle communities in southern california really connects these two really important places as the state historic preservation office of nevada noted though the old spanish trail was difficult and perilous the benefits could not be ignored perils included those by mother nature dangerous stretches of craggy mountains raging rivers and desert landscapes that could swing from sweltering to freezing all too quickly mcclellan added one explorer wrote in their log that they encountered deep snows and solitary gloom and needed to get bailed out on more than one occasion by indigenous peoples along the way but the landscape wasn t the only treacherous part of the expedition so too were the plentiful horse thieves who roamed the trail transporting stolen stock taken from california s ranchos and missions and those who used it to funnel indigenous captives to new mexico or california the trail wasn t always a place of peace sánchez clark said but for decades it prevailed in its mission to transport goods and people between the two cities however after the end of the mexican american war in 1848 mexico ceded the region to the u s the trails once used by mules shifted and instead were replaced by wagonways thus the old spanish trail made famous by armijo some 30 years earlier was abandoned and almost forgotten until 2002 when it was revived and officially designated by congress as one of the country s 19 national historic trails though you can t hike the path taken by armijo in its entirety unless you want to walk along some of america s busiest highways you can visit key sections of the trail on day trips or by undertaking one epic road trip to see as many of its significant stops as you can getty images the trail functions via a partnership between the national park service and the bureau of land management and with the help of tireless volunteers from organizations like the old spanish trail association who maintain the trail physically and preserve it historically even now some 20 years after its congressional designation sánchez clark explained it s a work in progress but one her team is diligently working on to grow partnerships along the route to encourage more visitors for example at the trail s starting point in new mexico travelers can visit the museum of spanish colonial art which displays thousands of artifacts from before during and after the trail s heyday in california travelers can actually walk the pathway of armijo and his fellow trekkers in amargosa canyon which is home to a vast network of hiking trails that follow the same path used by the explorers those looking to feel even more grounded in the experience can also make their way to utah to further retrace the footsteps of these brave men and women by hiking the old spanish trail heritage loop where they may even come across old wagon ruts and other artifacts and in colorado travelers can stop at fort uncompahgre interpretive center a trading hub used by those traveling the trail that shows visitors an as authentic as possible recreation of the 1829 experience as mcclellan said the old spanish trail provides an opportunity to interrogate some of the biases that we might have and further gives us a chance to explore our collective history and some of the most beautiful stretches of our nation one mile at a time

wti crude oil soared 17 22 from last week s low to this week s high close front month wti futures closed 76 on monday september 26 the lowest level since the first week of january the damage to the nordstream pipelines was discovered that day since then prices have rallied sharply and closed this week at 93 30 the anticipation of and the fact that opec announced a 2 mbd cut in production quotas at their october 5th meeting in vienna together with apparent substantial short covering helped drive prices higher the fact that opec members had collectively been unable to produce sell their full quotas before the vienna meeting means that the amount of crude they will now be able to produce sell will probably only be diminished by 500 000bpd but that does not weaken their message opec is willing to restrict supply to maintain high prices despite the global inflationary impact of high energy prices given the direct secondary and tertiary impact of high energy prices on inflation the market has to expect that the opec decision means that leading central banks will remain more hawkish for longer as they try to dampen inflation with demand destruction policies western political

invasion and the price has dropped 400 global gold etfs have seen steady selling since the brief burst of buying around the russian invasion net selling ytd 28 tonnes the futures market and the etf market are telling us that people buy gold because they think the price will rise and when it doesn t they sell they are not on balance buying gold as insurance even though gold has dropped 400 from the march highs i think it would have dropped much more if it was only moving counter to the rise in the us dollar and real interest rates therefore i think there is some insurance buying of gold and or there is a growing unwillingness to be net short of gold at these prices and with the conditions we have in the world as my friend kevin muir keeps saying traders have to trade what they think will happen not what they think should happen so as much as i think gold should be catching an insurance bid it will probably take a perception that the fed is about to back off for the price to jump or a geo political shock buy insurance when you can not when you must markets struggle to adapt to the new paradigm for more than 20 years markets assumed that the fed had their back if something bad happened the fed would throw money at the problem leverage and risk taking had friends in high places but things changed inflation soared and friends found new priorities kill inflation at all costs and markets are struggling to adapt to the new paradigm how far does the stock market have to fall before finding the fed put the new paradigm stresses legacy positioning leverage and risk taking that had grown around the world for over two decades some things broke early and quickly aark and peleton and other things china real estate broke more slowly but with enough weight to risk collateral damage twenty years of low interest rates and ultra loose monetary policy created an environment of financial instability as people thought that environment would last forever now with interest rates rising swiftly everybody knows that something big is going to break the uk pension problem that caused the boe to do a 180 overnight may be foreshadowing bigger problems to come cash may be trash after taking inflation into account but at least the burn rate is less than what s happened in stocks and bonds and yet retail shows no signs of capitulation stock indices have been trending lower all year with the djia down 22 bond yields have been trending higher for three years and this year has been the worst year ever american 30 year mortgage rates are 6 75 the highest since 2006 if and when long term investors start to sell who will be the buyer important dates october 13 us cpi november 1 2 next fomc meeting november 8 midterms my short term trading i started the week long gold and long t note calls i bought the s p early monday i sold all three positions early tuesday i made 48 on gold 110 points on the s p and took a small loss on the t note calls by the end of the week the calls were virtually worthless i took my medicine at the right time i bought and sold the s p on wednesday for a small gain i did nothing on thursday on friday about two hours after the employment report i bought the canadian dollar it was the only currency that was trading green on the day against the usd the canadian employment report was ok canada looks like it will keep up with american interest rates soaring crude oil was giving cad a bid but the falling stock market was a drag on cad later in the day i covered the trade for a tiny loss the falling stock market was overpowering any lift from crude oil my profits this week more than made up for the losses i took the previous two weeks and i went into the weekend flat on my radar i can imagine a big quick breakdown a panic but isn t that priced in market sentiment seems to be extremely bearish but i think it s also fragile and another hit of bad news could kick off the falling dominos that doesn t mean that i ll jump on the short side i ll watch the price action and decide what to do but my bias is that the next 1 000 point move in the djia is more likely to be down than up but the market sentiment is so negative that if we start to rally we could see a decent move quote of the week the barney report we ve had an amazing indian summer since the end of august and barney and i have taken full advantage of it with plenty of long off leash afternoon walks in the sunshine the shorter days mean that the sun comes up about the same time as the stock index day session starts not a good time to be walking the dog but it teaches me

nearly all the equity market gains from the two day rally on monday and tuesday were wiped out by friday the table shows the peak value of the indexes at the turn of the year the index lows three of the four indexes had new lows on september 30 the percentage change from the peak and where the closing prices stood on friday october 7 relative to their lows note that three of the four major indexes are close to their september 30 lows and as the week ended on a sour note are likely to test those lows as the new week begins equities peaks universal value advisors things aren t much better in bond land the 2 yr treasury closed the october 7 week at 4 31 slightly above its close of 4 27 the prior week only the baby boomers remember those kinds of yields and while four basis points doesn t appear to be out of the ordinary that yield was as low as 4 10 on monday october 3 the 10 yr treasury displayed similar volatility 3 83 on september 30 3 62 on october 3 and closing the week october 7 at 3 88 the important 2s 10s spread inversion was 44 basis points bps at quarter s end and 43 bps at last week s close why so much volatility in the financial markets for equities september 30 was quarter s end and part of the sell off was due to window dressing on the part of fund managers not wanting to show high levels of equity holdings for the quarter end reporting period the monday tuesday rally was at least partly due to extremely oversold conditions but there was new sentiment in the market questioning the fed s ability to raise rates with a developing recession at home not to mention the struggles europe japan and other allies are having with the values of their currencies the impacts on their financial markets and the specter of a developing default cycle all due to an over zealous fed surely the fed would have to pay attention to such developments was the market sentiment during the monday tuesday rallies there was even a rumor on the october 1 2 weekend that the fed had called an emergency meeting to deal with such concerns indeed a fed meeting had been called but this fed s open market committee meets every month via zoom when a meeting is not listed and published on the public agenda the fed is required to use its emergency powers to call such a meeting it has done so every month this year outside of its regular schedule so the rumor turned out to be just a rumor besides the market being oversold much of the monday tuesday price spike was based on that hope i e that this fed had come to its senses and would not carry out its stated rate agenda on wednesday the australian central bank raised rates 25 basis points the market had anticipated 50 so there was still some hope that the fed might only raise 50 bps at its november meeting instead of the anticipated 75 unfortunately those hopes were dashed as fomc members bostic daly and williams put the kibosh on the notion that this fed would soon pause or deviate from its plan much less pivot anytime soon markets began slipping on wednesday and by friday those slips and slides turned into a rout the djia fell 630 the good news on friday the market plunge intensified because of the solid labor market report i e good economic news has now become bad news for financial markets as good economic numbers give the fed even more reason to be hawkish the payroll report number was 263k right around the expected level but what was unexpected was the fall in the unemployment rate from 3 7 to 3 5 remember the fed itself forecast a 4 4 unemployment rate by december thus the employment report put another nail in the hope coffin and on friday market participants threw in the towel us leading index universal value advisors how we know it s a recession sometimes history repeats itself most of the time it rhymes the conference board s leading economic indicator index lei for august fell 0 3 down six months in a row and in seven of the last eight chart historically when the lei is negative for six straight months a recession occurs 100 of the time the rule of thumb definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative gdp growth the reason for the rule of thumb is that when two such consecutive negative gdp quarters occur a recession results 100 of the time when a 40 basis point yield curve inversion between 2 yr 4 31 and 10 yr 3 88 treasuries occurs a recession follows 100 of the time when the equity market falls more than 30 nasdaq and russell 2000 so far history tells us that a recession occurs 100 of the time when bear markets end because the incoming data continues to point to recession even some of the sell side analysts goldman bac are now using the r word not capitalized because it is qualified by the m word mild they are now talking about when the bear market might end history tells us that bad stuff continues to happen in the economy after the fed s first rate cut that s because monetary policy acts with long lags over the last seven recessions the s p 500 low occurred on average 11 6 months median 10 months after that first rate cut the data ranges from two months 1980 recession to 21 months 2001 recession according to this fed

were created ytd on a seasonally adjusted basis 928k were added via the birth death small business automatic add on i e bls doesn t survey small business they just add a number based on a time trend when the economy is sputtering small business formation is unlikely in fact contraction is highly likely in our view the payroll data is deceiving final thoughts we are in a bear market in equities and for the first time in a simultaneous bear market in fixed income that s because the fed normally raises interest rates when the economy is expanding not when it is contracting the normal relationship between fixed income prices and equity prices is that when one is rising the other is falling and this has spawned the idea that investor portfolios should have both asset classes for balance this fed however is tightening into the teeth of a recession and the result has been bear markets in both asset classes given that the fed employs 300 400 economists they have to know what we have written here perhaps they are motivated by hurt pride they were criticized for their transitory inflation call and are now out to slay the inflation dragon unfortunately they are gazing through the rear view mirror using past inflation as their guide instead of looking at what s ahead and it turns out that much of the inflation was indeed transitory but with a 16 month time frame perhaps they see the equity and housing price bubbles and are out to prick those ouch and it is highly likely that there is a political agenda as the biden administration is on the hot seat for much of the inflation and the mid term elections are rapidly approaching note the fed itself had a lot to do with the inflation as the money supply grew at double digit rates via quantitative easing for much of 2020 and 2021 now we have quantitative tightening with negative money growth another worry as far as recession is concerned much of the inflation is now in the rear view mirror considering falling commodity prices and shipping rates slowing demand falling real take home pay and 0 cpi for july and august combined the best word to describe current fed policy is overkill while most of the inflation is behind us most of the recession lies ahead by the time this fed recognizes reality the economy and financial markets will be in deep trouble as indicated above this fed is also having a huge impact worldwide the consequences of that could ultimately be significant for the dollar s reserve currency status the loss of which would have dire implications for the u s economy joshua barone

global finance chiefs gather in washington in the coming days with the warning of a possible 4 trillion loss in the world s economic output ringing in their ears that s the germany sized hole in the growth outlook through 2026 that international monetary fund chief kristalina georgieva identified last week as a looming risk she ll play host as central bankers finance ministers and others confront the fallout on the global economy of rampant inflation aggressive monetary policy tightening rising debt and the biggest ground war in europe since world war ii that the imf and world bank annual meetings will be fully in person for the first time since the outbreak of covid 19 in early 2020 showing progress in bringing the pandemic to heel will be of limited comfort given other headaches the current confluence of economic climate and security crises makes it unlike anything global policy makers have seen since 1945 yet certain elements such as the emerging market havoc wreaked by federal reserve interest rate hikes in the early 1980s chime with the present predicament the big question for the meetings is what are we going to do in terms of the institutional response to this beyond business as usual masood ahmed president of the washington based center for global development said last week here s a quick look at some issues officials will grapple with elsewhere this week a faster core inflation reading in the us uk financial stability news a south korean rate hike and the nobel prize for economics will be among highlights in the us the consumer price index is the highlight in the coming week the labor department s report on thursday will offer fed officials a snapshot of how inflationary pressures are evolving after a series of huge interest rate increases economists estimate the cpi rose 8 1 per cent in september from a year ago marking a deceleration from the prior month s 8 3 per cent annual increase as energy prices settled back however excluding fuel and food the so called core cpi is still accelerating it s expected to show a 6 5 per cent annual gain versus 6 3 per cent in august an increase of that magnitude in the core measure would match the largest advance since 1982 illustrating stubborn inflation and keeping the pump primed for a fourth straight 75 basis point rate increase at the fed s november meeting investors will hear from a

global economic slowdown the week will be capped by retail sales data economists forecast a modest monthly advance in september helped by a pickup in purchases of motor vehicles excluding cars the value of retail sales is seen declining for a second month because the figures aren t adjusted for inflation the data suggest demand for merchandise slowed in the third quarter asia bank of korea governor rhee chang yong may resort to a mini u turn on the scale of rate hikes while he returned to the usual quarter point increment in august many economists see him opting for a move twice that

abstract proponents of obamacare claim that it will simultaneously provide millions of americans with health insurance and reduce the budget deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars yet obamacare s proclaimed budgetary discipline rests on unlikely assumptions and budget gimmicks none worse than the class act a national long term care insurance program class is essentially a ponzi scheme that will run initial surpluses followed by massive deficits virtually guaranteeing program bankruptcy or more likely massive taxpayer bailouts the surest way to avoid this fate is to repeal the program preferably before it enrolls participants on january 1 2011 the heritage foundation s brian m riedl and visiting fellow james capretta explain why repeal is the right action for congress to take proponents of the recently enacted health law argue that it will provide millions of americans with health insurance as it simultaneously eases budgetary pressures with entitlement reform what they do not mention is that their claims of budgetary discipline depend on a series of implausible assumptions and budget gimmicks none more egregious than the inclusion of the community living assistance services and supports act class act in the final legislation the class act s stated purpose is to provide a fully funded insurance program for long term care ltc assistance the program has no bearing on the other provisions of the new law which are aimed at expanding and regulating health insurance coverage for acute care the obama administration and congress chose to attach the class act to the broader health legislation for one reason only it made the budget numbers look better on paper budget gimmicks are sometimes relatively benign and inconsequential accounting tricks but not so in this case the class act hitched a ride on the health law to help hide the near term budgetary costs of a major medicaid expansion and a new subsidy program for health insurance but in so doing congress created another ticking entitlement time bomb that is certain to explode on future taxpayers if not defused sooner rather than later class act basics the class act is a national insurance program for ltc assistance current workers pay premiums set by the department of health and human services hhs and then qualify for financial assistance also determined by hhs should they meet the ltc assistance criteria the criteria are based on difficulty in meeting the normal activities of daily living required to remain independent class is voluntary employers can choose to enroll their workers in the program and employees can opt out on a worker by worker basis premiums are paid entirely by those workers who elect to stay in the program class is funded on a pay as you go basis premium payments from current workers will finance benefit payouts for beneficiaries mainly disabled and retired former workers who qualify for assistance insurance experts including the chief actuary for the medicare program who have analyzed the class act believe it is near certain to suffer from adverse selection that is because it is voluntary and enrollment is likely to be relatively expensive only workers who already suffer from some conditions that make them high risks for disability will want to sign up consequently premiums are likely to fall short of obligations forcing administrators to either raise premiums even more or cut promised benefits this will further discourage healthy workers from participating the class act double count it is easy to see why senate budget committee chairman kent conrad d nd called class a ponzi scheme of the first order the kind of thing that bernie madoff would have been proud of common sense says one cannot spend the same dollar twice but that is exactly what congress intends to do with premiums collected under class the congressional budget office cbo projects that class will produce a total 70 billion surplus by 2019 but this surplus is temporary resulting from a mismatch between class s evolution and the 10 year window used for congressional budget assessments class s program rules require that participants pay five years worth of premiums before becoming eligible for payouts which means that class will begin collecting premiums in 2011 but not pay out benefits until 2016 from that point forward annual program surpluses will begin declining as class pays benefits to an escalating population of retiring baby boomers depending on future premium increases or benefit cuts a broad range of experts expect the program to fall into permanent deficit at some point in the 2020s or early 2030s once class falls into deficit the excess premiums collected in the program s initial years of operation would be needed to cover growing benefit obligations but the administration and congressional leaders will have already spent that 70 billion initial surplus to partially cover the massive multi trillion dollar costs of their other health care ambitions so when the class act runs short of funding congress will have to either tax or borrow an additional 70 billion to compensate for having already spent the class act funds on another entitlement program budget rules require congress to pay for only the first decade of new programs the class act gimmick was popular because it gave the appearance of paying for two new entitlements in short congressional leaders shamelessly decided to take advantage of this mismatch in timing between class act premiums and payouts they are using the same 70 billion to pay for expanded health insurance over the next 10 years and again later to pay for ltc claims but of course common sense has it right it is not possible to spend the same money twice what congress has really done is hide an additional 70 billion in new government debt incurred to pay for future class act spending by employing a gimmick another future liability dumped on our children and grandchildren other taxpayer costs class is supposed to be fully self financing and therefore not cost taxpayers a dime this status is notionally guaranteed by language empowering the secretary of health and human services to adjust premiums and benefits as necessary to keep the program solvent over a 75 year period even in the unlikely event that this occurs future taxpayers will still be forced to subsidize the program when that initial 70 billion surplus is lent to the treasury to shore up obamacare s deficits it will begin earning interest on those bonds this interest income can then be counted as program revenues to keep class solvent and who pays the interest on these government bonds the taxpayers additionally even the 70 billion in future taxes that will be necessary to replenish the raided funds will shore up the program s deficits for only a few years after that additional bailouts will likely be needed class is designed similarly to the social security program its initial surpluses will be diverted into other government spending eventually the program will fall into deficit and without accumulated assets only ious leave future taxpayers on the hook for promises made long ago like all ponzi schemes the early class participants will get full benefits while later participants and in this case taxpayers lose their shirts possible outcomes class appears to have been designed more to subsidize the first decade of obamacare than to provide a sustainable long term health care program this poorly crafted program will likely have one of the four following outcomes death spiral followed by bankruptcy as stated above the secretary of health and human services is empowered to adjust premiums as necessary to keep the program solvent for 75 years however for healthy individuals class will likely charge higher premiums and pay lower benefits than what is currently available on the market as healthy individuals bypass the program only those who expect to incur substantial long term costs will find it profitable to participate maintaining solvency would then require broad based premium increases or benefit cuts which would subsequently drive more of the comparatively healthy participants and potential participants out of the program requiring additional premium increases or benefit cuts for the dwindling number of participants this adverse selection death spiral would eventually bankrupt the program lawmakers are highly unlikely to allow this outcome program bankruptcy would mean that lawmakers created an entitlement collected premiums and then failed to provide the promised benefits this is no more likely to happen than washington announcing to all retirees turning 65 that they will not receive any social security benefits despite a lifetime of payroll taxes

participation class is guaranteed issue meaning all workers 18 and older regardless of health status are eligible to enroll additionally class is prohibited from charging higher premiums to those with higher health risks who will likely require more benefits which also means that healthy individuals who require fewer benefits would not receive a discount lawmakers could avoid an adverse selection death spiral by requiring that all american adults participate in the program this would ensure that enough healthy individuals pay class premiums to subsidize those who require large benefits this outcome is also unlikely healthy individuals rationally intend to bypass class because it is a bad deal for them especially compared to insurance policies they could purchase on the open market a compulsory participation law would concede this point because its purpose would be for washington to use the net profits from healthy participants to subsidize the chronically sick politically requiring everyone to pay an expensive premium for a benefit that only a few want would be enormously unpopular not to mention unaffordable for low income individuals class is guaranteed issue meaning

way to shore up class and pay all promised benefits would be with another taxpayer bailout unlike the troubled asset relief program tarp this would not be a one time bailout but would continue as long as anyone who has ever paid into the system may require benefits given america s serious long term budget challenges trillion dollar budget deficits and the challenge of paying social security and medicare benefits to 77 million baby boomers taxpayers cannot afford yet another expensive permanent bailout with washington unlikely to accept the two options above the only way to shore up class and pay all promised benefits would be with another taxpayer bailout unlike the troubled asset relief program tarp this would not be a one time bailout but would continue as long as anyone who has ever paid into the system may require benefits given america s serious long term budget challenges trillion dollar budget deficits and the challenge of paying social security and medicare benefits to 77 million baby boomers taxpayers cannot afford yet another expensive permanent bailout repeal class the only way to avoid program bankruptcy or more likely decades of taxpayer bailouts is to repeal the program preferably before it begins enrolling participants and collecting premiums on january 1 2011 nonsensically repealing this budget busting program would actually violate the pay as you go paygo rule but not the separate paygo law paygo is supposed to ensure that tax and entitlement legislation does not increase the budget deficit over the following decade because class would save 70 billion over the first decade it passes the paygo fiscal responsibility test even if it runs up trillions of dollars in debt after 2020 the flip side is that repealing class would violate the paygo rule even as it saves trillions of dollars over the long run class is yet another example of paygo s failed approach to deficit reduction congress was able to count this unsustainable new entitlement as a deficit reducer that would hide the rest of the health care law s deficits over the first decade if the true spirit of paygo is to prevent deficit spending then congress should set aside the paygo rule and repeal this debt ridden entitlement stopping a mistake before it starts the history of federal entitlement programs provides a cautionary lesson with a few exceptions once a federal entitlement is started it has been extremely difficult to reverse course citizens who participate in the program become strongly invested in its continuation and politicians are not eager to be accused of reneging on a government promise so even if class is widely seen as structurally unsound in future years congress may very well find it difficult to cut off enrollment if a large number of people have already signed up for it and are receiving or expecting to receive its benefits consequently the most prudent step is for congress to repeal the class act before any enrollment has started under the terms of the new law the program could begin accepting enrollments as early as january 2011 but it now seems more likely that the program will not launch until regulations give it more definition perhaps several months later regardless it would be far preferable to reverse course on class before the program builds momentum toward implementation congress must act now proponents of the new health law have claimed repeatedly that it will improve the nation s long term budget outlook that is an illusion based on implausible assumptions sleights of hand and outright budget gimmicks with class topping the list the class act is an ill conceived concept that was included in obamacare only because of the appearance of surplus funding in reality class is destined to run short of funds creating pressure for another massive taxpayer bailout the biggest threat to the long term prosperity of the country is the massive unfunded liabilities for the nation s major entitlement program the last thing congress should be doing is adding to the burden of future taxpayers which is why class act repeal is the most fiscally responsible and ethical course to follow james c capretta

artificial diamonds produced by henan huanghe whirlwind co ltd in changge city henan province xinhua a trending hashtag henan province has become the largest producer of cultured diamonds in the world has become popular on multiple social media platforms recently in 2021 global lab grown diamond output reached 9 million karats of which 4 million was produced in zhecheng a county in henan as the name suggests lab grown diamonds are diamonds that are produced in a lab using the same extreme forcesâ temperature and pressureâ that form naturally created diamonds there is no chemical optical or physical difference between a lab grown diamond and a natural one lab grown diamonds are manufactured using either the high pressure and high temperature hpht process or the chemical vapor deposition cvd process both use a tiny seed diamond the cvd method places a tiny diamond seed inside a chamber that can be taken to extremely high temperature and pressure carbon rich gases are pumped into the chamber with the extreme heat breaking the molecular bonds in the gases releasing the carbon which then attaches directly onto the seed diamond the surface of which provides a template for the arrangement of the carbon atoms into new layers of diamond the hpht method places a tiny diamond seed into the center of high purity source of solid carbon which is then heated and compressed the resulting molten carbon then forms new layers of diamond on the seed in a similar manner to the vaporized carbon atoms of the cvd method american corporation general electric created the first batch of cultured diamonds in 1954 artificial diamond products produced by a graphite factory in jixi heilongjiang province xinhua strong technological foundations why has henan become the world s factory for lab grown diamonds the province in central china has solid technological foundations for producing artificial diamonds in the 1950s zhengzhou capital of henan was assigned by the central government to develop the abrasive industry zhengzhou research institute for abrasive and grinding zzsm established in 1958 was a leader of the industry as one of the hardest materials in nature diamond is an important industrial material in addition to being prized as jewelry in the 1950s china relied on imports of diamonds for industrial use to shed the reliance on imports the country launched a research project to develop artificial diamonds in 1963 the zzsm developed a press a machine for creating diamonds in december that same year china succeeded in producing its first created diamond using the machine in 1965 the institute developed a new press which has production efficiency 10 times higher than the one developed in 1963 which made it possible to carry out the industrialized production of artificial diamonds in the 1980s feng jinzhang an engineer with the zzsm returned to his hometown the aforementioned zhecheng to start a diamond factory the factory produced micron diamond powder an ideal material for griding and polishing super hard materials such as optical glass later more micron diamond powder factories were established in the county making it a major producer of the material by 2000 and forming the foundation for the artificial diamond industry today since 2009 a batch of factories have been introduced to the county establishing a complete artificial diamond industrial chain in september last year the county s henan liliang diamond co ltd went public on the shenzhen stock exchange and in july this year the county s huifeng diamond co ltd went public on the beijing stock exchange in addition to companies in zhecheng the zzsm also cooperates with artificial diamond companies in other parts of henan such as zhongnan diamond co ltd in nanyang market prospects cultured diamonds are gaining more recognition globally in 2018 the u s federal trade commission issued a new guideline saying lab grown diamonds are diamonds too and now steers clear of the words synthetic and lab grown that same year technological advances led to retail prices of artificial diamonds being greatly reduced now the cost of cultivating 1 karat of diamond is around 3 000 yuan 419 4 10 times less than the cost in 2018 according to brilliant under pressure the global diamond industry 2020â 21 report released last february by american management consulting firm bain company in collaboration with the antwerp world diamond center the retail price difference between natural and synthetic stones has widened yet again the retail price of a 1 karat lab created diamond fell to only 35 percent of an equivalent mined diamond in 2019 and 2018 this figure was 50 percent and in 2017 it was 65 percent many foreign companies have realized the market potential and come up with their own artificial diamond brands for instance in 2016 swarovski came up with the diama lab grown diamond brand and in 2018 natural diamond giant de beers launched artificial diamond brand lightbox jewelry domestic jewelry companies have also delved into the field of artificial diamonds in recent years shanghai yuyuan tourist mart co ltd the parent company of shanghai laomiao gold co ltd launched its artificial diamond brand lusant in august last year and jewelry company mclon based in hangzhou zhejiang province established artificial diamond brand own shine this year the lab grown diamond industry is a lucrative one according to sinolink securities the lab created diamond jewelry industry has a gross profit rate of 50 to 60 percent and a net profit rate of 10 to 20 percent the upstream industry also has high profits according to the half year report of liliang diamond released in august its lab grown diamond has a gross profit rate of 83 percent the profitability of the lab grown diamond jewelry industry has also attracted investors attention at the end of last year manmade diamond jewelry brand light mark received an investment of 130 million yuan 18 2 million according to guotai junan securities the u s accounts for 80 percent of the global created diamond consumer market while china is still at the stage of consumer education yang fan deputy general manager of divine diamond co ltd told the beijing business today newspaper that the development of the artificial diamond market relies on continuous consumer education which needs to be supported by strong networks of offline outlets solely relying on promotions of new brands cannot drive the development of the market wang dongwei chairman of zhongtai capital investment management co ltd told the beijing business today that cultured diamonds provide more choices for consumers on a limited budget however the market will become more

new state and local property tax exemptions worked as intended in mclennan county dropping total taxes levied on owners with homestead exemptions by almost 3 compared to last year according to data compiled by the local appraisal district but that spells higher bills for the 41 of county residents who rent and for commercial property owners total taxes levied on mclennan county residences without a homestead exemption mostly rental properties increased by 23 year over year the levy on commercial properties increased by 7 a greater share of this year s tax levy imposed by all entities in mclennan county comes from rental properties a contributing factor to increasing rent costs the majority of taxing entities in the county lowered their tax rates or maintained last year s rate in the face of countywide taxable property values that increased by 3 2 billion or about 15 compared to last year overall for the county tax rates are going down over time which it should as values go up said joe don bobbitt chief appraiser for the mclennan county appraisal district the shift of tax burden away from homeowners and onto other property owners came with expanded homestead exemptions voters statewide approved a measure in may to expand the school tax homestead exemption available for properties that serve as the owner s primary residence from a 25 000 reduction of taxed value to a 40 000 reduction the waco city council followed up in june by increasing waco s general homestead exemption from 10 to 15 increasing the city s exemption for homeowners 65 or older from 5 000 to 50 000 and adding a new 50 000 exemption for homeowners with disabilities woodway which does not have a general homestead exemption expanded its exemption for homeowners 65 and older from 10 000 to 20 000 and added a 20 000 exemption for homeowners with disabilities anything that is not a property with a homestead exemption probably went up bobbitt said according to bobbitt who used weighted averages to prevent new properties or exemption status changes from skewing the data taxes all entities in mclennan county levied on residences without homestead exemptions increased by 9 from 2020 to 2021 then 23 from 2021 to 2022 while taxes levied on houses with an exemption increased by 3 from 2020 to 2021 then decreased by 3 from 2021 to 2022 and taxes levied on commercial properties dipped by 7 from 2020 to 2021 then increased by 7 from 2021 to 2022 while homeowners overall are seeing a dip in property taxes this year individual cases vary significantly and often eye popping value increases led to a jump in owners filing formal protests of property values set by the appraisal district the number of protests this year hit 19 000 compared to 15 000 last year bobbitt has said the vast majority of property value protests have been settled by this point in the year one of the few homeowners still fighting their valuations is local physician practice consultant john eagle who said he hired a startup to argue on his behalf this time around after he was unsuccessful last year he bought his home in the brookview neighborhood in may 2020 taking advantage of low interest rates available at the time eagle said the home was a steal at about 160 000 but since then his appraisal has increased by about 50 000 he and his wife have invested in the pale yellow house remodeling parts of the kitchen and maintaining the home s original hardwood floors before turning their attention to the exterior and landscaping under state law the tax value of a property with a homestead exemption can increase by no more than 10 per year but the cap does not apply to the value of new improvements made to the property i think the hardest part about it is that it punishes improvement eagle said we ve put some work into this house and we d love to be here a long time at the same time if that increases the appraisal it punishes us in the long run he said the home s appraisal has increased about 10 6 per year since 2015 compared to a 3 6 increase in waco s median wage over the same period of time unless you re constantly getting promoted or getting raises how do you keep up with the appraisal value of your own home eagle said the first time he attempted to argue for a lower valuation he took the wrong approach focusing on his issues with how waco isd and other taxing entities were using property taxes this time he said he hired ownwell a texas startup that will argue his case in exchange for half of any money the firm is able to save him for retired school teacher pam cooper this year s property appraisal notice for her home near china spring made her gulp the valuation jumped to 143 760 up from 116 360 the year before i m one of those who think school teachers shouldn t have to pay school taxes when they retire she said cooper 71 retired in 2020 after 37 years as a primary school teacher including 22 years with the waco independent school district she pays property taxes to mclennan county the city of waco mclennan community college and china spring isd qualifying for homestead and senior citizen exemptions in the taxing jurisdictions that offer them cooper estimates she draws about 3 100 monthly in retirement benefits but any future increases in those benefits would come from the texas legislature the 715 she paid in property taxes last year had increased from 650 the year before which makes her wonder what this year s tax bill will look like with the higher valuations cooper works part time as president of the greater waco american federation of texas but largely relies on her retirement benefits through the teacher retirement system of texas nearly three years ago waco artist susan sistrunk and then partner mark kieran moved into the 112 year old house that doubles as her home and the location of her susan l sistrunk fine art gallery its location in the 2100 block of washington avenue was a major draw close to downtown waco and access to potential customers local artists and business collaborators but more affordable than property closer to the city s center she leases the property through the cromwell co property management firm for 1 750 per month last year the property valuation for the 1 940 square foot home went up from 176 410 to 211 570 with taxes assessed at 4 563 20 her lease went up 100 per month this year and she is anxious about what rising property values will mean for a gallery owner and artist operating on a thin profit margin when you re dealing with a home based business you want to keep costs low and out of debt i m a debt free business and i plan to stay that way she said county tax records show a barry j williams of austin as the house s owner efforts to contact him for comment were unsuccessful in addition to paying property taxes through her lease sistrunk pays sales taxes from her business on a quarterly basis she said it peeved her to receive notice from the county tax assessor s office this year that some of her home furnishings such as antique chairs and a couch she inherited from her family are considered part of her business and taxed accordingly the amount is not vast but my concern is the taxes keep edging up sistrunk said i pride myself serving local artists in the community if this edges my prices up people will not pay the prices they see in dallas and austin when does this nickel and diming stop according to data from apartmentlist com average rent for a two bedroom apartment in mclennan county increased from 915 to 1 181 from 2020 to 2022 robert denton a local landlord who owns both commercial and residential properties said there are factors beyond rising property taxes that will increase rental rates in the future he said the number of properties the appraisal district oversees has almost quadrupled in the last several years but the staff has remained more or less the same size and he does not fault the appraisal district he said inflation maintenance costs and rising interests rates are factors that influence rent along with property taxes insurance costs also rise as a function of property values we re ready to get more into a recession and the numbers of people being evicted people not being able to pay their rent all those numbers are going to increase denton said he also said real estate investment companies that buy up as much rental property as possible are more active in mclennan county than they have been in previous years those are investors that you don t know and you don t see denton said if you try to say who owns this it will say such and such llc well it s not owned by an llc it s a stock exchange company denton said he expects a familiar pattern to play out in the next several years renters will be pushed farther and farther from cities cores by rising rents there won t be any change because property values aren t going to come down he said by the time the recession gets through in the bubble we

trip report this flight took place around a month ago from belgrade to new york on air serbia s a330 200 registered yu arb it was my first time flying this plane although i have flown the route before with the previous a330 operated by the airline registered yu ara this flight took place around a month ago from belgrade to new york on air serbia s a330 200 registered yu arb it was my first time flying this plane although i have flown the route before with the previous a330 operated by the airline registered yu ara i arrived at belgrade airport around 3 hours early factoring in the traffic congestion that is present in front of the terminal because of all the construction going on and the traffic being regulated differently than usual i headed to the check in desks and noticed that air serbia has pimped its business class check in desks they are now red compared to the rest which are blue there is a divider between the business and economy check in desks and they even put in a sofa the process was quick i checked in my bag got my boarding pass and was instructed that i could use the air serbia premium lounge the centralised security screening was quick there is a dedicated lane for business class passengers although this loses its purposes when you pass security as there is no dedicated lane for passport control for premium passengers and the airport was rather busy although there was a line in front of passport control it did move relatively quickly the centralised security screening was quick there is a dedicated lane for business class passengers although this loses its purposes when you pass security as there is no dedicated lane for passport control for premium passengers and the airport was rather busy although there was a line in front of passport control it did move relatively quickly once you get your passport stamped you go into the duty free shop and funnily enough i noticed this air serbia branded jersey on sale i headed to the lounge the area around the lounge is now a big construction site and it is rather dark in that part of the airport as the windows are blocked off so i noticed that air serbia put a huge illuminated sign to direct people to the lounge the lounge was quite busy this is because it is now being used by several airlines even the agent at the front desk was helping with clearing plates the buffet is now back after covid but they have also seemingly removed the a la carte dining menu which was previously available the lounge is still good with good facilities including showers i had a drink and a sandwich and went to the gate boarding began around 40 minutes before scheduled departure time the plane was full to the very last seat which was not surprising considering it was september and most of the us diaspora that spent their summer in serbia and the wider balkans starts going back home two air bridges were connected to the plane so business class passengers had a dedicated entry all seats occupied in the cabin i chose a window seat which is closer to the actual window the seats alternate with the ones closer to the window having more privacy than the ones closer to the aisle the crew greeted each passenger upon entry and later at their seat interestingly all crew were wearing face masks even though it is not a requirement for passengers there was a bottle of water menu blanket pillow and headphones at the seat this was a middle of the day flight and crew came by relatively quickly to introduce themselves and offer a welcome beverage of champagne water or orange juice once that was done the crew came by to ask for the meal order and noted that you could eat at any time you desired the menu was as follows i chose the serbian salad for starter and stuffed zucchini for the main and also decided to have my meal upon take off i had some fruit and coffee prior to landing we were delayed on departure by 45 minutes the pilot apologised and informed us this was due to a late connecting flight that was bringing passengers in any case the time was made up for en route and we arrived just 5 minutes behind schedule i appreciated that the pilot gave us detailed information of our flight path and details after departure the crew first served drinks mixed nuts and handed a disinfectant wipe it was followed by the meal which was good all of the meals are served on individual plates there is no tray and are brought out by the crew olive oil mixed with balsamic vinegar is also served along with the meal lavatory was in good shape and there were a few amenities like a facial mist hand cream and antibacterial gel however air serbia no longer offers an amenity kit or pjs with slippers as was the case before i asked about it and the crew simply told me they no longer had any lavatory was in good shape and there were a few amenities like a facial mist hand cream and antibacterial gel however air serbia no longer offers an amenity kit or pjs with slippers as was the case before i asked about it and the crew simply told me they no longer had any the entertainment system is ok nothing special but there is a mix of serbian and us movies and television shows these were some of the options on offer on my flight a huge minus in my opinion is that the plane has no wi fi i know the airline has removed wi fi from all planes but i think they should at least consider it for their wide body it s a real shame the seats are comfortable well padded and have a lie flat option overall crew was nice although i can t say they went above and beyond i also noticed some things like them not having any ice to go with drinks because they ran out halfway through the flight and little details like that i would say their catering was above european carrier standards for a transatlantic flight on the other hand they should do more to improve ife try to introduce wi fi stock their flights better and bring back amenity kits and pjs
