yeah they do look good i i did forget to check out inside mhm xr x oh yeah i mean you know gas prices are up obviously everyone knows that uh you know so that s that s an extra dollar per gallon that i m paying to get into the city to work and then you know we have the tolls that just went up this past year a dollar my eggs are a dollar more as well so everything s going up at least a dollar which you know adds up of course especially when you have kids and i m going to get groceries i mean my rent is absolutely ridiculous so and i just kind of see it kind of climbing and climbing and climbing to the point where i ll probably be just another one of these hundreds of thousands of people is moving out of california it s really hard because you ve got kids i see some people they have four or 56 kids and you know mhm no they have something fun but okay mhm mhm advertisement why is inflation so high and when could it ease share copy link copy another month another four decade high for inflation for the 12 months that ended in march consumer prices rocketed 8 5 that was the fastest year over year jump since 1981 far surpassing february s mark of 7 9 itself a 40 year high even if you toss out food and energy prices which are notoriously volatile and have driven much of the price spike so called core inflation jumped 6 5 in the past 12 months that was also the sharpest such jump in four decades consumers have felt the squeeze in everyday routines gasoline is up an average of 48 in the past year airline tickets are up 24 men s suits nearly 15 bacon 18 the federal reserve never anticipated inflation this severe or persistent back in december 2020 the fed s policymakers had forecast that consumer inflation would stay below their 2 annual target and end 2021 at around 1 8 yet after having been merely an afterthought for decades high inflation reasserted itself last year with brutal speed in february 2021 the government s consumer price index was running just 1 7 above its level a year earlier from there the year over year increases accelerated 2 6 in march 4 2 in april 5 in may 5 4 in june by october the figure was 6 2 by november 6 8 by december 7 for months fed chair jerome powell and some others characterized higher consumer prices as merely transitory the result mainly of shipping delays and temporary shortages of supplies and workers as the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession much faster than anyone had anticipated now most economists expect inflation to remain elevated well into next year with demand outstripping supplies in numerous areas of the economy so the fed has radically changed course last month it raised its benchmark short term rate by a quarter point and is expected to keep raising it probably aggressively well into 2023 in doing so the fed is moving decisively away from the ultra low rates that helped revive the economy from the recession but also helped fuel surging consumer prices the fed is making a high risk bet that it can slow the economy enough to rein in inflation without weakening it so much as to trigger a recession the overall economy is healthy with a robust job market and extremely low unemployment but many economists say they worry that the fed s steady credit tightening will cause an economic downturn ____what s caused the spike in inflation good news mostly when the pandemic paralyzed the economy in the spring of 2020 and lockdowns kicked in businesses closed or cut hours and consumers stayed home as a health precaution employers slashed a breathtaking 22 million jobs economic output plunged at a record shattering 31 annual rate in 2020 s april june quarter everyone braced for more misery companies cut investment and postponed restocking a brutal recession ensued but instead of sinking into a prolonged downturn the economy staged an unexpectedly rousing recovery fueled by vast infusions of government aid and emergency intervention by the fed which slashed rates among other things by spring of last year the rollout of vaccines had emboldened consumers to return to restaurants bars shops airports and entertainment venues suddenly businesses had to scramble to meet demand they couldn t hire fast enough to fill job openings or buy enough supplies to meet customer orders as business roared back ports and freight yards couldn t handle the traffic global supply chains seized up with demand up and supplies down costs jumped and companies found that they could pass along those higher costs in the form of higher prices to consumers many of whom had managed to pile up savings during the pandemic critics blamed in part president joe biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package with its 1 400 checks to most households for overheating an economy that was already sizzling on its own many others argued that the fed kept rates near zero far too long lending fuel to runaway spending and inflated prices in stocks homes and other assets ____how long will it last elevated consumer price inflation could endure as long as companies struggle to keep up with consumers demand for goods and services a recovering job market employers added a record 6 7 million jobs last year and are adding 560 000 a month so far this year means that americans as a whole can continue to splurge on everything from lawn furniture to electronics many economists foresee inflation staying well above the fed s 2 annual target this year but relief from higher prices might be coming jammed up supply chains are beginning to show some signs of improvement at least in some industries the fed s pivot away from easy money policies toward an anti inflationary policy could eventually reduce consumer demand there will be no repeat of last year s covid relief checks from washington inflation itself is eroding purchasing power and might force some consumers to shave spending at the same time new covid variants could cloud the outlook either by causing outbreaks that force factories and ports to close and disrupt supply chains even more or by keeping people home and reducing demand for goods ___how are higher prices affecting consumers the strong job market is boosting workers pay though not enough to offset higher prices the labor department says that after accounting for higher consumer prices hourly earnings for private sector employees fell 2 7 last month from a year earlier the 12th straight such drop there are exceptions after inflation wages rose 8 for hotel workers and 4 for restaurant and bar employees in march from a year earlier partisan politics in the meantime is influencing the way americans view the inflation threat with a democrat in the white house republicans are far more likely than democrats to say that inflation is having a negative effect on their personal finances according to surveys of consumer sentiment conducted by the university of michigan
experts say the ultrawealthy are abusing a law meant to uplift low income neighborhoods how on earth is this creating societal value photo anson chan for huffpost experts say the ultrawealthy are abusing a law meant to uplift low income neighborhoods how on earth is this creating societal value photo anson chan for huffpost queens n y behind one of the doors here at an unmarked brink s global warehouse near john f kennedy international airport is roughly 30 million in gold bars a group of investment advisers from suburban pennsylvania parked the gold here last may shortly after buying it from a seller in europe and they chose this spot an ordinary looking warehouse in springfield gardens a majority black lower middle class part of town for a very specific reason a provision in the trump tax cuts that offers breaks to investors who launch ventures in poorer neighborhoods advertisement advertisement we are actually driving economic activity in economically challenged areas bob enck the ceo and founder of the business boasted in a promotional video he s dubbed his scheme the us opportunity gold fund the gambit relies on opportunity zones a controversial federal program that lavishes a steep capital gains cut on rich companies and individuals in exchange for investing in a struggling community thanks to the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act investors who sell financial assets such as stock can defer and reduce their capital gains taxes which can run as high as 40 if they use the proceeds to build a business or housing in a federally approved low income neighborhood if the venture lasts more than 10 years the profits from the new business become entirely tax free the program entails very few requirements to prove that new projects will benefit existing communities as a result opportunity zones have fueled the construction of luxury housing self storage units and even a superyacht marina and helped the trump tax breaks earn their reputation as a bonanza for the ultrarich advertisement advertisement but even in that light experts told huffpost the us gold opportunity fund is one of the boldest applications of the program they have ever encountered how on earth is this creating societal value said brett theodos a senior fellow at the urban institute who has criticized the overly broad use of opportunity zones and they couldn t be sure whether the fund is ingenious or harebrained after all the irs did lay out a few basic conditions for using opportunity zones a set of technical rules and a rule aimed at ventures that meet all the technical rules but conflict in a glaring way with the spirit of the law the agency even offered examples of ventures that would fail the so called anti abuse rule one scenario consists of turning a vacant lot into a self pay parking lot while investors wait for the land to go up in value another example is a one person business that warehouses gold while investors wait for the price of gold to increase in value this poses an obvious challenge for the us gold opportunity fund a two person business that s warehousing gold while investors wait for the price of gold to increase in value at least that is how the fund s founder is marketing the fund to potential investors enck did not respond to multiple calls and emails for this story but in a series of undated videos on the company s website he pitches potential investors on a business model that bears a shocking resemblance to the one the irs declared improper sitting on gold for at least 10 years then selling it tax free we want to drive economic development in opportunity zones and within that construct we are offering a fund that invests in physical gold enck says in one video if anyone has interest in stimulating economic activity in an opportunity zone and if you like gold as an investment we should talk the ideal investor he says in another video is someone who buys into the thesis that gold is a good long term investment the fund raised 30 million from unidentified investors in december 2020 according to a disclosure the group filed with the securities and exchange commission six months later it contracted with stonex a global commodities mover to buy and deliver 30 million in gold bars from a seller in europe to the warehouse in queens a stonex executive hailed the delivery as an important part of our broader social responsibility initiatives how on earth is this creating societal value brett theodos a senior fellow at the urban institute on hearing a description of the us gold opportunity fund and its airport adjacent gold stash theodos said oh for the love of god to theodos this kind of wild scheme exists because the government has lost its ability to meaningfully police wealthy taxpayers and because congress required virtually no disclosure when it created the opportunity zone program we need the irs to be adequately resourced he said we need to know where opportunity zone projects happen where they re located in real time so that we can understand and vet what this program is accomplishing we need a legitimate certification process which treasury could undertake right now to limit the program to mission minded investors other experts agreed that the fund walks right up to the line of what s allowed under the irs rules for opportunity zones if it doesn t simply step over it my first thought was wow somebody is really setting themselves up and walking right into the anti abuse example that s an interesting choice said jessica millett who specializes in opportunity zone investments at the new york law firm duval stachenfeld the irs singled out gold buying businesses in its regulations because in the agency s words they are merely speculative in nature not expected to increase economic activity millett s guess is that the us gold opportunity fund offers something besides physical gold such as financial consulting in order to stay qualified as an opportunity zone business but the line the fund is walking is extremely fine millett said they re definitely saying hey look you re going to own all this gold if you invest in the fund she said it gives me pause probably to preempt those criticisms enck has claimed that actually the company s purchase of gold helps create a flurry of economic activity in disadvantaged neighborhoods we re really trying to make sure we re driving economic development enck says in another promotional video we re gonna move gold back from overseas all the economic activity that along with that storing securing guarding assaying weighing all the kind of things that have to happen with gold bars will be done now in the united states in an oz but the economic impact was difficult to detect on the ground in springfield gardens a tiny neighborhood bounded by some small parks the belt parkway and the razor wire fencing that surrounds jfk international from the sidewalk the brink s warehouse where the gold arrived did not look like it had undergone any recent upgrades or expansions and why would it when 30 million in gold bars can fit on a kitchen table approached by a reporter the driver of an idling brink s truck waved her away in annoyance and went back to eating his snack we are actually driving economic activity in economically challenged areas bob enck ceo and founder of the us opportunity gold fund most of the economic impact has likely accrued to whoever gave enck and his team 30 million because there were special tax liability reductions for investors who used the opportunity zone program before 2021 the fund may have already helped customers avoid more than 1 million in federal taxes at launch the fund had a grand total of just two employees enck and its chief operating officer scott victor its website also lists a president john pallat and an affiliated member alex joslin all four men previously worked at equinox funds an investment manager where enck was ceo and president from 2007 until 2021 in 2016 the sec sanctioned equinox funds for misrepresenting how it calculated its management fees among other material misstatements and omissions allowing equinox to overcharge customers by 5 4 million equinox paid a 400 000 fine and refunded more than 5 million to investors and the fund has since been reorganized under new leadership for their gold fund venture enck and his partners are receiving legal guidance from dechert a well regarded white shoe law firm and auditing by novogradac an accounting firm of equally good repute novogradac did not respond to a request for comment dechert did not reply to huffpost s inquiries or make the attorneys who advised the gold oz fund available to comment a few hours after huffpost first contacted dechert and brink s the references to disappeared from the about us section of the gold oz fund s website the spokesperson for brink s did not respond to questions about whether it hires extra personnel or makes physical improvements to its warehouses when it handles a particularly valuable deposit in this case or in general so huffpost asked people around springfield gardens whether their new neighbor 30 million in gold bricks was having a positive impact i really can t say said david mendez the owner of bugging out 4 burgers when asked if his restaurant had seen a substantial increase in foot traffic most of our customers are

it s not at all clear that people care why everything they are trying to buy costs more all they know is that gas prices are through the roof although they are lower this week than last and everything they want or need to buy costs more a lot more than it did a year ago inflation is crushing joe biden and the democrats chris cillizza cnn april 12 the stock market rose tuesday morning on news that inflation reached 8 5 percent in march on an annualized basis the biggest jump since 1981 how can that be when cnn s chris cillizza is telling us the inflation news is catastrophically bad it s not my usual habit to interpret the madness of crowds either in the financial markets or at the voting booth but i think what s going on is that people are well aware that russia which supplies roughly 10 percent of the world s oil invaded ukraine in late february and that as a result the march inflation number was always going to be bad just in case anybody didn t know white house press secretary jennifer psaki warned monday that the inflation numbers would likely be extraordinarily elevated because of what she called putin s price hike

the privatisation fever that swept the uk in the 1980s has come to dubai the dubai electricity and water authority dewa is the first of ten state companies to list on the dubai financial market exchange shares in the company surged around 20 per cent on their debut yesterday in the first listing of its kind in the region and the biggest in the middle east since saudi oil giant aramco went public in 2019 around 6 1billion 4 7billion was raised in the initial public offering ipo from more than 65 000 investors ringing up change the daily mail s ruth sunderland with hamed ali chief executive of the dubai financial market everyone involved pulled out the stops to make a success of the float which is the first step in a plan aimed at increasing activity on the dubai stock market in an updated version of the uk s tell sid campaign to persuade the public to purchase british gas shares in 1986 dewa customers were sent emails and text messages telling them about the ipo the aim however is not so much to create a version of margaret thatcher s shareholder democracy as to boost capital markets in the emirate for us this year a priority will be to accelerate the development of our capital markets says hamed ali chief executive of the dubai financial market dfm ten of our crown jewel government owned assets will be listed on the exchange four have been announced for this year the first being dewa one of the most successful businesses in dubai should you look at it as a privatisation programme or as a way of driving the growth of capital markets we look at it in the second light we do have a culture of private investing in shares the culture of the stock market among individuals is strong people are financially savvy another company tipped for an ipo is emirates the flagship dubai based airline its president sir tim clark suggested late last year a listing could be on the cards the dewa offer has set the privatisations off to a strong start russ mould of stockbroker aj bell said i guess you would like to think that if dubai has a major ipo programme coming up then the early deals will be enticingly priced to ensure they go well and generate demand for follow up transactions the float is likely to be followed up by salik a road toll operator others in the pipeline include tecom which runs business parks and the cooling systems firm empower dewa s listing is seen as being part of dubai s moves towards green energy which in turn lie at the heart of its economic growth strategy the dubai market says hamed ali has done relatively really well in the pandemic the dfm general index increased 28 2 per cent in 2021 higher than most of the major global indices around the world we expect this year to be one of the best he adds the size and the details will be announced by the issuers but we are ready to host any number of ipos whenever we have a listing we ring the bell for some reason people love the bell the dubai financial market is a young market only 22 years old compared with three centuries of history on the london stock exchange privatisations the dewa float is likely to be followed up by salik a road toll operator others in the pipeline include tecom which runs business parks and the cooling systems firm empower in 2010 it teamed up with the local branch of the us tech market nasdaq dubai the two are distinct the dfm is regulated by the uae securities and commodities authority while nasdaq dubai is under the international regulation of the dubai financial services authority the string of floats is an attempt by the emirate to rival its neighbours abu dhabi and saudi arabia saudi aramco the previously state owned oil producer was the world s biggest ipo in december 2019 feverish competition broke out between new york tokyo and london for the secondary listing though in the event the shares were only traded on the saudi tadawul there have been some big de listings from the dubai markets including dp world the giant ports operator whose subsidiary p o ferries caused a huge row by summarily sacking 800 british based seafarers last month dp world announced it was delisting from nasdaq dubai in 2020 and returned to private ownership citing the short termism on public markets theme park operator dxb also went private the forthcoming spate of ipos is aimed at putting the fizz back into markets dubai has big ambitions to become a financial as well as a logistics and travel hub the dubai international financial centre district which consists of 110 acres in the centre of the city crammed with offices hotels apartments and restaurants is one of the emirate s independent free zones it plays host to 27 000 professionals from around the world along with more than 2 900 companies rather like the city of london it has its own distinctive identity hamed ali says the free zone model has been extremely successful for us we have a logistics free zone a tech free zone and so on this has been a template that allowed a lot of businesses to come and establish in dubai in the centre companies can be 100 per cent foreign owned normally they need a local partner it has its own independent regulator the dubai financial services authority and instead of the united arab emirates legal system it is governed on the principles of english common law other attractions include tax free corporate income and profits guaranteed for 50 years a new corporate tax is to be introduced on business profits for the first time from june 2023 but it will be at 9 per cent below most other countries including the uk apart from the state sell offs hamed ali expects real estate investment trusts reits to be a growth area he says dubai is known for real estate so we see reits as one of the segments that will take off and we have a number of beautiful tech businesses developing out of dubai does he envisage one day taking on wall street or the city the reply is tactful it works way better for the global economy if we end up working with london what we are about here in dubai is building bridges

washington ap another month another four decade high for inflation for the 12 months that ended in march consumer prices rocketed 8 5 that was the fastest year over year jump since 1981 far surpassing february s mark of 7 9 itself a 40 year high even if you toss out food and energy prices which are notoriously volatile and have driven much of the price spike so called core inflation jumped 6 5 in

inflation to remain elevated well into next year with demand outstripping supplies in numerous areas of the economy advertisement article continues below this ad so the fed has radically changed course last month it raised its benchmark short term rate by a quarter point and is expected to keep raising it probably aggressively well into 2023 in doing so the fed is moving decisively away from the ultra low rates that helped revive the economy from the recession but also helped fuel surging consumer prices the fed is making a high risk bet that it can slow the economy enough to rein in

sinking into a prolonged downturn the economy staged an unexpectedly rousing recovery fueled by vast infusions of government aid and emergency intervention by the fed which slashed rates among other things by spring of last year the rollout of vaccines had emboldened consumers to return to restaurants bars shops airports and entertainment venues suddenly businesses had to scramble to meet demand

consumer financial protection bureau director rohit chopra followed through tuesday on a recent warning that he would penalize individual executives at companies suspected of repeated violations the cfpb announced a lawsuit against the credit bureau transunion for allegedly violating a 2017 order to stop misleading customers about the credit reporting and monitoring services the chicago company offers and to disclose recurring charges for them the suit also names john danaher a former top executive at transunion s interactive unit which was responsible for selling the products to consumers danaher delayed reforms required under the 2017 order that would have ended the company s allegedly abusive practices in order to continue generating revenue and to allow him to cash in 10 million from stock under his compensation plan according to the lawsuit transunion and attorneys representing danaher in separate statements denied the claims made in the cfpb suit the suit is considered one of chopra s biggest enforcement actions since his senate confirmation in september last month chopra promised the agency would go after top executives at companies that repeatedly break the law i do not take the decision to charge individuals lightly chopra says of suing former transunion executive john danaher in addition to the company itself based on the evidence uncovered in the investigation i believe it was appropriate that he be named individually and answer our allegations the cfpb is seeking customer relief and penalties from transunion and danaher they are in addition to the fines and restitution that transunion had to pay under the 2017 order both sides were in discussions over a settlement in the months before the new lawsuit was revealed but a deal could not be reached according to a source familiar with the talks danaher who had been at transunion since 2004 transitioned into an advisory role in april 2021 and retired in february according to a securities filing by the company last year rather than comply with a law enforcement order john danaher appeared to take a risk that violating the order was worth the increased revenue and profit chopra told reporters in a briefing tuesday the cfpb is also prepared to amend the complaint to include any other executives if more information is uncovered during legal proceedings chopra said a senior cfpb official told reporters that information is shared with state licensing boards and other agencies for repeat offenders but the official said it was beyond the scope of the complaint to speculate on what state licensing offices would do the suit against danaher signals a major shift toward targeting executives at big companies after the bureau has preferred to bring cases against those at smaller firms in the past said chris willis a partner at troutman pepper it is likely intended as and should be seen as a warning to executives in consumer financial services companies willis said of the suit against transunion and danaher since being ordered to set aside 13 9 million in restitution and paying a 3 million fine to settle the charges outside of the court process transunion continued to rack up complaints about its service according to the bureau s consumer complaint database the company has argued that many complaints levied against transunion should actually be directed toward creditors reporting debts the bureau alleges in the new lawsuit that the company did not receive authorization from customers before making recurring withdrawals from their bank accounts transunion was also alleged to have engaged in so called digital dark patterns designed to influence customer behavior for instance the bureau claims transunion offered brightly colored buttons advertising one time snapshots of their credit and instead allegedly duped customers into ongoing subscription services danaher allegedly instructed staff not to use an affirmative selection box required for customers under the previous consent order because he determined it would slow down enrollments according to the suit i do not take the decision to charge individuals lightly chopra said based on the evidence uncovered in the investigation i believe it was appropriate that he be named individually and answer our allegations transunion is not providing legal services for danaher who is being represented by jeff knox and brooke cucinella at simpson thacher bartlett these claims are without merit and this lawsuit demonstrates that the cfpb is focused more on politically expedient headlines than the facts or the law knox and cucinella said in an emailed statement mr danaher very much looks forward to his day in court in a press release announcing the suit chopra called transunion an out of control company that felt it was above the law transunion said in its statement that it had submitted a plan to make changes which the bureau allegedly ignored the company said bureau leadership refused to meet to resolve the issues and that it would defend itself in court rather than providing any supervisory guidance on this matter and advising transunion of its concerns like a responsible regulator would the cfpb stayed silent and saved their claims for inclusion in a lawsuit including naming a former executive in the complaint the company said consumer advocates have applauded the move and are using the lawsuit to argue for a government run credit bureau which has become a topic of debate in washington federal regulators state attorneys general consumer advocates and private attorneys have been battling a culture of impunity and arrogance by the credit bureaus for decades chi chi wu staff attorney at the national consumer law center said in a press release tuesday we need to have an alternative to the credit bureau cartel
former labor secretary under president clinton robert reich joined the chorus of media critics attacking tech mogul elon musk s significant purchase of twitter stock on tuesday reich penned an opinion piece in the guardian titled elon musk s vision for the internet is dangerous nonsense attacking musk s new status as the largest twitter shareholder new york times calls elon musk s possible future plans treacherous threat to twitter musk says he wants to free the internet but what he really aims to do is make it even less accountable than it is now reich wrote reich argued that musk s twitter stock purchase and his subsequent refusal to join twitter s board of directors is only about power rather than free speech musk advocates free speech but in reality it s just about power reich wrote power compelled musk to buy 2 64bn of twitter stock making him the largest individual shareholder last week twitter announced that musk would be joining twitter s board of directors prompting musk to promise significant improvements in the platform sunday evening though it was announced that musk would not be joining twitter s board no reason was given but it s probably part of a bargaining kabuki dance he also claimed musk s free speech positions were hypocritical and dangerous based on the fact that musk blocked reich on twitter and that musk disagreed with the decision to ban former president trump these moves were necessary to protect american democracy but elon musk the richest man in the world with 80 million twitter followers wasn t pleased reich continued cbs correspondent jokes elon musk is like a bond villain amid twitter drama gets pushback from gayle king ultimately reich feared that musk s purchase will make twitter even less accountable than it is now as it represents the attempts of billionaires like musk to skirt the law billionaires like musk have shown time and again they consider themselves above the law and to a large extent they are reich wrote musk has enough wealth that legal penalties are no more than slaps on his wrist and enough power to control one of the most important ways the public now receives news think about it after years of posting tweets that skirt the law musk was given a seat on twitter s board and is probably now negotiating for even more clout reich even went so far as to suggest that musk s twitter stock purchase is comparable to dictators such as russian president vladimir putin that s musk s dream and trump s and putin s and the dream of every dictator strongman demagogue and modern day robber baron on earth for the rest of us it would be a brave new nightmare reich concluded click here to get the fox news app musk currently controls a 9 2 stake at twitter inc if he accepted a seat on their board of directors his shares would have been capped at 14 9 because he is no longer considering the position he is free to bolster his stake or even purchase a majority share of the company

callable 8 1 2030 relative muni performance has been seen in rising short muni ust ratios the two year to 68 from 62 and falling longer ratios 10 year to 93 from 100 said matt fabian partner at municipal market analytics however he said rolling correlations with usts are still very tight those correlations show that despite muni centric variables influencing benchmark levels ust movements likely as relayed through secondary evaluations and primary market pricings are currently the dominating vectors this is despite increasing mutual fund outflows which have totaled 18 2 since the beginning of the year according to refinitiv lipper to date the longer slower outflow timeline in 2022 plus the funds stronger cash positions via ramped up principal amortization from the heavy advance refunding activity in the last three years have helped keep related selling pressure orderly fabian said three to five years of overdue reinvestment demands of non fund investors are also a positive element he said as they are now able to put investor cash to work more efficiently and in terms of primary market spreads and coupon structures more traditionally nonetheless fabian said persistent ust losses may accelerate fund outflows to the point that selling pressure becomes the narrative and municipal losses increase similarly sustained underperformance of lower coupons may quickly exceed de minimis discount tolerances necessitating faster deeper discounts to be placed this is more of an issue with investment grade since low coupons are more common there muni cusip requests rises monthly municipal volume rose in march but were down year over year the aggregate total of all municipal securities including municipal bonds long term and short term notes and

cpi report seemed to green light the fed s aggressive action plan at this point it is hard to imagine more justification is needed for further fed action beyond a four decade high in inflation said stifel chief economist lindsey piegza as such the market is widely anticipating a half of a percentage point increase and the fed expects to continue raising rates likely reaching near 2 maybe higher by december she said this will slow the economy potentially choking off growth altogether and resulting in negative gdp or worse recessionary conditions but piegza noted despite the rising risk of a weaker economy from the fed s perspective even facing such a potentially negative outcome many committee members argue it is a necessary evil or worthwhile outcome to rein in inflation with its focus now clearly on controlling inflation marvin loh senior macro strategist at state street global markets said the fed will not be deterred in the next 100 bps of rate hikes or the start of balance sheet reduction in our view should prices decelerate the fed may pause its hiking cycle near the end of the year depending on how tight the labor markets become he added since we expect that employment gains will start to moderate in the coming months the market may find itself with overly aggressive expectations around the fed and if not the risk of a policy mistake and potential recession will continue to rise the question is has inflation peaked said matt peron director of research at janus henderson investors and if so at what pace will it decline the report probably locks in a more aggressive fed action near term he said but there is some reason to believe that cpi will decline enough by year end to avoid the most severe fed action indeed that would be our mid cycle slowdown scenario which remains our base case by a thin margin andy sparks head of portfolio management research at msci noted the core rose 0 3 in the month less than the 0 5 gain in february inflation optimists may take this as a sign that inflation is peaking or has already peaked and may now begin to decline he said although today s headline cpi is very large by historical standards today s print of the core cpi may be used to justify the fed s existing monetary policy which is hawkish but still not hawkish enough for some of its critics should inflation numbers remain high sparks said it would likely result in increasingly aggressive fed policy to rein in prices the key to a soft landing is the labor force he said any or all of three situations could help the labor force continued post covid economic reopening more flex work arrangements or early retirees returning to work ameriprise chief economist russell price said the march figures could be the peak for cpi year ago comparisons become much more difficult beginning in the second quarter thus pressuring year over year growth rates he said also gasoline prices could switch from pushing up the headline index to weighing on it national average gas prices have dipped each of the past three weeks when traditionally they ve risen in april and may price said the especially hawkish tone of recent fed policy speak has been a wake up call for markets he added but if the march inflation rate is truly the peak and inflation rates begin to subside in the months following it would reduce fed officials need to be as hawkish as currently communicated and while price considered inflation a serious risk he sees the odds of it sparking a recession as overdone even if a peak is near james knightley ing chief international economist noted the descent will be long and slow given lingering supply chain issues significant tightness in the labor market and ongoing corporate pricing power this means the fed needs to raise rates rapidly with a growing chance a sharp slowdown will result still the growing cost of shelter concerns ron temple head of u s equities at lazard asset management the cost of shelter excluding hotels rose 4 5 over the prior year the largest increase since 2007 and we are seeing evidence of accelerating increases in rent across many cities he said higher rent often translates directly to higher wage demands raising the risk of a wage price spiral while most of the headline number s gain can be tied to higher energy prices following russia s invasion of ukraine wells fargo securities senior economist sarah house and economist michael pugliese said energy was not the only source of pain for households still they feel this likely marks the peak in post covid inflation but it s still quite a distance to the fed s 2 target with inflation so far above target we expect the fed to expedite tightening and hike the fed funds rate by 50 bps at both the may and june fomc meetings in addition to beginning to wind down the balance sheet in may nancy tengler ceo and chief investment officer of laffer tengler investments agreed this is likely to be much harder to unwind than the fed expects and while fed chair jerome powell is confident of the fed s ability to use its tools to get inflation under control she said so far the market has not seen evidence of this the policy mistake has already happened and the question now is will fed policy be able to navigate a soft landing in the primary monday j p morgan securities priced for the maryland economic

a twitter shareholder on tuesday filed a securities fraud lawsuit against elon musk alleging that the billionaire tesla ceo s late disclosure of his stake in twitter cost investors money and saved musk around 143 million marc bain rasella filed the suit in federal court in new york and seeks to represent all investors who sold twitter stock between march 24 and april 1 he argues that because musk waited days to declare his purchase of twitter stock he depressed the share price and ripped off others who sold twitter stock under securities laws musk was supposed to alert the securities and exchange commission within 10 days after purchasing 5 or more of twitter s stock but musk did not file his sec paperwork until april 4 or 11 days after he was supposed to and by that point musk had amassed a more than 9 stake in the social media company becoming its largest shareholder for the price of about 2 6 billion musk did not return a request for comment in his lawsuit rasella said by not giving federal regulators a heads up that he was gobbling up twitter stock musk was essentially able to buy twitter stock at a discount musk according to the suit made materially false and misleading statements and omissions by failing to disclose to investors that he had acquired a 5 ownership stake in twitter as required musk knew or recklessly disregarded that he had an obligation to file paperwork with the sec according to the suit which estimates that the delayed filings saved musk about 143 million or a tiny fraction of his wealth musk is the richest person in the world but while the moves may have been a moneymaker for musk on paper twitter shareholders who sold stock during the time period in question were doing so at a artificially low price the suit says plaintiff and the class would not have sold twitter s securities at the price sold or at all if they had been aware that the market prices had been artificially and falsely deflated by defendant s misleading statements wrote manhattan based lawyer jeffrey block who is representing rasella rasella s suit is seeking unspecified damages the lawsuit is the latest drama involving twitter and musk who in a dizzying reversal said he would not be joining twitter s board less than a week after he said publicly that he was offered a seat twitter ceo parag agrawal did not explain the turnabout beyond saying in a tweet that it was for the best and that there will be distractions ahead musk who is known for frivolous and sometimes trolling content on twitter has teased the idea of adding an edit button to twitter and has floated more outlandish proposals like converting the company s san francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

trading while those for the s p 500 were 0 06 lower and contracts for the tech heavy nasdaq 100 rose 0 07 all eyes are on us inflation data today investors feel the heat before today s inflation print said ipek ozkardeskaya senior analyst at swissquote bank cpi figure at or ideally below expectations could cool down the recent selloff but a figure above expectations will likely further boost the fed hawks and weigh on the equity appetite the headline us consumer price figure was 7 9 in february and that figure may be surpassed in march with some estimates suggesting a figure as high as 8 5 there is a chance that we see a higher print on the back of higher energy and commodity prices rising wages and rising rents added ozkardeskaya the us inflation data is due at 8 30 am et in march the fomc raised interest for the first time since 2018 the minutes of that meeting showed that most officials had agreed that one or more 50 basis point increases may be the right course of action to dampen inflation the latest inflation figures will likely solidify rate hike expectations but whether a series of increases work to reduce price pressures remains to be seen how fast the fed could bring down inflation that is mostly caused by supply side problems by restricting demand and how will the rising inflation and the rising rates to tame inflation will impact the market said ozkardeskaya elsewhere gold a safe haven in times of uncertainty continued higher gold futures were up 0 5 at 1958 40 benchmark brent crude futures were up 3 5 at 101 92 while wti futures were up 3 3

lower prices marc bain rasella filed the lawsuit against musk for alleged securities fraud in manhattan federal court on tuesday according to a bloomberg report the suit claims the billionaire was required to disclose his holdings to the u s securities and exchange commission by march 24 but the delay kept twitter s share price down allowing musk to buy more shares at a lower price musk is accused of violating a regulatory deadline to reveal he had accumulated a stake of at least 5 percent instead according to the complaint musk didn t disclose his position in twitter until he d almost doubled his stake to more than 9 percent that strategy the lawsuit alleges hurt less wealthy investors who sold shares in the san francisco company in the nearly two weeks before musk acknowledged holding a major stake musk s regulatory filings show that he bought a little more than 620 000 shares at 36 83 apiece on jan 31 and then continued to accumulate more shares on nearly every single trading day through april 1 musk held 73 1 million twitter shares as of the most recent count monday that represents a 9 1 percent stake in twitter the lawsuit alleges that by march 14 musk s stake in twitter had reached a 5 percent threshold that required him to publicly disclose his holdings under u s securities law by march 24 musk didn t make the required disclosure until april 4 that revelation caused twitter s stock to soar 27 percent from its april 1 close to nearly 50 by the end of april 4 s trading depriving investors who sold shares before musk s improperly delayed disclosure the chance to realize significant gains according to the lawsuit musk meanwhile was able to continue to buy shares that traded in prices ranging from 37 69 to 40 96 the lawsuit is seeking to be certified as a class action representing twitter shareholders who sold shares between march 24 and april 4 a process that could take a year or more musk spent about 2 6 billion on twitter stock a fraction of his estimated wealth of 265 billion the largest individual fortune in the world in a regulatory filing monday musk disclosed he may increase his stake after backing out of an agreement reached last week to join twitter s board of directors tesla ceo elon musk was sued by a twitter shareholder who claims the billionaire s delay in disclosing his more than 5 stake in twitter allowed him to buy more shares at lower prices as of tuesday morning twitter was trading at 45 83 per share a 2 49 percent drop from monday ceo of tesla motors elon musk speaks at the tesla giga texas manufacturing cyber rodeo in april 2022 he revealed last week that he had become twitter s largest shareholder jacob walker one of the lawyers that filed the lawsuit against musk told the associated press that he hadn t reached out to the securities and exchange commission about musk s alleged violations about the disclosure of his twitter stake i assume the sec is well aware of what he did walker said the sec and musk have been wrangling in court since 2018 when musk and tesla agreed to pay a 40 million fine t o settle allegations that he used his twitter account to mislead investors about a potential buyout of the electric car company that never materialized as part of that deal musk was supposed to obtain legal approval for his tweets about information that could affect tesla s stock price a provision that regulators contend he has occasionally violated and that he now argues unfairly muzzles him musk is accused of violating a regulatory deadline to reveal he had accumulated a stake of at least 5 percent instead he didn t disclose his stake in twitter until he d almost doubled it one day after musk disclosed his stake platform ceo parag agrawal announced the tesla co founder had been invited to the join the company s board of directors a seat he gladly accepted by accepting the board seat musk was limited in how much of the company s shares he could own with a 14 9 percent cap however on sunday parag announced the spacex ceo formally declined his board seat brandeis university finance professor anna scherbina told npr that she predicts musk could potentially turn into an activist investor putting pressure on management and pushing his agenda until he gets what he wants scherbina told npr that some of the tactics activist investors use to influence a company include pressuring shareholders by lobbying them or even releasing information about the company to the public activist investors also install people who share their point of view on the board of directors and in more aggressive cases they even attempt to replace the company ceo musk would need to purchase roughly 400 32 million additional shares valued around 15 3billion to own 50 percent of twitter the reason for the tactics are the activist investor thinks things need to change at the company but that often puts them at odds with the company board who are usually not open to being criticized by shareholders no matter how large a stake they have scherbina said although it is not known what kind of investor musk will be he has already vowed to make significant improvements to the site musk who describes himself as a free speech absolutist has been highly critical of twitter and its policies as of late arguing he doesn t think twitter is living up to free speech principles an opinion shared by followers of donald trump and a number of other conservative political figures who ve had their accounts suspended for violating twitter content rules jason miller former trump spokesman and ceo of rival social media platform gettr told dailymail com musk probably realized that the culture is so embedded in twitter that it can t be changed it is like getting a rental car from a driver who smoked you can t get rid of the smell activist investors also install people who share their point of view on the board of directors and in more aggressive cases they even attempt to replace the company ceo jack dorsey pictured the entire culture is fundamentally broken miller said and criticized their constant political discrimination censoring of conservative voices including jake posobiec and juanita brodderick and continually choosing winners and losers in the free speech the tech tycoon before reversing course on the board seat sent out a number of tweets over the weekend referencing potential changes at twitter many of them such as his proposal for an ad free twitter or turning the social media company s san francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter have since been deleted on saturday musk had suggested changes to the twitter blue premium subscription service including slashing its price banning advertising and giving an option to pay in the cryptocurrency dogecoin last monday after revealing his stake in twitter musk asked his followers do you want an edit button referencing a feature that many users have requested a day later musk a prolific user of twitter himself said that he was giving serious thought to building a new social media platform on march 25 musk tweeted a poll free speech is essential to a functioning democracy do you believe twitter rigorously adheres to this principle he also tweeted delete the w in twitter and the billionaire even asked his 80 million followers is twitter dying musk then posted a few cryptic tweets late sunday including one showing a meme that said in all fairness your honor my client was in goblin mode he then followed his post with another meme reading explains everything early monday morning he tweeted an emoji of a smiling face with a hand over its mouth supposedly an expression of rapture a smirk a shy smile or indicating happiness he then deleted it wall street analysts allege elon musk s declining a seat on twitter s board of directors which he had previously indicated he was excited to join could open the door for the tesla ceo to buy more stock and organize a takeover of the company this weekend s changeup spares the company from having to deal with a renegade director tweeting about board level discussions that would have been untenable don bilson of gordon haskett research advisors told cnbc monday the flip side to this is twitter must deal with a wildcard investor that already owns 9 percent of the company and has the resources to buy the remaining 91 percent as volatile as musk is we could see a move like that made shortly or we could never see it all he added i don t think anything is off the menu with this guy this is clearly going to be an unfriendly situation wedbush securities analyst dan ives echoed instead of musk in the board room in the corner just saying nay or agreeing on certain board candidates i think now it really goes to the point that in the coming days i think we ll start to see if he s going to go more hostile more active that s what the street s focused on
a twitter shareholder on tuesday filed a securities fraud lawsuit against elon musk alleging that the billionaire tesla ceo s late disclosure of his stake in twitter cost investors money and saved musk around 143 million marc bain rasella filed the suit in federal court in new york and seeks to represent all investors who sold twitter stock between march 24 and april 1 he argues that because musk waited days to declare his purchase of twitter stock he depressed the share price and ripped off others who sold twitter stock under securities laws musk was supposed to alert the securities and exchange commission within 10 days after purchasing 5 or more of twitter s stock but musk did not file his sec paperwork until april 4 or 11 days after he was supposed to and by that point musk had amassed a more than 9 stake in the social media company becoming its largest shareholder for the price of about 2 6 billion musk did not return a request for comment in his lawsuit rasella said by not giving federal regulators a heads up that he was gobbling up twitter stock musk was essentially able to buy twitter stock at a discount musk according to the suit made materially false and misleading statements and omissions by failing to disclose to investors that he had acquired a 5 ownership stake in twitter as required musk knew or recklessly disregarded that he had an obligation to file paperwork with the sec according to the suit which estimates that the delayed filings saved musk about 143 million or a tiny fraction of his wealth musk is the richest person in the world but while the moves may have been a moneymaker for musk on paper twitter shareholders who sold stock during the time period in question were doing so at a artificially low price the suit says plaintiff and the class would not have sold twitter s securities at the price sold or at all if they had been aware that the market prices had been artificially and falsely deflated by defendant s misleading statements wrote manhattan based lawyer jeffrey block who is representing rasella rasella s suit is seeking unspecified damages the lawsuit is the latest drama involving twitter and musk who in a dizzying reversal said he would not be joining twitter s board less than a week after he said publicly that he was offered a seat twitter ceo parag agrawal did not explain the turnabout beyond saying in a tweet that it was for the best and that there will be distractions ahead musk who is known for frivolous and sometimes trolling content on twitter has teased the idea of adding an edit button to twitter and has floated more outlandish proposals like converting the company s san francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

spring brings an abundance of tender greens young roots vibrant herbs and sweet green peas all plump in their pods to farmers markets these early season favorites make some of the season s best dishes from bright salads to hearty soups and stews brimming with fresh vegetables depending on your climate these vegetables are typically available at markets from mid april through early june since farmers are still planting and plants are still growing springtime markets tend to have a little less variety and abundance than markets hitting their peak in july and august but it s the perfect time to visit your local spot and get to know your growers early on before the frenzy of summer sets in you won t have to fight the crowds and you ll find plenty of gems to welcome the warmer days to come leeks leeks are members of the allium family which also includes onions shallots garlic and chives they have a delicate onion like flavor that melts to a beautiful sweetness when you cook them while the whole plant is edible the white and light green parts are best for cooking their delicate texture makes them perfect for salads or soups the dark green tops can be tough so save them for flavoring stocks and broths you can usually find leeks at the farmers market in the spring when buying them look for shiny whites and dark green leaves old leeks appear dull and dried out and they don t taste quite as good farmers grow leeks in sandy soil so you should thoroughly clean your leeks to remove any residual grit after removing the root tip and dark green leaves slice the white part in half lengthwise and rinse under cold running water to remove any dirt carrots in the springtime you ll find new slender spring carrots at the market farmers bunch them and usually sell them with their greens intact a sign of their freshness the whole carrot including the greens is edible the young roots are especially sweet and cooking enhances that sweetness while the greens have a light parsley like flavor and make an excellent pesto combined with extra virgin olive oil and plenty of garlic peas early spring is the season for english peas only about 5 percent of peas grown in the united states are sold fresh so count yourself lucky if you happen to find them at the farmers market the rest are harvested and sold to the frozen and canned food industry when buying fresh english peas look for firm crisp pods colored a lustrous green flimsy or flexible pods are old and their peas will taste flavorless peas are a bit finicky to prepare the pod is edible but fibrous and difficult to digest so you ll have to split the pod to free the peas within each pod holds about five peas according to folklore if you find nine peas in a pod it s considered good luck especially if it s the first pod you open quickly boil fresh peas and serve them with plenty of butter or add them to spring soups artichokes artichokes enjoy two seasons the first harvest happens in spring and the second in early fall artichokes are actually flower buds in the thistle family and are close relatives of the sunflower their woody green prickled petals are often mistaken for leaves and they surround the artichoke s heart which sits amid the petals on a thick sturdy stem you ll find an inedible fibrous choke at the center of mature artichokes which is absent in baby artichokes steaming the large artichokes and serving them with a vinaigrette or hollandaise sauce is one of the most popular ways to serve them baby artichokes are a little more versatile and they re excellent roasted braised sautéed or tossed into a springtime vegetable stew asparagus you ll find that asparagus arrives at markets in early spring and it usually disappears by may so snatch it up when you can look for crisp spears with firm tips sweet and vegetal when first picked asparagus is a vegetable with a freshness that fades quickly so you ll need to use it within a day or two of buying it place the bunches in a jar full of cold water drape a plastic bag over their tips and tuck them in the fridge to help preserve them and keep them fresh young thin asparagus is excellent eaten fresh in salads you can also quickly blanch them or roast them with a little olive oil salt and pepper finished with a drizzle of fresh lemon juice creamy asparagus soup is a springtime classic herbs bundles of fresh herbs are often the first sign of spring at your local farmers market they arrive well before most vegetables and begin to bolt once summer s heat arrives in full force you ll find plenty of chives and their blossoms licorice scented tarragon and fragrant bunches of fresh mint these herbs are tender cool weather plants that while available throughout the growing season are at their peak in spring when buying herbs at the market look for vibrant plants with perky leaves and crisp juicy stems their leaves should be uniformly green and have a bit of life left in them herbs with limp stems or yellowing leaves are past their prime at home you can dampen a flour sack dishcloth or tea towel with water wringing it out well and then wrap your herbs in them then store the wrapped bundle in a resealable plastic bag

this isn t a check for all americans retired workers are now receiving an average of 1 657 in monthly social security benefits after a cost of living increase a headline published by the u s sun newspaper has led to confusion among some people about whether americans will soon receive another round of direct payments the headline says americans to receive checks worth 1 657 in just four days and your birthday will decide when you ll get the cash some social media users are wondering whether that s true and google trends data show people are asking whether everyone will receive the checks worth 1 657 the question are all americans receiving checks worth 1 657 the sources the answer no all americans are not receiving checks worth 1 657 what we found the checks worth 1 657 are only for social security recipients not the general public the sun newspaper mentions that later in its story but not in the misleading headline the checks themselves aren t new either recipients are just getting a cost of living increase in the amount they receive in their monthly benefits payments social security provides people with income when they retire or can t work due to disability those who are retired can start receiving their social security benefits as early as age 62 on its website the social security administration ssa said social security and supplemental security income ssi benefits for about 70 million americans would increase by 5 9 in 2022 due to an increase in the cost of living the cost of living adjustment cola for the majority of social security recipients began in january 2022 and the average payment for all retired workers is now 1 657 the social security act ties the annual cola to the increase in the consumer price index the most widely used measure of inflation which is determined by the u s bureau of labor statistics rep terri sewell d al a member of the house ways and means committee s subcommittee on social security said in a press release about the 5 9 increase the cola protects benefits against losing their purchasing power over time when the cost of rent food and other expenses increase the press release says medicare premiums which are deducted from social security checks for most beneficiaries typically consume much of the cola increase a fact sheet from the ssa also references the 1 657 number that s quoted in the sun headline ssa estimates that all retired workers will receive average monthly social security payments of 1 657 after the 5 9 increase compared to 1 565 before for a couple receiving benefits the average estimated monthly payment jumped from 2 599 to 2 753 the sun also mentions in its headline that a person s birthday determines when they ll get their check that s not new either a schedule that s been in place since 1997 outlines when social security recipients will receive their benefits payments based on their birthday aarp writes on its website previously all payments went out on the third day of the month but that wasn t feasible anymore as the number of recipients grew the social security benefits payment schedule is as follows those with birthdays on the 1st through the 10th are paid on the second wednesday of each month those with birthdays on the 11th through 20th are paid on the third wednesday of each month those with birthdays on the 21st through the 31st are paid on the fourth wednesday of each month these payments aren t related to stimulus checks the federal government previously sent three rounds of stimulus payments for amounts between 600 and 1 400 due to the covid 19 pandemic a fourth stimulus check for all americans isn t in the works right now the internal revenue service s website only has information pertaining to the first three stimulus checks with no evidence a fourth check will be coming from the federal government congress also hasn t passed any legislation for a fourth stimulus check

on the amount of formula purchases shoppers can make both online and in person tuesday the chain which oversees 9 932 us locations are now limiting customers to three purchases a day a spokesperson said the rationing by the retail giants come as an estimated 30 percent of popular formula brands have been reported sold out across the country the shortage is being blamed on supply chain issues stemming from the pandemic which has spawned a backlog of billions of dollars of toys clothing electronics vehicles and furniture over the past year a recent recall however compounded the issue in february when abbott one of four major american formula manufacturers called back a number of its products including its preeminent similac formulas due to a bacteria contamination at its michigan factory the contamination was discovered after four infants who consumed the company s formula products which also include alimentum and elecare were hospitalized with one later dying the recall which focused on products that had been manufactured at its factory in sturgis was spurred by a possible contamination of cronobacter sakazakii a bacteria that could prove deadly to infants the company said at the time a spokesperson for target a popular big box option in the us that boasts 1 931 stores countrywide announced stores in most states will now have a five per day limit on baby formula purchases at the request of the food and drug administration amid the shortage abbott later expanded the recall after the death of the infant who tested positive for the bacteria was reported fda investigations revealed that the facility where the formula had been produced had failed to follow sanitary regulations with documents showing complaints dating back several years now nearly two months later the product is increasingly out of stock at retailers both small and large across the country the shortage of the product which roughly three quarters of infants in the us receive at some

tried all the local targets we checked costco costco online walgreens long s anhoeck said can t find it anywhere the shortage of the product which roughly three quarters of infants in the us receive at some point within their first six months has parents across the country panicked abbott said tuesday that that company is currently taking measures to increase formula availability amid the shortage such as increasing production at fda registered facilities aside from the one named it the recall the company said it will also be shipping formula from across the atlantic from europe via plane and sharing supply information with rival formula makers to help them meet pent up demand the fda is currently investigating the company s michigan factory an analysis by datasembly a company that chronicles billions of grocery and retail pricing records for stores in all 50 states tracked baby formula stock at more than 11 000 stores and found that 29 percent of top selling baby formula products were out of stock as of the week of march 13 the marked increase is up 11 percent from november when the supply chain crunch was at its height due to a historically high demand for consumer goods during the pandemic when an influx of americans elected to stay home instead of spending money on travel and entertainment other issues contributing to the bottleneck on america s overseas supply line including a lack of manpower at us ports and restrictions that came with the covid 19 outbreak in 2020 and 2021 these constraints which included social distancing and mandatory quarantines severely limited the number and ability of port workers and thus hampered the flow of products including formula into the states other supply chain related issues spurring the formula shortage include an increased difficulty procuring key ingredients along with packaging delays and labor shortages this is a shocking number that you don t see for other categories ben reich ceo of datasembly told cbs of the study s results which he said are likely to worsen a recent recall also compounded the issue in february when abbott one of the four major american formula manufacturers recalled a number of its products including the popular similac pictured is a currently out of stock similac listing on amazon a recent study that tracked baby formula stock at more than 11 000 stores found that 29 percent of top selling baby formula products including enfamil pictured were out of stock as of the week of march 13 we ve been tracking it over time and it s going up dramatically we see this category is being affected by economic conditions more dramatically than others reich said the probe by the retail tracker further found that in 24 us states 30 percent of all formula was out of stock as of mid march while other states were seeing even worse shortages in minnesota for instance a whopping 54 percent of baby formula products were out of stock several states also saw shortages of more than 40 percent the study revealed including connecticut hawaii iowa louisiana maryland north and south dakota rhode island and texas for reference during the first seven months of 2021 only 2 to 8 percent of baby formula products were out of stock the american deep and mid south have also been hit hard by the formula scarcity compounded by a slew of storm systems that have ravaged states like georgia mississippi and north and south carolina in recent weeks with shelves once lined with the product now barren more than two years into the pandemic the product is increasingly out of stock at retailers both small and large across the country pictured is an empty formula shelf in january a spokesperson for cvs health america s number one pharmacy with 9 874 locations nationwide in february was forced to acknowledge the shortage saying product supply challenges are currently impacting most of the retail industry the company went on to assert that it is working with national brand baby formula vendors to address this issue and we regret any inconvenience that our customers may be experiencing in january enfamil on of the nation s foremost baby formula brands said it was grappling with an unprecedented 18 percent surge in demand for baby formula in the us we have taken steps to ramp up production and are currently shipping 50 percent more product to address issues as fast as

to the point where i ll probably be just another one of these hundreds of thousands of people is moving out of california it s really hard because you ve got kids i see some people they have four or 56 kids and you know mhm no they have something fun but okay mhm mhm advertisement why is inflation so high and when could it ease share copy link copy another month another four decade high for inflation for the 12 months that ended in march consumer prices rocketed 8 5 that was the fastest year over year jump since 1981 far surpassing february s mark of 7 9 itself a 40 year high even if you toss out food and energy prices which are notoriously volatile and have driven much of the price spike so called core inflation jumped 6 5 in the past 12 months that was also the sharpest such jump in four decades consumers have felt the squeeze in everyday routines gasoline is up an average of 48 in the past year airline tickets are up 24 men s suits nearly 15 bacon 18 the federal reserve never anticipated inflation this severe or persistent back in december 2020 the fed s policymakers had forecast that consumer inflation would stay below their 2 annual target and end 2021 at around 1 8 yet after having been merely an afterthought for decades high inflation reasserted itself last year with brutal speed in february 2021 the government s consumer price index was running just 1 7 above its level a year earlier from there the year over year increases accelerated 2 6 in march 4 2 in april 5 in may 5 4 in june by october the figure was 6 2 by november 6 8 by december 7 for months fed chair jerome powell and some others characterized higher consumer prices as merely transitory the result mainly of shipping delays and temporary shortages of supplies and workers as the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession much faster than anyone had anticipated now most economists expect inflation to remain elevated well into next year with demand outstripping supplies in numerous areas of the economy so the fed has radically changed course last month it raised its benchmark short term rate by a quarter point and is expected to keep raising it probably aggressively well into 2023 in doing so the fed is moving decisively away from the ultra low rates that helped revive the economy from the recession but also helped fuel surging consumer prices the fed is making a high risk bet that it can slow the economy enough to rein in inflation without weakening it so much as to trigger a recession the overall economy is healthy with a robust job market and extremely low unemployment but many economists say they worry that the fed s steady credit tightening will cause an economic downturn ____what s caused the spike in inflation good news mostly when the pandemic paralyzed the economy in the spring of 2020 and lockdowns kicked in businesses closed or cut hours and consumers stayed home as a health precaution employers slashed a breathtaking 22 million jobs economic output plunged at a record shattering 31 annual rate in 2020 s april june quarter everyone braced for more misery companies cut investment and postponed restocking a brutal recession ensued but instead of sinking into a prolonged downturn the economy staged an unexpectedly rousing recovery fueled by vast infusions of government aid and emergency intervention by the fed which slashed rates among other things by spring of last year the rollout of vaccines had emboldened consumers to return to restaurants bars shops airports and entertainment venues suddenly businesses had to scramble to meet demand they couldn t hire fast enough to fill job openings or buy enough supplies to meet customer orders as business roared back ports and freight yards couldn t handle the traffic global supply chains seized up with demand up and supplies down costs jumped and companies found that they could pass along those higher costs in the form of higher prices to consumers many of whom had managed to pile up savings during the pandemic critics blamed in part president joe biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package with its 1 400 checks to most households for overheating an economy that was already sizzling on its own many others argued that the fed kept rates near zero far too long lending fuel to runaway spending and inflated prices in stocks homes and other assets ____how long will it last elevated consumer price inflation could endure as long as companies struggle to keep up with consumers demand for goods and services a recovering job market employers added a record 6 7 million jobs last year and are adding 560 000 a month so far this year means that americans as a whole can continue to splurge on everything from lawn furniture to electronics many economists foresee inflation staying well above the fed s 2 annual target this year but relief from higher prices might be coming jammed up supply chains are beginning to show some signs of improvement at least in some industries the fed s pivot away from easy money policies toward an anti inflationary policy could eventually reduce consumer demand there will be no repeat of last year s covid relief checks from washington inflation itself is eroding purchasing power and might force some consumers to shave spending at the same time new covid variants could cloud the outlook either by causing outbreaks that force factories and ports to close and disrupt supply chains even more or by keeping people home and reducing demand for goods ___how are higher prices affecting consumers the strong job market is boosting workers pay though not enough to offset higher prices the labor department says that after accounting for higher consumer prices hourly earnings for private sector employees fell 2 7 last month from a year earlier the 12th straight such drop there are exceptions after inflation wages rose 8 for hotel workers and 4 for restaurant and bar employees in march from a year earlier partisan politics in the meantime is influencing the way americans view the inflation threat with a democrat in the white house republicans are far more likely than democrats to say that inflation is having a negative effect on their personal finances according to surveys of consumer sentiment conducted by the university of michigan

yeah they do look good i i did forget to check out inside mhm xr x oh yeah i mean you know gas prices are up obviously everyone knows that uh you know so that s that s an extra dollar per gallon that i m paying to get into the city to work and then you know we have the tolls that just went up this past year a dollar my eggs are a dollar more as well so everything s going up at least a dollar which you know adds up of course especially when you have kids and i m going to get groceries i mean my rent is absolutely ridiculous so and i just kind of see it kind of climbing and climbing and climbing to the point where i ll probably be just another one of these hundreds of thousands of people is moving out of california it s really hard because you ve got kids i see some people they have four or 56 kids and you know mhm no they have something fun but okay mhm mhm advertisement why is inflation so high and when could it ease share copy link copy another month another four decade high for inflation for the 12 months that ended in march consumer prices rocketed 8 5 that was the fastest year over year jump since 1981 far surpassing february s mark of 7 9 itself a 40 year high even if you toss out food and energy prices which are notoriously volatile and have driven much of the price spike so called core inflation jumped 6 5 in the past 12 months that was also the sharpest such jump in four decades consumers have felt the squeeze in everyday routines gasoline is up an average of 48 in the past year airline tickets are up 24 men s suits nearly 15 bacon 18 the federal reserve never anticipated inflation this severe or persistent back in december 2020 the fed s policymakers had forecast that consumer inflation would stay below their 2 annual target and end 2021 at around 1 8 yet after having been merely an afterthought for decades high inflation reasserted itself last year with brutal speed in february 2021 the government s consumer price index was running just 1 7 above its level a year earlier from there the year over year increases accelerated 2 6 in march 4 2 in april 5 in may 5 4 in june by october the figure was 6 2 by november 6 8 by december 7 for months fed chair jerome powell and some others characterized higher consumer prices as merely transitory the result mainly of shipping delays and temporary shortages of supplies and workers as the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession much faster than anyone had anticipated now most economists expect inflation to remain elevated well into next year with demand outstripping supplies in numerous areas of the economy so the fed has radically changed course last month it raised its benchmark short term rate by a quarter point and is expected to keep raising it probably aggressively well into 2023 in doing so the fed is moving decisively away from the ultra low rates that helped revive the economy from the recession but also helped fuel surging consumer prices the fed is making a high risk bet that it can slow the economy enough to rein in inflation without weakening it so much as to trigger a recession the overall economy is healthy with a robust job market and extremely low unemployment but many economists say they worry that the fed s steady credit tightening will cause an economic downturn ____what s caused the spike in inflation good news mostly when the pandemic paralyzed the economy in the spring of 2020 and lockdowns kicked in businesses closed or cut hours and consumers stayed home as a health precaution employers slashed a breathtaking 22 million jobs economic output plunged at a record shattering 31 annual rate in 2020 s april june quarter everyone braced for more misery companies cut investment and postponed restocking a brutal recession ensued but instead of sinking into a prolonged downturn the economy staged an unexpectedly rousing recovery fueled by vast infusions of government aid and emergency intervention by the fed which slashed rates among other things by spring of last year the rollout of vaccines had emboldened consumers to return to restaurants bars shops airports and entertainment venues suddenly businesses had to scramble to meet demand they couldn t hire fast enough to fill job openings or buy enough supplies to meet customer orders as business roared back ports and freight yards couldn t handle the traffic global supply chains seized up with demand up and supplies down costs jumped and companies found that they could pass along those higher costs in the form of higher prices to consumers many of whom had managed to pile up savings during the pandemic critics blamed in part president joe biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package with its 1 400 checks to most households for overheating an economy that was already sizzling on its own many others argued that the fed kept rates near zero far too long lending fuel to runaway spending and inflated prices in stocks homes and other assets ____how long will it last elevated consumer price inflation could endure as long as companies struggle to keep up with consumers demand for goods and services a recovering job market employers added a record 6 7 million jobs last year and are adding 560 000 a month so far this year means that americans as a whole can continue to splurge on everything from lawn furniture to electronics many economists foresee inflation staying well above the fed s 2 annual target this year but relief from higher prices might be coming jammed up supply chains are beginning to show some signs of improvement at least in some industries the fed s pivot away from easy money policies toward an anti inflationary policy could eventually reduce consumer demand there will be no repeat of last year s covid relief checks from washington inflation itself is eroding purchasing power and might force some consumers to shave spending at the same time new covid variants could cloud the outlook either by causing outbreaks that force factories and ports to close and disrupt supply chains even more or by keeping people home and reducing demand for goods ___how are higher prices affecting consumers the strong job market is boosting workers pay though not enough to offset higher prices the labor department says that after accounting for higher consumer prices hourly earnings for private sector employees fell 2 7 last month from a year earlier the 12th straight such drop there are exceptions after inflation wages rose 8 for hotel workers and 4 for restaurant and bar employees in march from a year earlier partisan politics in the meantime is influencing the way americans view the inflation threat with a democrat in the white house republicans are far more likely than democrats to say that inflation is having a negative effect on their personal finances according to surveys of consumer sentiment conducted by the university of michigan
this isn t a check for all americans retired workers are now receiving an average of 1 657 in monthly social security benefits after a cost of living increase a headline published by the u s sun newspaper has led to confusion among some people about whether americans will soon receive another round of direct payments the headline says americans to receive checks worth 1 657 in just four days and your birthday will decide when you ll get the cash some social media users are wondering whether that s true and google trends data show people are asking whether everyone will receive the checks worth 1 657 the question are all americans receiving checks worth 1 657 the sources the answer no all americans are not receiving checks worth 1 657 what we found the checks worth 1 657 are only for social security recipients not the general public the sun newspaper mentions that later in its story but not in the misleading headline the checks themselves aren t new either recipients are just getting a cost of living increase in the amount they receive in their monthly benefits payments social security provides people with income when they retire or can t work due to disability those who are retired can start receiving their social security benefits as early as age 62 on its website the social security administration ssa said social security and supplemental security income ssi benefits for about 70 million americans would increase by 5 9 in 2022 due to an increase in the cost of living the cost of living adjustment cola for the majority of social security recipients began in january 2022 and the average payment for all retired workers is now 1 657 the social security act ties the annual cola to the increase in the consumer price index the most widely used measure of inflation which is determined by the u s bureau of labor statistics rep terri sewell d al a member of the house ways and means committee s subcommittee on social security said in a press release about the 5 9 increase the cola protects benefits against losing their purchasing power over time when the cost of rent food and other expenses increase the press release says medicare premiums which are deducted from social security checks for most beneficiaries typically consume much of the cola increase a fact sheet from the ssa also references the 1 657 number that s quoted in the sun headline ssa estimates that all retired workers will receive average monthly social security payments of 1 657 after the 5 9 increase compared to 1 565 before for a couple receiving benefits the average estimated monthly payment jumped from 2 599 to 2 753 the sun also mentions in its headline that a person s birthday determines when they ll get their check that s not new either a schedule that s been in place since 1997 outlines when social security recipients will receive their benefits payments based on their birthday aarp writes on its website previously all payments went out on the third day of the month but that wasn t feasible anymore as the number of recipients grew the social security benefits payment schedule is as follows those with birthdays on the 1st through the 10th are paid on the second wednesday of each month those with birthdays on the 11th through 20th are paid on the third wednesday of each month those with birthdays on the 21st through the 31st are paid on the fourth wednesday of each month these payments aren t related to stimulus checks the federal government previously sent three rounds of stimulus payments for amounts between 600 and 1 400 due to the covid 19 pandemic a fourth stimulus check for all americans isn t in the works right now the internal revenue service s website only has information pertaining to the first three stimulus checks with no evidence a fourth check will be coming from the federal government congress also hasn t passed any legislation for a fourth stimulus check

this isn t a check for all americans retired workers are now receiving an average of 1 657 in monthly social security benefits after a cost of living increase a headline published by the u s sun newspaper has led to confusion among some people about whether americans will soon receive another round of direct payments the headline says americans to receive checks worth 1 657 in just four days and your birthday will decide when you ll get the cash some social media users are wondering whether that s true and google trends data show people are asking whether everyone will receive the checks worth 1 657 the question are all americans receiving checks worth 1 657 the sources the answer no all americans are not receiving checks worth 1 657 what we found the checks worth 1 657 are only for social security recipients not the general public the sun newspaper mentions that later in its story but not in the misleading headline the checks themselves aren t new either recipients are just getting a cost of living increase in the amount they receive in their monthly benefits payments social security provides people with income when they retire or can t work due to disability those who are retired can start receiving their social security benefits as early as age 62 on its website the social security administration ssa said social security and supplemental security income ssi benefits for about 70 million americans would increase by 5 9 in 2022 due to an increase in the cost of living the cost of living adjustment cola for the majority of social security recipients began in january 2022 and the average payment for all retired workers is now 1 657 the social security act ties the annual cola to the increase in the consumer price index the most widely used measure of inflation which is determined by the u s bureau of labor statistics rep terri sewell d al a member of the house ways and means committee s subcommittee on social security said in a press release about the 5 9 increase the cola protects benefits against losing their purchasing power over time when the cost of rent food and other expenses increase the press release says medicare premiums which are deducted from social security checks for most beneficiaries typically consume much of the cola increase a fact sheet from the ssa also references the 1 657 number that s quoted in the sun headline ssa estimates that all retired workers will receive average monthly social security payments of 1 657 after the 5 9 increase compared to 1 565 before for a couple receiving benefits the average estimated monthly payment jumped from 2 599 to 2 753 the sun also mentions in its headline that a person s birthday determines when they ll get their check that s not new either a schedule that s been in place since 1997 outlines when social security recipients will receive their benefits payments based on their birthday aarp writes on its website previously all payments went out on the third day of the month but that wasn t feasible anymore as the number of recipients grew the social security benefits payment schedule is as follows those with birthdays on the 1st through the 10th are paid on the second wednesday of each month those with birthdays on the 11th through 20th are paid on the third wednesday of each month those with birthdays on the 21st through the 31st are paid on the fourth wednesday of each month these payments aren t related to stimulus checks the federal government previously sent three rounds of stimulus payments for amounts between 600 and 1 400 due to the covid 19 pandemic a fourth stimulus check for all americans isn t in the works right now the internal revenue service s website only has information pertaining to the first three stimulus checks with no evidence a fourth check will be coming from the federal government congress also hasn t passed any legislation for a fourth stimulus check
let s talk next steps what s he going to do to make up for all of the needless misery he caused i m not asking him to think like his fellow italian marc antony and fall on his sword so let s turn our minds to the moderate and reasonable options how many days is fauci volunteering to place himself in stocks set up on the national mall so that we can all pelt him with rotten eggs one day for every completely wrong thing he ever said would be fair but then he d be there all summer so let s be charitable and just make it a long holiday weekend advertisement the nation s 4 year olds should be allowed to get to the front of the line if any of them can squeeze in some time between appointments with all of the speech pathologists and psychotherapists they need because of fauci s insane policies you may have missed it but fauci said something even stupider than we gotta control this thing before we admit it s endemic in the november interview that we shouldn t get too excited about the distinction between such covid outcomes as getting killed and missing a day of work why did he say something so absurd because he s larry lockdown and loves to create confusion and panic like another blustering egomaniac the guy he used to work for he can t handle the idea of an america in which everyone isn t talking about him all the time in post covid america guess who doesn t get invited on colbert and kimmel and meet the press every week

cnn claims they re the only u s news outlet with a reporter inside the city which may well be true this is the first time i ve seen an american correspondent broadcasting live from shanghai advertisement enjoy david culver while you can though because if he tests positive he ll be going away for awhile to a quarantine facility in parts unknown he s so worried about that in fact that in his account of his experience for cnn com he says he s prepared a box of essentials for his dog chairman if culver s whisked away to isolate somewhere he hopes that someone will come by and care for his pet but there s no guarantee the dog may end up starving in the apartment or worse in wuhan at the start of the pandemic chinese authorities were known to weld the doors of people s apartments shut to make sure they didn t leave two years later says culver with government personnel scattered across shanghai and keeping an eye on residents comings and goings lockdown is enforced more elegantly they seal your door with paper now if you leave when you re not supposed to they ll know at a glance by the broken seal then you ll be in trouble and you don t want to be in trouble don t be daunted by the length of this clip as culver is featured only in the first three minutes watch then read on the news from shanghai today is that lockdown rules are being relaxed but only for about a quarter of the population i wrote a few days ago about how city authorities were shifting to a more targeted approach in which lockdowns would be tailored to particular districts or neighborhoods rather than imposed city wide if you re lucky enough to live in a neighborhood with no positive tests you re now free to move about if you aren t and most aren t then get used to starvation advertisement the government eased restrictions by announcing residents of areas with no cases for at least two weeks can leave their homes starting tuesday it said they could go to other areas that also had no new cases during that time but were urged to stay home when possible such prevention areas have about 4 8 million people the paper reported citing city officials it said all but 500 000 of those were in less crowded suburbs an additional 1 8 million people in control areas with no new cases in the past week are allowed out but can t leave their neighborhoods the report said another 15 million people in quarantine areas that have had infections in the past week still are barred from leaving their homes the report gave no indication of the status of the remaining 3 4 million people in the official population the government is making food shipments but coverage is spotty some households are getting two shipments a week says the ap while others report getting nothing some residents are down to one meal per day i ration my food and make the most of what arrives in the box and any extra food my community has been able to source culver wrote of his own survival strategy lately most of my meals have been a combination of eggs and carrots you have to get creative chinese citizens across the country are watching this play out and doing exactly what you d expect them to do raising the prospect of wider food shortages in china advertisement in beijing where some residential districts have been closed in recent weeks as infections have been discovered supermarket shelves in some parts of the city have been picked clean of toilet paper canned foods instant noodles and rice in recent days in suzhou an industrial hub roughly two hours drive west of shanghai residents swarmed supermarkets to fill their grocery baskets with instant noodles and other food on tuesday morning hours after local officials said they would conduct districtwide testing in one section of the city on social media chinese are reportedly sharing checklists of food to stock up on and strategies for growing vegetables and freezing tofu the risk that lockdowns will spread to other parts of the country is real at least 23 cities are under some form of restriction scott gottlieb noted yesterday with guangzhou now sealed off to visitors after it recorded 27 cases in a population of 18 million people even with the mass testing we can assume that the virus has moved beyond shanghai before the city was locked down said one hong kong professor to cnn if major outbreaks emerge in other locales the ccp will face hard decisions on how to manage them it s already sent tens of thousands of medical personnel to shanghai to conduct daily testing do those personnel redeploy to guangzhou if there s a spike there do they send in the pla to do testing instead it s a great irony of shanghai s ordeal that it may lead the chinese government towards an even more draconian form of its disastrous zero covid policy that is one could argue that shanghai s big mistake was that it didn t lock down sooner when case counts were small to snuff out transmission instead of waiting until the virus had begun to spread in earnest other chinese cities may pay for that mistake with sudden early lockdowns and they know it hence the food hoarding advertisement the situation is grim enough that the state department just urged all non emergency workers and their families in shanghai to evacuate there s no telling how hard it might be soon to find food or to what the chinese government might resort in order to stop the spread i ll leave you with another segment culver did for cnn last night on life in one of the world s biggest cities as it slowly starves to death maybe he should think about trying to get out too

walmart s plan to recruit truckers to its private fleet by offering drivers double the median pay for shorter hauls is just the latest example of how the rise of e commerce has changed the trucking industry experts said the retail giant announced plans last week to increase pay for drivers delivering goods and products to its warehouses and stores first year walmart drivers can now earn up to 110 000 more than double the industry s 47 130 median pay for long haul drivers demonstrating how far the company is willing to go to recruit truckers in a tight labor market walmart did not respond to a request for comment cnbc previously reported that company officials said drivers have earned an average of 87 500 in their first year similar competition driven by the growth of e commerce and demand for rapid home deliveries has in recent years pushed the trucking industry to remake itself putting more long and short haul trucks on the road and reducing delivery times trucking experts said it has also given truckers more options including the opportunity to join fleets offering higher wages and shorter routes and the ability to spend more time with their families said bob costello the chief economist at the american trucking associations however the exodus of truckers from traditional fleets may worsen the national trucking shortage and take away some of the best and most experienced drivers in the industry federal transportation officials and trucking experts said freight employers which include trucking companies are experiencing challenges recruiting and retaining qualified applicants because of challenging working conditions the transportation department wrote when it released its supply chain assessment report in february as e commerce creates additional demand for warehousing jobs and short haul freight long haul trucking positions may become harder to fill according to the report which added that long hours away from home and high turnover rates may lead truckers to seek employment elsewhere trucks line up to have containers loaded at the norfolk international terminal in norfolk va on dec 1 walmart workers who once unloaded trucks now have a chance to drive them the country s largest retailer has launched a training program for employees who work in its distribution or fulfillment centers steve helber ap in a 2019 report the american transportation research institute cited the growth in e commerce along with drivers retirements and competition from other industries as contributing to a trucker shortage the growing demand for truck transportation from e commerce is further exacerbating the industry s issues with vehicle capacity and truck driver demand the report read walmart runs and controls its own fleet as the largest private trucking company in the country boasting more than 12 000 drivers which makes for an enticing job for those who want to spend less time on the road there s definitely going to be a migration of drivers said thomas balzer the president of the ohio trucking association driving shorter routes for e commerce companies is an attractive opportunity for more qualified drivers and truck loaders who get shorter work trips and are able to work closer to home the american transportation research institute wrote in its report experts say competition to recruit and retain skilled drivers has allowed truckers to earn more in recent years even more so during the pandemic when supply chain issues have made it more difficult to deliver goods everywhere a walmart driver gets in his truck after a break at a love s truck stop in springville utah on nov 5 george frey getty images file we re in an environment where pay has been going up and continues going up in a tight driver market in which demand is outstripping supplies costello said ellen voie the president of the women in trucking association said drivers in general should earn more and enjoy better benefits and job flexibility for their hard work that s a good thing because drivers need to get paid more for what they do voie said adding that drivers sometimes even receive stock options after they switch to the private fleets but the hiring standards at walmart and other e commerce companies are competitive experts said you have to be the cream of the crop the training and testing is intense balzer said costello said the best example of how e commerce has changed the trucking industry is the reduction in the average trucking haul across the industry in general the average drive for long haulers crisscrossing several states to deliver goods has dwindled from 800 to 500 miles over the last two decades he said so there are more loads but at fewer miles costello said before the e commerce boom big box retailers had three to five distribution centers across the country where truckers would deliver those loads but now they have dozens of warehouses and in the last decade as consumers preferred at home drop offs delivery times became faster trucks that were being driven 130 000 miles a year are now doing closer to 100 000 miles as the industry has evolved over the past two decades costello said

billionaire elon musk is facing a lawsuit following a week of headlines created by his purchase of 9 2 percent of twitter s stock an investor sued musk on tuesday and proposed a class action lawsuit against him for not disclosing his purchase to the securities and exchange commission sooner the plaintiff marc rasella said in the lawsuit filed in federal court in manhattan new york that he lost money by selling shares of twitter at artificially deflated prices because musk waited beyond the mandated sec deadline to disclose his stake musk disclosed in an sec filing on april 4 that he had bought shares representing 9 2 percent of twitter making him the largest outside shareholder of the company s stock the share price rose more than 27 percent after the news rasella said in the lawsuit that musk had an obligation mandated by the sec to disclose his stake within 10 days of passing a 5 percent ownership threshold a deadline that would have been march 24 plaintiff and the class would not have sold twitter s securities at the price sold or at all if they had been aware that the market prices had been artificially and falsely deflated by defendant s misleading statements the lawsuit said musk has long been an avid twitter user but his interest as an investor is more recent over the weekend he declined an invitation to join the twitter board a position that would have closed off the possibility of a hostile takeover and limited what he could say about the social media company the lawsuit did not ask for a specified amount in damages but it said musk saved about 143 million by filing his form after the sec deadline and purchasing shares in the meantime representatives for musk the world s wealthiest person according to forbes did not immediately respond to a request for comment submitted to tesla the automaker where musk is ceo twitter declined to comment on the suit
