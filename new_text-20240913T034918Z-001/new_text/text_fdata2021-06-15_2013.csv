pembina pipeline corporation pembina or the company tsx ppl nyse pba today announced a mid year business update including delineation of its extensive runway of development opportunities which collectively highlight the company s strong momentum as it builds one of the largest and most integrated midstream energy companies in north america highlights volumes across the pipelines and facilities divisions have continued to grow steadily in 2021 exceeding pre covid levels over 400 million of assets placed into service so far in 2021 including prince rupert terminal prt a northeast british columbia nebc terminal and the expansion of the vancouver wharves terminal the vancouver wharves expansion with another approximately 1 billion currently under construction of assets placed into service so far in 2021 including prince rupert terminal prt a northeast nebc terminal and the expansion of the vancouver wharves terminal the vancouver wharves expansion with another approximately currently under construction reactivation of the phase ix peace pipeline expansion phase ix over 7 billion of accretive projects identified and in various stages of development to be pursued by pembina alone or upon combination with inter pipeline ltd inter pipeline of accretive projects identified and in various stages of development to be pursued by pembina alone or upon combination with inter pipeline ltd inter pipeline formation of chinook pathways partnership to support western indigenous pipeline group to pursue ownership of trans mountain pipeline partnership with the haisla nation in the development of cedar lng executive commentary mick dilger pembina s president and chief executive officer commented as a reflection of our confidence in improving market fundamentals and our strong competitive position as evidenced by volumes on most of our systems exceeding pre covid levels we are excited to delineate the extensive runway of development opportunities we see in front of us with the opportunities that lie ahead pembina remains confident in the work it is doing to create an integrated diversified and global energy platform and the combination with inter pipeline further advances this objective one that will serve as a strong foundation benefitting the entire canadian energy sector as the needs of our customers investors communities and employees as well as the global energy landscape change pembina is committed to helping all our stakeholders take advantage of opportunities for sustainable and long lasting growth mr dilger added throughout its history pembina has had an unwavering focus on developing meaningful relationships and creating value for all stakeholders we could not be prouder of our partnerships with both the haisla nation and the western indigenous pipeline group pembina believes that the future of canada s energy sector development is inextricably linked to meaningful partnerships and commercial relationships with indigenous communities we see an important role for our company to play in advancing indigenous economic reconciliation in canada business update activity in the western canadian sedimentary basin continues to benefit from strengthening commodity prices across all the products within pembina s integrated value chain crude oil condensate natural gas and natural gas liquids ngl notably there were 49 active rigs in alberta and british columbia for the month of may representing an approximately 155 percent increase from the same time last year as a result of significantly higher energy prices pembina has seen continued strength and recovery in its conventional pipelines business physical throughput for the second quarter of 2021 is expected to be approximately three percent higher than the first quarter of 2021 and in line with pre covid levels further pembina is forecasting continued growth in physical volumes on its conventional pipelines for the remainder of the year higher physical volumes are being driven primarily by increased capacity utilization on the peace and northern systems in addition to increased volumes on the drayton valley system pembina has also seen strong demand on cochin pipeline cochin physical throughput in april averaged over 100 000 barrels per day bpd which represents one of the highest average volume months in cochin s history the increased volume is a result of the recent debottleneck completed since pembina acquired cochin in late 2019 which proved up an incremental approximately 15 000 bpd of capacity with no associated capital cost pembina expects to see continued strong year over year demand and volumes in excess of assumptions made at the time of the acquiring cochin similarly in pembina s gas services business volumes are exceeding pre covid levels and pembina is expecting to finish the year with record average physical volumes year to date veresen midstream s physical throughput has exceeded the budget forecast at all of its facilities with strong commodity prices veresen midstream continues to expect robust activity in the montney for the remainder of the year higher inlet gas volumes have resulted in more processed liquids for pembina s value chain while lowering per unit operating costs for all customers pembina has observed that as a result of strong aeco and chicago natural gas pricing in addition to increases in liquids pricing producers have shifted to higher rate natural gas weighted liquids rich wells with higher pembina and third party gas processing volumes pembina is seeing increasing demand for its integrated ngl value chain with facilities at the redwater complex operating at record utilization and throughput as a result of high customer demand for fractionation and rail services pembina is accelerating its evaluation of a fourth propane plus fractionation facility as discussed further below in addition to continued volume growth pembina has placed over 400 million of new projects into service so far in 2021 pembina recently placed into service its first marine export facility prt on watson island british columbia the start up of prt is a major step in providing market diversity and helping add incremental value to western canadian hydrocarbons since being placed into service pembina has safely loaded seven vessels with exports of propane to international markets approaching one million barrels exceeding our commissioning volume expectations for our customers the start up of prt is a major step in providing market diversity and helping add incremental value to western canadian hydrocarbons since being placed into service pembina has safely loaded seven vessels with exports of propane to international markets approaching one million barrels exceeding our commissioning volume expectations for our customers in february a new northeast british columbia terminal the nebc montney infrastructure project which connects to pembina s nebc pipeline system was placed into service these assets are supported by long term cost of service arrangements with an investment grade counterparty terminal the nebc montney infrastructure project which connects to pembina s nebc pipeline system was placed into service these assets are supported by long term cost of service arrangements with an investment grade counterparty in late may the company placed the vancouver wharves expansion into service the expansion added 200 000 barrels of additional refined product storage and enhancements to the railcar unloading capabilities volumes for vancouver wharves are loaded on railcars at pembina s redwater complex representing another example of pembina s strategy coming to fruition vancouver wharves expansion is supported by a 20 year take or pay off take agreement with an asian based investment grade counterparty pembina anticipates providing an update to its 2021 financial guidance upon completion of its six month actual plus six month forecast in the normal course secured and deferred projects phase ix peace pipeline expansion pembina is reactivating the previously deferred phase ix which will add capacity in the northwest alberta to gordondale alberta corridor to accommodate increased activity in the nebc montney play as was the case with the previously announced reactivation of the phase vii peace pipeline expansion phase vii pembina s decision to re commence construction of phase ix was based on extensive discussions with its producing customers validating long term development plans and leading to a clear understanding and consensus regarding their need for future intra basin transportation these discussions confirmed both the need for and the timing of phase ix phase ix will include new 6 inch and 16 inch pipelines debottlenecking the corridor north of gordondale alberta as well as upgrades at one pump station in addition this expansion will see existing pipelines which are currently batching converted to single product lines furthering pembina s goal of full product segregation across the peace pipeline system phase ix also now includes a pump station in the wapiti to kakwa corridor that is partially complete and was previously part of the phase vii project scope this pump station will help accommodate increased and sustained demand for ngl service also due to increased activity in the montney phase ix is supported by 10 year contracts with predominantly investment grade counterparties including significant take or pay provisions the project has a revised estimated cost of approximately 120 million which reflects the addition of the wapiti to kakwa corridor pump station offset by cost savings identified through value engineering phase ix is anticipated to be placed into service throughout the second half of 2022 subject to regulatory and environmental approvals the reactivation of phase ix and potentially the phase viii peace pipeline expansion phase viii will have a minimal impact on pembina s 2021 capital program phase viii expansion the previously announced phase viii although having received all regulatory approvals remains deferred initial contracts supporting the project remain intact and the customers continue to signal plans which will necessitate the incremental capacity value engineering work is ongoing and pembina continues to evaluate this project in discussions with its producing customers with a reactivation decision expected in the second half of 2021 in support of phase ix and the potential reactivation of phase viii pembina has entered into an exclusivity agreement with and concurrently provided an irrevocable offer for midstream services to a premiere nebc montney producer the exclusivity agreement provides a bridge to negotiation of definitive agreements for transportation and fractionation t f of a material volume of liquids and ngl mix from certain nebc montney lands pembina and the producer will work together over the next few months to develop and execute definitive agreements by the end of 2021 all new firm t f services provided under the proposed arrangement would be supported by long term take or pay agreements prior to deferral phase viii had an associated capital cost of approximately 500 million but pembina expects this level of investment to decrease given cost and scope improvements prince rupert terminal expansion pembina is continuing to evaluate expansion of prt up to approximately 45 000 bpd incremental propane supply available under the proposed combination with inter pipeline would further support this expansion given substantial incremental proprietary natural gas liquids supply project engineering is well advanced including an alternative for larger vessels and butane export and a final investment decision is expected in the second half of 2021 project backlog on a standalone basis pembina s backlog of new projects stood in excess of 4 billion across numerous value chains the industrial logic of the combination with inter pipeline enhances the probability as well as the profitability of a number of capital investment opportunities many of which each company was pursuing independently readily actionable upon closing of inter pipeline 450 million estimated adjusted ebitda multiple of 4 5x cochrane straddle plant connecting inter pipeline s cochrane straddle

expansion with the initial debottleneck complete pembina continues to evaluate the option to expand cochin by up to an additional 35 000 bpd to a total capacity of 150 000 bpd at preliminary capital investment of 100 million one such opportunity is the development of a project to connect the aux sable channahon facility channahon to pembina s cochin pipeline the new approximately 40 million pipeline aims to improve shipper netbacks by providing a reliable low cost transportation option for condensate produced at channahon that is currently being trucked or railed by reintroducing aux

s hythe facility each new cogeneration facility will use natural gas to generate approximately 30 to 45 megawatts of electrical power thereby reducing overall operating costs by providing power and heat while shielding pembina s customers from volatility in power prices and uncertainty in the power market these facilities also reduce energy use by capturing waste heat resulting in a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions the expected capital cost of each cogeneration project will vary based on the size and scope of each facility pembina is pursuing additional cogeneration projects at both its duvernay complex and veresen midstream s facility each new cogeneration facility will use natural gas to generate approximately 30 to 45 megawatts of electrical power thereby reducing

cedar lng an approximately 1 5 billion net to pembina floating lng facility in partnership with the haisla first nation as discussed further below pdh pp petrochemical complex as highlighted in the recent announcement of pembina s proposed combination with inter pipeline by combining inter pipeline s hpc with pembina s industry leading 60 000 bpd of propane supply infrastructure in fort saskatchewan long term supply risk for hpc would be eliminated while further improving the possibility of a second such facility globally petrochemical infrastructure tends to cluster with multiple facilities taking advantage of shared infrastructure and feedstock with this in mind pembina has undertaken a preliminary evaluation of the synergies that may be available to the combined entity through the development of a second facility and has identified approximately 200 million of capital cost savings and approximately 100 million of annual operating general and administrative expense savings compared to building a single stand alone facility in addition pembina and its partner safeguarded a 400 million investment in their previous project including finishing several long lead equipment orders that remain in storage pembina will continue to carefully consider possible next steps to progress further petrochemical infrastructure opportunities a second facility would be incremental to the 6 billion of combined development opportunities described above esg centric investments investments to reduce the emissions intensity of each business pembina operates pembina has committed to reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of each business it operates and by the end of 2021 will have taken concrete action in this area and published five year emissions reduction targets investments which could contribute to achieving these targets include in addition to cogeneration facilities at the empress and duvernay facilities the company continues to evaluate additional potential cogeneration projects at its other facilities including those of inter pipeline facilities the company continues to evaluate additional potential cogeneration projects at its other facilities including those of inter pipeline incremental renewable power agreements across our business similar to the previously announced transaction with trans alta and and pilot projects for carbon capture and sequestration at pembina s redwater kakwa river and hythe facilities are under evaluation indigenous partnerships cedar lng the haisla nation and pembina recently announced a partnership agreement whereby pembina will become the haisla nation s partner in the development of the proposed cedar lng project cedar lng is strategically positioned to leverage canada s abundant natural gas supply and british columbia s growing liquefied natural gas lng infrastructure to produce industry leading low carbon low cost canadian lng for overseas markets cedar lng will be the largest first nation owned infrastructure project in canada and will have one of the cleanest environmental profiles in the world cedar lng is expected have a liquefaction capacity of approximately three million tonnes per annum of lng and will source natural gas from the prolific montney resource play in northeast british columbia cedar lng will largely target the asia pacific market to maximize the project s geographic shipping advantage compared to u s gulf coast lng projects which are subject to the high costs and risks of transiting the panama canal cedar lng s low cost value chain combined with its low emissions intensity positions it favorably to deliver to asian countries with large energy needs and aggressive emissions reduction targets cedar lng provides a connection for western canadian sedimentary basin natural gas to international markets and will contribute to the displacement of coal as an energy source in asia chinook pathways pembina is proud to have been chosen by the western indigenous pipeline group wipg to be the industry partner in the formation of chinook pathways partnership chinook pathways chinook pathways is an indigenous led partnership working to organize a significant number of first nation communities to pursue ownership of the trans mountain pipeline following completion of the construction of the trans mountain expansion mick dilger pembina s president and chief executive officer commented the relationships between pembina and many of the first nations within wipg is a decade in the making this is how projects like this and our cedar lng partnership happen after years of relationship building with the communities that live and work in these areas we are proud to have been chosen by wipg and as the most impacted nations we believe they are amongst a larger group of rightful owners we are proud to support wipg in their goal of acquiring trans mountain for pembina the formation of chinook pathways is an important step in the process of evaluating an asset which we have previously and consistently indicated is a good strategic fit under the right circumstances as we continue to evaluate the merits of a potential investment the key parameters for pembina include among others the construction of the trans mountain expansion being fully de risked compliance with pembina s financial guardrails including a strong bbb credit rating and the investment creating significant value for investors pembina s ability to finance its share of this potential investment becomes even stronger following a combination with inter pipeline both through significant discretionary cash flow and additional opportunities for capital recycling and third party capital we will continue to build our partner consortium while the pipeline is being completed and take it from there added mr dilger about pembina pembina is a leading transportation and midstream service provider that has been serving north

prnewswire pembina pipeline corporation pembina or the company ppl pba today announced a mid year business update including delineation of its extensive runway of development opportunities which collectively highlight the company s strong momentum as it builds one of the largest and most integrated midstream energy companies in north america highlights volumes across the pipelines and facilities divisions have continued to grow steadily in 2021 exceeding pre covid levels over 400 million of assets placed into service so far in 2021 including prince rupert terminal prt a northeast british columbia nebc terminal and the expansion of the vancouver wharves terminal the vancouver wharves expansion with another approximately 1 billion currently under construction of assets placed into service so far in 2021 including prince rupert terminal prt a northeast nebc terminal and the expansion of the vancouver wharves terminal the vancouver wharves expansion with another approximately currently under construction reactivation of the phase ix peace pipeline expansion phase ix over 7 billion of accretive projects identified and in various stages of development to be pursued by pembina alone or upon combination with inter pipeline ltd inter pipeline of accretive projects identified and in various stages of development to be pursued by pembina alone or upon combination with inter pipeline ltd inter pipeline formation of chinook pathways partnership to support western indigenous pipeline group to pursue ownership of trans mountain pipeline partnership with the haisla nation in the development of cedar lng executive commentary mick dilger pembina s president and chief executive officer commented as a reflection of our confidence in improving market fundamentals and our strong competitive position as evidenced by volumes on most of our systems exceeding pre covid levels we are excited to delineate the extensive runway of development opportunities we see in front of us with the opportunities that lie ahead pembina remains confident in the work it is doing to create an integrated diversified and global energy platform and the combination with inter pipeline further advances this objective one that will serve as a strong foundation benefitting the entire canadian energy sector as the needs of our customers investors communities and employees as well as the global energy landscape change pembina is committed to helping all our stakeholders take advantage of opportunities for sustainable and long lasting growth mr dilger added throughout its history pembina has had an unwavering focus on developing meaningful relationships and creating value for all stakeholders we could not be prouder of our partnerships with both the haisla nation and the western indigenous pipeline group pembina believes that the future of canada s energy sector development is inextricably linked to meaningful partnerships and commercial relationships with indigenous communities we see an important role for our company to play in advancing indigenous economic reconciliation in canada business update activity in the western canadian sedimentary basin continues to benefit from strengthening commodity prices across all the products within pembina s integrated value chain crude oil condensate natural gas and natural gas liquids ngl notably there were 49 active rigs in alberta and british columbia for the month of may representing an approximately 155 percent increase from the same time last year as a result of significantly higher energy prices pembina has seen continued strength and recovery in its conventional pipelines business physical throughput for the second quarter of 2021 is expected to be approximately three percent higher than the first quarter of 2021 and in line with pre covid levels further pembina is forecasting continued growth in physical volumes on its conventional pipelines for the remainder of the year higher physical volumes are being driven primarily by increased capacity utilization on the peace and northern systems in addition to increased volumes on the drayton valley system pembina has also seen strong demand on cochin pipeline cochin physical throughput in april averaged over 100 000 barrels per day bpd which represents one of the highest average volume months in cochin s history the increased volume is a result of the recent debottleneck completed since pembina acquired cochin in late 2019 which proved up an incremental approximately 15 000 bpd of capacity with no associated capital cost pembina expects to see continued strong year over year demand and volumes in excess of assumptions made at the time of the acquiring cochin similarly in pembina s gas services business volumes are exceeding pre covid levels and pembina is expecting to finish the year with record average physical volumes year to date veresen midstream s physical throughput has exceeded the budget forecast at all of its facilities with strong commodity prices veresen midstream continues to expect robust activity in the montney for the remainder of the year higher inlet gas volumes have resulted in more processed liquids for pembina s value chain while lowering per unit operating costs for all customers pembina has observed that as a result of strong aeco and chicago natural gas pricing in addition to increases in liquids pricing producers have shifted to higher rate natural gas weighted liquids rich wells with higher pembina and third party gas processing volumes pembina is seeing increasing demand for its integrated ngl value chain with facilities at the redwater complex operating at record utilization and throughput as a result of high customer demand for fractionation and rail services pembina is accelerating its evaluation of a fourth propane plus fractionation facility as discussed further below in addition to continued volume growth pembina has placed over 400 million of new projects into service so far in 2021 pembina recently placed into service its first marine export facility prt on watson island british columbia the start up of prt is a major step in providing market diversity and helping add incremental value to western canadian hydrocarbons since being placed into service pembina has safely loaded seven vessels with exports of propane to international markets approaching one million barrels exceeding our commissioning volume expectations for our customers the start up of prt is a major step in providing market diversity and helping

which connects to pembina s nebc pipeline system was placed into service these assets are supported by long term cost of service arrangements with an investment grade counterparty in late may the company placed the vancouver wharves expansion into service the expansion added 200 000 barrels of additional refined product storage and enhancements to the railcar unloading capabilities volumes for vancouver wharves are loaded on railcars at pembina s redwater complex representing another example of pembina s strategy coming to fruition vancouver wharves expansion is supported by a 20 year take or pay off take agreement with an asian based investment grade counterparty pembina anticipates providing an update to its 2021 financial guidance upon completion of its six month actual plus six month forecast in the normal course secured and deferred projects phase ix peace pipeline expansion pembina is reactivating the previously deferred phase ix which will add capacity in the northwest alberta to gordondale alberta corridor to accommodate increased activity in the nebc montney play as was the case with the previously announced reactivation of the phase vii peace pipeline expansion phase vii pembina s decision to re commence construction of phase ix was based on extensive discussions with its producing customers validating long term development plans and leading to a clear understanding and consensus regarding their need for future intra basin transportation these discussions confirmed both the need for and the timing of phase ix phase ix will include new 6 inch and 16 inch pipelines debottlenecking the corridor north of gordondale alberta as well as upgrades at one pump station in addition this expansion will see existing pipelines which are currently batching converted to single product lines furthering pembina s goal of full product segregation across the peace pipeline system phase ix also now includes a pump station in the wapiti to kakwa corridor that is partially complete and was previously part of the phase vii project scope this pump station will help accommodate increased and sustained demand for ngl service also due to increased activity in the montney phase ix is supported by 10 year contracts with predominantly investment grade counterparties including significant take or pay provisions the project has a revised estimated cost of approximately 120 million which reflects the addition of the wapiti to kakwa corridor pump station offset by cost savings identified through value engineering phase ix is anticipated to be placed into service throughout the second half of 2022 subject to regulatory and environmental approvals the reactivation of phase ix and potentially the phase viii peace pipeline expansion phase viii will have a minimal impact on pembina s 2021 capital program phase viii expansion the previously announced phase viii although having received all regulatory approvals remains deferred initial contracts supporting the project remain intact and the customers continue to signal plans which will necessitate the incremental capacity value engineering work is ongoing and pembina continues to evaluate this project in discussions with its producing customers with a reactivation decision expected in the second half of 2021 in support of phase ix and the potential reactivation of phase viii pembina has entered into an exclusivity agreement with and concurrently provided an irrevocable offer for midstream services to a premiere nebc montney producer the exclusivity agreement provides a bridge to negotiation of definitive agreements for transportation and fractionation t f of a material volume of liquids and ngl mix from certain nebc montney lands pembina and the producer will work together over the next few months to develop and execute definitive agreements by the end of 2021 all new firm t f services provided under the proposed arrangement would be supported by long term take or pay agreements prior to deferral phase viii had an associated capital cost of approximately 500 million but pembina expects this level of investment to decrease given cost and scope improvements prince rupert terminal expansion pembina is continuing to evaluate expansion of prt up to approximately 45 000 bpd incremental propane supply available under the proposed combination with inter pipeline would further support this expansion given substantial incremental proprietary natural gas liquids supply project engineering is well advanced including an alternative for larger vessels and butane export and a final investment decision is expected in the second half of 2021 project backlog on a standalone basis pembina s backlog of new projects stood in excess of 4 billion across numerous value chains the industrial logic of the combination with inter pipeline enhances the probability as well as the profitability of a number of capital investment opportunities many of which each company was pursuing independently readily actionable upon closing of inter pipeline 450 million estimated adjusted ebitda multiple of 4 5x cochrane straddle plant connecting inter pipeline s cochrane straddle

saskatchewan long term supply risk for hpc would be eliminated while further improving the possibility of a second such facility globally petrochemical infrastructure tends to cluster with multiple facilities taking advantage of shared infrastructure and feedstock with this in mind pembina has undertaken a preliminary evaluation of the synergies that may be available to the combined entity through the development of a second facility and has identified approximately 200 million of capital cost savings and approximately 100 million of annual operating general and administrative expense savings compared to building a single stand alone facility in addition pembina and its partner safeguarded a 400 million investment in their previous project including finishing several long lead equipment orders that remain in storage pembina will continue to carefully consider possible next steps to progress further petrochemical infrastructure opportunities a second facility would be incremental to the 6 billion of combined development opportunities described above loading loading esg centric investments investments to reduce the emissions intensity of each business pembina operates pembina has committed to reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of each business it operates and by the end of 2021 will have taken concrete action in this area and published five year emissions reduction targets investments which could contribute to achieving these targets include in addition to cogeneration facilities at the empress and duvernay facilities the company continues to evaluate additional potential cogeneration projects at its other facilities including those of inter pipeline facilities the company continues to evaluate additional potential cogeneration projects at

in the latest bout of trouble for lordstown motors the electric car company that operates out of a former gm plant the company said monday that ceo steve burns and cfo julio rodriguez have stepped down from their posts lordstown is actively seeking permanent replacements the resignations arrive amid an ongoing internal investigation of the company s operations into claims by short seller hindenburg research that it deceived investors the securities and exchange commission has plans to examine hindenburg s claims as well as the company s merger with spac diamondpeak holdings hindenburg implicated lordstown in march of using fake orders to levy capital for its electric truck the short seller said the vehicle was nowhere near ready for production but lordstown has claimed it s on track to begin production this fall morgan stanley analyst adam jonas said the management change is an important first step for the company to move forward including securing necessary new capital we felt it was untenable for the company to secure necessary new capital with a management team widely seen as potentially not leading the company into the next era of its development he said monday in an investor note general motors operated a plant in lordstown ohio for over 50 years before stopping operations in 2019 but the plant was saved after gm opted to sell it to lordstown motors later that

america at our headquarters in lordstown ohio in addition to our experienced executive team made up of automotive leaders from tesla toyota gm vw hyundai and more we will also leverage a skilled local labor force at this legendary manufacturing plant to build our electric trucks the cyber truck revolution has been rough on lordstown whose stock was already down over 40 in 2021 prior to monday s

billion usd on electric cars more than double the previous year while governmental support measures continued to fall for the fifth year in a row this indicates a growing consumer demand for electric vehicles one that does not rely on government subsidies for growth while they can t do the job alone electric vehicles have an indispensable role to play in reaching net zero emissions worldwide said fatih birol executive director of the iea in a press release he went on to say that current sales trends are very encouraging but our shared climate and energy goals call for even faster market uptake

whenever we enter a raise cycle or bonus season we get at least one concerned reader bemoaning that above the law s core editorial staff takes a partial hiatus from unraveling law school gossip and clowning on lawyer meltdowns to report on the furious stream of associate compensation news a stream that got so hot this year that the new payscale didn t even last 24 hours before getting topped then compensation bonus season arrives i suddenly remember why most people fucking hate lawyers i ll see you guys again sometime in late august when your site isn t a gross celebration of greed thankfully this reader is coming at it recognizing that it s not a news development we can just ignore since the majority of the audience very much relies on these stories but it s a valid concern and one that hits a lot of our readers in particular the counsel and staff that rarely get corresponding raises harder than others sponsored legal ai 3 steps law firms should take now if 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative ai then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it things are moving fast so however emptying the stock image library of money pictures aside are we contributing to a culture of greed when we celebrate salary hikes i don t think so and in fact i think it s the opposite obviously a 205k starting salary is nothing to take for granted it s a big haul and immediately places an associate in the upper classes of american society that said what are firms really paying first years when all is said and done attending law school puts students back upwards of 350k depending on the financial package and that s before considering the costs of just not working for three years then they begin jobs working 2200 hours year and that s working not billing because even lower end billing probably lands a lawyer in the office for 2200 or so taking home something like 80 90 hour that s not unheard of for a trained professional electricians or plumbers often bill out at more which of course brings us to the fact that associates are billing out higher the wall street journal reports large law firms charge clients between 371 and 665 an hour for lawyers straight out of law school according to bodhala a market intelligence firm that generally tracks what my in house sources tell me too we re not so deliberately obtuse to think law firms can t charge more than cost for legal services but there s a hefty delta when it comes to first year work and that holds even after all the discounts and write downs that everyone expects out of biglaw because even though we re talking about decent sized numbers the alternative is for partners to just pocket somewhere between 300 and 500 per hour in profit and we re not begrudging partners for leading the teams that get the job done but if there s an argument that biglaw business models run on greed it feels as though letting partner profits grow ad infinitum on the back of increased leverage would be a better fit so congratulations associates you have earned what you re about to make so don t feel bad about it joe patrice is a senior editor at above the law and co host of thinking like a lawyer feel free to email any tips questions or comments follow him on twitter if you re interested in law politics and a healthy dose of college sports news joe also serves as a managing director at rpn executive search
teco 2030 asa ose teco has signed a memorandum of understanding with chart industries inc chart nyse gtls to jointly develop technological solutions that will capture carbon dioxide co₂ emitted by ships and subsequently store it in liquid form when the new co2 capture integration that we are collaborating with chart industries inc and sustainable energy solutions ses on is ready it will enable ships to capture and store the co2 that they would otherwise have emitted into the air and which would thereby have contributed to climate change says stian aakre ceo of teco 2030 as the agreement between the norwegian company teco 2030 and the american manufacturer chart industries inc involves the joint development of onboard carbon capture solutions for ships using the cryogenic carbon capturetm ccc technology developed by ses which was acquired by chart industries inc in december 2020 this innovative technology which utilizes chart industries inc s expertise in cryogenic equipment and systems along with ses s patented and proven technology will separate the co2 from the ships exhaust gases resulting in a high purity liquid co2 product the liquid co2 is then stored onboard in cryogenic storage tanks until the ship reaches port when it has been offloaded from the ship the co2 can then either be permanently stored in geological formations underground or be put to beneficial use in co2 consuming industries such as the agricultural industrial energy or food and beverage sectors will help ships comply with environmental legislation when fully developed the carbon capture solution will become available as a key element in the teco 2030 future funnel an exhaust gas cleaning system for ships developed by teco 2030 at teco 2030 our ambition is to help ships become more environmentally friendly as well as enable them to comply with emerging climate legislation says aakre we believe carbon capture for ships will become one of several measures needed for the shipping industry to reach global decarbonisation goals carbon capture and storage ccs is the process of capturing emitted co2 and transporting it to a storage site to prevent it from entering the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas one of the challenges with carbon capture onboard ships is that the storing of co2 is space consuming and that space onboard ships is rather limited each tonne of fossil fuel consumed by ships leads to approximately three tonnes of co2 emissions we are excited to bring our carbon capture process expertise to the maritime industry with a partner like teco 2030 that is dedicated to solving the emissions challenges facing ship owners today says jill evanko ceo and president of chart industries inc the solutions that are developed will help enable the shipping industry to reach the greenhouse gas emissions goals for 2030 and 2050 set forth by the international maritime organization green transition within the shipping industry the international maritime organization imo aims to reduce carbon intensity in international shipping by 40 by 2030 and to cut the total annual greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by at least 50 by 2050 compared to 2008 ship owners across the world will therefore have to do something to make their vessels more climate friendly and teco 2030 will help them with that in addition to exhaust gas cleaning systems for ships teco 2030 is also developing hydrogen fuel cells for the maritime industry these will enable ships to switch from fossil fuels to green hydrogen which is hydrogen produced by renewable energy and thereby become completely emissions free source teco 2030 asa

with the haisla nation in the development of cedar lng executive commentary mick dilger pembina s president and chief executive officer commented as a reflection of our confidence in improving market fundamentals and our strong competitive position as evidenced by volumes on most of our systems exceeding pre covid levels we are excited to delineate the extensive runway of development opportunities we see in front of us with the opportunities that lie ahead pembina remains confident in the work it is doing to create an integrated diversified and global energy platform and the combination with inter pipeline further advances this objective one that will serve as a strong foundation benefitting the entire canadian energy sector as the needs of our customers investors communities and employees as well as the global energy landscape change pembina is committed to helping all our stakeholders take advantage of opportunities for sustainable and long lasting growth mr dilger added throughout its history pembina has had an unwavering focus on developing meaningful relationships and creating value for all stakeholders we could not be prouder of our partnerships with both the haisla nation and the western indigenous pipeline group pembina believes that the future of canada s energy sector development is inextricably linked to meaningful partnerships and commercial relationships with indigenous communities we see an important role for our company to play in advancing indigenous economic reconciliation in canada business update activity in the western canadian sedimentary basin continues to benefit from strengthening commodity prices across all the products within pembina s integrated value chain crude oil condensate natural gas and natural gas liquids ngl notably there were 49 active rigs in alberta and british columbia for the month of may representing an approximately 155 percent increase from the same time last year as a result of significantly higher energy prices pembina has seen continued strength and recovery in its conventional pipelines business physical throughput for the second quarter of 2021 is expected to be approximately three percent higher than the first quarter of 2021 and in line with pre covid levels further pembina is forecasting continued growth in physical volumes on its conventional pipelines for the remainder of the year higher physical volumes are being driven primarily by increased capacity utilization on the peace and northern systems in addition to increased volumes on the drayton valley system pembina has also seen strong demand on cochin pipeline cochin physical throughput in april averaged over 100 000 barrels per day bpd which represents one of the highest average volume months in cochin s history the increased volume is a result of the recent debottleneck completed since pembina acquired cochin in late 2019 which proved up an incremental approximately 15 000 bpd of capacity with no associated capital cost pembina expects to see continued strong year over year demand and volumes in excess of assumptions made at the time of the acquiring cochin similarly in pembina s gas services business volumes are exceeding pre covid levels and pembina is expecting to finish the year with record average physical volumes year to date veresen midstream s physical throughput has exceeded the budget forecast at all of its facilities with strong commodity prices veresen midstream continues to expect robust activity in the montney for the remainder of the year higher inlet gas volumes have resulted in more processed liquids for pembina s value chain while lowering per unit operating costs for all customers pembina has observed that as a result of strong aeco and chicago natural gas pricing in addition to increases in liquids pricing producers have shifted to higher rate natural gas weighted liquids rich wells with higher pembina and third party gas processing volumes pembina is seeing increasing demand for its integrated ngl value chain with facilities at the redwater complex operating at record utilization and throughput as a result of high customer demand for fractionation and rail services pembina is accelerating its evaluation of a fourth propane plus fractionation facility as discussed further below in addition to continued volume growth pembina has placed over 400 million of new projects into service so far in 2021 pembina recently placed into service its first marine export facility prt on watson island british columbia the start up of prt is a major step in providing market diversity and helping add incremental value to western canadian hydrocarbons since being placed into service pembina has safely loaded seven vessels with exports of propane to international markets approaching one million barrels exceeding our commissioning volume expectations for our customers the start up of prt is a major step in providing market diversity and helping

which connects to pembina s nebc pipeline system was placed into service these assets are supported by long term cost of service arrangements with an investment grade counterparty in late may the company placed the vancouver wharves expansion into service the expansion added 200 000 barrels of additional refined product storage and enhancements to the railcar unloading capabilities volumes for vancouver wharves are loaded on railcars at pembina s redwater complex representing another example of pembina s strategy coming to fruition vancouver wharves expansion is supported by a 20 year take or pay off take agreement with an asian based investment grade counterparty pembina anticipates providing an update to its 2021 financial guidance upon completion of its six month actual plus six month forecast in the normal course secured and deferred projects phase ix peace pipeline expansion pembina is reactivating the previously deferred phase ix which will add capacity in the northwest alberta to gordondale alberta corridor to accommodate increased activity in the nebc montney play as was the case with the previously announced reactivation of the phase vii peace pipeline expansion phase vii pembina s decision to re commence construction of phase ix was based on extensive discussions with its producing customers validating long term development plans and leading to a clear understanding and consensus regarding their need for future intra basin transportation these discussions confirmed both the need for and the timing of phase ix phase ix will include new 6 inch and 16 inch pipelines debottlenecking the corridor north of gordondale alberta as well as upgrades at one pump station in addition this expansion will see existing pipelines which are currently batching converted to single product lines furthering pembina s goal of full product segregation across the peace pipeline system phase ix also now includes a pump station in the wapiti to kakwa corridor that is partially complete and was previously part of the phase vii project scope this pump station will help accommodate increased and sustained demand for ngl service also due to increased activity in the montney phase ix is supported by 10 year contracts with predominantly investment grade counterparties including significant take or pay provisions the project has a revised estimated cost of approximately 120 million which reflects the addition of the wapiti to kakwa corridor pump station offset by cost savings identified through value engineering phase ix is anticipated to be placed into service throughout the second half of 2022 subject to regulatory and environmental approvals the reactivation of phase ix and potentially the phase viii peace pipeline expansion phase viii will have a minimal impact on pembina s 2021 capital program phase viii expansion the previously announced phase viii although having received all regulatory approvals remains deferred initial contracts supporting the project remain intact and the customers continue to signal plans which will necessitate the incremental capacity value engineering work is ongoing and pembina continues to evaluate this project in discussions with its producing customers with a reactivation decision expected in the second half of 2021 in support of phase ix and the potential reactivation of phase viii pembina has entered into an exclusivity agreement with and concurrently provided an irrevocable offer for midstream services to a premiere nebc montney producer the exclusivity agreement provides a bridge to negotiation of definitive agreements for transportation and fractionation t f of a material volume of liquids and ngl mix from certain nebc montney lands pembina and the producer will work together over the next few months to develop and execute definitive agreements by the end of 2021 all new firm t f services provided under the proposed arrangement would be supported by long term take or pay agreements prior to deferral phase viii had an associated capital cost of approximately 500 million but pembina expects this level of investment to decrease given cost and scope improvements prince rupert terminal expansion pembina is continuing to evaluate expansion of prt up to approximately 45 000 bpd incremental propane supply available under the proposed combination with inter pipeline would further support this expansion given substantial incremental proprietary natural gas liquids supply project engineering is well advanced including an alternative for larger vessels and butane export and a final investment decision is expected in the second half of 2021 project backlog on a standalone basis pembina s backlog of new projects stood in excess of 4 billion across numerous value chains the industrial logic of the combination with inter pipeline enhances the probability as well as the profitability of a number of capital investment opportunities many of which each company was pursuing independently readily actionable upon closing of inter pipeline 450 million estimated adjusted ebitda multiple of 4 5x cochrane straddle plant connecting inter pipeline s cochrane straddle

cedar lng an approximately 1 5 billion net to pembina floating lng facility in partnership with the haisla first nation as discussed further below pdh pp petrochemical complex as highlighted in the recent announcement of pembina s proposed combination with inter pipeline by combining inter pipeline s hpc with pembina s industry leading 60 000 bpd of propane supply infrastructure in fort saskatchewan long term supply risk for hpc would be eliminated while further improving the possibility of a second such facility globally petrochemical infrastructure tends to cluster with multiple facilities taking advantage of shared infrastructure and feedstock with this in mind pembina has undertaken a preliminary evaluation of the synergies that may be available to the combined entity through the development of a second facility and has identified approximately 200 million of capital cost savings and approximately 100 million of annual operating general and administrative expense savings compared to building a single stand alone facility in addition pembina and its partner safeguarded a 400 million investment in their previous project including finishing several long lead equipment orders that remain in storage pembina will continue to carefully consider possible next steps to progress further petrochemical infrastructure opportunities a second facility would be incremental to the 6 billion of combined development opportunities described above esg centric investments investments to reduce the emissions intensity of each business pembina operates pembina has committed to reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of each business it operates and by the end of 2021 will have taken concrete action in this area and published five year emissions reduction targets investments which could contribute to achieving these targets include in addition to cogeneration facilities at the empress and duvernay facilities the company continues to evaluate additional potential cogeneration projects at its other facilities including those of inter pipeline facilities the company continues to evaluate additional potential cogeneration projects at its other

carbon capture and sequestration at pembina s redwater kakwa river and hythe facilities are under evaluation indigenous partnerships cedar lng the haisla nation and pembina recently announced a partnership agreement whereby pembina will become the haisla nation s partner in the development of the proposed cedar lng project cedar lng is strategically positioned to leverage canada s abundant natural gas supply and british columbia s growing liquefied natural gas lng infrastructure to produce industry leading low carbon low cost canadian lng for overseas markets cedar lng will be the largest first nation owned infrastructure project in canada and will have one of the cleanest environmental profiles in the world cedar lng is expected have a liquefaction capacity of approximately three million tonnes per annum of lng and will source natural gas from the prolific montney resource play in northeast british columbia cedar lng will largely target the asia pacific market to maximize the project s geographic shipping advantage compared to u s gulf coast lng projects which are subject to the high costs and risks of transiting the panama canal cedar lng s low cost value chain combined with its low emissions intensity positions it favorably to deliver to asian countries with large energy needs and aggressive emissions reduction targets cedar lng provides a connection for western canadian sedimentary basin natural gas to international markets and will contribute to the displacement of coal as an energy source in asia chinook pathways pembina is proud to have been

it s déjà vu all over again and i ve observed a lot by watching yes ladies and gentlemen present company included i hope it s time once again when we ve come to that diverging approach on the railroad regulatory right of way called revenue adequacy as defined by the surface transportation board let s take that turnout even though no one except perhaps railroad and shipper attorneys goes there anymore because it s too crowded so wye does it matter on june 11 my inbox lit up with this subject line rail customers call on stb to reject absurd proposal to prop up monopolies gee willikers i better look at this it might be something important or not good morning the email which came from the american chemistry council acc started rather politely that s refreshing with a lot of attention being paid to the ongoing rail merger proposals and the billions of dollars on the table it might be easy to overlook something as arcane as the revenue adequacy proposal from the rail industry that the stb is currently considering however the proposal and the mergers are actually quite interrelated and more than a little bit ironic as the following blog post from the rail customer coalition points out the railroads are crying poor to shore up their financial regulatory protections at the stb during a period of strong health and unprecedented merger offers please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss the stb proposal or any other freight rail issues further thanks and have a great weekend well i did have a great weekend thanks very much actually i didn t think very much about the purported absurd proposal until i read the blog this morning and then asked the association of american railroads for a response i first thought of writing a straight news story nah that s too easy so i thought i d do my own blog on the blog would that be a double blog or a blog squared first here are a few choice morsels from the rail customer coalition blog if you want to read the whole thing be my guest but chances are you ve heard all this railroads rattling their tin cups on the steps of the u s capitol stuff before ailroads are trying to convince the stb their balance sheets are too fragile and the board should change how the financial health of the rail industry is measured in reality they re seeking to lock in profits while continuing to lock out competition the stb has found a majority of class i railroads to be revenue adequate while this is undoubtedly good news some railroads fear that it may threaten the protective regulatory policies the board adopted decades ago when the industry was financially struggling and so three major railroads union pacific norfolk southern and cn are now calling for the stb to redefine revenue adequacy in a way that practically ensures no railroad can meet the threshold the railroads propose an absurdly high bar for revenue adequacy a railroad meeting the board s current revenue adequacy standard is able to cover all its costs attract capital maintain current assets invest in new infrastructure and generate competitive returns for investors the railroads have proposed a radical departure claiming that no railroad should be considered revenue adequate unless it is more profitable than the median of the s p 500 ying revenue determinations to the s p 500 would transform revenue adequacy into a standard of superstar financial health by definition half of the nation s most successful firms would fail to clear this bar that is like telling a high school student that she is not in adequate physical health unless that student can outrun half the varsity cross country team the stb should adopt pro competitive reforms not further protect monopoly profits stb s mission is to promote a safe and efficient rail transportation system not to favor railroad profitability over all other considerations the board s rate review guidelines state captive shippers should not continue to be charged differentially higher rates beyond what is needed for a financially sound railroad however many rail shippers have no competitive transportation options and no meaningful process to challenge unreasonable rates he stb should prioritize reforms to address these growing challenges first the board should adopt final offer rate review a streamlined process to challenge unreasonable rates second the board should finalize new rules for reciprocal switching which would promote competition by allowing a shipper served by a single railroad to switch its traffic to a second railroad at a nearby interchange the board should focus on completing these long overdue reforms instead of raising the revenue adequacy bar to absurd levels and protecting railroads ability to charge monopoly rates like i said it s déjà vu all over again so good people here is the 127 page stb filing from the rail customer coalition download and read it at your own risk of falling asleep the aar had a nice compact we re kinda busy response to my request for comment the acc is merely using as a fresh hook for the same old arguments at the end of the day aar s response is laid out clearly in the attached comments regarding the same matter acc uses as the basis for that blog post alrighty then so i downloaded the document an stb filing it s only 24 pages a relatively quick read i suppose i could at least try to stay awake i appreciate the brevity though it s still a bit stultifying now do you folks want the real deal sure ya do well it ain t gonna come from me sorry to disappoint you i hope capitol hill contributing editor and fellow new york yankees fan yogi berra aficionado frank n wilner whose new book railroads economic regulation is to be published this summer by simmons boardman books lays it all out in correct english as only someone who has been intimately involved for eons with the workings of washington d c can revenue adequacy means earning enough to cover total operating costs including depreciation and obsolescence plus a competitive return on invested capital sufficient over the long term to attract capital to maintain a railroad s large and costly infrastructure including locomotives and rolling stock to determine revenue adequacy the stb compares a railroad s return on investment roi with the rail industry s after tax cost of capital if roi at least equals the industry s cost of capital the railroad is deemed revenue adequate for that year economist alfred e kahn the architect of commercial airline economic deregulation termed this revenue adequacy determination totally discredited nonsensical results alfred e kahn is the guy behind him trying not to nod off shippers cite acquisition premiums prices substantially above stock market value paid by one railroad to acquire another as evidence of a flawed regulatory process by increasing the investment base they lower roi and make it less likely a railroad will be found revenue adequate increasing the investment base also causes costs as estimated by the stb s costing system to rise resulting in some freight rates becoming immune from regulatory challenge additionally a 2015 congressionally funded report by the transportation research board an arm of the national academy of sciences said the stb s annual revenue adequacy determination serves no constructive purpose and its persistence prolongs the misguided view that a single yes no indicator of railroad profitability should be used to regulate rates the trb suggested a periodic assessment of industry wide economic and competitive conditions another alternative is to adopt as the cost of equity capital an average of wall street analyst estimates an acknowledgment that wall street firms are staffed with the best and brightest of equity analysts are in stiff competition with each other for investor confidence and are more removed from political influence than are stb members a side note to this controversy is that former sen jay rockefeller d w va a perennial shipper standard bearer while chairing the senate commerce committee compared railroad profits to those of his great grandfather oil baron john d rockefeller frequently sitting behind him at commerce committee hearings was his senior adviser on rail shipper issues ian jefferies now aar president and ceo a not atypical situation if one observes the revolving door between industry congress and regulatory agencies in fact two of jefferies counterparts from the republican aide side of the senate commerce committee themselves hardened veterans of rail shipper legislative combat are current stb members ann d begeman and patrick j fuchs so there you have it it doesn t get much better than wilner buy the book when it comes out i fondly recall how jefferies aar predecessor ed hamberger once referred to the same old arguments a solution in search of a problem it reminded me of a great latin jazz original written and arranged for the woody herman thundering herd theme in search of a movie i m a little tired i think i ll go take a nap watch the grass grow or start reading the reader s digest condensed version of war and peace by leo i told you so

attention to spacs is increasing in japan well known japanese investment companies have listed spacs in the us and some of the us listed spacs are targeting japanese companies the japanese government has begun to discuss the introduction of a japanese version of spacs j spacs in japan on june 2 2021 the growth strategy conference an advisory board to the japanese government published a draft of the growth strategy implementation plan which indicates that in light of the experiences of the us and other foreign regulators general trends of the spac market and the perspective of enhancing japan s international competitiveness the japanese government will consider introducing j spacs while taking adequate measures required from an investor protection perspective while the us sec is strengthening its monitoring as the spac boom heats up in the us japan is still on the other end of the spectrum it would be worthwhile for japan to consider the pros and cons of introducing j spacs by looking at experiences in the us market in addition as a more impending issue japan would see situations where japanese companies will consider listing in the us market through business combinations with us spacs lawyers investment banks venture capitalists and private equity pe funds as well as the relevant japanese regulators have led the discussion relating to spac by publishing thought leadership articles in this article major legal issues are summarised on i the business combination of japanese companies with us spacs and ii the introduction of j spacs the business combination of japanese companies with us spacs transaction structure in the us de spacs are typically carried out by way of a reverse triangular merger using spac shares as merger consideration although a reverse triangular merger is not available under japanese corporate law it would be possible purely from a japanese corporate law perspective to create substantially the same capital relationship by way of a triangular share exchange followed by the merger of the merger subsidiary into the target company with the target company being the surviving company or a forward triangular merger with the target company being the dissolving company if any of the spac managers intend to join in the management of the target company the spac would not qualify for the exemptions while the forward triangular merger structure under japanese corporate law is similar to that used in the us the triangular share exchange structure is illustrated in the chart on the following page however the feasibility of these transaction structures should also take into account the specific facts and circumstances of the entities involved particularly from the taxation and regulatory perspective set out below is a summary of applicable tax treatment to the target and its shareholders in each scenario restrictions under foreign investment control regulations under the foreign exchange and foreign trade act of japan generally a foreign investor intending to acquire shares of an unlisted japanese company engaging in certain designated businesses must file a prior notification with the minister of finance and other competent ministers including the minister of economy trade and industry irrespective of the number of shares to be acquired while there are certain exemptions if any of the spac managers intend to join in the management of the target company the spac would not qualify for the exemptions and therefore a prior notification must be filed in addition no exemption is available if the target company engages in certain highly sensitive businesses in the so called core business sectors including the manufacture of semi conductors and software if a prior notification is filed the proposed acquisition cannot be consummated until a 30 day waiting period has lapsed from the date of filing although this period may be shortened or extended up to five months the ministers may ultimately order the acquisition to be modified or stopped after considering various factors including the management and investment policy of the foreign purchaser and the relationship of japan with the government of the place of organisation of the foreign purchaser as well as any person effectively managing it disclosure in the proxy statement to be issued in connection with a de spac the us sec rules require the spac to include two to three years of audited financial statements of the target which must comply with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap or the international financial reporting standards ifrs in certain cases as well as the pro forma financial statements of the combined company for targets that have not had a public company audit the preparation of financial statements could impose a significant burden and delay the timing of the completion of the de spac the target business disclosure in the proxy statement is similar to what would be required in a form s 1 ipo prospectus of the target s business including a detailed description of the business management discussion and analysis md a and background of the de spac and projections of the target company furthermore after the de spac the combined company will need to comply with the continuous disclosure obligations and the internal control requirements under the us sarbanes oxley act of 2002 sox act in reality generally japanese private companies do not prepare ifrs compliant financial statements or disclosure documents in english nor do they establish effective internal controls compliant with the us sox act therefore it is important for the spac to analyse the target s capabilities relating to disclosure and internal control during the due diligence process and to procure the management s commitment regarding these matters in the de spac definitive agreement triangular share exchange forward triangular merger tax qualified share exchange non tax qualified share exchange tax qualified merger non tax qualified merger target non taxable mark to market tax while the scope of the subject assets are limited non taxable capital gains tax target shareholders if cash consideration is included capital gains tax if the consideration consists only of spac shares no capital gains tax non taxable if cash consideration is included capital gains tax if the consideration consists only of spac shares no capital gains tax deemed dividend tax in addition to capital gains tax legal issues in introducing j spacs listing criteria and requirements as the current listing criteria of japanese stock exchanges does not jibe with the nature of spacs it would be necessary for the stock exchanges to design listing criteria and requirements that are applicable to spacs in addition japanese stock exchanges need to modify their listing examination practices for spacs unlike the us where issuers and underwriters retain their respective lawyers to conduct due diligence and prepare disclosure documents and the stock exchanges and sec do not conduct substantive examination a japanese stock exchange traditionally undertakes a comprehensive and substantive examination of the listing applicant for over a year or more partly because issuers and underwriters generally do not retain lawyers in japanese domestic ipo deals due to the low litigation risk in other words in the us investor protection focuses on fair disclosure supported by a severe litigation risk while in japan the stock exchange is expected to conduct and has in fact conducted paternalistic investigations on behalf of investors the introduction of j spacs would be an important challenge for the japanese capital markets substantive investigations by stock exchanges in japan are not practicable during the life span of the ipos of spacs and de spacs considering that these processes may be completed within a short period a theoretically possible approach under the existing listing rules would be to apply the rules relating to back door listing to the spacs under these rules if it is discovered that a listed company is not a substantive surviving company after a merger or otherwise with an unlisted company the listed shares will be designated as securities under supervision and the listed company will go through an examination that is equivalent to a listing examination the listed company will be delisted if it is found that it does not meet the listing criteria within a certain period of time if j spacs are to be introduced in the future it would be necessary for the japanese stock exchanges to revisit the manner of investor protection that should be pursued for spac investors this includes whether and how much the stock exchanges will rely on the substantive examination and to design if necessary the workflow of the substantive examination so as to be practically consistent with the timeline of spacs and de spacs spac schemes units at the time of the ipos of us spacs units are typically issued to investors each of which consists of a share of spac common stock and fraction of a warrant exercisable for spac shares which will be separated after a certain period of time apparently this unit structure is adopted for ease of market stabilisation if a similar unit structure is necessary for the ipos of j spacs it should be noted that there is currently no settlement system or mechanism on which shares and stock acquisition rights can be traded as one unit however a similar effect may be achieved under the current japanese corporate law and settlement system assume that at the time of the ipo only shares will be issued but the board of directors of the j spac will approve a resolution on a gratuitous allotment of stock acquisition rights i e pro rata allotment to spac shareholders of stock acquisition rights without contribution immediately upon the ipo which will take effect on a specific date after a certain period of time through this mechanism the spac shares will be tradable with a right to receive a pro rata allotment of the warrants until the ex rights date redemption for us spacs general spac shareholders have the right to have their spac shares redeemed upon their request at the time of the de spac or if the de spac transaction is not completed within the prescribed timeframe under japanese law there are no material issues if such a redemption feature is included in the terms and conditions of the class of spac shares held by such shareholders the class of shares issued to general spac shareholders would be different from those issued to spac sponsors as the sponsors are not given the right to have their spac shares redeemed disclosure for spac ipo and de spac it would be necessary for the regulator to consider designing a new spac compliant disclosure regime more specifically under japanese securities regulations ipo disclosures would be made by the spac by filing a securities registration statement just like a traditional ipo however as the spac will not be conducting any business at the time of the ipo its disclosures would be significantly different from ordinary companies and the existing disclosure form would not be appropriate in that it includes many items that are not relevant for spacs in addition under the existing japanese securities regulation framework even if the consideration for the de spac includes spac shares material information on the target company such as the nature of its business and risk factors would not be required to be disclosed at the time of the de spac this is because the registration requirement is not applicable to a reorganisation that involves the distribution of shares as consideration if the shares to be distributed are already listed it is true that a convocation notice including agenda items relating to the proposed de spac will be circulated by the spac for the shareholders meeting but under the japanese regulatory regime such convocation notice is governed by corporate law and not by securities regulations conclusion as investors flock to spacs in the us the world s largest capital market the impact on the japanese capital market and m a market would be inevitable spac schemes have some issues that may not be easy to harmonise with traditional ipo practices in japan however the us spac boom seems to imply that traditional ipos alone cannot meet the evolving needs of the capital markets and the same can be said for japan when strong demand for j spacs from unicorns venture capitalists pe funds and investors are seen the introduction of j spacs would be an important challenge for the japanese capital market to fulfil its function to properly supply risk money as said lawyers have led the discussion among market participants including the regulators on concepts relating to spacs in japan and will continue to contribute for the development of capital markets in japan by introducing spacs to japan with cooperation with players outside japan as well katsumasa suzuki partner mori hamada matsumoto t 81 3 6212 8327 e katsumasa suzuki mhm global com katsumasa

thanks in part to subsidized government loans the eu counter sued over what it termed unfair r d support and subsidized tax incentives for boeing in recent months top european british and u s officials have engaged in intense discussions to settle the dispute and focus on other challenges including china china on radar tai told reuters in may she was optimistic about reaching a deal with brussels adding that the two sides needed to look at the bigger question of china s ambitions to become a global player in the commercial aircraft industry the u s has floated a joint review of aerospace funding in non market economies like china two of the people said one of the sources said the two sides had agreed to increase information sharing but gave no further details there s no question that the rise of china s aircraft industry is on everybody s proverbial radar u s chamber of commerce senior vice president marjorie chorlins told reporters on monday noting what she described as china s heavy subsidization of its industries she said settling the dispute would provide a tremendous boost of goodwill for broader u s european ties brussels and washington remain at odds over steel and aluminum tariffs but are expected at tuesday s summit to set a dec 1 deadline to end punitive tariffs related to the dispute according to a draft communique seen by reuters like the united states the eu has sparred with beijing on trade and security this year but its 27 nations could struggle to agree a common front on topics like aerospace in april for example hungary blocked an eu statement criticizing china s new hong kong security law sparking a row over the right of member states to veto eu foreign policy the chinese embassy in washington had no immediate comment none of the parties agreed to comment on the talks hurdles to permanent agreement in a potentially key breakthrough the united states had watered down opposition to the principle of future public loans for airbus and removed its demand for compensation but its insistence on advance notice of any future public loans had triggered concerns among eu officials who rejected giving washington any veto power people familiar with the talks said even more critical is the benchmark to be used when deciding whether the interest on any future loans is market compatible under the 1992 subsidy pact one third of a project could be financed by direct government support such as loans and cleared indirect r d support up to 4 of a company s revenue one option is to revisit that framework with market rules replacing subsidy quotas and a new cap on indirect r d support brexit has also complicated negotiations britain and the united states came close to striking an aerospace agreement in december that could have forced the hand of brussels in its own talks with washington britain s ability to negotiate trade deals independently of the eu is central to its new global britain stance but its flexibility on airbus is cramped by its role as one of four core nations involved in the planemaker pre dating its eu accession airbus which has 14 000 staff in britain has made plain work could shift abroad if the uk turns its back on aerospace

sign of sound economy fickle friends idle money rocks the rupee free money addiction look beyond us dollar new delhi india s foreign exchange stock has touched 600 billion fourth highest in the world ahead of russia that heap of dollars gives us macroeconomic stability we now have enough to pay for 18 months of imports whereas back in the crisis year of 1991 we didn t have enough forex for two weeks at the very least we need foreign exchange to pay for importing crude oil the lifeline of transport and logistics we are also import dependent for a variety of items including vaccine supplies steel and auto components is there a downside to having a large war chest of dollars it s complicated but yes there are downsides first some good news though unlike all the major dollar hoarding central banks china russia saudi arabia and japan we are not an export surplus country much of their pile is the accumulation from years of earning more dollars than they spend for us it is the opposite we may be the only large asian country with a current account deficit i e we import much more than we export and still have large foreign exchange reserves that is creditable if every year we fall short of dollars how come our forex stock keeps rising the reason is the current account deficit is offset by a large influx of capital flows dollars flow into india through foreign portfolio investors fpi or as foreign direct investment fdi this inflow from the purchase of assets like shares shows the confidence of foreign investors in india s growth prospects in the past three decades india has attracted nearly 500 billion as fdi beyond fpi and fdi inflows into the stock market are loans these are called external commercial borrowings the total outstanding foreign loans are 560 billion or about 93 of our foreign exchange reserves that s a downside the stock market inflows especially fpi can easily and abruptly make an about turn such investors can be fickle or nervous or simply riskaverse and will pull out funds at the drop of a hat although pulling out fdi is not that easy similarly indian companies having large dollar obligations of short and long term loans are also a warning sign we need enough dollars to at least pay off the short term debts even nris can withdraw large dollar deposits suddenly that s what they did in 1990 when there was panic before the first iraq war also if india s rating drops below investment grade no foreign lender would be willing to refinance our old loans our coffers will become empty repaying loans that s why india s large forex stock to the extent it has fickle flows should not make us complacent unless our exports exceed imports we will remain vulnerable the second downside to a large dollar pile is that it earns very little interest if it represents a national asset is there a better use for it third large foreign holdings in india s stock market make its value vulnerable to ebbs and flows of forex indeed the rupee usually gets stronger on days when the stock market rises and vice versa is it healthy that the purchasing power of our importers is dependent on fickle foreign investors the fourth downside is that a large forex pile means rbi s balance sheet gets bloated since the balance sheet is measured in rupees it expands whenever the rupee weakens this is free gain to rbi which it can then pass on as dividends to the centre a very large balance sheet size means even a slight weakening translates into notional gains of thousands of crores or profit for rbi when currency fluctuates the gains and losses should normally not be encashed but large revaluation gains on rupee weakening could become a continuing source of fiscal financing for a central government in desperate need this can lead to fiscal addiction or even dilution of rbi s independence the dollar is not our currency too much of it can become a headache unlike rupee debt we cannot forgive our dollar debt countries like russia despite having large foreign reserves are moving away from the dollar there are geopolitical tensions with the us and russia doesn t want to depend on new york clearing banks dollar transactions can only be cleared by us banks india should also look to diversify its forex holding away from the dollar and examine the optimal size of foreign reserves for our needs
global share markets mostly rallied over the last week the big surprise perhaps was the us where shares rallied to a new record high and bond yields fell despite another surge in inflation because investors rightly in my view interpreted the make up of higher than expected inflation for may as consistent with the fed s assessment that the spike in inflation would be transitory australian shares also rose to a new record high led by bond sensitive it utility property and health stocks global inflation readings continued to rise over the last week with producer price inflation accelerating in china and japan and us inflation surging again in may to 5 year on year with core inflation rising to 3 8 yoy its highest since 1992 however our assessment remains that the current spike is likely to be transitory the key drivers remain base effects as last year s deflation drops out of annual calculations higher commodity prices goods supply bottlenecks as a result of cuts to production in the pandemic and then consumers switching spending to goods from services and reopening leading to a rebound in some prices source bloomberg amp capital we remain of the view that the inflation spike will prove temporary as high inflation numbers a year ago will drop out of annual calculations industrial production will pick up in response to the surge in prices thereby boosting supply and depressing prices consumer spending will gradually rotate back to services and away from goods some sectors like traditional retailing corporate travel and cbd services will see a longer lasting hit to jobs from the pandemic and in the us the ending of enhanced unemployment benefits in september will push more workers back into the workforce in fact half of us states are already ending enhanced unemployment benefits so inflation is likely to fall back again as bottlenecks and the reopening boost fade in fact us core inflation may be close to peaking in year on year terms as high monthly numbers a year ago will start to drop out the continuing us economic recovery and a desire to keep inflation expectations under control will keep the fed on track to start tapering its bond buying from later this year with the taper talk commencing either in the week ahead or at its july meeting the likely fall back in inflation into later this year and early next year combined with central banks remaining dovish will mean that any near term inflation driven bond market panic and hit to share markets will likely be short lived key to watch will be inflation expectations and wages growth tax on big global companies the past week saw a big move towards agreement on minimum global tax but there is a long way to go yet the g7 endorsement of an excess profits tax on the biggest global companies and a 15 minimum tax rate on earnings outside a company s home country still has been helped along by the us desire to raise its corporate tax but not at the same time severely harm us companies there are several points to note first it still has to go through the g20 the oecd and individual countries parliaments second the excess profits tax is heavily weighted against us companies and it s difficult to see congress agreeing to that third the excess profits tax could just lead to wasteful activities by multinationals to reduce profit margins which could be bad for investment and jobs and it provides a benefit for companies that are not big enough to qualify for the tax finally most australian companies will actually receive a competitiveness boost given australia s already high corporate tax rate bitcoin rollercoaster it was another interesting week on the bitcoin crypto currency rollercoaster first the fbi confirmed it had hacked back us2 3 million of the us4 3 million in bitcoin ransom paid by colonial pipeline last month to the darkside while it s unclear how they did this it s undeniably good news but it also calls into question how secure bitcoin actually is which of course contributed to another plunge in its price but it then got a lift after el salvador adopted it as legal tender adding to hopes other countries would do likewise some who rely on the us dollar as their currency like el salvador may do so too and countries like el salvador may see an opportunity to profit from interest in it eg by offering bitcoin miners access to clean energy but it s hard to see most countries adopting bitcoin as legal tender and if anything we are likely to see more regulation of it most governments won t want to see the seigniorage revenue they get from their own currencies threatened they will face increased pressure to protect their citizens from its volatility its use for illegal activity particularly in ransomware will likely lead to more regulation its high carbon emissions will work against it as governments focus on reducing emissions its slow transaction speed and high cost per transaction work against it as a digital currency and governments will likely provide their own digital currencies finally a proposal by international banking regulators to classify bitcoin as the riskiest of assets may be seen as positive for bitcoin to the extent its getting recognised but then such a risk weighting would make it very hard for banks to even hold it coronavirus update the trend in new coronavirus cases and deaths remained down over the last week with developed countries falling sharply helped by vaccines with japan also in a steep decline and new cases in india continuing to fall sharply several asian countries that had been in a rising trend now appear to be rolling over but the trend remains up in south africa south korea and in some south american countries source ourworldindata org amp capital melbourne lockdown ends the good news in australia is that the lockdown in melbourne has ended albeit with various restrictions remaining after the number of new cases trended down risks remain though so it could still flare up again but so far so good and it s clear that snap lockdowns if implemented early when cases are low can help avert a longer more debilitating lockdown as well as save lives the only way to avoid them going forward is to rapidly ramp up vaccination source covid19data com au vaccine update so far only 12 of the global population has had at least one dose of vaccine with only 9 in emerging countries but 43 in developed countries canada has now shot up to 64 after a slow start the uk is now at 61 the us is at 53 europe is at 42 and australia is at 21 the success of the vaccines continues to be evident in low new cases hospitalisations and deaths in israel the uk and the us however the uk has seen an edging up in new cases due to the highly contagious delta variant particularly amongst young unvaccinated people highlighting the risks of reopening before enough people have been vaccinated but vaccines should help prevent anything like past waves and keep hospitalisations and deaths down in the uk source ourworldindata org amp capital while australia s vaccination rate has increased to 0 5 of the population a day see thick line in next chart its lagging much of europe and canada that has been running around 1 a day source ourworldindata org amp capital our australian economic activity tracker our australian economic activity tracker fell sharply over the last week as victoria s lockdown continued to impact however with the lockdown now over we are likely to see the rising trend in economic activity quickly resume again as seen after the various other snap lockdowns ended source amp capital our us economic activity tracker remained just below its pre coronavirus level and our european tracker is continuing to rise rapidly as europe reopens based on weekly data for eg job ads restaurant bookings confidence mobility credit debt card transactions retail foot traffic hotel bookings source amp capital continuing with the beatles george harrison also continued with a

speaking as the california budget do you really think that bulking me up with your billions will solve california s post pandemic problems i the california budget am bigger than ever right now more than 267 billion according to governor newsom s recent revision of me and please don t think i don t appreciate being more swole than schwarzenegger i remember how lean and gaunt i got in the great recession when the pandemic first hit everyone including me thought i d be much smaller by now instead i m projected to have a 38 billion surplus you might think that this would make me feel all safe and proud since i m able to fund a bunch of new programs from small business incentives to transitional kindergarten and medi cal coverage for more undocumented californians but actually i m worried and you should be too the phony conventional wisdom oft repeated by politicians and the media is that if i m doing well the state is doing well just look at the victory lap around california that newsom who is facing a recall is taking to tout all the new things he put in me but the reality is that focusing on me when i appear to be in good shape is a way to cover up our state s failures to fix our many broken systems right now money is being poured into me to fund a number of programs that aren t being properly managed look at the state s unemployment system and its failures to prevent fraud and deliver services or consider all the money that the latest revision of me spreads among homelessness programs that as a recent audit found don t work well by themselves or together or scrutinize the billions being added to housing funds and programs that produce very little affordable housing history says that it is at times when i m most flush that california makes its dumbest mistakes you could also take note of the billions being thrown in to cover pension debt without any accompanying effort to bring pension and other retirement benefits under control or take a gander at the record amounts of money going to schools which are not yet fully reopened and which have yet to assess fully all the academic and social emotional damage done to students by more than a year of closures of course managing california and its programs is hard by comparison i m easy to handle i m just a spending plan and my numbers are based on predictions about state revenues that are almost always wrong why because state budget officials make me by guessing how the stock market and the incomes of the wealthy will look in the following year indeed my dependence on capital gains makes me so volatile that even kanye probably thinks i m nuts and all the formulas that govern me many of them imposed via ballot initiative by those crazy people known as california voters make me extremely complicated and even antiquated this year the big reason why the governor is cutting taxes and giving schools extra bucks is because of a little known 42 year old voter approved formula that limits spending growth based on population and personal income that s right how california budgets out of the pandemic is being determined not by the needs of today s californians but by a ballot measure written in 1979 by an anti tax activist named paul gann who died in 1989 even though i m governed by the dead i do include some good new proposals this year like my new payments to low income and middle income californians with 500 additional checks to families with children harvard economists have shown that such payments worked wonders in california this past year with poorer counties like imperial having higher levels of consumer spending during the pandemic than before it for fresno and some other parts of the central valley covid proved to be an economic stimulus but beyond such ideas i wonder if i m growing too big too fast making the new me the 2021 22 budget such a giant historic document could bring risks especially if the stock market and economy turn and my revenue picture goes upside down again while the conventional wisdom is that a big budget is good for the state and the governor history says that it is at times when i m most flush that california makes its dumbest mistakes state voters passed prop 13 and its tax cutting formulas when i had a surplus so big it was dubbed the obscene surplus the state gave unsustainable boosts to its pensioners when it was running big surpluses in the late 1990s tech bubble so let me suggest making me less bulky let s put aside most of this giant windfall of tax revenues into a reserve and focus on improving management and developing smarter pandemic recovery plans right now let s make sure transitional kindergarten works better before enrolling all 4 year olds in it let s not throw money into pensions and retirements without reforming that system too then in the years to come we can devote this extra money to building up these better systems for the state so that as i get bigger i have a longer

wuhan nytimes to a growing chorus of united states politicians and scientists she is the key to whether the world will ever learn if the virus behind the devastating covid 19 pandemic escaped from a chinese lab to the chinese government and public she is a hero of the country s success in curbing the epidemic and a victim of malicious conspiracy theories dr shi zhengli a top chinese virologist is once again at the centre of clashing narratives about her research on coronaviruses at a state lab in wuhan the city where the pandemic first emerged the idea that the virus may have escaped from a lab had long been widely dismissed by scientists as implausible and shunned by others for its connection with former us president donald trump but fresh scrutiny from the biden administration and calls for greater candor from prominent scientists have brought the theory back to the fore scientists generally agree that there is still no direct evidence to support the lab leak theory but more of them now say that the hypothesis was dismissed too hastily without a thorough investigation and they point to a range of unsettling questions some scientists say dr shi conducted risky experiments with bat coronaviruses in labs that were not safe enough others want clarity on reports citing us intelligence suggesting that there were early infections of covid 19 among several employees of the wuhan institute of virology dr shi has denied these accusations and now finds herself defending the reputation of her lab and by extension that of her country reached on her cellphone last week shi said at first that she preferred not to speak directly with reporters citing her institute s policies yet she could barely contain her frustration how on earth can i offer up evidence for something where there is no evidence she said her voice rising in anger during the brief unscheduled conversation i don t know how the world has come to this constantly pouring filth on an innocent scientist she wrote in a text message in a rare interview over e mail she denounced the suspicions as baseless including the allegations that several of her colleagues may have been ill before the outbreak emerged the speculation boils down to one central question did dr shi s lab hold any source of the new coronavirus before the pandemic erupted her answer is an emphatic no but china s refusal to allow an independent investigation into her lab or to share data on its research make it difficult to validate dr shi s claims and has only fuelled nagging suspicions about how the pandemic could have taken hold in the same city that hosts an institute known for its work on bat coronaviruses those in favour of the natural origins hypothesis though have pointed to wuhan s role as a major transportation hub as well as a recent study that showed that just before the pandemic hit the city s markets were selling many animal species capable of harbouring dangerous pathogens that could jump to humans the chinese government has given no appearance of holding dr shi under suspicion despite the international scrutiny she seems to have been able to continue her research and give lectures in china

avoid news part 2 what the stock market taught me about news it s been a decade since i blogged about the benefits of avoiding news in that time i mostly followed the advice i gave i kicked my addiction to the daily show in late 2016 after it switched from ridiculing trump to portraying him as scary probably part of a general trend for the show to be less funny i got more free time and only missed the news a little bit then the pandemic hit i suddenly needed lots of new information corporate earnings releases were too slow wikipedia our world in data metaculus and some newly created covid specific web sites partly filled that gap but i still needed more and i mostly didn t manage to find anything that was faster or more informative than the news media storyteller industry that at least correlated with higher than normal stress i suspect that paying attention to the storytellers partly caused the stress distorted salience do you want to focus your attention on problems that are most likely to hurt you if so the storyteller industry is likely to distract you it s hard for a daily news source to avoid that effect it has to focus on recent unusual events when coal plants emit radioactive smoke there s little occasion to write about it because it s very routine and not at all a sign that someone did something wrong when people initially adopted coal yet when a nuclear plant emits a similar amount of radioactive material that s a rare sign of an avoidable mistake it s unclear how the storyteller industry could avoid causing readers to pay undue attention to the nuclear mistakes but the natural consequence is that readers will at least subconsciously treat that attention as implying more harm storytellers could reduce the biases from that distorted salience by sounding more worried in proportion to harm implied by their stories but that conflicts with the goal of making their stories entertaining and with the goal of maximizing the number of stories that readers believe to be important alas few readers are willing to give the storytellers incentives to prioritize that kind of balance preparing for the pandemic one of the bigger mistakes that i made in 2020 came from recalling that ebola sars the 1976 swine flu outbreak and various bird flu s all generated a modest amount of news but little harm in the us even the older pandemics that did kill many americans had little apparent effect on the stock market so i gave low priority to studying pandemics in addition i had traded a few bird flu contracts on intrade and i think made a tiny amount of money betting that pandemics were less likely than people thought alas there s a difference between the probability of an event and the expected value of that event s effects storytellers who tend not to do expected value calculations seemed to often overstate the probability of a distant pandemic reaching the us yet they rarely imply that the expected harm implies anything more than you need to stay tuned to our channel but i wasn t paying much attention to the storytellers at the critical times so i can t blame them much for my mistake covid fears in the spring and summer of 2020 i saw rather large discrepancies between my business forecasts and the impressions that storytellers were promoting it sure looked like many commentators storytellers were going out of their way to overstate the economic damage from the pandemic i presume that s partly due to them trying to manage people s fear levels if people felt economically safe that might cause them to feel it was safe to risk spreading the virus another reason might be that fearful stories selling better than happy ones whatever the reasons by mid to late april enough companies were issuing statements to the effect that the damage to their business wasn t catastrophic and that they were seeing signs of recovery no single report meant a lot but i read a lot of corporate announcements and saw a clear pattern business was better than most pundits were willing to imagine for much of 2020 there were widespread claims that hertz shares were worthless or nearly worthless that conclusion was superficially plausible as it s not unusual for bankruptcy cases to work out that way but hertz s situation seemed unusually uncertain and the pandemic triggered some abnormally fast business fluctuations it now looks like buying hertz while it was in bankruptcy proceedings was a great idea given the benefit of hindsight i m not complaining that the storytellers were wrong about what hertz shares were worth they did a decent job of identifying relatively competent sources of opinion on the subject i m complaining about the false implications about the competence of those sources it s hard to identify an expert who could convincingly report that nobody had the foggiest idea what would happen unless you re willing to treat market prices as expert opinions in which case why are you paying attention to a story instead of just looking at the price of hertz stock hertz ought to have been almost that expert but legal risks pressured hertz to slant it s comments in a more paranoid way hertz s value ended up depending somewhat heavily on when vaccines became available that s an important topic where the storytellers failed badly e g this headline claiming to be a fact check that said we d need a miracle to get vaccines in 2020 that was in mid may when metaculus was showing a significant chance that a vaccine would be proven effective by the end of 2020 some storytellers even spread the false claim that we ve never made a successful vaccine for a coronavirus before if you read the story carefully enough you will notice it eventually hints at the caveat in humans vaccines for coronaviruses have been commercially available for several species of pets and livestock it took me a couple of months to see through that vaccine smokescreen doing so helped me to make lots of money in the second half of 2020 betting on pandemic sensitive stocks not hertz since most investors were too pessimistic about vaccines for much of that period enron enron is an example of why i mostly ignore stories and focus on verifiable numbers i heard a glowing report of enron s innovative management style in mid 2001 at extro 5 and likely would have noticed more such reports if i had been more addicted to storytellers that report sounded plausible and it would have required an unusual amount of effort for me to find anything wrong with that story when i thought in terms of stories about enron management i felt a real temptation to buy enron stock and those stories would have seemed more salient if i had paid more attention to the storytellers then i looked at enron s earnings growth revenue growth and return on equity the revenue growth was fairly impressive but nothing about the earnings distinguished it from a boring company i also looked at charts of its stock price i saw signs that sellers were less patient than buyers that usually indicates an ordinary fluctuation in business but whatever it counted as evidence that i could safely postpone buying so i decided to wait i kept waiting until it had clearly collapsed coping strategies my most important strategy for getting good stock market information is to decide what information i want to actively seek it and to minimize my attention to what other people suggest i should pay attention to if i let the storytellers decide what evidence to use in evaluating a company or an industry or the economy i ll end up using criteria that are selected for other people s purposes sometimes those purposes will be ideological sometimes they will be to protect some powerful institutions or maybe they ll be mostly for entertainment purposes the results are mostly not much better than letting one side of a court case choose which evidence i should look at more generally i try to focus on sources that prioritize accuracy over entertainment e g wikipedia metaculus alas that requires some willpower i haven t managed to develop a consistent habit of looking at sites like that for information i also have some need for alerting myself to important events that aren t on my radar the wikipedia current events portal is such a source but isn t wise enough about what s important to be a complete answer i check news google com but it s click baity enough that i keep hoping to replace it with something better individual bloggers sometimes provide news like benefits especially when they re aiming to earn respect from well informed peers rather than any of the strategies which require attracting lots of readers scott sumner often meets those standards i ve gone back to reading tyler cowen he does a better job than wikipedia of identifying important topics but is much harder to skim i can t get much out of his blog without getting sucked in to spending more time there than i want is it getting worse when i was young there were fewer choices for how to get the knowledge that storytellers aim to provide people chose between maybe three tv stations and one or two newspapers that meant less competition than we have today less competition meant that storytellers had more freedom to write stories that enhanced the storytellers reputations with their friends and families that created a modest tendency toward high brow consensus oriented stories for example the u s had many bombings in 1970s often politically motivated the storyteller profession was able to treat those as ordinary crimes that we could mostly forget because the police were able to contain the harm to relatively minor levels whereas today we have storytellers that specialize in peddling outrage at least some of them will have ideologies which will predispose them to overstate the importance of politically motivated crimes even those who are predisposed to downplay the importance will have some incentive to hype the stories in order to keep readers who are attracted to controversy yet we also have information sources that replicate the high brow consensus oriented features that newspapers and tv stations used to provide e g wikipedia so my conclusion is that people who really want good information are better off today but the average person s information diet is likely getting a bit worse p s i don t want to leave you with the impression that storytellers are mostly wrong if they were i could make more money by doing the opposite of what they say their actual track record is much more ordinary than that

lordstown made misstatements about preorders of its electric endurance pickup truck an investigation by the company s board concluded lordstown motors corp s shine dimmed further monday as the electric truck startup s two top executives stepped down after the company s board found evidence of inaccurate statements the onetime star special purpose acquisition company s stock took its biggest one day drop ever chief executive steve burns and chief financial officer julio rodriguez have resigned from the company effective immediately the company said in a statement monday burns declined to comment about his exit in a text message it was the latest setback for the company which warned last week that it might not have enough cash to fund development of its first truck or even survive the next 12 months if it can t raise more capital in march the startup disclosed a securities and exchange commission investigation of its operations after a short seller said that its technology was flawed and that preorders for its truck were nonbinding advertisement shares of the company sank 19 to 9 26 the lowest in almost three weeks the stock is down 54 this year and more than 70 below the closing high of 31 40 it reached in september it may come under further selling pressure from potential stock disposals by burns who is the single largest shareholder with a 26 5 stake adam jonas an analyst at morgan stanley who recently pulled his rating on lordstown wrote in a research note lordstown is one of a slew of electric vehicle startups that have gone public through mergers with spacs which have been controversial because they ve made public companies out of young ventures that have little in the way of revenue or commercially viable products lordstown combined with diamondpeak holdings in an october deal that netted the electric truck company 675 million the company said in a separate statement that a board investigation concluded it had made misstatements about its vehicle preorders the inquiry cited instances when the startup inaccurately claimed preorders came from commercial fleets instead of from third party management companies or influencers that didn t plan to buy trucks directly it also found that some of the preorders were placed by ostensible buyers unlikely to have the resources to complete the orders or whose commitments were too vague or infirm to be appropriately included in the total number of preorders disclosed in a march report short seller hindenburg research called lordstown s claim that it had 100 000 preorders for its truck fictitious advertisement as recently as last month burns told analysts on a conference call that lordstown had halted preorders at 100 000 vehicles but had begun accepting an additional 23 000 vehicle purchase agreements most of which included down payments lordstown s board concluded that other allegations made by hindenburg in march were false and misleading in many aspects the company s lead independent director angela strand has been named executive chairwoman and she will oversee the company until a new ceo is identified becky roof who has previously served as an interim finance chief at other corporations will do the same at lordstown we remain committed to delivering on our production and commercialization objectives holding ourselves to the highest standards of operation and performance and creating value for shareholders strand said in the statement hindenburg alleged that burns had been forced out of his former company electric van maker workhorse group inc he left that company in 2019 and founded lordstown burns denied hindenburg s allegations burns abrupt departure and lordstown s finding that it made misstatements during his tenure are eerily similar to what transpired at nikola corp another electric vehicle startup that went public via a blank check company nikola s founder and ceo also stepped down after hindenburg targeted the company for misleading investors something the startup later confirmed advertisement lordstown drew attention to itself when it acquired a shuttered general motors co factory in youngstown ohio where it plans to manufacture its own vehicles the move was lauded by then president trump s administration after he had promised to bring back work to the thousands of workers who lost jobs when the plant was closed in 2019 the exit of lordstown s two top executives comes at a difficult time for the company as it attempts to transition from research and development into commercial production of its first model the company is trying to build a unique electric pickup with a motor at each wheel that makes it an engineering challenge it is working with technology licensed from elaphe propulsion technologies of slovenia to produce the motors lordstown s board rejected an allegation from hindenburg that the technology isn t workable in a commercial vehicle while hub motors have not previously been used at scale in commercially

there was nothing of the giant in the aspect of the man who was beginning to awaken on the sleeping porch of a dutch colonial house in that residential district of zenith known as floral heights his name was george f babbitt babbitt by sinclair lewis the joys of a sleeping porch are many but the greatest is a warm morning before dawn the windows are flung open and i lie in bed listening to a chorus of birdsong from the surrounding woods the symphony builds to a crescendo as the sun rises the notes loud and jumbled perhaps the closest western pennsylvania will ever get to the sounds of a jungle i try to distinguish one bird from another occasionally recognize a carolina wren or an eastern towhee but for me the divine pleasure is in the whole oh you have a sleeping porch people always exclaim their eyes lighting up when i show them around our old farmhouse just before we bought this farm in 1988 my husband and i had slept on a friend s porch in norfolk conn and afterward my husband suggested we add one onto our new bedroom i agreed we enlisted our friend and architect ellis schmidlapp and soon found ourselves discussing window treatments roof angles and drainage ours was the first and only sleeping porch schmidlapp designed in 40 years of architectural practice today sleeping porches may seem quaint or out of a different time but they were once standard treatment in domestic architecture evolving how odd it feels to write this during another global health crisis tuberculosis tb is an infectious airborne disease that most commonly affects the lungs and was prevalent in this country from the mid 19th century until the 1940s when streptomycin an antibiotic was discovered tb patients were usually quarantined in sanitoria or at home one of the most important stated goals of the home rest cure was to provide the greatest amount of fresh air possible to bring the outdoors in wrote katherine ott in her book fevered lives tuberculosis in american culture since 1870 some patients slept outdoors in tents lean tos or cabins others transformed existing porches into makeshift bedrooms or slept near open windows the farlin window tent was a tortuous looking contraption attached to a window and protruding indoors to cover a patient s upper body around the turn of the century ott wrote the presence of a sleeping porch indicated respiratory problems in a family as clearly as if a marching band had been hired to announce it and by 1910 sleeping outdoors and exposure to fresh air had become a part of general middle class culture the aeroshade company of waukesha wis made awnings for sleeping porches in 1916 that do not absorb and retain heat but keep it out and to meet the popular demand of sleeping porches the 1917 aladdin house catalog of bay city mich which sold house plans offered two pre fabricated sleeping porch additions no 5 was two stories high 10 feet by 6 feet the upper story big enough for a double bed two twins or three cots and cost 100 including screens and interior and exterior paint stain or oil the slightly larger no 6 was 14 feet by 7 feet and cost 149 50 the popularity of the sleeping porch needs no comment here claimed the catalogue copy this makes a splendid addition to any house frank lloyd wright designed sleeping porches too including those for western pennsylvania s own fallingwater as donald hoffmann wrote in frank lloyd wright s fallingwater the house and its history wright s bedroom designs for fallingwater were small simple and meant to serve almost as antechambers to their respective terraces each of which offered more floor space in 1921 about 14 years before commissioning wright to design fallingwater the kaufmanns had built at bear run from the same aladdin catalogue a readi cut cabin with screened porches where according to hoffmann the kaufmanns had become accustomed to sleeping outside then with the design of fallingwater under way kaufmann had what he called a bird cage idea for sleeping on the terraces of his new house he discussed it with wright as early as april 1936 hoffmann wrote and wright made a drawing for a mobile steel framed sleeping chamber in 1937 however the idea was abandoned because a pittsburgh manufacturer was unable to make the device these ideas were early in the design process said justin gunther director of fallingwater and whether or not the kaufmanns ever pulled their walnut framed beds out onto the terraces at night i don t know but it s certainly a romantic notion to think that liliane might have slept on the master bedroom terrace under the stars the stars and planets are another pleasure of a second floor sleeping porch such as ours surrounded as it is on three sides by tall windows and at the gable end a large fanlight window that allows us to look straight up to the heavens schmidlapp said he d initially pictured conventional double hung windows for our porch but my husband wanted windows that swung open into the room and were removable so we could store them underneath our bed in summertime the predominantly south facing room has 11 screened windows in all and in case they re left open during a rainstorm schmidlapp placed drain holes on the floor with a rubber membrane underneath so water wouldn t seep down into the dining room ours is the simplest of interiors white wainscoting and a gray wood floor i ve seen photos of elaborate sleeping porches with wicker furniture fancy curtains ceiling fans shutters rows of beds with matching bedding and potted hydrangeas but we have only a bed two side tables with lamps for reading a wooden chest to store warm nightclothes and a hooked rug when the children were young we added a small bed in case they wished to join us our dogs always do we sleep on our porch year round in all weather and all temperatures i usually draw the line around the freezing mark but my husband is of stronger stock winter takes the most preparation making sure the windows are shut tightly and piling onto the bed layers of down comforters and sleeping bags for extra warmth i ve been known to don a red wool union suit with back flaps a nightcap and socks our son remembers when he was young dressing in many layers to sleep out there in winter not for the faint of heart he said on the coldest nights the last and my favorite thing to do is to place hot water bottles underneath the sheets before climbing running into bed on a sleeping porch the nighttime sounds of wild creatures come close great horned owls bullfrogs fishers spring peepers coyotes we hear the wind howl off the ridge the roar of a swollen creek below and rain on the metal roof thunder echoes off the walls and lightning illuminates the entire room some nights we watch the full arc of the moon rise and set and on moonless nights identify constellations in winter we smell the first scent of snow and awaken to a white world in summer lightning bugs sparkle around us when a chill takes hold in autumn the sleeping porch retains the sun s warmth and becomes a solarium of sorts a wonderful place to meditate read a book or nap but who wants to sleep on a sleeping porch when the world offers such gifts

sign of sound economy fickle friends idle money rocks the rupee free money addiction look beyond us dollar new delhi india s foreign exchange stock has touched 600 billion fourth highest in the world ahead of russia that heap of dollars gives us macroeconomic stability we now have enough to pay for 18 months of imports whereas back in the crisis year of 1991 we didn t have enough forex for two weeks at the very least we need foreign exchange to pay for importing crude oil the lifeline of transport and logistics we are also import dependent for a variety of items including vaccine supplies steel and auto components is there a downside to having a large war chest of dollars it s complicated but yes there are downsides first some good news though unlike all the major dollar hoarding central banks china russia saudi arabia and japan we are not an export surplus country much of their pile is the accumulation from years of earning more dollars than they spend for us it is the opposite we may be the only large asian country with a current account deficit i e we import much more than we export and still have large foreign exchange reserves that is creditable if every year we fall short of dollars how come our forex stock keeps rising the reason is the current account deficit is offset by a large influx of capital flows dollars flow into india through foreign portfolio investors fpi or as foreign direct investment fdi this inflow from the purchase of assets like shares shows the confidence of foreign investors in india s growth prospects in the past three decades india has attracted nearly 500 billion as fdi beyond fpi and fdi inflows into the stock market are loans these are called external commercial borrowings the total outstanding foreign loans are 560 billion or about 93 of our foreign exchange reserves that s a downside the stock market inflows especially fpi can easily and abruptly make an about turn such investors can be fickle or nervous or simply riskaverse and will pull out funds at the drop of a hat although pulling out fdi is not that easy similarly indian companies having large dollar obligations of short and long term loans are also a warning sign we need enough dollars to at least pay off the short term debts even nris can withdraw large dollar deposits suddenly that s what they did in 1990 when there was panic before the first iraq war also if india s rating drops below investment grade no foreign lender would be willing to refinance our old loans our coffers will become empty repaying loans that s why india s large forex stock to the extent it has fickle flows should not make us complacent unless our exports exceed imports we will remain vulnerable the second downside to a large dollar pile is that it earns very little interest if it represents a national asset is there a better use for it third large foreign holdings in india s stock market make its value vulnerable to ebbs and flows of forex indeed the rupee usually gets stronger on days when the stock market rises and vice versa is it healthy that the purchasing power of our importers is dependent on fickle foreign investors the fourth downside is that a large forex pile means rbi s balance sheet gets bloated since the balance sheet is measured in rupees it expands whenever the rupee weakens this is free gain to rbi which it can then pass on as dividends to the centre a very large balance sheet size means even a slight weakening translates into notional gains of thousands of crores or profit for rbi when currency fluctuates the gains and losses should normally not be encashed but large revaluation gains on rupee weakening could become a continuing source of fiscal financing for a central government in desperate need this can lead to fiscal addiction or even dilution of rbi s independence the dollar is not our currency too much of it can become a headache unlike rupee debt we cannot forgive our dollar debt countries like russia despite having large foreign reserves are moving away from the dollar there are geopolitical tensions with the us and russia doesn t want to depend on new york clearing banks dollar transactions can only be cleared by us banks india should also look to diversify its forex holding away from the dollar and examine the optimal size of foreign reserves for our needs
to a growing chorus of us politicians and scientists she is the key to whether the world will ever learn if the virus behind the devastating covid 19 pandemic escaped from a chinese lab to the chinese government and public she is a hero of the country s success in curbing the epidemic and a victim of malicious conspiracy theories shi zhengli a top chinese virologist is once again at the center of clashing narratives about her research on coronaviruses at a state lab in wuhan the city where the pandemic first emerged the idea that the virus may have escaped from a lab had long been widely dismissed by scientists as implausible and shunned by others for its connection with former president donald trump but fresh scrutiny from the biden administration and calls for greater candor from prominent scientists have brought the theory back to the fore scientists generally agree that there is still no direct evidence to support the lab leak theory but more of them now say that the hypothesis was dismissed too hastily without a thorough investigation and they point to a range of unsettling questions some scientists say dr shi conducted risky experiments with bat coronaviruses in labs that were not safe enough others want clarity on reports citing us intelligence suggesting that there were early infections of covid 19 among several employees of the wuhan institute of virology dr shi has denied these accusations and now finds herself defending the reputation of her lab and by extension that of her country reached on her cellphone two weeks ago dr shi said at first that she preferred not to speak directly with reporters citing her institute s policies yet she could barely contain her frustration how on earth can i offer up evidence for something where there is no evidence she said her voice rising in anger during the brief unscheduled conversation i don t know how the world has come to this constantly pouring filth on an innocent scientist she wrote in a text message in a rare interview over email she denounced the suspicions as baseless including the allegations that several of her colleagues may have been ill before the outbreak emerged the speculation boils down to one central question did dr shi s lab hold any source of the new coronavirus before the pandemic erupted dr shi s answer is an emphatic no but china s refusal to allow an independent investigation into her lab or to share data on its research make it difficult to validate dr shi s claims and has only fuelled nagging suspicions about how the pandemic could have taken hold in the same city that hosts an institute known for its work on bat coronaviruses those in favour of the natural origins hypothesis though have pointed to wuhan s role as a major transportation hub as well as a recent study that showed that just before the pandemic hit the city s markets were selling many animal species capable of harboring dangerous pathogens that could jump to humans shi zhengli speaks during the 2020 zhongguancun zgc forum on 18 september 2020 in beijing china source getty the chinese government has given no appearance of holding dr shi under suspicion despite the international scrutiny she seems to have been able to continue her research and give lectures in china the stakes in this debate extend into how scientists study infectious diseases some scientists have cited the lab leak scenario in pushing for greater scrutiny of gain of function experiments that broadly defined are intended to make pathogens more powerful to better understand their behavior and risks many scientists say they want the hunt for the virus origins to transcend politics borders and individual scientific achievements this has nothing to do with fault or guilt said david relman a microbiologist at stanford university and co author of a recent letter in the journal science signed by 18 scientists that called for a transparent investigation into all viable scenarios including a lab leak the letter urged labs and health agencies to open their records to the public it s just bigger than any one scientist or institute or any one country anybody anywhere who has data of this sort needs to put it out there dr relman said transparency matters many virologists maintain that the coronavirus most likely jumped from an animal to a human in a setting outside a lab but without direct proof of a natural spillover more scientists and politicians have called for a full investigation into the lab leak theory proponents of a lab investigation say that researchers at dr shi s institute could have collected or contracted the new coronavirus from the wild such as in a bat cave or the scientists may have created it by accident or by design either way the virus could then have leaked from the laboratory perhaps by infecting a worker china has sought to influence investigations into the virus origin while promoting its own unproven allegations beijing agreed to allow a team of world health organization experts to visit china but limited their access when the who team said in a report in march that a lab leak was extremely unlikely its conclusion was seen as hasty even the head of the who dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said i do not believe that this assessment was extensive enough security guards are seen in front of the wuhan institute of virology in wuhan hubei province china on 3 february 2021 source aap last month president joe biden ordered intelligence agencies to investigate the origin question including the lab theory on sunday the leaders of the world s wealthiest large democracies at the group of 7 summit urged china to be part of a new investigation into the origins of the coronavirus mr biden told reporters that he and other leaders had discussed access to labs in china transparency matters across the board mr biden said scientists have a motherland in less polarised times dr shi was a symbol of china s scientific progress the bat woman at the forefront of research into emerging viruses she led expeditions into caves to collect samples from bats and guano to learn how viruses jump from animals to humans in 2019 she was among 109 scientists elected to the american academy of microbiology for her contributions to the field she s a stellar scientist extremely careful with a rigorous work ethic said dr robert c gallo director of the institute of human virology at the university of maryland school of medicine the wuhan institute of virology employs nearly 300 people and is home to one of only two chinese labs that have been given the highest security designation biosafety level 4 dr shi leads the institute s work on emerging infectious diseases and over the years her group has collected over 10 000 bat samples from around china researchers work in a lab of the wuhan institute of virology wiv in wuhan hubei province china 23 february 2017 source featurechina under china s centralised approach to scientific research the institute answers to the communist party which wants scientists to serve national goals science has no borders but scientists have a motherland xi jinping the country s leader said in a speech to scientists last year dr shi herself though does not belong to the communist party according to official chinese media reports which is unusual for state employees of her status she built her career at the institute starting as a research assistant in 1990 and working her way up the ranks dr shi 57 obtained her phd from the university of montpellier in france in 2000 and started studying bats in 2004 after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars which killed more than 700 people around the world in 2011 she made a breakthrough when she found bats in a cave in southwestern china that carried coronaviruses that were similar to the virus that causes sars in all the work we do if just once you can prevent the outbreak of an illness then what we ve done will be very meaningful she told cctv china s state broadcaster in 2017 but some of her most notable findings have since drawn the heaviest scrutiny in recent years dr shi began experimenting on bat coronaviruses by genetically modifying them to see how they behave in 2017 she and her colleagues at the wuhan lab published a paper about an experiment in which they created new hybrid bat coronaviruses by mixing and matching parts of several existing ones including at least one that was nearly transmissible to humans in order to study their ability to infect and replicate in human cells proponents of this type of research say it helps society prepare for future outbreaks critics say the risks of creating dangerous new pathogens may outweigh potential benefits the picture has been complicated by new questions about whether us government funding that went to dr shi s work supported controversial gain of function research the wuhan institute received around 600 000 in grant money from the us government through an american nonprofit called ecohealth alliance the national institutes of health said it had not approved funding for the nonprofit to conduct gain of function research on coronaviruses that would have made them more infectious or lethal dr shi in an emailed response to questions argued that her experiments differed from gain of function work because she did not set out to make a virus more dangerous but to understand how it might jump across species my lab has never conducted or cooperated in conducting gof experiments that enhance the virulence of viruses she said speculation rooted in utter distrust concerns have centered not only on what experiments dr shi conducted but also on the conditions under which she did them some of dr shi s experiments on bat viruses were done in biosafety level 2 labs where security is lower than in other labs at the institute that has raised questions about whether a dangerous pathogen could have slipped out ralph baric a university of north carolina expert in coronaviruses who signed the open letter in science said that although a natural origin of the virus was likely he supported a review of what level of biosafety precautions were taken in studying bat coronaviruses at the wuhan institute dr baric conducted nih approved gain of function research at his lab using information on viral genetic sequences provided by dr shi dr shi said that bat viruses in china could be studied in bsl 2 labs because there was no evidence that they directly infected humans a view supported by some other scientists she also rejected recent reports that three researchers from her institute had sought treatment at a hospital in november 2019 for flulike symptoms before the first covid 19 cases were reported the wuhan institute of virology has not come across such cases she wrote if possible can you provide the names of the three to help us check a woman wearing a protective face mask walks at a market in a residential area in wuhan china on 22 january 2021 source aap as for samples that the lab held dr shi has maintained that the closest bat virus she had in her lab which she shared publicly was only 96 per cent identical to sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 a vast difference by genomic standards she rejects speculation that her lab had worked on other viruses in secret dr shi s research on a group of miners in yunnan province who suffered severe respiratory disease in 2012 has also drawn questions the miners had worked in the same cave where dr shi s team later discovered the bat virus that is close to sars cov 2 dr shi said that her lab did not detect bat sars like coronaviruses in the miners samples and that she would publish more details in a scientific journal soon her critics say she has withheld information this issue is too important not to come forward with everything you have and in a timely and transparent manner said alina chan a postdoctoral research fellow at the broad institute of mit and harvard who also signed the science letter many scientists and officials say china should share employees medical records and the lab s logs of its experiments and its viral sequence database to evaluate dr shi s claims dr shi said she and the institute had been open with the who and with the global scientific community this is no longer a question of science she said on the phone it is speculation rooted in utter distrust i have nothing to fear the pandemic was a moment that dr shi and her team had long braced for for years she had warned of the risks of a coronavirus outbreak building up a stock of knowledge about these pathogens in january 2020 as dr shi and her team worked frantically they were exhausted but also excited said wang linfa a virologist at the duke national university of singapore medical school who was in wuhan with dr shi at the time all the experiences reagents and the bat samples in the freezer were finally being used in a significant way globally said dr wang dr shi s collaborator and friend for 17 years dr shi published some of the most important early papers on sars cov 2 and covid 19 which scientists around the world have relied on but soon the speculation about dr shi and her lab began to swirl dr shi who is known among friends for being blunt was baffled and angry and sometimes let it show in an interview with science magazine in july she said that mr trump owed her an apology for claiming the virus came from her lab on social media she said people who raised similar questions should shut your stinky mouths dr shi said what she saw as the politicisation of the question had sapped her of any enthusiasm for investigating the origins of the virus she has instead focused on covid vaccines and the features of the new virus and over time she said has calmed down i m sure that i did nothing wrong she wrote so i have nothing to fear this article originally appeared in the

equity markets in the mena region have delivered exceptional returns despite covid 19 headwinds and are set to cement their gains supported by an economic recovery that is well under way according to global investment manager franklin templeton although last year was challenging the global investment manager expects a strong recovery in corporate earnings in mena markets this year earnings are expected to grow by 71 per cent compared with a 31 per cent contraction a year ago said bassel khatoun managing director of the franklin templeton emerging markets equity group during an online seminar on monday this will support current valuation levels and the wide dispersion across the region creates opportunities for active management critical structural and fiscal reforms undertaken by regional governments especially gcc countries over the past few years also support the investment case for mena equities the reforms have bolstered fiscal strength and have helped economies to bounce back quickly from the crisis the global environment has been supportive of healthy equity markets both frontier and emerging markets this year and within that mena markets have actually demonstrated some of the most exceptional returns said mr khatoun the regional index up by over 20 per cent barely halfway into the year many of the gulf s equity markets have outperformed their global peers this year as of monday s close the abu dhabi securities exchange was 34 per cent higher since the year began while saudi arabia s tadawul the dubai financial market and the boursa kuwait s premier market were up 26 per cent 15 per cent and 14 per cent respectively in comparison the msci world index was about 11 per cent higher economies in the mena region are experiencing a strong rebound after the twin shocks of an oil price slump and the covid 19 slowdown that tipped the world economy into its worst recession since the 1930s the international monetary fund expects mena economies to grow by 4 per cent on average this year after shrinking by 3 4 per cent last year regional policymakers reacted to the pandemic far quicker than some of their peers in emerging markets with effective movement restrictions and rapid vaccination campaigns supporting demand and economic recoveries crude prices have also rallied rising by more than 40 per cent since the start of this year oil hit a 32 month high on monday as countries worldwide hasten their vaccination programmes and reopen economies brent the international benchmark that accounts for more than half of the world s crude rose by 0 89 per cent to 73 34 a barrel at 5 04pm uae time west texas intermediate the key gauge for us oil was up 1 03 per cent at 71 64 a barrel with oil prices trending above 70 per barrel we see a very meaningful upside to the imf s gdp forecasts said mr khatoun the fiscal cost of the rebound has been much more modest with the region spending about a third of what other emerging markets which have yet to record similar rebounds have expended this has left sovereign balances sheets in a healthier position and with much more fiscal flexibility and manoeuvrability going forward in order to support their long term growth objectives he said the mena region is also blessed with a young population with high potential for productivity and that creates a very long demand runway for consumption growth the global environment has been supportive of healthy equity markets both frontier and emerging markets this year and within that mena markets have actually demonstrated some of the most exceptional returns franklin templeton is bullish about uae equities as the recovery of the residential property market especially villa prices and the tourism sector support equity prices in the arab world s second largest economy a resilient economy continuing reforms and an extensive covid 19 vaccination programme leads us to maintain a favourable outlook on the uae he said the investment manager is also optimistic about equities in egypt whose economy has continued to grow in an environment where other countries have experienced sharp contractions although low liquidity has been a challenge for the market strong fundamentals and increasingly attractive valuations contribute to support our positive view said mr khatoun healthier economic fundamentals also bode well for the region s bond market and will markedly improve our outlook for second half of the year according to mohieddine kronfol chief investment officer in franklin templeton s global sukuk and mena fixed income department despite having a market capitalisation of more than 600 billion international investors continue to be light on gcc bonds and are missing out on strong risk adjusted returns and valuations that remain generous relative to credit ratings he said gcc policymakers have reinforced their commitment to fiscal consolidation and a multi year structural reform journey which underpins our constructive outlook for regional debt he told the online seminar higher oil prices the ongoing recovery structural reform trends and a reduction in geopolitical risks support our credit allocations the market share of gcc bonds has more than doubled relative to loans over the past five years and they now command a leading position in emerging market debt indexes gcc issuers are on track to issue 125bn worth of bonds this year in line with the total for last year however sovereign issuance is at 30 per cent of the total volume compared with 50 per cent last year and in 2019 this indicates the changing make up of the market as corporate issuers are increasing he said
a rooster hogfish shows off its sharp protruding teeth photo robert michelson hogfish are strange looking members of the wrasse family their first three dorsal spines are long and trailing extending several inches off their dorsal fin this species is more laterally compressed or flattened from side to side and more oval shaped when compared to other marine fish in the wrasse family they have cool red irises in the center of their eyes and a color pattern that constantly changes throughout their lives the color of this species is highly variable and depends upon the age sex and habitat where the fish are found said north carolina division of marine fisheries biologist mclean seward they usually range from pearl white to mottled mixed in with a brownish red coloration with a single black spot located at the back bottom part of its dorsal fin and is paler underneath males are usually more vividly colored than females youngsters and females are more typically pale green reddish brown or a gray brown color their pectoral fins are usually yellow in color he said hogfish in north carolina can grow as large as 3 feet in length and weight up to 24 pounds they can live up to 21 years of age the young fish are usually seen in and around estuaries and seagrass beds and shallow reef habitats predators of the hogfish include larger fishes as well as several species of shark seward said these fish can be found throughout the western atlantic from bermuda and north carolina south to brazil the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico in the united states hogfish are managed through the south atlantic fishery management council representing north carolina south carolina georgia and the east coast of florida north carolina boasts the all tackle world record for hogfish with a 24 pound 5 ounce fish speared at frying pan shoals by diver derek williams the largest fish taken on hook and line was a 21 pound 15 ounce specimen the southeast data assessment and review or sedar 37 report states that the oldest observed age was 21 years from the georgia north carolina stock and 23 years from the west florida stock on the gulf coast seward noted hogfish are usually large bottom feeding predators that eat during the daytime using powerful jaws and large canine teeth that stick out from the front of their mouths to crush hard shelled food species including mollusks and crabs young hogfish will feed primarily on starfish sand dollars mollusks and crustaceans they get their name because of how they hunt for food on the sea floor they will move in and around the sand with their pointed snout searching for mollusks and crustaceans to eat quite similar to that of a farm or wild hog seward said this species is usually found over open sandy bottoms and in and around coral reefs it may be found between 10 to more than 100 feet of water hogfish like to hang around where there a lot of gorgonians also known as a sea fan or sea whip which are types of soft coral found throughout the oceans of the world especially in the warmer subtropics and tropics you can find higher numbers of hogfish along the edges of the reef near the sand reef confluence they really like habitat with hard sand and rock bottoms adjacent to shallow reefs right next to the inshore and offshore portions of the reef system larger hogfish can be found in and around the main reef are while smaller individuals prefer the reef patches to hide from predators said seward hogfish are protogynous hermaphrodites which means they are all born female and change sex to male at a certain size and age a single male holds together a harem of between five to 15 females during an extended spawning season that lasts for months sex change can take several months research has shown if a dominant male is removed it has the potential to negatively impact a harem s stability and may reduce full reproductive potential said seward peak spawning activity for hogfish has been documented numerous times as taking place during the winter and spring months these studies have shown that spawning activity occurs primarily during the months of december through april schools are made up of females and larger dominant males in his harem the male will guard his harem and will only spawn with the females in that harem spawning takes place during late afternoon hours and into the early evening the behaviors exhibited by hogfish as they mate are very interesting seward said the male will first court the female then they rush toward the surface the male and female will simultaneously release their eggs and milt into the open ocean where fertilization will take place the fertilized free floating eggs will quickly develop into larvae hatching approximately 24 hours after spawning takes place they will stay in the larval stage for several weeks until they grow into juveniles and settle down out of the water down into their preferred habitat seward explained that life history studies on hogfish in florida waters estimate that 50 of females reach sexual maturity by the time they are about 1 to 1 5 years old and about 7 inches in length while 50 of males are estimated to be mature by 6 or 7 and around 17 inches in length there is a lack of available life history information on hogfish off georgia and north carolina but preliminary data suggests that hogfish belonging to this stock mature at larger sizes than off the east coast of florida and sexual transition from female to male occurs at approximately 24 inches fork length he said steve poland is the north carolina division of marine fisheries executive assistant for councils and vice chair of the south atlantic fisheries management council he explained that recreational fishermen can legally pursue hogfish year round this species is managed by an annual catch limit if the numbers of fish caught meet or exceed this limit the fishery would be closed at that time poland said there is a limit of two fish per day per person for recreational fishermen with a minimum size of 17 inches fork length a federal commercial snapper grouper permit is needed to commercially harvest hogfish in north carolina waters and commercial fishermen are also required to report their catch the minimum size for commercial fishermen is also 17 inches fork length the commercial trip limit in north carolina waters is 500 pounds whole weight said poland north carolina marine fisheries proclamation ff 10 2021 states that for a vessel with both a valid federal south atlantic charter head boat permit for snapper grouper and a valid federal commercial south atlantic snapper grouper permit it is unlawful to exceed the recreational bag limits for snapper grouper species when fishing with more than four persons including the captain and their mate on board or when carrying paying customers additionally for a vessel with both permits it is unlawful to sell or offer for sale any species of the snapper grouper complex harvested when fishing with more than four persons including the captain and their mate on board or when carrying paying customers for scuba divers hogfish are a fascinating species to watch and photograph they hang right on the bottom so divers do not have to chase them through the middle of the water column and it is cool to observe them dig through the sand bottom with their snouts while looking for food i get the feeling when seeing this behavior that i am really on dry land at a local farm watching their land based namesakes doing the same thing
a meeting of university workers members of the committee for public education cfpe in australia last week urged global support for the decision by 3 000 us volvo truck workers in the united states to oppose a second sell out contract negotiated by the pro corporate united auto workers uaw union and return to the picket lines the resolution stated we extend our solidarity to the volvo workers striking for their just demands at volvo truck new river valley plant in dublin virginia and undertake to fight for the widest support for their struggle we welcome their decision to reject the sell out agreement proposed by the pro company united auto workers union and to form a rank and file committee to lead the battle against the company union partnership although we work in a different industry on the other side of the world we face the common need for a unified working class fightback against the employers offensive which is being enforced by the trade unions as many as 90 000 university workers in australia have lost their jobs since the covid 19 disaster began on top of a decades long assault on wages and conditions that has now left two thirds of university staff in insecure casual or contract employment this has been possible only because the union covering us the national tertiary education union has systematically stifled and suppressed the outrage and resistance of university workers over the past year and for years before that the stand taken by the volvo workers is providing a decisive lead and inspiration to workers around the globe in the fight against the attacks being mounted by the capitalist class and its trade union collaborators we urge workers everywhere to back the volvo strikers several educators supporters of the cfpe have sent statements backing the volvo workers and endorsing the resolution chris gordon a university lecturer said i stand in support of the volvo workers in virginia their fight is not just against one company large as that is what stands behind the company is the entire corporate structure including the media with the government and in particular the uaw union which supposedly represents them the uaw with hundreds of thousands of members refuses to mobilise a movement in defence of workers the reason is that the uaw does not stand in defence of the workers but defends and carries out the program of the corporation financially the uaw depends on the stock market and so supports the productivity and cost cutting measures of volvo there are parallels with a strike in sydney australia with general mills workers facing plans for a sellout by their union the united workers union who like the uaw are refusing to mobilise their 150 000 members and are also not providing full strike pay the same process of shutting down any unification of workers occurs in every union including in the area i work in education i urge auto workers from volvo and more broadly to join the volvo workers rank and file committee as part of establishing a broader struggle and developing a movement that will address the root cause of the brutalisation of workers the capitalist system itself dr ludmilla robinson a senior lecturer in law stated it is imperative that we all express our support for the 3 000 us volvo truck workers who are both determined and brave enough to resist the united auto workers blatant and cowardly compliance with the demands of volvo the uaw s conduct appears to be another example of the egregious infiltration of labour organisations by those whose personal interests and sympathies lie not with their members but with the transnational corporations and the exploitative capitalist system in a country in which once strong and effective unions have become the doormats of capitalism it is so very heartening to learn that there are still those gallant souls who at a grass roots level are willing to fight and serve as an example of what true belief in the ideals of socialism should be workingmen of all countries unite a senior lecturer in business studies said i would like to express my solidarity with the volvo workers striking at the volvo truck new river valley plant in dublin virginia i applaud their decision to reject the agreement proposed by the united auto workers union and perhaps more important to form a rank and file committee this brave move pits them against both the company and the union but they should not think that they are alone i hope that workers across the globe recognise their inspirational courage and support their fight i would like to state my agreement with the resolution adopted by the supporters of the committee for public education

in the heart of their antarctic habitat krill populations are projected to decline about 30 this century due to widespread negative effects from human driven climate change however these effects on this small but significant species will be largely indistinguishable from natural variability in the region s climate until late in the 21st century finds new university of colorado boulder research published today in frontiers in marine science the study has important implications for not only the local food web but for the largest commercial fishery in the southern ocean a booming 2 billion fish oil industry sold as omega 3 supplements in retail giants like costco krill are what links the ecosystem together said zephyr sylvester lead author on the paper and graduate student in environmental studies they re really important to the southern ocean for pretty much every predator species because these tiny animals live in one of the most sensitive areas in the world to climate change explicitly separating trends associated with human driven warming from those arising naturally in krill habitat is a crucial step for planning and mapping harvest limits this study is also the first of its kind to use a group of climate models to demonstrate that climate change has the potential to dramatically alter antarctic marine ecosystems but that natural climate variability can obscure human driven trends small but significant krill are about 2 5 inches 6 cm long fast swimming zooplankton that live in large groups they re key to the region s food chain eaten by just about everything that lives in the waters surrounding antarctica penguins seals fish and whales some of which are still recovering from overharvesting in previous centuries but while they are one of the most abundant species on earth their total biomass estimated at 300 to 500 million tons krill can only survive in a narrow temperature range and are strongly affected by variables in their underwater environment currently fishing in the southern ocean is managed by the convention on the conservation of antarctic marine living resources known as ccamlr pronounced cam ah lar an international body established as part of the antarctic treaty system the first item on their agenda krill yet 40 years after their founding their catch limits on this creature are still only set using a stock assessment that does not account for natural environmental variability or climate change impacts while today there is widespread international recognition of the importance of understanding the impacts of climate change on this marine ecosystem knowing how the climate naturally varies is an important prerequisite according to sylvester the thing that we really have to understand is is there enough krill to feed everything that needs to eat it in the southern ocean as well as humans said cassandra brooks co author on the paper and assistant professor of environmental studies my hope is that we can take this as a first step to understanding how to manage krill better what is natural variability every environment on earth naturally varies a bit each year in its weather temperature and precipitation for example some winters in colorado have more snowfall some have less some will be a bit warmer some colder human driven climate change aside each year in the state has a unique pattern of precipitation and temperature due to natural variability but separating the effects of human driven climate change from natural changes in a region is no easy task to be able to pull apart the variables affecting the southern ocean over this century the researchers ran a larger group of models many times known as a large ensemble earth system model it s the first time this has been done for the southern ocean and for krill then we were able to look at the different trends and quantify how much the natural variability was masking the signal for climate change said sylvester this research addresses one of the biggest disconnects between scientists and fishery managers understanding and communicating uncertainty by being able to quantify how much change is likely to occur from natural variability and separately from climate change it allows everyone involved to plan better for the future and sustain krill for those who depend on it according to brooks even if we won t see this really strong signal from climate change until later what s important for us to understand is that the southern ocean is a very dynamic system and we absolutely have to be managing for natural variability said brooks and we should be ready to manage for the broader impacts of climate change matthew long at the national center for atmospheric research is a co author on this publication

to buy there s no shortage of choices when it comes to buying stocks or investing in individual stocks the number of options can be downright overwhelming that s why it s important to understand your risk tolerance investment objectives and available funds before you begin to invest in the stocks online here are some different types of stocks explained growth stocks these include shares of companies with substantial profits and gains in revenue as the name suggests these are new or younger companies that are growing or serving markets with high growth potential though they can have high gains they are also highly volatile for short term investments these include shares of companies with substantial profits and gains in revenue as the name suggests these are new or younger companies that are growing or serving markets with high growth potential though they can have high gains they are also highly volatile for short term investments value stocks these are shares of companies that are traded at a discount but will hopefully increase in value over time as the market grows the share s price potential think of these as buying stocks on sale so you get a good deal on a more valuable stock that is underpriced these are shares of companies that are traded at a discount but will hopefully increase in value over time as the market grows the share s price potential think of these as buying stocks on sale so you get a good deal on a more valuable stock that is underpriced dividend stocks these are stocks that give shareholders some of the earnings as dividends this means you get a steady income from your investments no matter the current market price good to know an important step in the process is researching stocks you might be interested in and educating yourself on important metrics such as the price to earnings ratio and debt to ebitda ratio pay particular attention to finding information about a company s competitive landscape and management team as well as how industry trends might impact its stock price doing your due diligence if you re researching stocks on your own consult analyst reports industry trend bulletins company prospectuses and company annual reports and conference call transcripts all of this data can help you get a handle on how a company is performing and where it might be headed next analyst reports in particular can help teach you if a company s current share price is fair overvalued or undervalued these determinations are made by comparing a company s stock price to items like its earnings future revenue forecasts and competitor valuations step 3 think about how many shares to buy how many shares you want to buy will greatly depend on how much money you have to invest here are a few things to consider if you want to start with an amount like 2 000 you ll want to research the best affordable stocks out there to create a diversified portfolio some of the best value stocks for instance might include established brands like cvs health and tyson foods which produce steady profits and rank as leaders in their respective industries keep in mind though stocks like alphabet parent company of google amazon and tesla might have name recognition but it doesn t always mean they should be your first purchase however big names can have big rewards you can also invest in fractional shares depending on the online brokerage you choose that can allow you to invest with less money or create a more diversified portfolio step 4 make your order when you buy your first stock you re likely to put in a market order which is the most common type with a market order you ll buy the stock at whatever the current price is another option is a limit order which designates a price you re not willing to exceed for example if you want to buy apple stock at 150 per share but it s currently trading at 155 you can put in a limit order at 150 your order won t be executed unless the share price trades down to 160 whether you re entering a market order or a limit order be sure to do the math so that you can afford to pay for your purchase for example if you want to buy 100 shares of apple at 160 per share you ll have to pay at least 16 000 if your broker charges commissions or other fees you ll need to incorporate those into your total purchase price step 5 diversify your stock portfolio if you re a beginner it s advisable to start small when it comes to buying your first stocks if you rush in too quickly you might end up losing money before you even know what you re doing next be sure to diversify your investment portfolio there are no sure things in stock investing so a diversified portfolio is the best way to reduce your risk diversifying your portfolio with different stocks in different industries makes it easier to ride the ups and downs should one industry get hurt by an unexpected event this makes it especially important to find affordable stocks so you can buy shares in a few different companies glossary of terms for buying and selling stocks as you get familiar with how to buy stocks online here are a few basic investment terms you should understand term meaning

said here are a few quick takeaways and tips to give you a jumpstart on purchasing stocks if you re ready to take the plunge you can start buying stocks online but first you need to open a brokerage account as a general rule your best chance at making money in the stock market is by owning companies with consistent earnings and revenue growth if a company can outperform the expectations of wall street analysts its stock will typically go up meme stocks like gamestop and amc may be tempting in the short term but consider the long term future of these companies their earnings reports and their fundamentals before you make investments you may regret if you want to invest in a few different stocks for diversification purposes but don t have a lot of money to spend you can consider such strategies as buying fractional shares as opposed to buying individual stocks of your favorite companies expert strategy warren buffett s investment style warren buffett the billionaire investor known as the oracle of omaha uses the concept of moats to describe his investment style according to buffett the type of company he wants to own is one with an established competitive advantage over others

governors in 25 us states have already eliminated or will soon begin eliminating pandemic related supplemental unemployment benefits depriving some four million jobless workers of 22 billion in additional assistance according to the century foundation the elimination of the 300 a week federal unemployment benefits began this past saturday in mississippi missouri iowa and alaska the other 21 states are set to remove the assistance by july 10 twenty one out of the 25 states including maryland texas and tennessee will be ending all pandemic related program such as pandemic unemployment assistance for gig workers and the pandemic emergency unemployment compensation program the states taking these drastic actions are led by republican governors the policy however is bipartisan last month president joe biden signaled his support for the ending of benefits by allowing the resumption of work search related requirements he also stated his support for letting federal unemployment benefits expire for the entire country on september 6 in less than three months this was followed by a statement from white house press secretary jen psaki on june 4 in which she stated that republican governors have every right to not accept the federal benefit adding that s ok in the capitalist press the move to eliminate unemployment support for millions of workers and their families has been described as an experiment nbc news declared on june 11 it s the beginning of a bold mass social and economic experiment to see if turning off federal unemployment benefits early for half the country will prod people in those states back to work this bold experiment will mean in practice throwing millions of people into poverty and destitution while facilitating the further spread of the coronavirus pandemic take for example mississippi where less than 29 percent of the population has been fully vaccinated and where roughly 70 000 unemployed workers were cut off from unemployment payments saturday nearly 15 percent of adults in mississippi surveyed by the us census bureau last month reported sometimes or often not having enough food to eat in the last seven days in addition nearly 37 percent of adults said it has been somewhat or very difficult to pay for usual household expenses in the last week the conditions in mississippi are repeated throughout the country the slashing of federal benefits will be catastrophic for jobless workers and their families many of whom are unable to find work for health reasons lack of child care or livable wages there are two interrelated motivations driving the cutoff of unemployment benefits first there is the imperative of the ruling class to get workers back on the job even as the pandemic continues to claim hundreds of lives every day and dangerous new strains such as the delta variant are spreading rapidly the ruling class with the biden administration at its head has proclaimed the pandemic over supplemental federal unemployment benefits of 600 a week were included in the cares act which was passed in late march 2020 the temporary assistance provided to those devastated by the economic impact of the pandemic was intended as a stopgap measure and a cover for the act s main purpose the multitrillion bailout of wall street once this massive handout to the rich became law the demands for workers to get back on the job began coupled with bipartisan denunciations of the 600 a week subsidy for creating a disincentive to work the program was allowed to expire in july 2020 and was later replaced under trump by a temporary program paying half as much 300 a week the 300 a week supplement was again extended in march of this year under biden providing benefits through september the unanimous agreement within the ruling class that all benefits must come to an end coincides with the biden administration s campaign to remove all remaining restrictions on the spread of the virus the decision by the centers for disease control and prevention to eliminate mask mandates and reduced social distancing guidelines last month has been followed by the release of the labor department s workplace safety guidelines that only apply to health care facilities the rest of the working class will be left defenseless at workplaces that will not be obligated by law to enact basic safety measures such as mandatory mask wearing social distancing or requirements to inform workers when they may have been exposed to the virus second the ruling class is concerned that the relative shortage of labor in some industries is contributing to rising wages the fed could be facing a jobs headache in its inflation fight wrote cnbc last week the longer it takes to get people back to work it declared the more employers will have to pay cnbc quotes ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics unfortunately we see good reasons to think that labor participation might not return quickly to its pre covid level whatever is happening here the fed needs large numbers of these people to return to the labor force in the fall behind the coded language is a ruthless class logic the ruling class wants to create pressure for lower wages by forcing millions of workers to accept poverty level jobs under dangerous conditions by cutting off unemployment benefits as for inflation the ruling class is not concerned with inflation in general but with demands by workers for increased wages in line with soaring costs of consumer goods this would cut into corporate profits over the past year there has been a massive inflation in prices of nearly every financial asset driven by the limitless infusion of money from the federal reserve into the stock markets this has produced a corresponding growth in the wealth of the oligarchy with the wealth of global billionaires skyrocketing from 8 trillion to 13 1 trillion just the increase in wealth for the oligarchy during this period is 227 times more than the cost of the federal unemployment benefits that are being cut off while there are daily articles bemoaning the fact that some jobless workers are able to survive on the meager benefits provided no one in the capitalist press is suggesting that the spigot to wall street be shut off this is an experiment that they are not interested in carrying out the ruling class s experiment with its homicidal herd immunity policy has led to the deaths of more than 600 000 people in the us now the cutoff of unemployment assistance will mean social devastation for millions in both cases the reality of capitalism and the consequences of the subordination of society to the interests of the financial oligarchy is exposed the cutoff of unemployment benefits will fuel mounting opposition in the working class the ongoing strikes of workers at volvo in virginia ati steelworkers in pennsylvania and massachusetts nurses are initial expressions of a developing explosion these struggles must be expanded and taken out of the hands of the corporatist trade unions which have worked systematically for decades to suppress working class opposition to the policies of the ruling elite the fight against the cutoff of unemployment benefits against herd immunity and against exploitation must be connected to a revolutionary movement of the working class in the us and internationally to expropriate the oligarchs establish public ownership of the giant banks and corporations and abolish the capitalist system

in germany during december 1922 the last straw that broke the back of the german economy was a forced loan of 10 of all your assets this destroyed the confidence that remained in the weimar republic and thereafter people withdrew the money from banks and started to convert to other currencies and to buy whatever tangible assets they could hyperinflation took off in 1923 history repeats because human nature remains the same in an interview with the hill of course it was a democrat from new york thomas suozzi who said he s in the early stages of looking at what he called a patriot tax which is really a wealth tax that he is proposing to impose as a one time surcharge of 2 5 on wealth between 50 million and 100 million and a 5 on wealth above 100 million this is not income this is on assets it will require full disclosure of all assets held globally with penalties of imprisonment and confiscation of assets if you lie note this is how they introduced the income tax in 1913 they always put the initial level above the average person in 1913 the average annual wage was about 1 500 making the income tax starting at 3 000 was to ensure the people would not worry about the rich they are doing this once again true i would not care if bill gates or george soros had to pay 5 of their gross worth but they throw that into their foundations which will not be taxed my real concern is once they push this through then it is one small step for the government to lower that to 1 million or 500 000 even if you own a home that is 1 million and you have an 800 000 mortgage you are taxed on the 1 million not the net still many people will say anyone with 1 million can afford to pay 5 but that includes all assets the value of your home or business he says they will give them 5 years to pay it why because this is on all gross assets that they will then appraise they can say your home is now worth 1 million despite the fact you paid 250 000 so you have to pay 5 of that 1 million gross as well we are talking about assets that not liquid meaning you then must sell things to pay the tax this is how they destroy farmers the inheritance tax forced the sale of land to pay the tax ultimately leading to big corporate farming so you wanted to know how to destroy an economy as fast as possible all you have to do is impose a wealth tax and watch what happens you can double your money in the stock market they want 5 to the total gross value they could easily tax you on the maximum value of bitcoin holdings during a given period do not count on any federal judge ruling in your favor that will never happen so this is just another nail in the coffin of the west and why china will emerge as the 1 world economy the left will destroy everything it always ends up that way that is neither my opinion nor a conspiracy theory it is just history the policies of the left are prohibited by the ten commandments not only does this violate the freedom of religion the same prohibition appears in other legal codes from ancient times proving that it was prohibited for good reason
