the message look at how unfair the american tax system has become the ultrarich are subject to different laws than everyone else but is that really the case propublica has published confidential tax data on the super rich apparently showing that they pay next to no income tax the unbelievable claim over the past decade the twenty five wealthiest americans paid tax at a total rate of 3 4 percent of their wealth their true tax rate this figure made headlines all around the world and you can be sure such efforts to expose the super rich for paying too little tax feed into and reinforce common prejudices but how does propublica arrive at its figure to capture the financial reality of the richest americans propublica undertook an analysis that has never been done before propublica compared how much in taxes the twenty five richest americans paid each year to how much forbes estimated their wealth grew in that same period we re going to call this their true tax rate the results are stark those twenty five people saw their worth rise a collective 401 billion from 2014 to 2018 according to forbes they paid a total of 13 6 billion in federal income taxes in those five years the irs data show that s a staggering sum but it amounts to a true tax rate of only 3 4 for warren buffett who has repeatedly advocated higher taxes on the rich propublica calculates a true tax rate of 0 1 percent propublica highlights the supposed discrepancy by comparing its figures for the super rich with those of the median american household earning 70 000 a year and paying 14 percent in federal taxes the message look at how unfair the american tax system has become the ultrarich are subject to different laws than everyone else but is that really the case let s say you own a house that increases in value from 1 million to 1 5 million within four years how much income tax do you have to pay on the increase in germany at least zero and that s how the system works in most countries a person doesn t have to pay income taxes on unrealized gains but on realized gains the same principle applies to stocks if stock prices go up but a person doesn t sell their stocks then they don t have to pay taxes a person only pays taxes when they sell their shares or their house i e when the unrealized gains become realized profits conversely if a person makes unrealized losses i e if the value of their house goes down then they don t get a refund from the tax authorities a person cannot claim these unrealized losses which only exist on paper to reduce their tax liability propublica has compared apples and oranges the growth in the worth of the twenty five richest americans estimated by forbes primarily derives from an increase in the value of their assets such as stocks and property jeff bezos s wealth for example has grown because the value of amazon stock increased warren buffett s fortune grew as the stock he holds in his company berkshire hathaway gained value propublica compares the increase in wealth which primarily derives from unrealized stock gains to income taxes which in contrast are levied on a very different tax base and this is not just on the super rich but on everyone or when was the last time the average person paid income taxes because their house was worth more on paper than it was a year earlier for propublica this so called true tax rate is evidence of loopholes for the ultrawealthy what would happen if the average person or the super rich had to pay income taxes on unrealized capital gains what would have happened in 2001 or 2008 2009 when share prices dropped off a cliff the state would have had to issue tax refunds to cover the substantial share price losses most journalists have not asked these critical questions because the fake figures fit their existing prejudices about the rich rainer zitelmann is the author of the rich in public opinion image reuters
if rep liz cheney loses in a gop primary in 2022 her successor s road to victory will likely have begun at a candidate s forum held by a qanon curious florida activist who calls himself a massive disrupter with titanium balls earlier this june six of the seven republicans currently vying to unseat cheney convened in a ballroom at the ramkota hotel in casper wyoming for their first chance to stand out since cheney s vote to impeach the former president in january kicked off a fervent effort among pro trump wyomingites to kick her out of congress k w miller the aforementioned disrupter behind the forum s organizing group america first pc not to be confused with america first action pac came to the podium and declared that wyoming is ground zero for the effort to take back the republican party from so called rinos and leftists gesturing to the long table where the candidates sat miller proclaimed one of these individuals is going to be your new representative advertisement advertisement that very well could be the case the ensuing two hours made clear that wyoming s next representative won t just be different from cheney they ll be from an entirely different political universe during miller s forum the six candidates onstage didn t just castigate cheney for calling out trump s unfounded claims about the election he lost or just enthusiastically embrace those claims themselves they bragged about being in washington for the jan 6 riot they endorsed nationwide audits of the 2020 election including in wyoming which posted trump s largest margin of victory anywhere in the country and they flirted with leading threads of the qanon conspiracy theory wyoming s gop congressional hopefuls run the full gamut of experience poise and polish some are total newcomers who ve never held or campaigned for office some are state lawmakers and party officials but all are exactly the same when it comes to the most important qualification in today s republican party unswerving personal devotion to trump advertisement advertisement trump did win and i hope he will be reinstated by all these different audits that are going on said robyn belinskey one candidate who appeared at the forum he never what do you call it dang it he never conceded house republicans cancel liz cheney for her refusal to lie another candidate bryan miller said only one endorsement in the race mattered above the voters of wyoming the gentleman whose name is on this hat he said holding up a red maga cap he is the leader of the republican party every challenger is angling for trump s endorsement which is expected to come in this race the former president has railed against cheney ever since her vote to impeach him in january and is reportedly itching to exact revenge the congresswoman meanwhile has already been booted from her post as the third ranking house republican over her refusal to accommodate trump and his election conspiracies advertisement advertisement public enemy no 1 of the maga movement is a precarious place to be in wyoming a state that went for trump by 43 points and the truckload of trump loving candidates are hoping to capitalize on the backlash similar dynamics are playing out in other districts and states where gop officials broke with the ex president but few gop primaries in 2022 will be more symbolically weighty than cheney s and judging by the june 12 forum in casper the first big event of the contest few will be as full of maga movement red meat and trumpian posturing as this one the field of would be cheney vanquishers includes belinskey a paralegal miller chair of the sheridan county gop denton knapp a retired u s army colonel marissa selvig a former mayor and current kombucha purveyor chuck gray a state representative and darin smith a conservative activist who ran in a primary for this seat when it was open in 2016 the only challenger not to appear at the casper forum was anthony bouchard a gop state senator he was the earliest cheney challenger and he calls himself the real america first candidate he also claims to have raised more than 500 000 so far recently he appeared at a florida rally alongside rep marjorie taylor greene r ga and was a guest at the anti cheney rally that rep matt gaetz r fl held in cheyenne in february advertisement advertisement but bouchard has mostly made headlines for admitting that he impregnated a 14 year old girl when he was 18 years old comparing it to the romeo and juliet story miller said cheney was invited too but didn t show both absent candidates were booed by the crowd the introductions in casper were colorful smith a maga trump republican used his time to air a laundry list of grievances straight from fox news critical race theory vaccine passports and the new york times 1619 project to name a few belinskey spoke about her patriot car and recounted a story about telling a pakistani man who found her car offensive to go back to his country afterward the candidates took questions from miller and the audience the first question from a member of the crowd will you fight child sex trafficking and pedophilia and introduce legislation to criminalize it with stiff prison terms was an overt nod to qanon which theorizes that a global elite of devil worshipping pedophiles run the world all of the candidates answered that yes they would fight hard against sex trafficking and pedophilia though only one noted these activities are already illegal the audience also grilled the candidates on whether they back voter reform and audits of the 2020 election like the unofficial haphazardly run ballot audit currently unfolding in arizona that has become a focus for trump backers still hoping he could return to power advertisement advertisement republicans now want to audit election results in states that trump won candidates attempted to outdo each other in demonstrating their enthusiasm for the plainly false notion that trump actually won in 2020 it s interesting what s going on in arizona selvig said and i can t wait to see what the results are gray argued that an audit is needed in wyoming of all places an argument that reflects a nationwide trend on the right to support audits even in safely republican states there was massive fraud in this election said smith who brought up no actual evidence to support that dubious claim that s why i was at the capitol on jan 6 to protest for free and fair elections because we didn t get one one of the first questions in the forum was about whether the candidates would support designating black lives matter antifa or other left wing organizations as official terrorist groups all of them answered in the affirmative and brought up stock talking points about marxism and arguments that cheney was in league with leftists advertisement advertisement some went even further using the question to riff on topics such as the investigation into trump s ties with russia we need to prosecute people within the government who used government resources to attempt to overthrow our president said miller to rousing applause from the crowd there were a few relatively normal questions about how the candidates would represent wyoming whether they supported a new nuclear power plant in the state and whether they would support u s military interventions abroad that last question was an opportunity to tee off on cheney s hawkish views and those of her father former vice president dick cheney bush and cheney what they did to go into the middle east they were smoking crack to think they could put a democracy in the middle of that islamic nation said smith the irony of the forum s rollicking opening music toby keith s jingoistic post 9 11 anthem courtesy of the red white and blue seemed to be lost on everyone involved advertisement advertisement miller moderating the event was about as revealing as the candidates themselves how he got into the position of hosting the first major candidate forum in one of the country s most closely watched primaries is not exactly clear but the chair of the wyoming gop frank eathorne gave the event his blessing and took a photo with miller there eathorne who has previously endorsed the idea that wyoming secede from the union presided over the party s successful censure of cheney after her vote to impeach trump a native of south florida miller first came to political notoriety by challenging rep brian mast r fl in 2020 charging that the 40 year old iraq veteran and double amputee was a liberal rino and not a true conservative mast who has a 74 percent lifetime rating from the conservative heritage foundation voted not to certify biden s electoral college victory on jan 6 during his bizarre bid for office miller went viral by tweeting that black lives matter was an excuse for white women to fornicate with black men and alleged that beyonce was a satanist his campaign was also laced with qanon nods he relentlessly called mast a pedophile after old social media comments from mast surfaced in which he joked about sex with 15 year olds being permissible abroad miller s campaign insisted he didn t subscribe to the conspiracy theory but instead just wanted to appeal to its adherents it didn t matter however in november miller drew 2 2 percent of the vote to mast s 56 percent advertisement advertisement now in wyoming miller is reprising the qanon flavored rhetoric especially on bouchard who miller said should withdraw from the race because of his admission that he impregnated a minor we have no knowledge no affiliation and no interest in qannon or any other groups said miller when reached by email we are a conservative republican platform the real reason liz cheney had to go after his failed campaign in florida miller threw his energy into his facebook page where he broadcasts all caps posts and videos of him talking or addressing the nation to his 13 000 followers in these posts miller airs apocalyptic visions of the struggle for the country broadcasts his support for trump and boasts of having those titanium balls advertisement advertisement my encrypted phone is lighting up with message from world leaders reads one post from the spring summary lock kamila harris in a box for next 4 years it s unclear how miller s organization america first pc is organized or what its exact goals are beyond purging the republican party of all rinos it is not registered with the federal election commission meaning it cannot raise or spend money to influence elections and it is not affiliated with a set of organizations with conspicuously similar names like america first action pac the official super pac of trumpworld miller said his group is independent by design from other political groups we do not raise outside money to avoid any conflicts of interest what is clear is that after jan 6 miller through america first pc identified cheney as a target for whatever its future activities would be america first has announced it s 1 primary target for 2022 read a post from feb 27 liberal rino liz cheny less than four months later miller was in casper playing kingmaker in the primary he declared that his group would endorse a candidate in wyoming in the near future and that it will most likely coincide with an endorsement by president trump a spokesperson for trump s official political organization did not respond to a question about the extent of their relationship if any with miller and america first pc whoever gets trump s blessing will immediately become the leader of the pack of challengers in wyoming but it doesn t seem his word will clear the field at the forum all the candidates were asked if they would withdraw if they didn t get trump s endorsement two of them said no or were noncommittal that was probably music to cheney s ears she is treating this like a serious race bringing in major names from the gop establishment to fundraise for her like former speaker paul ryan in the first three months of 2021 she pulled in over 1 5 million and she has been criss crossing the state on official business and keeping a frenetic pace of interviews with local media outlets but cheney will need all the momentum she can get even if her challengers are split at the forum in casper miller ruefully acknowledged that a cheney win would be a bad sign for the maga movement if we can t remove liz cheney from congress miller told the crowd i m not sure what state we can win read more at the daily beast got a tip

propublica s investigation released tuesday revealing that the top 25 wealthiest americans have paid little and sometimes nothing in federal income taxes has resulted in demands to rewrite the tax code and to investigate how the confidential data was released congressional democrats called for legislation to force the rich to pay more at a hearing tuesday sen ron wyden d ore chairman of the senate finance committee said the country s wealthiest who profited immensely during the pandemic have not been paying their fair share he said he was preparing proposed reforms but did not share details sen elizabeth warren d mass tweeted that propublica s findings underscored the importance of instituting a wealth tax a reform she has long pushed that would tax net worth not just income like salaries and capital gains which the wealthiest largely avoid paying sen bernie sanders i vt said the story showed the rich have money the rich have power the rich have lobbyists and the rich do not pay their fair share of taxes the white house echoed those concerns we know that there is more to be done to ensure that corporations individuals who are at the highest income are paying more of their fair share jen psaki the white house press secretary said at a briefing at the same time the white house administration officials and members of congress on both sides of the aisle expressed alarm over how the trove of confidential tax data was obtained by propublica irs commissioner charles rettig said at a hearing tuesday that there is an investigation with respect to the allegations that the source of the information in that article came from the internal revenue service the investigators will investigate he said a treasury department spokesperson told reporters the unauthorized disclosure of confidential government information is illegal and said the matter had been referred to the fbi federal prosecutors in washington the treasury s inspector general and the irs inspector general during a hearing wednesday sen susan collins r maine raised concerns about the leak with attorney general merrick garland saying these highly confidential personal documents were obtained illegally collins seemed to compare the release of the tax data to abuses perpetrated during the nixon administration garland responded i very well remember what president nixon did in the watergate period the creation of enemies lists and the punishment of people through reviewing their tax returns he added that the leak was an extremely serious matter garland said he knew nothing about the origin of the leak except what he had read in the propublica story which he was astonished by he said he expected the irs would be referring the matter to the justice department this was on my list of things to raise after i finished preparing for this hearing he said i promise you it will be at the top of my list sen mike crapo r idaho the top republican on the finance committee said during an earlier hearing that the leak raised questions about the white house s proposals to crack down on tax avoidance by requiring banks and other financial institutions to share more financial data about individuals and companies with the irs we re seeing information today that appears to be 15 years worth of leaked confidential individual tax data from the irs he said sen steve daines r mont warned this violation of individual privacy and confidentiality could easily happen to ordinary americans and small businesses some commentators expressed concerns that the breach could chill the irs willingness to continue sharing anonymized data with academics and other researchers the wall street journal s editorial board suggested the confidential data was released to support the biden administration s proposals to raise taxes the timing here is no coincidence comrade propublica does not know who the source of the information is and it has not commented on when the data was obtained the revelations from the ongoing propublica investigation have already sparked a conversation about the fairness of the u s tax code which largely favors people who own businesses or huge quantities

vienna top diplomats said sunday that further progress had been made at talks between iran and global powers to try to restore a landmark 2015 agreement to contain iranian nuclear development that was abandoned by the trump administration they said it was now up to the governments involved in the negotiations to make political decisions it was the first official meeting since iran s hard line judiciary chief won a landslide victory in the country s presidential election last week some diplomats expressed concern that iran s election of ebrahim raisi as president could complicate a possible return to the nuclear agreement enrique mora the european union official who chaired the final meeting of the sixth round of talks between russia china germany france britain and iran told reporters that we are closer to a deal but we are not still there we have made progress on a number of technical issues mora added we have now more clarity on technical documents all of them quite complex and that clarity allows us to have also a great idea of what the political problems are he did not elaborate advertisement top russian representative mikhail ulyanov said the members of the joint comprehensive plan of action or jcpoa took stock of the significant progress made at the vienna talks including at the sixth round and decided to make a break to allow participants to consult with their capitals in preparation for what is supposed to be the final round of negotiations there are a few controversial points which require political decisions apparently diplomatic efforts to find common language have been almost fully exhausted so the time has come for political decisions ulyanov added the nations involved in the negotiations have been trying to resolve the major outstanding issues on how to return the u s into the landmark agreement which then u s president donald trump pulled washington out of unilaterally in 2018 trump also restored and augmented sanctions to try to force iran into renegotiating the pact with more concessions ulyanov said after heading back to report on the talks results to their respective governments he expected the diplomats to return for the final round of talks in vienna in about 10 days and said they could finalize negotiations by mid july i believe we have all chances to arrive at the final point of our negotiations maybe even by mid july unless something extraordinary and negative happens he said in a written statement after the talks sunday the e3 european senior diplomats urged speedy decision making in the capitals involved in

agreement documents are ready according to semi official iranian news agency mehr of the main issues that remain disputed some have been resolved and some remain but it has taken on a very precise form and it is quite clear what the dimensions of these disputes are seyyed abbas araghchi said the u s did not have a representative at the table in vienna however president biden s administration has signaled willingness to rejoin the iran deal under terms that would broadly see the united states scale back sanctions and iran return to its 2015 nuclear commitments a u s delegation in vienna is taking part in indirect talks with iran with diplomats from the other world powers acting as go betweens sunday s meeting was overshadowed by the election of raisi in iran which puts hard liners firmly in control of the government at a time when tehran is enriching uranium at its highest levels ever though still short of weapons grade levels tensions remain high with iran and both the u s and israel which is believed to have carried out a series of attacks targeting iranian nuclear sites as well as assassinating the scientist who created its military atomic program decades earlier raisi is the first iranian president sanctioned by the u s government even before entering office over his involvement in the 1988 mass executions as well as his time as the head of iran s internationally criticized judiciary one of the world s top executioners advertisement in jerusalem new israeli prime minister naftali bennett warned sunday that raisi s election as iranian president was the last chance for the world powers to wake up before returning to the nuclear agreement and to understand who they re doing business with these guys are murderers mass murderers a regime of brutal hangmen must never be allowed to have weapons of mass destruction that will enable it to not kill thousands but millions he said israel has long stated that it opposes arch enemy iran s nuclear program and said it would prevent tehran from obtaining nuclear weapons iran insists its nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes the european union s foreign policy chief josep borrell said sunday he hoped the election of the new iranian president would not be an obstacle to reaching a deal in vienna we are very close we have been working for two months borrell told reporters during a visit in the lebanese capital of beirut so i hope that the results of the elections is not going to be the last obstacle that will ruin the negotiation process send questions comments to the editors

responsibility in our hearts and puts community at the center of everything we do peng added sense photonics develops wider field of view sense photonics the world s leading automotive flash lidar solutions provider announced they have developed a system which delivers high resolution long range capability and a mid range capability with a wider field of view fov simultaneously in a single shot using a single sensor sense s new multirange capability allows a vehicle to detect the road profile road debris and lane markings at long distances and also detect traffic in adjacent lanes without requiring multiple sensor heads a comprehensive lidar solution in vehicles must be able to detect objects up to 200 meters directly ahead while also being aware of cars changing lanes within 50 meters in front of the vehicle explained hod finkelstein sense s cto legacy lidar systems can either deliver long range capabilities with fine angular resolution or mid range imaging with a broad field of view thus requiring oems to integrate multiple systems in the vehicle for complete coverage these legacy solutions increase the overall system cost complexity and power consumption with our unique flash architecture we can deliver multiple fields of view with stunning clarity efficiently and without data gaps with a single sensor a capability we call multirange stated finkelstein sense has been able to accomplish multirange performance by a combination of its proprietary vcsel laser array which houses tens of thousands of lasers on a single substrate paired with its proprietary cmos spad silicon receiver which can detect single photon level detail with every return similar to a car s headlights sense s emitter technology uses a diffused beam to simultaneously illuminate the entire fov global shutter acquisition allows for a consistently high resolution point cloud across the fov without motion artifacts multirange capability is currently being tested by leading automotive oems and autonomous vehicle solutions providers automotive companies expect high performance systems but at a price that will scale stated sense ceo shauna mcintyre by delivering ultra high resolution point clouds across multiple fields of view with a single sensor we allow companies a comprehensive solution for both short and long range sensor needs at a fraction of the cost explained mcintyre hprobe

kings world news introduction unknown the fomc s problem fred the liquidity problem was foreseeable interest rates should be rising unknown we can expect the deterioration to be sudden and very public that appears to describe the cliff edge upon which we now sit the collapse of a currency is always unexpected by its users and when it happens can be swift alasdair macleod yesterday the fomc released its june statement which only served to remind us that its members are powerless in the face of inflationary conditions they refuse to accept the price consequences of monetary inflation still clinging on to an increasingly untenable hope that price rises are transitory the fact of the matter is thatin the us the fed s 120bn monthly qe continues to goose financial asset values while the us government has spent a further trillion into circulation from its general account at the fed which is why the fed has increased its outstanding reverse repos to 721bn interest rates will have to increase far earlier than the fed admits to stop foreigners dumping dollars not just for commodities which have nearly doubled since march 2020 but for other currencies as well whipped up by american and british neo keynesian policy makers who are now increasingly cornered by their own monetary fallacies courtesy of the central banks we used to be most aware of the bank of japan s extraordinary money printing to corner the japanese etf market but that is no longer a topic of conversation the bank of japan now owns about 48 trillion invested in etfs 447bn the most aggressive money printing stock ramp in the style of john law and his mississippi bubble relative to the size of the market in modern times but today s monetary planners have dismissed empirical evidence of any dangers as pre keynesian and therefore irrelevant anyone who hoped that the inflationary response to the financial crisis of 2008 09 was to be just a one off event will have been sadly disillusioned and anyone who thought that china or japan with their money were the most irresponsible nations a common perception not long ago would have got that wrong as well even the ecb looks relatively moderate compared with the british and americans of course as well as the expansion of central bank balance sheets there are other factors in monetary policy which we can with justification label as inflationary but it is interesting that the bank of england s chief economist has chosen this summer to leave the bank deciding at the same time to no longer toe the official line about rising prices while some of his colleagues on the monetary policy committee have only recently been rooting for negative interest rates and from the governor down are now claiming that increasing prices are only temporary and one wonders why sterling is not weakening with the dollar given the bank of england s solidarity with the fed in terms of common monetary policies the message from figure 1 is that sterling which rallied from 1 15 on the back of dollar weakness to 1 41 currently should not have rallied much at all particularly as the perceived value of the brexit dividend is being superseded by the economic effects of covid and its extended lockdowns evidenced by the launch of a 1 trillion covid stimulus package this week the destruction being wrought by the ecb is economic as well as monetary with even bankrupt italy sporting a sub 1 ten year government bond yield we all know or should know don t be surprised if productive businesses get none of it and presumably without the bundesbank s monetary conservativism the ecb would be issuing even more euros the expansion of the pboc s balance sheet has been the smallest in percentage terms by a long way its government debt to gdp ratio is the lowest by degrees of magnitude and the pboc s policy planners have been putting the brakes on credit expansion for the best part of a year this suggests thatseeking to escape from the declining currencies of the more profligate nations we should bear china s different approach in mind because the geopolitical consequences of a stronger yen becoming attractive for international capital flows will lead to an obvious contrast between the while the chinese enjoy an improving standard of living furthermore unless americans suddenly decide to decrease their spending and increase their savings china s trade surplus with the us will continue to increase despite the slowing monetary growth reflected in gdp numbers the chinese appear to be in a far stronger position than their western counterparts both economically and monetarily the consequences of monetary expansion everywhere arereflecting the loss of purchasing power for diluting national currencies so far use of tightly controlled consumer price indices to hide the evidence has concealed the true extent of rising prices providing goal sought answers of approximately two per cent all round but so formidable has the monetary dilution since covid lockdowns become that the reality of rising prices for essentials such as food and energy is becoming all to obvious andin figure 1 above leading the charge is the us dollar which should worry us all because it is everyone else s reserve currency and while similar statements emanate from the bank of england s monetary policy committee it is those of the fed s fomc which met this week that always have global significance the fed s money printing has continued apace so much so thateven for those with badly impaired economic vision as the us economy is re opening following the easing of covid restrictions policy planners expected there to be increased demand for money reflecting the ramping up of consumer goods production to meet demand and therefore of the necessary working capital but looking at bank credit to non financials loans and leases in the fed s h 8 table there is no evidence this is happening so far the banks do not appear to be keen to lend or perhaps their customers to borrow as shown in the st louis fred s chart below as figure 1 illustrates which dates from before the central banks first introduction of extraordinary measures following the lehman crisis loans and leases saw an increase ahead of lockdown when banks recognised that they must bridge their customers cash flow or risk driving them into non performing territory unsold inventory was stacking up which over the last year has gradually been cleared leaving little or no product on the shelves while reducing the need for working capital which it did and still does by goosing financial markets withfor the fed it is vital that market confidence remains intact and an unprecedented monthly qe injection had this objective in mind with bond markets underwritten by the fed s bond buying through qe the us treasury was able to raise large quantities of money through bond sales in anticipation of an unprecedented level of unfunded spending who show little sympathy with supply side economics instead after decades of perfecting just in time production methods businesses have been faced with a lethal combination of continuing supply chain disruptions higher commodity and raw material prices and a labour force that appears reluctant to return to work the assumption that stimulation of consumption would trigger an automatic rebound in supply of products and servicesif the banks have been cautious in their lending it was with good reason and it is hardly surprising that loans and leases in bank credit have failed to increase whether it is the banks worried about risk or in these conditions businesses seeing no reason to demand more working capital without the production capacity to deploy it is a moot point for consumers it is rather like getting dressed to the nines to attend a ball only to find there s no one to dance with in the american financial system which explains why in recent weeks bond yields have fallen and a feeling of deflationary conditions has emerged it explains a mystery unfathomed by some commentators who only look at the collateral side of reverse repos the reason outstanding reverse repos have hit a record of 721bn is not due to insufficient collateral in the banking system and making the situation worse instead of raising money through bond sales technically putting money into circulation which was not there before since last october and at the same time all this excess liquidity with a banking system constrained by lack of balance sheet capacity threatens that market interest rates would turn negative if market rates went negative money market funds would almost certainly break the buck leading to a crisis at the heart of the financial system for this 4 5 trillion market whose investors have been led to understand that their funds are safe in yesterday s fomc statement it is little wonder that the fed has had to claw some of this liquidity back for fear of driving interest rates into negative territory this situation was foreshadowed in a goldmoney article last february when i pointed out that there was a risk these events would lead toparticularly if the fed did not extend the temporary suspension of the supplementary leverage ratio and increase the counterparty limit of 30bn on its reverse repo facility back in february and in the following month at the quarter end we were able to see these conditions evolving the difference for the fed at least was their blindness to supply side issues and that price inflation would rapidly accelerate beyond the bounds of statistical control and with independent analysts such as john williams at shadowstats comthe distortion in financial markets awash with excess liquidity at zero interest rates is increasingly destabilising the question for the fed now is thatif they taper the stock market will almost certainly crash undermining the fed s cherished policy of using the stock market to keep everyone optimistic if they take the lead in raising interest rates that goes against keynesian religion and is simply beyond contemplation the signal being received by the policy planners from the apparent lack of demand for money is that an argument they are likely to milk for all its worth the idea that there is too much money in the system rarely occurs to them but with m1 money supply standing at 19 trillion in a 20 trillion economy admittedly the statisticians bolstered m1 last february by shifting most of m2 into it but thethere is a latency in its absorption which means that the liquidity bulge is only temporary before markets adjust for it because in the absence of an increase in savingsthere seems to be confusion in the minds of macroeconomists on this issue at a time when the purchasing power of the dollar is set to fall establishment thinking in the markets appears to be signalling a decline in economic activity consistent with deflationary conditions that being the case the issue as often is the case is defining deflation if it exists and that is open to question it implies a contraction in the total quantity of money and credit and the consequences that follow which is not the condition that is faced and we can reasonably assume that any further tendency for bank credit to non financial borrowers to contract will be more than countered by increases in fiscal deficits financed by monetary expansion for the state to become the motor driving the economy when free markets are deemed to fail is basic keynesian philosophy meanwhile as if to drive the deflation argument home recently we have seen a steadying in the dollar s trade weighted index of over 2 above recent lows yesterday the twi rose 0 75 and a recent fall in bond yields figure 2 charts the 10 year us treasury bond yield and figure 3 shows the dollar s twi no doubt the fed and fed watchers are closely following these charts for them it is probably comforting that the markets do not appear to take an inflation threat as seriously as the few independent commentators who have warned that interest rates will be forced to rise later this year andeither for other currencies or for real assets such as the commodities and raw materials used in the course of production this phenomenon is already visible in commodity prices as figure 4 clearly illustrates the fact that the dollar has only declined by about 13 7 against the euro the largest component of its twi indicates that the euro has also lost purchasing power though not to the same extent as the dollar for the fed to claim that inflation is merely transitory is either being disingenuous or ignorant of the theories of exchange it matters not which the fed is already judged guilty in the court of commodity markets it is hard to see how it will not similarly be judged by other forms of evidence being the broader consequences of inflationary monetary policies with foreign ownership of dollar denominated financial assets and cash deposits at 30 trillion triffin described the situation where the issuer of a reserve currency has to deploy ultimately destructive inflationary policies to supply the world s demand for it until a currency crisis inevitably leads to its ultimate rejection the last such crisis was also ahead of a period of escalating dollar inflation commencing with the failure of the london gold pool in the late 1960s followed by the abandonment of the bretton woods agreement in august 1971 and the roaring price inflation of the 1970s decade than the failure of the london gold pool and the ending of bretton woods therefore when triffin s downside for the dollar materialises this time monetarists who understand as milton friedman put it that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon have just half the story their understanding is that the relationship between money and subsequent prices is essentially mechanistic it is not as the following well documented example attests between april 1919 and march 1923 the german government s cumulative increase in debt i e the difference between revenues and spending financed by a mixture of savings and monetary inflation measured in gold marks was an increase of 203 yet the unbacked paper marks in circulation increased 207 times over the same timescale and itsso an increase in the cumulative mostly inflation financed government spending of 203 had a disproportionately destabilising effect on the currency only then did the final collapse in the paper mark begin this was what the austrian economist von mises termed the crack up boom the phenomenon whereby the general public finally realising that the state s paper currency was never going to stabilise finally dumped it for anything needed or not the lesson from this and many other sorry tales involving state issued currencies backed by nothing more than a dwindling faith in the issuer is thatif john williams at shadowstats is right and undoubtedly he is then a fall in the dollar s purchasing power currently annualised at over 11 will require a suitable interest rate to compensate foreign holders but even a move of less than half that will take out over indebted corporations and force the us government to accept cuts in spending that it is simply not prepared to make its advisers are keynesian to a man or woman they long ago dismissed classical economic theory and offer no solutions only more bad advice in order to stabilise stock markets fund the government s ballooning debt and to subsidise industrial production they are even likely to opine that a lower dollar stimulates economic activity and perhaps that price controls should be introduced along with dollar denominated assets being sold by foreigners the currency is set to continue its collapse as we might have seen with the resignation of the bank of england s chief economist unpalatable truths will continue to be rejected and as the purchasing power of the currency declines public demand for it will increase not because it is wanted per se but because its purchasing power is declining faster than it is being pushed into circulation and more is required to cover even diminishing real levels of spending this is what kept the printing pressings working 24 7 in germany in 1923 what took place between may and november 1923 when the paper mark finally hit the wall

if rep liz cheney loses in a gop primary in 2022 her successor s road to victory will likely have begun at a candidate s forum held by a qanon curious florida activist who calls himself a massive disrupter with titanium balls earlier this june six of the seven republicans currently vying to unseat cheney convened in a ballroom at the ramkota hotel in casper wyoming for their first chance to stand out since cheney s vote to impeach the former president in january kicked off a fervent effort among pro trump wyomingites to kick her out of congress k w miller the aforementioned disrupter behind the forum s organizing group america first pc not to be confused with america first action pac came to the podium and declared that wyoming is ground zero for the effort to take back the republican party from so called rinos and leftists gesturing to the long table where the candidates sat miller proclaimed one of these individuals is going to be your new representative that very well could be the case the ensuing two hours made clear that wyoming s next representative won t just be different from cheney they ll be from an entirely different political universe during miller s forum the six candidates onstage didn t just castigate cheney for calling out trump s unfounded claims about the election he lost or just enthusiastically embrace those claims themselves they bragged about being in washington for the jan 6 riot they endorsed nationwide audits of the 2020 election including in wyoming which posted trump s largest margin of victory anywhere in the country and they flirted with leading threads of the qanon conspiracy theory there was massive fraud in this election that s why i was at the capitol on jan 6 to protest for free and fair elections because we didn t get one darin smith conservative activist running for wyoming s congressional seat wyoming s gop congressional hopefuls run the full gamut of experience poise and polish some are total newcomers who ve never held or campaigned for office some are state lawmakers and party officials but all are exactly the same when it comes to the most important qualification in today s republican party unswerving personal devotion to trump trump did win and i hope he will be reinstated by all these different audits that are going on said robyn belinskey one candidate who appeared at the forum he never what do you call it dang it he never conceded another candidate bryan miller said only one endorsement in the race mattered above the voters of wyoming the gentleman whose name is on this hat he said holding up a red maga cap he is the leader of the republican party every challenger is angling for trump s endorsement which is expected to come in this race the former president has railed against cheney ever since her vote to impeach him in january and is reportedly itching to exact revenge the congresswoman meanwhile has already been booted from her post as the third ranking house republican over her refusal to accommodate trump and his election conspiracies public enemy no 1 of the maga movement is a precarious place to be in wyoming a state that went for trump by 43 points and the truckload of trump loving candidates are hoping to capitalize on the backlash similar dynamics are playing out in other districts and states where gop officials broke with the ex president but few gop primaries in 2022 will be more symbolically weighty than cheney s and judging by the june 12 forum in casper the first big event of the contest few will be as full of maga movement red meat and trumpian posturing as this one the field of would be cheney vanquishers includes belinskey a paralegal miller chair of the sheridan county gop denton knapp a retired u s army colonel marissa selvig a former mayor and current kombucha purveyor chuck gray a state representative and darin smith a conservative activist who ran in a primary for this seat when it was open in 2016 the only challenger not to appear at the casper forum was anthony bouchard a gop state senator he was the earliest cheney challenger and he calls himself the real america first candidate he also claims to have raised more than 500 000 so far recently he appeared at a florida rally alongside rep marjorie taylor greene r ga and was a guest at the anti cheney rally that rep matt gaetz r fl held in cheyenne in february but bouchard has mostly made headlines for admitting that he impregnated a 14 year old girl when he was 18 years old comparing it to the romeo and juliet story miller said cheney was invited too but didn t show both absent candidates were booed by the crowd they were smoking crack to think they could put a democracy in the middle of that islamic nation darin smith the introductions in casper were colorful smith a maga trump republican used his time to air a laundry list of grievances straight from fox news critical race theory vaccine passports and the new york times 1619 project to name a few belinskey spoke about her patriot car and recounted a story about telling a pakistani man who found her car offensive to go back to his country afterward the candidates took questions from miller and the audience the first question from a member of the crowd will you fight child sex trafficking and pedophilia and introduce legislation to criminalize it with stiff prison terms was an overt nod to qanon which theorizes that a global elite of devil worshipping pedophiles run the world all of the candidates answered that yes they would fight hard against sex trafficking and pedophilia though only one noted these activities are already illegal the audience also grilled the candidates on whether they back voter reform and audits of the 2020 election like the unofficial haphazardly run ballot audit currently unfolding in arizona that has become a focus for trump backers still hoping he could return to power candidates attempted to outdo each other in demonstrating their enthusiasm for the plainly false notion that trump actually won in 2020 it s interesting what s going on in arizona selvig said and i can t wait to see what the results are gray argued that an audit is needed in wyoming of all places an argument that reflects a nationwide trend on the right to support audits even in safely republican states there was massive fraud in this election said smith who brought up no actual evidence to support that dubious claim that s why i was at the capitol on jan 6 to protest for free and fair elections because we didn t get one one of the first questions in the forum was about whether the candidates would support designating black lives matter antifa or other left wing organizations as official terrorist groups all of them answered in the affirmative and brought up stock talking points about marxism and arguments that cheney was in league with leftists some went even further using the question to riff on topics such as the investigation into trump s ties with russia we need to prosecute people within the government who used government resources to attempt to overthrow our president said miller to rousing applause from the crowd there were a few relatively normal questions about how the candidates would represent wyoming whether they supported a new nuclear power plant in the state and whether they would support u s military interventions abroad if we can t remove liz cheney from congress i m not sure what state we can win k w miller that last question was an opportunity to tee off on cheney s hawkish views and those of her father former vice president dick cheney bush and cheney what they did to go into the middle east they were smoking crack to think they could put a democracy in the middle of that islamic nation said smith the irony of the forum s rollicking opening music toby keith s jingoistic post 9 11 anthem courtesy of the red white and blue seemed to be lost on everyone involved miller moderating the event was about as revealing as the candidates themselves how he got into the position of hosting the first major candidate forum in one of the country s most closely watched primaries is not exactly clear but the chair of the wyoming gop frank eathorne gave the event his blessing and took a photo with miller there eathorne who has previously endorsed the idea that wyoming secede from the union presided over the party s successful censure of cheney after her vote to impeach trump a native of south florida miller first came to political notoriety by challenging rep brian mast r fl in 2020 charging that the 40 year old iraq veteran and double amputee was a liberal rino and not a true conservative mast who has a 74 percent lifetime rating from the conservative heritage foundation voted not to certify biden s electoral college victory on jan 6 during his bizarre bid for office miller went viral by tweeting that black lives matter was an excuse for white women to fornicate with black men and alleged that beyonce was a satanist his campaign was also laced with qanon nods he relentlessly called mast a pedophile after old social media comments from mast surfaced in which he joked about sex with 15 year olds being permissible abroad miller s campaign insisted he didn t subscribe to the conspiracy theory but instead just wanted to appeal to its adherents it didn t matter however in november miller drew 2 2 percent of the vote to mast s 56 percent now in wyoming miller is reprising the qanon flavored rhetoric especially on bouchard who miller said should withdraw from the race because of his admission that he impregnated a minor we have no knowledge no affiliation and no interest in qannon or any other groups said miller when reached by email we are a conservative republican platform after his failed campaign in florida miller threw his energy into his facebook page where he broadcasts all caps posts and videos of him talking or addressing the nation to his 13 000 followers in these posts miller airs apocalyptic visions of the struggle for the country broadcasts his support for trump and boasts of having those titanium balls my encrypted phone is lighting up with message from world leaders reads one post from the spring summary lock kamila harris in a box for next 4 years it s unclear how miller s organization america first pc is organized or what its exact goals are beyond purging the republican party of all rinos it is not registered with the federal election commission meaning it cannot raise or spend money to influence elections and it is not affiliated with a set of organizations with conspicuously similar names like america first action pac the official super pac of trumpworld miller said his group is independent by design from other political groups we do not raise outside money to avoid any conflicts of interest what is clear is that after jan 6 miller through america first pc identified cheney as a target for whatever its future activities would be america first has announced it s 1 primary target for 2022 read a post from feb 27 liberal rino liz cheny less than four months later miller was in casper playing kingmaker in the primary he declared that his group would endorse a candidate in wyoming in the near future and that it will most likely coincide with an endorsement by president trump a spokesperson for trump s official political organization did not respond to a question about the extent of their relationship if any with miller and america first pc whoever gets trump s blessing will immediately become the leader of the pack of challengers in wyoming but it doesn t seem his word will clear the field at the forum all the candidates were asked if they would withdraw if they didn t get trump s endorsement two of them said no or were noncommittal that was probably music to cheney s ears she is treating this like a serious race bringing in major names from the gop establishment to fundraise for her like former speaker paul ryan in the first three months of 2021 she pulled in over 1 5 million and she has been criss crossing the state on official business and keeping a frenetic pace of interviews with local media outlets but cheney will need all the momentum she can get even if her challengers are split at the forum in casper miller ruefully acknowledged that a cheney win would be a bad sign for the maga movement if we can t remove liz cheney from congress miller told the crowd i m not sure what state we can win

for seven months most investors have been singing the same uplifting song since pfizer and biontech published the successful results of trials of their covid 19 vaccine last november the way to make money in markets has been to bet on a roaring rebound in the global economy as pent up demand for all the things the pandemic denied people holidays dining out shopping was unleashed this reflation trade lifted the prices of commodities used in construction such as copper and lumber to record heights it lifted global stocks especially the share prices of firms hardest hit by the pandemic such as cruise operators and retailers the currencies of emerging economies which tend to benefit more than most from global economic strength rallied against the dollar and the euro bond yields climbed along with expectations of speedy growth and higher inflation but that changed on june 16th after the federal reserve hitherto apparently sanguine about rising american inflation suggested that it may eventually think about raising its policy rate long anchored at zero shorter dated bonds and shares tumbled as did those building boom commodities after a jittery week some investors may start this one wondering whether they over reacted the enthusiasm of the past few months was underpinned partly by the assumption that the fed would maintain the same super loose monetary policy hence the anxiety when jerome powell the fed s chairman suggested that the central bank might have to consider tightening somewhat sooner than previously anticipated the fed raised its inflation forecasts and lifted its median estimate for the future of policy rates to include two increases in 2023 mr powell also said the fed would begin discussing when to slow its asset purchases from the current 120bn per month any doubt about the change of tone was snuffed out two days later when james bullard head of the st louis fed told cnbc that the first rate rise could arrive in late 2022 the fed had seemed nonchalant even as signs of overheating in the american economy became harder to ignore the central bank s target measure of inflation core pce jumped to 3 year on year at the end of april headline inflation gauged by the consumer price index has climbed from less than 2 in february to 5 in may anecdotal evidence of overheating abounds from the piping hot housing market to spiking grocery bills gas prices and uber fares yet fed officials said the acceleration in inflation was transitory and that they would look through its effects investors believed them they were accordingly surprised by the change of tone many of the trends that have dominated markets since november unwound reflecting the prospective rate increases the yield on two year treasury bonds jumped to 0 27 from 0 16 on june 14th see chart the 30 year yield which tends to follow long term growth or inflation expectations tumbled to 2 02 on june 18th from 2 21 before the fed s meeting the prospect of the fed putting a brake on inflation and growth hit share and commodity prices the s p 500 slipped from near a record high ending the week about 2 lower value stocks which had performed particularly well since november were hard hit copper lost its spark shedding 8 over the week lumber was felled dropping 15 the fed also wrong footed monetary policymakers elsewhere several of whom met after the fed did or are due to convene this week when the fed last unwound a post crisis stimulus in 2013 setting off a notorious taper tantrum many emerging market currencies notably those of brazil india indonesia south africa and turkey fell sharply against the dollar on june 16th the brazilian central bank raised its interest rates from 3 5 to 4 25 the third increase since february despite the damage covid 19 has done to brazil s economy and to brazilians health the currencies of the other four countries have fallen by between 1 and 4 against the dollar since the fed s meeting an index of the dollar against other leading currencies rose by 1 9 last week as a new week begins investors will ask whether the shift signalled by the fed warranted such strong reactions it is possible that markets overdid it when many investors hold the same portfolio of positions they can be forced to bail out in a hurry if markets move violently against them this liquidation of positions can exacerbate volatility in fact there are reasons to think the great reflation trade has further to run the full reopening of the american economy is still in its early stages and the end of 2022 is a long way off but those turning their backs on emerging market currencies value stocks and copper will find plenty to convince them that a new phase for markets and the economy has already begun lumber prices were already slipping before the fed meeting as a frenzy for home improvements cooled credit card spending an early indicator of economic activity has been running 20 higher than it was two years ago but this month the pace has slowed to 16 5 according to bank of america soon investors will learn which bet pays off next but those still eager after last wednesday s surprise for hints of what the fed thinks is in store are in luck its officials including mr bullard and mr powell will make no fewer than 12 public appearances this week

the wreckage of covid 19 has drastically exceeded anyone s imagination since the first reported outbreak in wuhan china in early 2020 the number of pandemic deaths has crept over 3 7 million leaving disastrous economic and social consequences in its wake at its peak considerable attention was paid to containing the spread of the virus von bismarck osten et al 2021 blanchard rohner et al 2021 bonardi et al 2020a 2020b and creating a policy mix that could attenuate looming recessions and rising poverty baldwin and di mauro 2020a 2020b bonardi et al 2020b today as vaccination offers a light at the end of the tunnel questions about how to manage a post pandemic world have become more pressing among those questions of course is the number one problem of our generation how to counter climate change and build a more sustainable economy as covid 19 proliferated and lockdowns were imposed the global anthropause provided just the kind of natural experiment to better understand the environmental cost of mobility and globalisation and how to minimise this cost going forward a series of studies showed drops in pollution during the first few months of the pandemic across parts of the globe venter et al 2020 he et al 2020 forster et al 2020 in contrast our recent article bonardi et al 2021 provides new insights into the economy environment relationship by estimating the worldwide environmental consequences of lockdown measures over the medium run across 162 countries this longer run evidence provides precious information on the extent of air quality improvements that are attainable which may constitute key informational input for designing sustainable policies that can bring the environment back on track drawing on an especially rich sample we find that domestic and international lockdown measures translated overall into a 35 45 medium run reduction in pollution going beyond existing short run estimations interestingly our documented air quality improvements persist in the medium run even as lockdowns lifted the study shows that some country trajectories are much more appealing than others with fewer covid 19 casualties less economic downturn and bigger pollution reductions we use fine particle pollution pm2 5 as our air quality indicator because it is the pollutant with the most acute health consequences pm2 5 levels are also used by the world health organization as the main indicator of population exposure to pollution although pollution monitoring networks exist they offer sparse geographic coverage instead we leverage daily high resolution satellite retrievals from nasa gelaro et al 2017 this unique data offers complete coverage roughly equivalent to placing a monitor every 50km across the planet figure 1 global distribution of pandemic induced air quality changes notes cell values describe the difference in mean log pm2 5 before and after the first inside npi measure relative to the same pre post difference in 2019 the before period extends to november of the previous year until the lockdown date the after period extends to 31 august from bonardi et al 2021 building back a sustainable economy our second result unlocks the blueprint for building back better we find unequal air quality impacts across the world figure 1 even among countries with similar lockdown stringency to understand why note that pollution is a negative externality from common economic activities such as industry transport heating and cooking whereas the cascade of lockdowns starkly reduced mobility and industrial activity the net impact on energy use is more complex as working from home became the new normal put differently when restrictions were placed on some economic activities transport and industry people shifted to different ones domestic energy in this example contrary to conventional wisdom reductions in economic activities could be bad for the environment in countries where domestic energy is the largest pollution source policies to combat climate change must take these diverse responses to regulation into account our study carefully uncovers these heterogeneities in order to inform tractable environmental policy prescriptions figure 1 shows that most of the americas europe southern africa east asia and the pacific saw improved air quality purple during lockdown but some parts of south america and asia orange saw their air quality worsen the existence of heterogenous sources of air pollution across regions lelieveld et al 2015 largely explains the variation and reveals the complexities of comprehensively tackling pollution domestic energy use agriculture and power generation are among the dominant pollution sources in urban areas of asia south america and africa in contrast to developed countries in north america and europe where most emissions come from transport and industry figure 2 shows that areas that experienced air quality improvements had industry or transport as the main pollution source whereas areas with no changes or air quality deterioration were often the same regions where the dominant pollution sources include agriculture residential biomass burning or power generation including greece japan and brazil figure 2 air quality changes in urban areas gdp changes sources of air pollution and covid 19 related mortality notes gdp and pm2 5 are measured as the difference in mean values between the first and second quarter in 2020 relative to the same difference in 2019 covid 19 related deaths are the sum of deaths in the second quarter of 2020 the sources of air pollution are the sources responsible for the largest impact of pm2 5 on mortality in 2010 the gdp data are from the oecd while covid deaths data are from the european centre for disease prevention and control bonardi et al 2021 the development economic literature shows that the composition of economies changes during the process of structural change often from agriculture to industry and then to service dominated economies herrendorf et al 2014 thus environmental quality and economic progress can improve in tandem when shifts toward cleaner production counteract the environmental damage from increased production our results suggest that such complexities may also exist in the short term when people respond to covid 19 restrictions by switching to other more highly polluting activities that are less affected by lockdowns such as increased pollution from heating despite large global air quality improvements the price of covid 19 lockdowns was overwhelmingly high looking forward our results suggest taking a more nuanced policy approach than blanket restrictions on economic activity building back better a sustainable economy requires designing market based instruments that reward a shift towards cleaner production and consumption of goods and services such an approach not only puts a price on pollution through taxes or quotas such as the carbon taxes or the recent european plastic tax but will also incentivise innovation and investments in green technologies in conclusion there is a popular notion that the environment is bouncing back during covid 19 while humanity stays at home our study shows that the reality is much more complex as restrictions are rolled back and vaccination drives sweep the globe we can choose to return to normal or to learn from the pandemic experience and build back better a sustainable economy our findings can inform smart environmental policy design in tandem with broad lessons metcalf and

a rtisans associated with basketry are unaware that the precious raw material that they use is disappearing fast from their surrounding environment one of the most common material that they use is tamarix aphylla which is found along watercourses in arid zones in river beds and also on the coastal areas senior officials associated with the sindh social forestry department at mayani forest range hyderabad district said they had seen long trees and small shrubs of this species in the riverine forest now you may see scattered plants in the river bed from where the artisans collect this raw material to continue their work said alisher hajano managing the forest nursery though it is a flowering plant nobody knows how to collect its seed for using in nurseries for conservation of this valuable species hajano said that the seeds of the tree were spread by wind like some other wild plants it germinates wherever it falls near water bodies since the plant is disappearing from its natural habitats we cannot see its specific groves in any area he said the tree is often used as a wind breaker and fire barrier in dryer regions in australia and the united states in some regions of the world it is even considered an invasive species however here in pakistan where it is a native tamarix is getting neglected and is not as abundant as it used to be some decades ago nature conservationists believe that long ago conscious forest department officials used to grow this specific forest specie as a windbreaker and also for soil conservation and sand dune fixation in artificial forests this does not happen anymore concepts of forest conservation are not the same now and as a result sindh lost a lot of forested areas which has affected artisans and communities that relied on various trees like the tamarix for subsistence ramzan mallah a community activist from chotiari reservoir said once the area was a natural habitat of this forest specie tamarix aphylla large clusters of the wild shrubs are all lost now as the patches where these species grew went under the reservoir he added only a few plants have survived here and there around small water bodies in various neighbourhoods but even those face extinction as the tamarix is also used for construction by the communities for their makeshift houses and for weaving baskets mallah lamented the situation is the same at larger water bodies as well as the coastal areas of the province where this shrub is being cut for various purposes traditional artisans who collect stock of this plant to continue their ancestral work weaving small and larger baskets have also realised the depletion of these plants in the neighbourhood yaroo kehal weaving sticks of tamarix for small sized baskets at the river indus stream near hala old matiari district said they have to travel long distances now to collect live shrubs for the purpose talking about the small baskets that he was weaving he said it was not only the season of mango there was also demand from jamon and phalsa farmers and traders who used the baskets to stock the fruits shahryar bhanbhro a local activist said almost all people men women and younger children adopt basketry as a profession artisans from traditional families who have been associated with this work for generations all pointed out that the wild shrub was disappearing from their environment and procuring raw material was increasingly becoming a problem however they continue to use the shrub to extend their businesses each male and female can weave dozens of small baskets for clients to run this business without any concept of sustainability in general thus the exploitation of the tamarix continues and there have been no efforts from the provincial forest department or the community people themselves to save the shrub from extinction the need is for the government to spread awareness among artisans and if needed to even provide alternative livelihood options so the wild shrub can be rehabilitated and the areas reforested there is no denying the fact that the baskets made by these artisans are an integral part of the fruit and vegetable markets however there is a need to promote sustainable use of the baskets as well as a need to adopt sustainable methods of using the existing raw material resources the prices of these basketry products depend on its size which starts from rs50 to rs100 150 and rs500 on a visit to the thin stream of the river indus near hala old one may find many artisans who have set up an open gallery to display a variety of baskets woven by this specific plant growing at the river bed these people are aware of the ups and downs of the river and prefer to stay near so they can continue their traditional work which is their sole source of income according to them they do not have a specific place or permanent village where they may live and work it is a wide river bed near the embankment where they can live and work for whole the year whenever they see the change in water flow and fear flooding they move with raw material towards the embankment in fact occasionally some rowdy elements create disturbances for them which they ignore to continue with their work shakeel abro director sindh indigenous and traditional crafts company sitco said they have tried to mobilise these artisan communities especially those have been engaged in basketry products by using tamarix plants to get unorganised some families are like nomadic tribes traveling from one water body to another for finding raw material to continue work the reason they have turned nomadic was the fast depleting raw material along water bodies abro said they have apprised the chamber of commerce industries about the importance of handicrafts which have been an important part of the country s economy there are many unorganised clusters of artisans of this specific work residing near the river canals and wetlands across the province where entire families play their role in traditional work they collect raw material from water bodies for weaving sticks of this shrubs to prepare baskets but now the depletion of raw material might disturb these people who have depended solely on this craft for livelihood through generations presently they collect it free of cost from water bodies but later they may pay for it in case of wiping out of the tamarix groves the writer is a staff member

1 commodities it is impossible to understand the way in which the capitalist system works without some knowledge of basic marxian economics such knowledge is invaluable to the socialist because he can use it to expose the myth that the capitalist is the lynch pin of society and without him civilization would perish the marxist theory of value is based upon the analysis of the commodity marx describes the commodity as being the cell form of capitalist society and that wealth within capitalism presents itself as a vast accumulation of commodities first and foremost a commodity is a product of human labour under definite social conditions of production which can only apply to capitalist society it is an article produced for sale or exchange with a view to profit it contains two diametrical opposites use value and exchange value use value is the utility of an article and is something concrete food can be eaten homes can be lived in clothes can be worn this is self apparent but as we socialists are well aware the production of use values is not the prime function of capitalist society that function is the production of exchange value exchange value or price is the proportion in which commodities exchange with each other a thing possesses exchange value only to the person who has no use for it and loses its exchange value when its use value asserts itself or is eventually lost in consumption commodity production is peculiar to capitalist society when we talk about commodity production we mean a condition where the dominant means and almost the entire means of social production are devoted to the production of articles for sale and exchange commodities have been produced in past societies before capitalism but their production was confined to the handicraftsmen or to incidental surpluses their production was never a mass social process as it is today it is only in capitalist society that commodity production becomes the prevailing mode of production use value has nothing to do with whether or not an object or service is useful to humanity the whole economy of capitalism has a multitude of products and services which are incontestably useless and indeed harmful nuclear weapons military bases equipment for armies banking insurance and the whole apparatus of wholesale and retail the institutions and services however are useful to capitalism and use value in this context is related to the needs of capitalism and whatever these needs may be from time to time the most practical way to find out whether an article or service is useful or not is when it is offered for sale if no one wants it then it is socially useless whatever its virtues in other respects production of that particular commodity or service would then cease as its reproduction would be unnecessary to put it another way the production of any commodity or group of commodities which cannot be marketed or sold is useless by capitalist standards the fact that a social need may exist for unwanted commodities has nothing to do with the case there is no morality in capitalist economics some things which are bought and sold are not commodities bearing in mind that a a commodity must contain a certain amount of human labour and b that it must be capable of being reproduced we find that there are a number of instances where this does not apply land excluding buildings for example contains no value there is no labour involved in its production it cannot be reproduced nevertheless land is bought and sold it has a price and that price is determined by competition between buyers a woman s virtue is not a commodity but we know that virtue may be sold by prostitution likewise with a man s character you can buy a man s character by bribing him what happens in effect is that these non commodities assume the commodity form they take on an abstract exchange value and successfully masquerade as the real thing likewise with works of art the value and consequently the price of a commodity is determined by the amount of social labour spent on its production social labour includes the materials used in the productive process and is measured in time there is one important qualification and that is that the labour must be socially necessary if this were not the case the more inefficient and time wasting processes would produce the most value which is nonsense socially necessary labour means the average time that is spent in any field of production or distribution in the manufacture of articles or services for example if crude oil was shipped from europe to the middle east the cost of society s time including the element of wear and tear on the ship etc could not be added to the product because this would have been unnecessary labour as crude oil is found in abundance in the middle east again if a group of capitalists decided to erect a factory on the island of tristan de cunha or some other remote spot say for the manufacture of textiles the cost of the textiles would not have a greater value on account of the cost of shipment transport and other charges for the obvious reason that the areas for producing textiles are mainly concentrated in industrial areas with all the attendant services of railways roads etc again although the example may be open to question due to the capitalist energy crisis if a firm decided to build hansom cabs to be drawn by horses to replace taxi cabs the social time spent on these would be quite valueless as this commodity transport by horse drawn carriage is obsolete and is not used by society outside of its novelty value which is minute socially necessary labour must take into consideration the things which society now requires and the average methods through which they can be obtained this average working raises another question and that is whether by using the latest machinery the value of the product is less than that of similar products produced by relatively old machinery because the time spent on the former is naturally less the answer is that we have to take an average throughout the whole field of this production in particular in the coal mining industry throughout the world methods of extracting coal vary from working narrow seams to exploiting huge faces by coal cutting machinery the hand cut coal is not more valuable and in any case the entire production of coal cannot be carried out by hand neither can it be entirely carried out by machinery therefore the average time is proportioned between the two methods again if we take ten firms with varying degrees of efficiency say from 1 10 the average would be 5 and this would represent the social necessary labour time socially necessary labour is the substance of value or conversely value has for its substance embodied or congealed labour 2 value articles are exchanged because they are different this means that they possess a different kind of useful labour it is the quality of the labour which makes them different the labour of the bricklayer is different to that of the fitter as is the labour of the pattern maker to the coal miner s consequently the products are different identical goods or services are not exchanged for each other as there would be no useful purpose in doing this coal is not exchanged for coal in a world of commodity production this qualitative difference between definite types of useful labour develops into a complex system a social division of labour these useful forms of labour are carried on independently by individual producers working on their own account human labour in addition to producing use values also produces value it has a double function the commodity is the depository of value whilst everyone can see eat or feel the use value of a commodity i e its material side it seems impossible to grasp its value it is the very opposite of its use value use value is something which can be experienced but value is an abstract quality however we know that all commodities have one thing in common they are products of human labour and it is this which gives them their value and consequently their social reality it is only during the social process of exchange that value will declare its origin that is when commodities containing different forms of human labour confront each other on the market this is nothing other than the social relation of commodity to commodity it follows then that value is a social relation not between persons but between their products it is a relation between objects which contain an identical social substance human labour the multifarious sub divisions of labour are directed entirely to the exchange of commodities and there is no direct relation of social production to social producer the capitalist system does not produce for consumption its function is to produce surplus value out of which the capitalists industrialists banks landlords take their profits the sole agency through which value comes into existence is the international working class including russian and chinese who work within state capitalism they allow the capitalist not only to take the fruit of this labour but also to dictate the conditions under which they produce no matter how soul destroying and tedious allow is the operative word because the capitalist system could not survive against the wishes of workers collectively opposed to it the worker s access to his own product is through the wage packet he obtains his means of subsistence in the form of commodities articles produced for sale or exchange with a view to profit this peculiar way of getting his livelihood where there is no direct relation between production and consumption leads to a situation where workers tend to avoid thinking about the overall purpose of production and lend their thinking and activity to engaging in the wages struggle which from their point of view is at least simple and uncomplicated the capitalist is the enemy to be attacked but as we know only too well only on the wages front it is the socialist who tries to show the real significance of the class struggle by refusing to be dominated by the narrow trade union issue and demands that the capitalist be stripped of the means of production and that these become social property because capitalism produces wealth in the form of commodities the relations between the various producers are not direct that is to say that there is no conscious co ordination or specific purpose between the various branches of production and distribution everything appears to happen spontaneously or accidentally everything has to be done for an anonymous market nobody has any direct control over what will be produced when or in what quantity in earlier forms of society there was social co ordination and planning of production even though this was on a simple scale due to the undeveloped nature of the productive forces the food supply was obtained through hunting fishing fruit gathering etc some members of the community made cloth others pottery weapons etc this simple division of labour produced simple methods of distribution and both were integrated with the needs of the community and under its direct control today we have a fantastic situation where the only laws governing production are the laws of exchange not having any direct interest in production as such but only in the production of value and the exchange of their own commodity labour power the working class are unable to comprehend the social powers of production the real world for them is the world of exchange they wish to live in a situation where the hazards of capitalism can be tolerated and where they can sell their lives in instalments of their labour power which will be exchanged ultimately with instalments of fellow workers labour power however capitalism will not let the worker live quietly or stabilize his slavery it steps up the pressure and eventually forces him into a situation where he has to learn something new in order to escape from the pressure cooker the capitalist class including their governments do not control capitalism do not control production nor can they anticipate demand each capitalist carries on independently his knowledge of the market is restricted because he cannot know how much will be produced and sold from time to time competition between capitalists creates conflicting interests and these are a barrier to balanced social production most capitalists will back their experience or engage in market research in the hope of foreseeing demand however there is always some unforeseen factor for example few capitalists in europe could foresee the action by arab capitalists which was taken strictly in line with economic interests and in opposition to the interests of other world capitalists this was inevitable in a capitalist society you cannot expect the arabs to behave in a non capitalist way our alice in wonderland economists are now desperately trying to explain away the advice they gave to their masters on the imminent boom which turned out to be a slump the whole picture of capitalist production is one of social anarchy this anarchy is the direct result of social production being appropriated by the capitalist class resulting in the antagonism between producers and possessors the class struggle some things which are bought and sold are not commodities bearing in mind that a a commodity must contain a certain amount of human labour and b that it must be capable of being reproduced we find that there are a number of instances where this does not apply we have the absurd situation produced by the relation of value where the products in effect govern the producer the socialist proposes that the social means of production including distribution should be directly controlled by a society whose overriding concern is to provide all men and women with the best existence society is capable of without the value relation or any other economic relation based on value the physical production of wealth is well within the technical capability of a world wide community with the will to do it we are forced to stand by when ignorant experts hold the field lecturing on the economics of scarcity and belt tightening despite the scare stories about falling world resources there is sufficient wealth potential used in a responsible way not squandered or vandalized as is the case today to maintain a socialist society for a very long time as for the figure of 3 5 annual growth rate socialist society would disdain such a small increase and take the fetters off the productive forces capitalism has nearly succeeded in creating a race without real ambition the social relation of value represents a condition where the exchange of the product represents the exchange of the various types of labour embodied in the product and consequently provides the only social link between the producers it is a relationship of things rather than persons the value relation can only exist in a society concerned with exchange where things are more important than people if the social powers of production are brought under the democratic control of society a new and progressive era will have been founded exchange will become obsolete and the higher social relations based on planned production for need will have been established 3 money and prices the whole financial edifice of capitalism at first sight appears incomprehensible to the average person ignorance concerning the financial and monetary system has given rise to many unsound theories and consequently has prevented a proper understanding of what it is how it came into being and the circumstances which will make the monetary system unnecessary this is not an intellectual exercise but a vital element in exposing the nature of capitalism the monetary system has evolved gradually and has been in existence as a system for about 250 years in england and for a much shorter period abroad we make a distinction between the ancient coinage of greece carthage and rome which although used to effect the exchange of commodities was at that period incidental to the main stream of an exchange system which was based on surpluses and barter as a general social form money developed alongside the development of commodity production and at the point in history when all wealth was produced in the form of commodities money became the universal medium or equivalent through which all exchange transactions were carried out the first condition for the introduction of a monetary system is when social products become commodities i e articles produced for sale and exchange it is quite obvious that commodities cannot go to the market on their own as they are owned by someone or other he is the person who will take or send them there likewise there are other owners of commodities carrying out a similar function each will recognize the other as a private proprietor that is they respect each other s rights to dispose of the social product to their own immediate advantage eventually they embellish their right through a set of legal relations this juridical relation which thus expresses itself in a contract whether such contract be part of a developed legal system or not is a relation between two wills and is but the reflex of the real economical relation between the two it is this economical relation that determines the subject matter in each such juridical act marx capital vol i p 96 kerr edn the capitalists who are the owners of commodities have to appropriate the wealth of society before they can sell it once having done so they create a juridical system backed up by the state machine which politically safeguards their position and consequently the whole institution of private property when exchange becomes a normal social practice and the volume of transactions is being constantly repeated inevitably one commodity emerges either through custom or the stamp of legality in which all the others can represent their value or express their price which is the money name for value this one commodity which is historically acceptable becomes the recognized universal equivalent it becomes money it becomes the measure of value all commodities will therefore express their price through the agency of this single commodity whatever it happens to be at any given point historically gold became the universal equivalent and still is for international transactions gold evolved as such because of the facts that it had a certain amount of social labour in it that it was relatively durable easily divisible and kept its value for a long period the fact that currency notes without gold backing have replaced gold as the means of circulation within individual political states does not materially alter the function of the universal equivalent symbolic money introduced by state compulsion can only circulate within the political sphere which created it we are not concerned here with the interminable international squabbles between capitalist powers who refuse to take each other s bad money the fact that symbolic money is now used does not remove gold as the measure of value as eventually all symbolic currencies will require to be related to one another at some point and are finally adjusted through the medium of gold let us assume that 1 oz of gold contains 100 hours of social labour and that 40 gallons of wine also contain 100 hours in that case 1 oz of gold would be equal to 40 gallons of wine or ½ oz equal to 20 gallons of wine or ¼ to 10 gallons and so on the same thing would apply to every other commodity for example if 4 washing machines also contained 100 hours of social labour then 4 washing machines would be equal to 40 gallons of wine or 1 washing machine to 10 gallons of wine or ¼ oz of gold the change from one universal equivalent to another does not nor cannot alter the exchange value or the proportion in which one commodity exchanges with another gold as the money commodity or currency as the recognized legal form are really external factors different products of labour are being equated with one another and the function of money is to facilitate this equation for practical commercial purposes the law of value like the law of gravity is not subject to amendment by acts of parliament currency is not value the amount of currency notes needed to carry out exchange transactions depends on the number of transactions the speed with which they are conducted and the volume of commodities to be exchanged if for example 5 million currency was required to circulate 50 million worth of commodities and the government decided to print 10 million then the purchasing power of the would have fallen and it would take 2 to purchase what would previously be purchased for 1 prices would rise accordingly the value of the commodities has not changed but merely that their standard of measurement has altered you do not alter temperature by changing the numbers on a thermometer prices will rise because the measure of price has fallen prices will rise higher and in direct ratio to the depreciation of the symbolic standard of measure this is the main factor in rising prices the exchange of commodities is not based on legal promises to pay or arbitrary standards which alter according to political expediency therefore they will express their value as they have always done on the amount of socially necessary labour contained within them supply and demand do not determine prices although they influence them a shortage will create higher prices a surplus low prices but invariably throughout most fields of production and distribution through repetition the supply of commodities becomes equal to the demand for them and the two therefore cancel each other out these are accidental factors and do not determine value any more than a train driver can determine the route between london and glasgow other factors which influence price are monopoly and subsidy monopoly action by certain groups of capitalists with holding supplies of a given commodity can cause prices to rise the arab oil sheikhs demonstrated this recently monopoly does not add to the surplus wealth but merely redistributes it capitalism cannot run on the basis of permanent monopoly anymore than it can run on the basis of permanent subsidy subsidy is the action which is carried on by certain governments to keep prices below the current market level from time to time for many years the prices of food and housing were kept artificially low deliberately in order to keep wages down the introduction of an excess of currency notes over and above those required to circulate will undoubtedly cause dislocation not only in the marketing process but also in the productive process this we are now witnessing you cannot print value if governments could only follow the example of king midas how happy they would be like the old canadian bum they have the button of inflation if only someone would sew a shirt on to it 4 do machines produce surplus value historically the function of the capitalist system of production was to replace the previous mode of production prevailing within feudal society by the more efficient capitalist mode of production this involved the amalgamation of small fragmented and even individual means of production into a social force capitalism socialized the means of production all the productive forces which were capable of being developed were developed the capitalist could ensure the presence of large numbers of wageworkers in any one place co operating with each other within the process of production with a view to cutting down the time expended in the process even on the basis of simple manual labour it is a fact that 20 men working in unison can perform tasks that 40 men working individually could never do the secret is that the 20 men are operating socially or in concert as a productive force a force almost as old as mankind the sub division of labour is accelerated as each process becomes repetitious and broken down so that a number of operations can happen at the same time it is quite obvious that a productive force based on even a high sub division of manual labour was inadequate so long as it continued to rely on mainly manually operated tools there were limits as to how many men you could get into a factory or one place and there were also limits to the amount of time you could work the labourer without his health deteriorating this productivity of labour could only be increased by the introduction of machinery the motive force for this machinery was in the first instance provided by men or animals but eventually by water steam gas and electricity in that order it should always be borne in mind that the natural forces in social labour i e sub division of labour and co operation cost the capitalist nothing likewise with the physical forces water and steam it is true that physical forces have to be harnessed in order to be exploited this involves costly power generating stations hydro machinery etc but the cost of these is recovered over the period of their operation capital therefore has not only inherited the earth but the natural physical forces so far discovered and perhaps some at present undiscovered the gigantic means of production existing today bear little resemblance to the industrial scene when marx made his analysis of machinery manufacture and the position of the working class in relation to the development of these technical productive forces automation computers nuclear energy are certainly new but the basic marxist theory on machinery embracing these new developments is as true today and of equal application as it was in 1860 today capitalists and their economic advisers will go to great lengths to stress that most of the profit created by modern industry is due mainly to the increasing mass of constant capital vested in plant and machinery this appears on the surface to be the case but socialists do not take things at their face value we fully agree with marx that machines do not produce surplus value and consequently profit even if whole areas of production were based entirely on automated processes involving little direct labour participation the reason why machinery however highly developed does not produce surplus value is not difficult to understand machinery is an extension of the labour process which is carried on mechanically machines are in effect social tools created by the man for the sole purpose of replacing human labour power and cutting down the time expended by human labour the productiveness of machinery is measured by the labour it replaces it is a fact that there are quite a number of processes which can only be done by machines but all complicated processes have evolved from a sub division of simple labour and therefore the fact that simple labour has been intensified to the point of the scientific skill needed to produce and operate a machine to replace that simple labour in no way alters the basis for calculating the productiveness of a machine no matter how complicated machines become even to the point of the capitalist s wildest dreams the push button society they are still produced and maintained by men being a product of labour a machine like every other commodity contains value in addition to its use value that value is determined by the amount of socially necessary labour required to produce the machine during the productive process the machine wears out and has to be replaced in the course of time it follows then that the machine cannot pass on any more value than that which is contained within it in the first place the machine is used in the production of commodities and it gradually by stages perhaps over years or decades comes to the end of its working life but during its working life it has added value to the particular commodity for which it was designed each of the commodities therefore has consumed part of the value of the machine and consequently the machine has transferred its value to the products suppose for example a machine cost 10 000 and would operate efficiently for 10 years and at the end of the period would require to be replaced the capitalist owner of the machine would therefore add 1 000 to the value of the products produced annually representing 1 10th of the value of the machine in this way the capitalist ensures that he can replace that portion of his capital vested in the machine any depreciation of value of machinery however complicated is always compensated by the amount returned to the capitalist by way of the value added to the commodity value in the form of capital lives on it has the gift of eternal life not only do the workers produce surplus value at the point of production but they also preserve existing value it is the phenomenon of the social relation of value that whilst it owes its origin to the social relation of human labour it has an independent existence working through its own anarchistic economic laws consequently it is no longer under the control of the society which gave rise to it if we consider the productive process as a whole with computers electronic devices and highly developed machinery there can be no doubt that these have added greatly to production it appears that any increase in profit apart from cutting wages can only be derived by introducing machinery this is true but the profit or surplus value cannot come from an inanimate object the technical foundations of modern industry are built on machinery this machinery has been created by men under the capitalist mode of production and distribution the incentive to its invention and introduction has always been the profit motive if a machine is to replace labour it must perform its operation in less time than that required by human labour it is no good otherwise any substitution for labour including the substitution of natural force for human force is an extension of the labour process carried on by the working class it is not disputed that machinery is a means to the production of surplus value but this surplus value is produced by the people who make and operate the machines the production of the worker working with machinery is increased tremendously but the workers are paid not for what they produce but for what they sell their labour power it follows therefore that the introduction of machinery serves only to increase the rate of exploitation that is the difference between what the worker produces and what he receives in the form of wages each fresh introduction of machinery into the working process is always done with a view to cutting down the amount paid in wages by reducing the number of wage workers capitalists find the machine a useful ally in the struggle over wages most of the industrial processes today could not as they are serve the needs of a socialist society existing technology would provide the basis for developing socially acceptable industrial processes free from noise dirt and non injurious to life and limb at the moment the plain fact is that scientific progress in the development of machinery as in all things serves capital and not man 5 capital the lazy men squandered their substance whilst the diligent saved theirs thus capital was born from thrift this fairy tale has about as much real application to the origins of capital as adam s rib has to the origins of women the important point is how are private fortunes created and how do they grow we know that prior to the capitalist system of production the producers owned their means of production and the primitive accumulation of capital is nothing less than the process of divorcing the producers from their means of production and turning them into capital when this process is completed historically we arrive at the situation which exists today where the producers are totally alienated from the social means of production they are propertyless wage workers selling their life activity to their employers with enough to live on and sometimes not even that capital has not existed from all time it commenced in europe out of the ruins of the old feudal society around the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it is a social relation of production and came into existence with the production of commodities and their circulation the circulation of commodities means the development of an exchange system which finds its ultimate expression in the introduction of a monetary system any stated sum of money is representative of any stated quantity of commodities or value money is the final product of the circulation of commodities and capital appears in the first instance in that form but capital can also appear in the form of a sum of commodities values raw materials instruments of labour in fact any sum of exchange values what distinguishes the commodities comprising capital from any other group of commodities is the way in which they are used the object behind their use must always be to produce a greater value than that existing capital functions solely to produce a surplus value greater than the sum originally advanced either in the monetary form or in the commodity form or both it is important to differentiate between capital trading transactions and share or stock dealings carried out mainly on the world s stock exchanges between rival stockholders and investors each trying to improve his financial position individually or in a group these represent transfers of capital between various people and institutions they do not add to the total wealth but change the ownership of existing wealth value much in the same way as you can move furniture from one room to the other within the same house you finish up with the same furniture but in different rooms one man s loss is another man s gain the function of capital production is to increase existing wealth the production of wealth cannot therefore depend on trading transactions neither can it depend on nature or heaven despite the lord s bounty when the parson gives thanks every harvest festival when all is safely gathered in it should never be forgotten that every day is harvest day for the capitalist sowing capital and reaping surplus value raw materials and even the most sophisticated machinery or gold bars do not possess magical powers and cannot increase their own value merely by being placed together in any sphere of production being inanimate objects they are dependent on men either to produce them in the first instance or to maintain or supervise their operation living labour is vital to the whole function of capital if the machine or the materials cannot change their value and if there is an additional or surplus value created then it could only have come from living labour there being no other possible source the legendary brilliance of the capitalist his organizing ability and other associated fables have little to do with the social production of wealth and its accumulation some are clever some are industrious most are ignorant of the source of their wealth inefficient and self indulgent were they all in the first category it would make no difference because the fact remains that capital is a social relation of production working independently from personalities clever stupid or mediocre the social capital mainly consists of the means of production and distribution factories industrial complexes oil wells mineral workings means of transport ships aeroplanes railways and road transport systems agricultural land plantations etc most of these have been created gradually by workers long since dead this is the accumulated labour value of the past which provides the basis for the living labourers productive activity in the present the employer capitalist allows the worker access to this existing social capital created by the worker s predecessors for the sole and specific purpose of adding a greater value than that previously existing this marriage between living labour and capital past labour is a necessary condition for the social extraction of surplus value but as has been stated the element of surplus value or profit cannot come from a fixed quantity of accumulated wealth if anything without the fertilization of living labour the accumulated wealth of the past which exists in the objects of social labour factories machinery road systems industrial centres shipyards cultivated land etc would deteriorate and eventually become wasted assets living labour serving capital therefore performs two functions first it produces a surplus value working together with the accumulated labour of the past and second and by virtue of its productive activity it preserves the means of production from decay every act of production is in effect also an act of reproduction and it is through this act of reproduction that the means of production remain intact and are preserved for the capitalist the employers as a class who own the social capital buy social labour power giving wages in return the amount of the capital is described by socialists as variable capital because we claim that it alone changes in quantity at the end of the productive process this is because the workers produce more value than they receive back in the amount of wages paid to them the difference is described by us as the rate of surplus value or exploitation if a company pays annually the sum of 1 million in wages and 9 million in raw materials machinery etc 10 million total and shows a profit of 1 million the rate of exploitation is 100 per cent irrespective of the claim of the capitalist that he only earns 10 per cent the variation upwards in total value has been entirely due to living labour on the other hand if a capitalist spends 10 million in wages and 1 million on raw materials fuel machinery etc and shows a profit of 1 million the rate of exploitation would be 10 per cent the rate of exploitation is measured against the amount paid out in the form of wages and not the total capital the constant capital vested in machinery raw materials fuel buildings etc is constantly replaced or constantly reproduced by the capitalist adding the value of these elements to the commodities which he produces constant capital cannot add any additional value to the products other than that contained within itself in fact it is only through the agency of human labour power during the productive process that dead capital accumulated labour gives birth to new additional value capitalism is basically a system of accumulation and that portion of surplus value which is not consumed by the capitalists on luxury living is remitted to the fund of accumulated labour where it can serve as fresh capital to exploit workers again and again increasing with every phase of circulation it is indeed the dead hand of the past weighing heavily like an alp on the living the greater the fund of accumulated capital the greater the pressure on the workers to serve that capital to augment it ad infinitum it is often stated by supporters of capitalism that capital has opened up new horizons and that men have access to things and technological discoveries previously undreamed of but it should be remembered that men together with their fellow men live in society and create their own environment that environment is anti social because men s creative ability is stifled as they do not own or control the means of production it is hardly an argument to suggest that man is adequately compensated for this social loss by the ownership of tvs motor cars and central heating as marx stated whether his wages be high or low or whether the chains that bind him be made of gold the worker is as firmly riveted to capital as was prometheus to the rock capital appears to have a separate existence outside the control of man as a social relation it frankenstein like dominates all forms of human behaviour where everything is related to the money principle the measure of a man is his wealth not his intellect or culture the ability of a man is determined by his financial power the big spender has inherited the earth that is why he is a big spender capitalism has created a phoney culture and has debased man s intellect to the level of a commodity happily we have not all succumbed to its pernicious influence and we know and are optimistic enough to believe that society can be turned the right way up which means that civilisation can survive and prosper without capital 6 surplus value capitalism s innermost secret is the production and the accumulation of surplus value this is sub divided into profit interest and rent and it is the blessed trinity dominating the entire international economic and political structure of the capitalist world the seed corn of surplus value is labour power labour power is now a commodity it is different from all other commodities in that it produces more value than it takes to reproduce itself the mental and physical capabilities of human beings are thus appropriated as commodities and set to work to produce other commodities social freedom despite the high sounding phrases is nothing less than permission to sell labour power from employer to employer who are the only people in a position of purchasing it and this is taken to be in the natural order of things it however is not nature which produces this strange relation nor is the social basis of selling labour power a normal social practice which has existed throughout the history of civilized society on the contrary the emergence of the commodity labour power has been the result of many historical developments of propertied society culminating in the establishment of the capitalist form of production certain historical conditions are necessary before the product of labour power can become a commodity and these historical conditions apply equally to living labour power itself these conditions are 1 that the means of exchange must be developed that the means of production must be privately owned and operated socially that the labourer must be separated from his means of production the value of a commodity is determined by the amount of labour which is socially necessary to produce it and no more than is socially necessary if the labour time remains constant the value remains constant new production methods cut the time required and consequently reduce the value other factors intervene like increased skill state of science etc when mineral deposits for instance become less accessible so as to increase the labour time socially necessary this increases the value we have a society where homogeneous human labour working within an average social time is expended in producing a huge mass of commodities at any given period during the life of that society a definite amount of value is produced exploitation is therefore measured in time which is translated into monetary symbols time is money a vulgar description for a most anti social practice if a group of workers each work 160 hours monthly for an employer and the employer makes a profit at the end of 12 months then where does the profit come from the raw materials used in the productive processes cannot add to their value nor can the machinery add to its own value in fact it transfers its value to the products as it wears out plant and industrial installations are in the same category likewise with the bricks and mortar of the factory steel mill and shipyard the worker has not been cheated because on average he receives the value of the commodity which he sells to the employer for wages his labour power surplus value is not created by trading transactions even by cartels or monopolies a manufacturer may corner a market and grab the lion s share of the profit to the detriment of other capitalist groups but no monopoly can create surplus value in any case goods have to be produced before they can be sold and the producing capitalist would expect to make a profit apart from his trading partner s profit the only possible explanation left to us is that surplus value comes from labour power the capitalist buys labour power in order to use it and puts the seller to work providing the raw materials machinery factories etc the subjects of labour power or the place where the labour process is to be carried on labour power in motion becomes labour that is it becomes congealed in the objects it produces the capitalist buys labour power but he sells labour and that labour is presented to us as a vast conglomeration of commodities the value of labour power and the value of labour are not the same thing the commodities are sold and the cycle is repeated the capitalist buys labour power for money wages m labour power becomes labour products commodities c commodities are sold money m m c m but the commodities are sold at their value not at the cost of production that value is determined by the amount of socially useful labour contained in them no capitalist sells goods or services at the cost of producing them he is not in business merely to receive his money back wages represent a certain period of time which the worker contracts to work for the employer whether it be an hourly or weekly rate or a monthly salary he must at some point require to produce the value of his own wages so if a proportion of the working day is devoted to this purpose then it becomes necessary for him to labour up to the point where he has in effect produced the value of his own wages this is necessary labour it follows that if he continues to work beyond this period of necessary labour he is in effect rendering a certain amount of superfluous labour or surplus labour the worker does not own his labour this is the property of the capitalist he owns his labour power indeed it would be hard to separate it from him as it exists in the form of muscle brain and nerve the human organism he is therefore making a gift to his employer for every atom of time he spends in the labour process over and above that necessary to reproduce the value of his wages which is the necessary labour time it is precisely this surplus labour time which manifests itself in the physical products of labour values and this becomes surplus value an additional quantity for which the capitalist has not paid we speak of time only at this juncture but the workers are supplied in addition to raw materials with highly developed machinery and other sophisticated tools of production the tempo of production is intensified the greater the degree of production which can be achieved using up to date methods and techniques within the same time or even less time means that the rate of exploitation is higher because the necessary labour time will have been reduced and the surplus labour time increased this is what happens in real life the tu movement has for years been trying to cut down the workers hours although most trade unions have long term agreements whereby their members work considerable amounts of overtime the official working week has been reduced in most industries to around 40 hours in 1973 as compared to 52 hours per week in 1900 but even allowing for the additional number of workers in industry production has increased at least two fold and this has been due to the extension of machinery over a whole range of labour processes it is the capitalist who stands to benefit by this as he benefits by every advance in science and technology whilst wages have risen above prices compared with 1900 the rate of exploitation has increased and the capitalist class are much better off marx put it succinctly the bigger the banquet the bigger the crumbs which fall from the table the capitalists do not arbitrarily fix their profits over their cost of production they sell the goods for what they think the market will stand but the starting point is what it costs them it is however the secret of commodities that when brought to the market they will exchange with other commodities according to the amount of socially necessary labour time contained within them and no capitalist knows this although he will obviously know the amount of time his process has taken value contains surplus value the fact that articles do not always sell at their value sometimes above sometimes below does not alter this rule buying and selling influence prices they do not determine them profit is not made from trading transactions but from the productive process the surplus product becomes the surplus value the surplus value is the social fund from which the profits of all sections of the capitalist class bankers landlords and industrialists are derived it is not our concern to take sides in disputes which occur from time to time between sections of the capitalist class on whether landlords or bankers profits are too high and industrialists too low this is a matter for the labour party and the small fry of the left who usually side with the industrial capitalist it is sufficient for our purpose to show where surplus value comes from and not its final destination we know it doesn t go to members of the working class surplus value is produced at the point of production and not during the process of circulation i e banking insurance and commerce whilst it is true to say that only productive workers produce surplus value it is equally true to say that all workers are exploited how would the banking capitalist appropriate his share of the surplus value unless he employed bank clerks accountants etc to appropriate it on his behalf where would the landlords get their share without the chartered surveyor rent collector and estate agents and clerical staff how would capitalism function without street cleaners refuse collectors health services and every other service including police civil servants and other ancillary workers whilst the basic mechanism shows the original source of surplus value to be labour power at the point of production in fact you cannot separate the main divisions of capital which through custom and the division of labour have historically impressed themselves on the capitalist mode of production banking capital industrial capital landlord capital capitalism has to be taken as an organic whole or an indivisible system the extraction of surplus value is a social act consequently the entire resources of the body politic exist for that one purpose every member of the working class plays a part either directly or indirectly and all are therefore exploited do banks produce wealth there are three main divisions within capitalist society which share the surplus value which is socially extracted from the working class the industrialist the landlord and the banker these divisions historically reflect the application of the division of labour to the specialized investment of capital in any field of production and distribution any process of circulation of which banking is part individual capitalists or groups of capitalists may have financial interests in all three of these groups there is nothing to stop the industrial capitalist from becoming his own landlord and banker but were he to do so he would require to hold huge reserves of cash or have part of his capital locked up in bricks and mortar thus preventing it from being more usefully employed in the exploitation of human labour power generally speaking the industrialist the banker and the landlord pursue their own separate courses their interests are intertwined but nevertheless are antagonistic whilst it is true that the capitalist class have more in common with each other than with the working class it is necessary to add that a class society must inevitably produce a conflict of interest between capitalist and capitalist as it does between capitalist and worker and worker and worker interest and profit in capitalist society all wealth takes the form of commodities and is bought and sold capital itself is subject to this process the price of capital represents the amount paid for the use value of that commodity for a prescribed period the lender sells to the borrower the use value of his capital and expects to receive an additional payment i e interest as well as having the original sum returned to him at the end of the mutually agreed period if we assume annual average rate of profit is 10 this would mean that anyone owning 10 000 employed as capital and provided it was used with average intelligence under normal conditions would expect this capital to yield a profit of 1 000 if however he gives or transfers this 10 000 to another person who also proposes to use this as capital then he has given to that person the power to produce a profit of 1 000 a surplus value which would have cost him nothing obviously this person does not expect to receive this privilege without making some payments in return if he decides to pay say 250 to the original owner out of the 1 000 profit for making the 10 000 capital available to him that part of the profit is called interest it is a payment made for the use value of the capital the banker makes his money out of the process of indirectly bringing borrower and lender together the banker borrows money at say 10 and lends it at say 14 and the difference between the two rates after deduction of expenses of book keeping rent wages etc represents his profit it should be borne in mind that the rate of profit has its origin in the productive process or at the point of production that is at the place and places where socially useful human energy or labour power transforms natural wealth and natural forces into commodities the essence of the capitalist form of exploitation is that the capitalist does not nor cannot pay the full amount of the value of that socially necessary labour and pays only the value of the living labour as represented by wages and that is not the same thing capital the surplus value is the difference between the value of the product and the value of the producers living labour produces a greater value than it takes to reproduce itself and consequently all surplus value comes from the exploitation of human labour power under a wages system banks produce nothing they are really middlemen or custodians of idle capital which must be available as a hoard as potential money capital waiting to be put to use the purely technical labour of paying and receiving money constitutes an employment by itself which necessitates the making of balance the balancing of accounts as far as money serves as a means of payment this labour belongs to the expenses of circulation and does not create any value it is abbreviated by being organized as a special department of agents who perform this work for the rest of the capitalist class marx capital vol ill p 373 their profit is made during the process of circulation as is the case with all commercial and interest bearing capital the difference between interest bearing capital and industrial capital or capital used in the productive process where wage labour is exploited is that the owner of money capital who wishes to earn interest on that money throws it into circulation not as capital for himself but so that others can use it and consequently gains a profit by this service the basic difference is that whereas the individual capitalist has his capital locked up in factories mines heavy machinery ships and means of transport and distribution stocks of materials or committed to a wages bill the lender of interest bearing capital invariably has it returned to him the main exception to the rule is when certain money has been loaned to the government in which case the lender has a legal title to a permanent income at a fixed rate of interest banks not dominant it is quite true that individual sums of money deposited with banks may be too small to function as capital by themselves but they can be gathered together into useful masses of capital and advanced to industrialists and others who use the banking system in the main however the hoard of capital which is deposited with the banks is the residue of unconsumcd profits or capital which is surplus to immediate requirements contrary to popular belief banks do not dominate the capitalist system this mistaken view is due to the fact that wealth is represented by enormous quantities of money all wealth under capitalism expresses its value in the symbolic money form but that form tends to conceal the fact that capital exists in the physical implements of the labour factories minerals buildings ships etc and that these are the dominant form of capital the expansion of capital can only arise from these sources and not from the variety of banking and commercial transactions involving interest bearing capital at the present time banks have advanced 8 897 million to the manufacturing industries including 2 103 million to the engineering and metal industries 2 247 million to the construction industry and 1 187 million to food drink and tobacco the balance of the loans is mainly divided between chemicals electrical engineering shipbuilding agriculture and forestry financial statistics hmso table 53 oct 1974 an estimate of the value of the physical assets of the uk wealth was published recently the total value of the assets was estimated

clearing banks statistical unit 16th oct 74 effects of crises the labour party and the communist party mistakenly argue that the slump of the thirties was due to the fact that the banks withheld loans from industrialists a variation of the same argument being used today by politicians of all parties including the residue of the left and a number of economists is that the present high rate of bank interest will dissuade the capitalists from borrowing for fresh investment thus causing unemployment by reducing production the assumption behind this rather naive conception of capitalism is that as long as the industrial capitalist can find capital whether by borrowing from a bank or out of his hoarded resources he can maintain full employment the point that they constantly overlook is that the function of capital is to produce profit this can only become a reality when the commodities produced can be sold if for some reason whether it be that the market is already overloaded and cannot absorb further commodities or that over production has already taken place then production will be scaled down curtailed or in some cases halted entirely and workers will be laid off in these circumstances there will be little prospect of profit and as experience has shown a number of capitalists the smaller ones go bankrupt in the first 9 months of this year 4 000 receiving orders were made an increase of 40 over the same period for last year sunday telegraph city 4 24 nov 74 all the machinations of the banks either by advancing or retarding credit whether charging low interest rates or not cannot alter this at the moment there is no shortage of cash available for investment and the banks are only too eager to make capital available to bona fide capitalists however in a failing market there is little incentive to the industrial capitalist to commit himself to paying interest when the prospects of earning surplus value on the borrowed money are extremely remote only these capitalists in dire financial trouble or those who have to meet certain contracted obligations will be forced to borrow generally speaking in periods of crisis when the capitalist s position deteriorates and he has to meet payments he will borrow money almost at any price to stay in business invariably the rise in the rate of interest implies a fall in the value of shares and securities interest comes out of profit and in these periods the fact that the capitalist needs to borrow means that his normal source of profit has temporarily dried up therefore the price of shares has fallen the present rate of interest i e 14 16 per cent is the highest for over forty years and the price of shares the lowest for sixteen years financial times index 168 5 23 nov 74 there is of course the element of inflation written into the present interest rate unlike real wealth in the physical sense loan capital exists as a symbolic paper hoard and as such is subject to the hazards of inflation were the commercial capitalists not to take some preventive action their assets as they exist purely in the monetary form would be eroded year by year as a result of inflation so the price of capital rises as with other prices and the high interest rate is the protective mechanism the banks etc use to protect their assets the utopian promise of low interest rates at times when the operation of capitalism is forcing high ones can be ruled out as a pious hope the industrial capitalist does not suffer to any great extent from the ravages of inflation as his assets consist mainly of real wealth whose relative value rises as the purchasing power of paper currency falls and he can adjust his prices upwards taking into account the rising cost of production on the subject of inflation generally we are reminded of the small boy at the seaside saying to his father dad where does the water go when the tide goes out it had obviously gone elsewhere but it certainly wasn t lost and neither is wealth during periods of inflation the rate of interest or bank rate itself is not arbitrarily fixed it fluctuates according to the conditions of the market supply and demand cause competition between buyers and sellers and raises or lowers prices competition between borrowers buyers of capital and sellers owners of capital operating through their banking agents determines the rate of interest the mythology surrounding the power of banking helps those who take the view that this vast institution is so necessary that the prospect of a world without money would be unthinkable the present world with money is becoming uninhabitable and that is why we want to establish socialism banks and credit the use value of loan capital which is made available through the banking system consists of producing profit and this type of profit is described as interest the rate of interest is arrived at by competition between lenders and borrowers or by supply and demand the lender of loan capital striving to obtain the highest rate of interest for the use of his capital and the borrower seeking the lowest rate there is no natural rate of interest nor is there any limit to the rate that can be charged in the german weimar republic during the period of great inflation after world war 1 the rate of interest was raised weekly in some cases to 200 the natural rate theory has its basis in the repetitive form of dealings between merchants and industrialists in the negotiation of bills of exchange a substantial part of the business of a bank consists in discounting cashing bills of exchange they are generally speaking promises to pay between merchant and industrialist at 60 90 day intervals or longer these bills usually represent goods in transit or in store and for the facility of advancing cash immediately on the strength of the bill which guarantees the value of the goods nominated in the bill the banker will deduct or discount a fraction of the amount shown and buy the bill if for example a bill of exchange was valued at 10 000 and the annual rate of interest was 10 and the bill was due in 90 days the banker would deduct the sum of 250 i e 90 days interest and advance the sum of 9 750 when the bill was finally redeemed the banker would then receive the sum of 10 000 the full value of the bill rates of interest naturally the merchant and the industrialist incidentally banking transactions as described above are not just confined to these two would seek out the most favourable discount rates and over a period of years the rate would tend to become adjusted at a regular rate for many years between world wars i and ii the bank rate remained almost stable around 2½ 3 the old bank rate was based on this practice of discounting bills and gave rise to the theory of the natural rate of interest regarding the possibility of the banker getting the better of the merchant industrialist etc by successfully charging high discount rates this would only result in a transfer of wealth between them were the british banks to consistently charge usurious rates capitalists would endeavor to have their bills discounted elsewhere say new york or paris since interest is part of industrial profit the maximum limit of interest is marked by profit itself the leaves can never be greater than the tree or the part can never be greater than the whole the high rate of interest today i e 15 16 is distorted by inflation the chairman of barclays bank mr a favil tuke said it is worth recording that of the three parties who make up a bank namely stockholders staff and customers none has gained much from these profits customers do not need to be told how much interest rates have risen in the last year or two the increases in the salaries of our staff have been limited to about 7 per annum and that of the stockholders dividend to 5 per annum all this at a time of inflation of some 10 per annum directors report to agm 1974 obviously the depreciation of money is taken into account when fixing a rate of interest and this is basic to the preservation of the value of the loan capital on the other hand any prolonged fall resulting in a total loss of interest as well as an erosion of the value of the money capital would eventually remove loan capital from the money market this would sooner or later have repercussions in the productive process as industrialists and other capitalists would find difficulty in raising capital for certain projects as capitalism s wealth develops there is a tendency for the owner of inherited wealth to live on the annual interest without actively participating in the productive process the same attitude is adopted by retired capitalists who want to take things easy instead presumably of just taking them as in their youth loan capital arises mainly from these sources were there no profit in loaning capital that capital would be hoarded until such times as things improved the owners of such capital would not retain it in the form of paper currency at the mercy of inflation which has the effect of gradually reducing the wealth of the banker and the landlord as well as literally confiscating such savings as are owned by workers they would hold their hoard either in gold works of art land buildings or any other desirable commodity which retained its value no profits would accrue from assets held in this way but on the other hand there would be no losses either however if this happened on any scale there would be industrial dislocation lenders borrowers the function of banks is firstly to make recurring payments on behalf of their customers meeting mortgage payment rates quarterly bills and regular annual orders these are payments which are entirely concerned with the circulation of commodities but their second and most important function is to provide credit or capital for industry commerce property etc this is not provided out of the resources of the bank as can be seen by the statement of the london clearing banks total advances were 16 7 thousand millions quarterly analysis of bank advances bank of england 20th november 1974 whereas the total capital of these banks was 658 millions as at december 1973 annual reports 1973 generally speaking bank overdraft limits are reviewed every year and bank borrowing is mainly short term up to 3 years in the main long term loans are usually handled by the merchant banks who charge a higher rate of interest for this facility the credit system which owes its development to the specialized function of the bank has proved to be a significant force in the centralization of capital gathering as they do all the disposable money which is spread throughout society they channel it into the hands of groups of capitalists who turn it into capital the accumulation of capital is speeded up and with it the productiveness of labour as more and more machinery is introduced into the productive process credit and the credit system have given rise to many misconceptions about the power of banks to create credit firstly credit whatever its form whether in money or goods consists in a transfer from one person to another credit in its simplest expression is the well or ill founded confidence which induces one man to extend to another a certain amount of capital in money or in commodities estimated at a certain value which amount is always payable after the lapse of a definite time tooke capital vol iii kerr edn p 471 elements of social wealth and the conditions under which the transfer takes place or the trustworthiness of either of the parties to the transaction need not concern us an owner of goods may be separated by an interval of time from realizing the value of these goods in money certain articles take a longer time to produce than others and others longer to market the production of certain commodities mainly agricultural products depends on certain seasons of the year inevitably the owner of the commodities will borrow money on them or sell his right to them for money on the spot or the written promise of money this is putting it at its simplest the goods providing the security for the loan in any case goods are exchanged or secured against a sum of money which is due to be repaid at a given date in the future payment in advance of delivery or delivery in advance of payment represent the two sides of simple credit it is to be assumed that the credit seeker has a reputation for solvency and that fraud is not the purpose credit advances in this way merely facilitate the circulation of commodities by getting them to the market quicker weakest to the wall the second and most important function of the banker is to provide money for industry which is capital this has a separate function from money as the medium of circulation the function of capital is not merely the circulation of commodities but their production in the first instance therefore money used as capital is withdrawn from circulation because the wealth which it represents has been locked up in the process of production the credit system of advancing capital allows individuals to use capital which is not theirs and has opened the door to all sorts of swindles and reckless speculation who would not gamble with other people s money if banks could create credit with the stroke of a pen that would mean in effect they could create wealth and consequently the marxist theory of value would be shown to be wrong however as time passes the validity of the labour theory of value i e that wealth can only come into existence when men apply their energies to nature is all too apparent if banks could create credit they would never be in financial difficulties nor would they go bankrupt as we have seen in recent years a number of bank failures are taking place the ideal savings bank and the bank of the lebanon for example more recently the herstatt bank of germany and the sindona group of banks in italy the israel british bank london with deficits of over 40 millions many of the 40 or so fringe banks are in dire trouble and some have gone into liquidation including mr jeremy thorpe s london counties bank his insight into the political future has not helped him in his banking adventures many of these failed banks had the dubious benefit of advice from economic and political experts forecasting the future of capitalism once again they have come unstuck and we can say with certainty that more banks will fail as the competition increases the large fish will gobble up the little ones credit creation a myth in these circumstances why did these banks not create a bit of credit for themselves and literally pull themselves up with their own shoelaces the answer is all too obvious the credit of the banker is provided only by his depositors this is real money it matters not whether the bank transfers depositors credit to a bad risk or a dud enterprise he is liable for its return at the present time the property market has turned out to be a bad financial risk and the little fish are in trouble having lent long to property speculators and borrowed short from their bigger brothers the alleged rescue operations organized by the bank of england are nothing other than the lambs being eaten up by the wolves the smaller fry of the financial and banking world are no more immune from the centralization of capital than the small car firms garages shopkeepers etc in the last four years the big five banks westminster barclay s national provincial lloyd s and midland have become the bigger four a number of scottish banks have been taken over by the big four the bank of scotland for example is now under the control of barclay s whilst the clydesdale bank is controlled by midland national westminster controls coutts co also the ulster bank ltd lloyd s control the bank of london and south america the national bank of new zealand and many others if these small satellites wanted to remain independent all they need have done was to create credit by increasing their capital by a stroke of the pen such fictitious capital would no doubt pay a fictitious dividend and create a series of fictitious deposits unfortunately however the original depositors who have loaned real money have no sense of fiction even the science fiction of the economic experts and would require repayment in very realistic banknotes the bank profits for 1973 the last accounting year of the london clearing banks and subsidiaries do not bear out the miraculous power of credit creation although this was a bumper year the total profits after tax were 335 7 millions annual statement for 1973 this is a large profit but it is only a small portion of the total industrial profit inflation fraud the one institution which appears to create credit is the state operating through the bank of england this is an act of deliberate political policy the reasons for which will be given in a separate article the government in a variety of ways instructs the bank of england to print an excess of paper currency which the government uses to finance its own schemes and without having to introduce tax legislation to deal with particular cases this inflation of the currency does not nor cannot add to existing wealth what is really happening is that far from creating credit the government is confiscating other people s this has the same effect as a general increase in taxation the constant dilution of the purchasing power of money by inflation raises prices and dislocates production and distribution this is public fraud posing as public credit capitalism is a system of production and distribution with many contradictions and inflation adds yet another whatever strategy is worked out by economic planners and monetary specialists will make no difference capitalism will run according to its own laws and they can only run after it after all who ever heard of an expert on anarchy

winner daniel kahneman is our guest and as always we ve got a couple of stocks on our radar but we begin with the market in general the s p 500 hit a new all time high this week this comes amid growing concerns about inflation and yet ron gross to borrow from taylor swift investors are shaking off those inflation fears but should they ron gross i think a little bit of concern is warranted prices are clearly higher from food to cars to energy real estate some of this is transitory as the economy reopens but the question is will all that stimulus money that was pumped into the economy plus the fed s quantitative easing programs lead to more sustained inflation supply chain problems labor shortage have added to the increase in prices we re seeing now again it s cars and it s even your burrito at chipotle it s very widespread and i do think some higher prices are here for a while are we looking at a repeat of the 1970s i don t think so i certainly don t hope so but deutsche bank a bit of an outlier here thinks perhaps so inflation is more likely to persist in their opinion it s going to lead to a crisis in the years ahead but again they are the outlier the conventional wisdom is that a lot of this is transitory one other problem to keep an eye on wages are not keeping up with inflation we definitely should watch that but i am glad to see the fed s recent announcement that it will begin to taper its quantitative easing program it s bond buying program in august or september it s important to start unwinding some of that stimulus it ll be interesting to watch if the fed eases up or changes their minds and their willingness to tolerate inflation that is higher than 2 which was previously their line in the sand hill but have you seen anything so far that makes you think you know what maybe i shouldn t be buying stocks right now gross no primarily because stocks are a pretty good place to be even in an inflationary environment certainly there are specific sectors that will benefit more than others commodities banks industrials energy but just in general as prices are rising stocks are a pretty ok place to be hill let s move on to some earnings chewy s first quarter results were better than wall street was expecting but the goodness was quickly overshadowed when the pets products retailer warned about supply chain issues and shares of chewy down more than 5 on friday jason jason moser well speaking of inflation and supply chain issues it s not just semiconductors chris yeah i think chewy represents a very powerful combination here of not only growing the customer base but growing wallets as well you want to be aware of these types of opportunities and it seems that chewy is really becoming what i mean by this is over the last two years the company s increased their active customer base by about 75 that means a large part of their customer base is still very much in the beginning stages of that relationship for context why that matters chewy customers historically spend over 400 with the business in their second year compared to approximately 700 in their fifth year and almost 900 in their ninth year it s something worth keeping in mind and given the nature of their market that they pursue in pets there is some durability there i think but when we look at the actual quarter itself really strong results they added 4 7 million net active customers up to 31 6 ended the quarter now with just under 20 million active customers if you look at sales net sales were up 32 from a year ago to 2 14 billion autoship continues to gain a little bit more of that share those sales were up 34 4 autoship now represents almost 70 of total sales for this business and customers continue to spend more as well hey bonus positive net income chris not even adjusted just a positive net income and they re raising full year 2021 net sales guidance that s going to be about 25 top line growth there for the year a lot of things to really like i wouldn t read too much into the markets trepidation here it seems like this business is really executing hill huge first quarter results from rh the home furnishings retailer formerly known as restoration hardware had profits and revenue higher than expected they raised guidance for the full fiscal year and shares of rh up more than 10 as we run you ve really got to tip your hat to what they are doing gross a firing on all cylinders report if i ever seen one chris let s not forget they are anniversarying some pretty weak pandemic numbers but still this is pretty exciting and we ve talked about the performance of the stock before over the last five years up more than 2 500 as they really transform their business and this quarter is no exception the net revenue is up 78 adjusted gross margin up 550 basis points operating margins up 1 200 basis points as 1 2 and now standing at 22 6 operating margins for specialty furniture retailers is pretty darn impressive adjusted net income of 375 the ceo pointed out several unique things about their business model that s been allowing them to put up these results and then i buy into them i think they make sense it s not a very seasonal inventory business they have similar inventory throughout the year limited fashion risk their modeling their designs don t change yearly or quarterly it s more on a multiyear basis they ve got a very impressive membership model that they moved to several years ago some including me were a little skeptical about it it s worked out really nicely and there is now a luxury brand right up there with some of the higher brands that you would recognize that s really accruing to the bottom line they increase their guidance as you say revenue growth in fiscal 21 expected to be 25 30 versus a prior outlook of 15 20 they re growing they see accelerating growth in fiscal 22 and beyond they re launching the new digital portal they re expanding internationally they think they can be at 20 billion to 25 billion global brand in their current form and that s up from where we are now at the 3 billion business so perhaps some really strong growth runways ahead hill marvell technology is not in the superhero business they are in the semiconductor business and business appears to be good these days shares up more than 5 this week after first quarter profits came in higher than expected jason the stock is close to an all time high how good is it going at marvell these days moser well this is a really attractive way for folks to invest in the 5g opportunity if you hold onto these shares long enough chris you may feel like a superhero with that said you could be forgiven if this company was off of your radar over the last five or so years because the top line really hasn t gone anywhere as we have seen so much saturation in the mobile market but r d as a percentage of revenues average about 35 annually since 2016 for these guys it s because they ve been investing in just this very 5g opportunity and it s starting to pay off the management is now targeting 10 15 top line growth over the next several years thanks to key growth drivers and 5g cloud automotive you look at the numbers net revenue for the quarter 832 million was up 20 from a year ago gross margins look strong at 64 3 and if you look at that revenue growth of 20 it was 17 organically if you exclude the recent infi acquisition that they just closed on i think that s going to be a good one that will expand their capabilities here but the business itself is really divided into two primary segments and networking which grew 21 from a year ago storage revenue which grew 17 from a year ago infi really gives them more exposure on that storage and data center side management did note a pause in china s 5g investments there is some exposure there but that exposure is decreasing this is a company that s diversifying its revenue stream geographically speaking and customer wise as well just to put some numbers around that they traditionally have relied on western digital toshiba and seagate as primary customers that was about 45 of total revenue just a couple of years ago now those numbers are down considerably below 30 all in all i think this is a company that s made a lot of investments really excited to see what they ve got in store for the next decade hill coming up we ve got retail restaurants and a hot ipo if you re an investor you re right where you should be you re listening to motley fool money welcome back to motley fool money chris hill here with jason moser and ron gross wall street was expecting dave and buster s to report a loss in the first quarter but the restaurant and entertainment chain surprised the analysts with an actual profit ron shares of dave and buster s up 7 this week gross yeah back to pre pandemic levels up 50 year to date which just brings them back to pre pandemic this report was not a great report but it was one that was moving in the right direction that s not bad they began the fiscal first quarter with 76 of their 141 stores opened almost all of their restaurants the stores are open now most stores were opened during the quarter under reduced hours and capacity limitations this is nothing new to the covid story obviously revenue was up 66 but again obviously anniversarying pandemic level revenue they ve provided us with comparisons to 2019 which a lot of retailers a lot of restaurants have been doing i appreciate that if we compare it the q1 of 2019 revenue was actually down 27 again much more of a true picture there than a 66 increase overall comparable store sales declined 35 when you compare it to the first quarter of 2019 so it s just very important to get a good picture of what s going on there but as you said net income totaled 20 million that s compared to about 40 million in 2019 again down but still profitable ended the quarter with only 20 million in cash not a great balance sheet there but they do have 340 million of liquidity available to them i d like to see the balance sheet a little bit stronger there their guidance was pretty good business recovery momentum has continued through the first five weeks of the second quarter again on the right track moving in the right direction hill monday com the work management software company made its public debut on thursday the stock was priced at 155 and finished the day up a little bit more than 20 jason i feel like monday com and their investment bankers really hit the sweet spot for ipos it was up a decent amount but not so much that they left a lot of money on the table moser that s what you like to see i agree totally i can see the potential in a business like this for sure it s not one where i feel it all compelled to get it on the ground floor though i think it s worthwhile for investors just to be patient and learn about this one the business itself they say they democratize the power of software so that organizations can easily build software applications and work management tools that fit their needs they call this work os i would assume it s just a work operating system it s a building block it s no code and low code building blocks to help companies build essentially bespoke software for what they need the value proposition seems to be that the workplaces tend to shape themselves based on pre packaged software that they are given and monday com is ultimately trying to let the workplace shape the software based on what it needs that s great i think that makes sense to a degree but there s a lot of software out there today to me one of the bigger challenges in any company is having the hands of the few inside the company building solutions for the many because people work differently and that seems like it s only going to become more of the case now but the company is doing something right they ve closed 130 000 customers very proud of their culture as matter they say that s why they win i would hope they can maintain that culture the risk that you run there as companies get bigger culture changes but all in all interesting business and nice to see the day had such an uneventful introduction to the public markets hill a bold branding choice when you think about monday as a brand monday doesn t always invoke wonderful feelings moser i was going to lead with that chris but decided to try to be a little bit more optimistic but yeah i see monday com i start thinking about garfield and i might just go to a dark place gross i don t like mondays hill solid end to the fiscal year for casey s general stores fourth quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected despite that shares of casey s down 5 this week i don t know ron this seems like one of those businesses that really stands to benefit from more americans getting on the road this summer gross 100 yeah this was a solid report but as you imagine investors weren t impressed perhaps looking for stronger guidance but these numbers look pretty good to me so total sales up 31 inside the store revenue up almost 15 inside same store sales up almost 13 as guest counts steadily improve as the pandemic subsides obviously inside margins improved by 100 basis points then when we get into fuel the picture changes a little bit fuel gallons sold were up 10 but fuel gross profit was down 11 that s primarily due to really very high fuel margins achieved last year as a result of all the supply and demand shocks that were going on in the earlier stages of covid net income is down 33 during a difficult time obviously but the numbers look pretty good to me they closed on 580 million acquisition of buc ee s convenience stores not a chain that i m familiar with hill big in texas gross big in texas exactly right they re also closing on the acquisition of 49 circle k stores in oklahoma they ve got both organic growth as well as acquisition growth on the table here which will bode well for the coming quarters and end years hill interesting to see that expansion because in different parts of the country people are in some cases very loyal to their brand in the mid atlantic region it s wawa and in the midwest it s casey s gross yeah i love a good wawa i ve never been to casey their new stores as you said are also illinois and nebraska is big for their new acquisition they re adding about 94 stores there are 79 dealer locations but you know people are loyal some folks love sheets some people love as you said wawa i love a good slurpee myself hill shares of stitch fix up 15 this week after the company s third quarter loss was smaller than expected revenue was also higher than expected i don t know jason this seems like one of those quarters that if you re a shareholder it wet your appetite but they re moving in the right direction they still need to do more moser i feel like you really just encapsulated this dilemma that i have with this business it was a strong quarter hats off to them it s very hard for me to see them being able to repeat this performance reliably and consistently i mean fashion it s just too fickle even for a data company like this one but let s give credit where credit is due again it was a strong quarter you look at net revenue 535 million was up 44 now it was a bit of a coiled spring it s certainly understandable but it s not something investors should get used to they re guiding for 22 24 revenue growth here in their company s fourth quarter active clients 4 1 million now that was up 20 from a year ago and net revenue per active client however down slightly 481 it s down 3 from a year ago to me this is a business trying to figure out it s optionality they ve introduced things like a fixed preview where you can actually get an idea of what you are getting before you get it the big question for me it s really going to be on the direct buy from them now clients can engage with direct buy that s something that takes this business model in a fundamentally different direction not to say that that s a bad thing but it s something that they re going to have to work yet it s going to be something that will be a little bit challenging just fashions just too fickle for me to really be able to get too convicted about this business hill real quick new ceo takes over august first for katrina lake how long would you give a new ceo at least a year right moser i would absolutely give her a year maybe it does feel like they have a plan they re executing it is just going to be a matter of whether these new features and investments actually bear fruit hill i don t know about you but the first time i had heard of daniel kahneman it was in michael lewis s best selling book the undoing project a friendship that changed our minds that book explored the partnership between kahneman and amos tversky two israeli psychologists who created the field of behavioral economics in 2002 kahneman was awarded the nobel prize in economic sciences for the work that s done with tversky he s written several books including the best seller thinking fast and slow kahneman latest book is noise a flaw in human judgment it explores why we make bad judgments and how to make better ones recently motley fool senior analyst maria gallagher caught up with daniel kahneman to talk about the wisdom of crowds the wisdom of the markets and how noise applies to investing maria gallagher when we re talking about investing there is an incredible amount of information that we get about companies on a minute by minute basis if you think about the wisdom of crowds affects like you say in the book it averaging the independent judgments of different people tend to improve accuracy so you would think that the information investors get separately and then the average of those generally the stock price would be about that correct price but also like you speak about in the book there are wise crowds and then there are crowds that follow tyrants crowds that believe in magic so as we re thinking about investing and being a part of these crowds how can you tell if a crowd is a wise crowd how can you figure it out with all of this information that we re getting daniel kahneman well in general very few people would want to it s how to think that the market is not wise the market probably has a lot of wisdom in it it s extremely difficult to beat the market because of the feature that the market integrates judgments of the large number of people people who think that they can beat the market most of them are expensively wrong there are a few very few who are able to do this mostly with mathematical tools but individuals who have just the feeling that they can do it had better take a shower gallagher so then when you think about this too so you have that the market has this large crowd and then don t you have those subsections of crowds if you see things like the rise of reddit or of means stocks within these subsections of people do you think that there is the general wise crowd and then within it depending on who you re talking to you maybe talking to people who are wise or not wise kahneman well certainly there are what we see and that s in large part due to social media you can get a crowd that decides on a different valuation of the stock as happened recently and whether to doubt whether they are wise or unwise that is difficult that accounts really pass judgment on it in general you would say that the larger the market the closer it is likely to be statistically to be more or less wise more or less efficient and deciding that you can beat it is a risk that you re taking gallagher interesting through all of your research on noise is there an industry you found to be either the noisiest or the least noisy kahneman actually when we looked at it from the little information we have and this is really the study of noise in some way we always knew that there is noise because methods of judgment by definition we expect some disagreement what we didn t know is how much noise there is so the motivation for the book was that wherever there is judgment there is noise and much more of it than you think because it s a surprising amount of noise that justifies an effort in that direction now this is fairly recent it s recent for us certainly that wherever we look in terms of profession we found way more noise than we had expected and sadly way more noise than people in that field had expected we find it an underwriting you find it in the evaluation of business propositions by venture capitalists you find it in loan approval you find it in patent approval and you find it in medicine and i ve already mentioned symptoms seen so wherever we looked we found a lot of it and even in fingerprint reading now fingerprint reading is much less noisy than underwriting but even there there is some noise people disagree more than almost anyone would think anything that involves judgments you can be virtually certain will involve noise gallagher wow so now the natural question is what should we do to reduce noise in the book it talks a lot about noise hygiene so can you explain a little bit about how that works kahneman well one obvious way of reducing noise is taking judgment out of the equation by imposing rules or algorithms but we know and when that happens because algorithms are noise free when you present the same problem to an algorithm on two occasions you ll get the same answer which isn t true when you ask two underwriters one way of dealing with noise is to play algorithms but of course for the firm for the next few decades we can be certain that human judgment is still going to be the most important source of important decisions there we have a suggestion that we call decision hygiene and it s the deliberately off putting term because the same hygiene has no glamour to it it s like washing your hands like washing your hands you don t know what germ you re killing and if we re successful you ll never know and so those will address procedures that you ve got to trust and adopt and follow and there is a list of them now the simplest of them is to take more than one judgment because when you average judgments you can be mechanically certain if the judgments are independent of each other that averaging reduces noise so that s one piece of advice the other piece of advice is independence keep if you re averaging judges make them independent if you look at different aspects of the problem make the judgments or the different aspects independent of each other another idea that s related to this is breakup problems to the extent you can into fact based narrower assessments and that s the key delay intuition intuition is the global view that people have that gives them confidence that they ve got it and that their decision is right you don t want to do without intuition but intuition tends to jump to conclusions and so so you are better off by delaying intuition looking at the various facets of the problem and when you have the whole profile of the problem then and only then let your intuition free in integrating the information those are some of the examples of decision hygiene there are more gallagher how does one delay intuition because i would imagine if i m interviewing a candidate and i m breaking it down i m asking the same questions i m putting into the sheet these are going to be i m going to rank them in some numerical way if my gut tells me like i don t really like them and i keep filling out the form how do i delay that gut feeling kahneman well the gut feeling is going to be much attenuated when you are collecting information another thing that happens is that when you conduct an interview in what is called the non structured way then what happens is you get your gut feeling and you spend the rest of the time confirming your gut feeling by asking questions that effectively lead the candidate to confirm your initial hunters when you have a structured set of dimensions the gut feeling is less pronounced and it doesn t affect the intermediate judgments because they re fact based and so you give yourself an opportunity to be surprised you give yourself an opportunity to discover either good things or bad things that were not expected on the basis of your first impression that is an advantage whenever you re surprised when you collect information you are very likely to have learned something the way our mind works we resist surprises we tend to go with our intuition and confirm it and that leads to the lowest end to bias by the way hill if you re listening to us on the radio we have a new station to welcome to the motley fool money affiliate family krqx am 600 in youngstown ohio shout out welcome that s awesome our email address is from long time listener gary car in tucson arizona and he adds parenthetically warm dry and cicada free gary writes jason moser s slight bearishness about twitter a service he uses and appears to like makes me wonder how much should an investor weigh personal enthusiasm or even just constant usage for a product or service i m thinking facebook google spotify apple or on the flip side if the other aspects add up does it matter if you don t particularly like the service or product it s a great question jason because there are great investments to be had in businesses that for one reason or another rub people the wrong way you can look at a business like comcast which for years was routinely at or near the top of the list of the worst customer service brands in america over the long haul that s been a stock that has rewarded shareholders moser yeah i agree it is a great question i feel like we could have an entire show just centered around this question because it is not one simple answer i mean it does depend i think it s very easy to fall into the trap of loving a product and then thinking therefore it s a good investment even the other way around hating something and thinking oh that must be a bad investment and just clearly isn t always the case i mean twitter for example i mean yeah for a very long time i had a bullish outlook on it because it just seems so relevant to people continuing to use it and it just conveys so much information in real time the twitter blue thing was the straw that broke campbell s back because i feel like all of those things that they are asking me to pay for i feel like those are the things they should have been developing here over the last five six seven years that they just didn t then it makes me question management and makes me question vision costco i mean i want to go to a costco like i want to nod a hole in the head but i fully recognize the fact that 100 million families here in the country love the experience apparently and so being able to divorce yourself from your personal feelings and just recognizing the merits of the business it s not an easy thing to do it s an important skill to develop though gross yeah i take great pleasure in owning over long periods of time companies that i appreciate and costco is one of them actually disney would be another example then conversely i don t think i would enjoy being an owner of a company for five or ten years that i didn t think was doing a good job or didn t make the world a better place or didn t make a product or service that i agreed with the one thing to be careful about is those are all typically consumer product related companies and so you ll miss out on some great investments in cloud or biotech or tech in general that you don t come across in your average daily life just to exclude them because you don t have any personal exposure to them on a daily basis would be a mistake but as peter lynch would say finding companies that you use that you d love are a great place to begin an investing journey hill well and it s an opportunity particularly as you said ron consumer facing businesses to do your own boots on the ground research to see what the stores are like are they crowded what is the staff like all that sort of thing but it is important to make sure that you re not alone that you re not on an island like you re the person who loves this there have got to be ways to checkout like wait a minute i m the only one who loves this or do other people love it as well gross yeah i loved my kodak camera boy do i love that it seems i m the only one hill let s get to the stocks on our radar our man behind the glass dan boyd is going to hit you with a question jason moser you re up first what are you looking at this week moser yeah one i ve talked about on the show before one that i ve recommended and i own a company called masimo ticker is m a s i it s a medical device company that has traditionally focused on non invasive monitoring started with monitoring oxygen levels in the blood but they have evolved into much more as technology has allowed but the business itself has a lovely razor blade model they get those units in the hospitals installed and then they can sell these consumables over the last 10 years the razors the installed base machines they ve shipped approximately 2 2 million of these razors in that just as they tremendously installed a base that really ramps up those switching costs as time goes on and the adhesive sensors those consumables the blades that they re very high margin and that s something that they will continue to sell as long as they keep those machines installed something very similar to an intuitive surgical if you will but they ve developed a terrific new platform with a safety net multiple applications that capitalizes on the growth in remote healthcare telemedicine innovative founder leader there with joe kiani just a lot of things to really like about this business i think it s a little bit overlooked right now due to some tough year over year comps from the covid pull forward but there is sequential growth here that s a very positive sign and one that i m very encouraged by here very excited about the future of this company hill dan question about masimo dan boyd chris more of a comment masimo great medical stuff awesome great but let s think about massimo the clothing line real quick moser yes boyd i don t even know if it exists anymore but it was big in the 90s i just remember i knew this older kid in my neighborhood growing up he was ian that was his name he was always really cool he had cool glasses and he always wore a massimo t shirt that guy was just really cool moser yeah well hey listen they sold that stuff like hotcakes and target day and it was popular for a time i m not sure where it is right now but like i ve told you before my sartorial sensibilities are not the greatest gross if you re listening ian please write to us hill is our email address i don t know moser it seems like it could be a tuck in acquisition that masimo makes just to get all those brands under one roof gross now we re talking moser i like the way you re thinking hill ron gross what are you looking at this week gross i m looking at accenture acn a name derived from the phrase accent on the future accenture provides consulting technology and outsourcing services in more than 120 countries you may recall it began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm arthur andersen remember the days where they were big six accounting firms i don t know where they ve gone but this company has actually been incorporated in dublin ireland since 2009 so some changes to the company over the years but they produced steady growth strong cash flow they ve got a reliable dividend all thanks to their long term relationships with clients they have newer focus areas like cloud security supply chain and digital manufacturing those are all seeing really solid growth even as their traditional consulting business advances a bit more slowly which is not really surprising in addition to their organic growth they consistently make acquisitions to spur growth enter new markets that s really good but it also can be a risk keep an eye on their capital expenditures as it relates to acquisitions they ve raised their dividends for the last 15 years we love to see the current yields of 1 3 hill dan question about accenture boyd i was going to make fun of the name accent on the future but i was thinking about it just now and accenture is probably the best they could have done i mean what do you get fuacc accture there s nothing there except for accenture so i got to say good on them gross i believe that was an employee who won a contest who recommended that name glad you like it dan hill two very different businesses dan you ve got one you want to add to your watch list boyd chris you know i love a good employee contest i m going to go with accenture moser i hope that employee got some options or something for winning that contest hill no kidding right hopefully they got more than just a gift certificate or something like that all right jason moser ron gross guys thanks for being here moser thanks chris hill that s going to do it for this week s edition of motley fool money the show is mixed by dan boyd our producer is mac greer i m chris hill thanks for listening we ll see you next week

10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 this video was recorded on june 11 2021 chris hill we ve got the latest headlines from wall street nobel prize winner daniel kahneman is our guest and as always we ve got a couple of stocks on our radar but we begin with the market in general the s p 500 hit a new all time high this week this comes amid growing concerns about inflation and yet ron gross to borrow from taylor swift investors are shaking off those inflation fears but should they ron gross i think a little bit of concern is warranted prices are clearly higher from food to cars to energy real estate some of this is transitory as the economy reopens but the question is will all that stimulus money that was pumped into the economy plus the fed s quantitative easing programs lead to more sustained inflation supply chain problems labor shortage have added to the increase in prices we re seeing now again it s cars and it s even your burrito at chipotle it s very widespread and i do think some higher prices are here for a while are we looking at a repeat of the 1970s i don t think so i certainly don t hope so but deutsche bank a bit of an outlier here thinks perhaps so inflation is more likely to persist in their opinion it s going to lead to a crisis in the years ahead but again they are the outlier the conventional wisdom is that a lot of this is transitory one other problem to keep an eye on wages are not keeping up with inflation we definitely should watch that but i am glad to see the fed s recent announcement that it will begin to taper its quantitative easing program it s bond buying program in august or september it s important to start unwinding some of that stimulus it ll be interesting to watch if the fed eases up or changes their minds and their willingness to tolerate inflation that is higher than 2 which was previously their line in the sand hill but have you seen anything so far that makes you think you know what maybe i shouldn t be buying stocks right now gross no primarily because stocks are a pretty good place to be even in an inflationary environment certainly there are specific sectors that will benefit more than others commodities banks industrials energy but just in general as prices are rising stocks are a pretty ok place to be hill let s move on to some earnings chewy s first quarter results were better than wall street was expecting but the goodness was quickly overshadowed when the pets products retailer warned about supply chain issues and shares of chewy down more than 5 on friday jason jason moser well speaking of inflation and supply chain issues it s not just semiconductors chris yeah i think chewy represents a very powerful combination here of not only growing the customer base but growing wallets as well you want to be aware of these types of opportunities and it seems that chewy is really becoming what i mean by this is over the last two years the company s increased their active customer base by about 75 that means a large part of their customer base is still very much in the beginning stages of that relationship for context why that matters chewy customers historically spend over 400 with the business in their second year compared to approximately 700 in their fifth year and almost 900 in their ninth year it s something worth keeping in mind and given the nature of their market that they pursue in pets there is some durability there i think but when we look at the actual quarter itself really strong results they added 4 7 million net active customers up to 31 6 ended the quarter now with just under 20 million active customers if you look at sales net sales were up 32 from a year ago to 2 14 billion autoship continues to gain a little bit more of that share those sales were up 34 4 autoship now represents almost 70 of total sales for this business and customers continue to spend more as well hey bonus positive net income chris not even adjusted just a positive net income and they re raising full year 2021 net sales guidance that s going to be about 25 top line growth there for the year a lot of things to really like i wouldn t read too much into the markets trepidation here it seems like this business is really executing hill huge first quarter results from rh the home furnishings retailer formerly known as restoration hardware had profits and revenue higher than expected they raised guidance for the full fiscal year and shares of rh up more than 10 as we run you ve really got to tip your hat to what they are doing gross a firing on all cylinders report if i ever seen one chris let s not forget they are anniversarying some pretty weak pandemic numbers but still this is pretty exciting and we ve talked about the performance of the stock before over the last five years up more than 2 500 as they really transform their business and this quarter is no exception the net revenue is up 78 adjusted gross margin up 550 basis points operating margins up 1 200 basis points as 1 2 and now standing at 22 6 operating margins for specialty furniture retailers is pretty darn impressive adjusted net income of 375 the ceo pointed out several unique things about their business model that s been allowing them to put up these results and then i buy into them i think they make sense it s not a very seasonal inventory business they have similar inventory throughout the year limited fashion risk their modeling their designs don t change yearly or quarterly it s more on a multiyear basis they ve got a very impressive membership model that they moved to several years ago some including me were a little skeptical about it it s worked out really nicely and there is now a luxury brand right up there with some of the higher brands that you would recognize that s really accruing to the bottom line they increase their guidance as you say revenue growth in fiscal 21 expected to be 25 30 versus a prior outlook of 15 20 they re growing they see accelerating growth in fiscal 22 and beyond they re launching the new digital portal they re expanding internationally they think they can be at 20 billion to 25 billion global brand in their current form and that s up from where we are now at the 3 billion business so perhaps some really strong growth runways ahead hill marvell technology is not in the superhero business they are in the semiconductor business and business appears to be good these days shares up more than 5 this week after first quarter profits came in higher than expected jason the stock is close to an all time high how good is it going at marvell these days moser well this is a really attractive way for folks to invest in the 5g opportunity if you hold onto these shares long enough chris you may feel like a superhero with that said you could be forgiven if this company was off of your radar over the last five or so years because the top line really hasn t gone anywhere as we have seen so much saturation in the mobile market but r d as a percentage of revenues average about 35 annually since 2016 for these guys it s because they ve been investing in just this very 5g opportunity and it s starting to pay off the management is now targeting 10 15 top line growth over the next several years thanks to key growth drivers and 5g cloud automotive you look at the numbers net revenue for the quarter 832 million was up 20 from a year ago gross margins look strong at 64 3 and if you look at that revenue growth of 20 it was 17 organically if you exclude the recent infi acquisition that they just closed on i think that s going to be a good one that will expand their capabilities here but the business itself is really divided into two primary segments and networking which grew 21 from a year ago storage revenue which grew 17 from a year ago infi really gives them more exposure on that storage and data center side management did note a pause in china s 5g investments there is some exposure there but that exposure is decreasing this is a company that s diversifying its revenue stream geographically speaking and customer wise as well just to put some numbers around that they traditionally have relied on western digital toshiba and seagate as primary customers that was about 45 of total revenue just a couple of years ago now those numbers are down considerably below 30 all in all i think this is a company that s made a lot of investments really excited to see what they ve got in store for the next decade hill coming up we ve got retail restaurants and a hot ipo if you re an investor you re right where you should be you re listening to motley fool money welcome back to motley fool money chris hill here with jason moser and ron gross wall street was expecting dave and buster s to report a loss in the first quarter but the restaurant and entertainment chain surprised the analysts with an actual profit ron shares of dave and buster s up 7 this week gross yeah back to pre pandemic levels up 50 year to date which just brings them back to pre pandemic this report was not a great report but it was one that was moving in the right direction that s not bad they began the fiscal first quarter with 76 of their 141 stores opened almost all of their restaurants the stores are open now most stores were opened during the quarter under reduced hours and capacity limitations this is nothing new to the covid story obviously revenue was up 66 but again obviously anniversarying pandemic level revenue they ve provided us with comparisons to 2019 which a lot of retailers a lot of restaurants have been doing i appreciate that if we compare it the q1 of 2019 revenue was actually down 27 again much more of a true picture there than a 66 increase overall comparable store sales declined 35 when you compare it to the first quarter of 2019 so it s just very important to get a good picture of what s going on there but as you said net income totaled 20 million that s compared to about 40 million in 2019 again down but still profitable ended the quarter with only 20 million in cash not a great balance sheet there but they do have 340 million of liquidity available to them i d like to see the balance sheet a little bit stronger there their guidance was pretty good business recovery momentum has continued through the first five weeks of the second quarter again on the right track moving in the right direction hill monday com the work management software company made its public debut on thursday the stock was priced at 155 and finished the day up a little bit more than 20 jason i feel like monday com and their investment bankers really hit the sweet spot for ipos it was up a decent amount but not so much that they left a lot of money on the table moser that s what you like to see i agree totally i can see the potential in a business like this for sure it s not one where i feel it all compelled to get it on the ground floor though i think it s worthwhile for investors just to be patient and learn about this one the business itself they say they democratize the power of software so that organizations can easily build software applications and work management tools that fit their needs they call this work os i would assume it s just a work operating system it s a building block it s no code and low code building blocks to help companies build essentially bespoke software for what they need the value proposition seems to be that the workplaces tend to shape themselves based on pre packaged software that they are given and monday com is ultimately trying to let the workplace shape the software based on what it needs that s great i think that makes sense to a degree but there s a lot of software out there today to me one of the bigger challenges in any company is having the hands of the few inside the company building solutions for the many because people work differently and that seems like it s only going to become more of the case now but the company is doing something right they ve closed 130 000 customers very proud of their culture as matter they say that s why they win i would hope they can maintain that culture the risk that you run there as companies get bigger culture changes but all in all interesting business and nice to see the day had such an uneventful introduction to the public markets hill a bold branding choice when you think about monday as a brand monday doesn t always invoke wonderful feelings moser i was going to lead with that chris but decided to try to be a little bit more optimistic but yeah i see monday com i start thinking about garfield and i might just go to a dark place gross i don t like mondays hill solid end to the fiscal year for casey s general stores fourth quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected despite that shares of casey s down 5 this week i don t know ron this seems like one of those businesses that really stands to benefit from more americans getting on the road this summer gross 100 yeah this was a solid report but as you imagine investors weren t impressed perhaps looking for stronger guidance but these numbers look pretty good to me so total sales up 31 inside the store revenue up almost 15 inside same store sales up almost 13 as guest counts steadily improve as the pandemic subsides obviously inside margins improved by 100 basis points then when we get into fuel the picture changes a little bit fuel gallons sold were up 10 but fuel gross profit was down 11 that s primarily due to really very high fuel margins achieved last year as a result of all the supply and demand shocks that were going on in the earlier stages of covid net income is down 33 during a difficult time obviously but the numbers look pretty good to me they closed on 580 million acquisition of buc ee s convenience stores not a chain that i m familiar with hill big in texas gross big in texas exactly right they re also closing on the acquisition of 49 circle k stores in oklahoma they ve got both organic growth as well as acquisition growth on the table here which will bode well for the coming quarters and end years hill interesting to see that expansion because in different parts of the country people are in some cases very loyal to their brand in the mid atlantic region it s wawa and in the midwest it s casey s gross yeah i love a good wawa i ve never been to casey their new stores as you said are also illinois and nebraska is big for their new acquisition they re adding about 94 stores there are 79 dealer locations but you know people are loyal some folks love sheets some people love as you said wawa i love a good slurpee myself hill shares of stitch fix up 15 this week after the company s third quarter loss was smaller than expected revenue was also higher than expected i don t know jason this seems like one of those quarters that if you re a shareholder it wet your appetite but they re moving in the right direction they still need to do more moser i feel like you really just encapsulated this dilemma that i have with this business it was a strong quarter hats off to them it s very hard for me to see them being able to repeat this performance reliably and consistently i mean fashion it s just too fickle even for a data company like this one but let s give credit where credit is due again it was a strong quarter you look at net revenue 535 million was up 44 now it was a bit of a coiled spring it s certainly understandable but it s not something investors should get used to they re guiding for 22 24 revenue growth here in their company s fourth quarter active clients 4 1 million now that was up 20 from a year ago and net revenue per active client however down slightly 481 it s down 3 from a year ago to me this is a business trying to figure out it s optionality they ve introduced things like a fixed preview where you can actually get an idea of what you are getting before you get it the big question for me it s really going to be on the direct buy from them now clients can engage with direct buy that s something that takes this business model in a fundamentally different direction not to say that that s a bad thing but it s something that they re going to have to work yet it s going to be something that will be a little bit challenging just fashions just too fickle for me to really be able to get too convicted about this business hill real quick new ceo takes over august first for katrina lake how long would you give a new ceo at least a year right moser i would absolutely give her a year maybe it does feel like they have a plan they re executing it is just going to be a matter of whether these new features and investments actually bear fruit hill i don t know about you but the first time i had heard of daniel kahneman it was in michael lewis s best selling book the undoing project a friendship that changed our minds that book explored the partnership between kahneman and amos tversky two israeli psychologists who created the field of behavioral economics in 2002 kahneman was awarded the nobel prize in economic sciences for the work that s done with tversky he s written several books including the best seller thinking fast and slow kahneman latest book is noise a flaw in human judgment it explores why we make bad judgments and how to make better ones recently motley fool senior analyst maria gallagher caught up with daniel kahneman to talk about the wisdom of crowds the wisdom of the markets and how noise applies to investing maria gallagher when we re talking about investing there is an incredible amount of information that we get about companies on a minute by minute basis if you think about the wisdom of crowds affects like you say in the book it averaging the independent judgments of different people tend to improve accuracy so you would think that the information investors get separately and then the average of those generally the stock price would be about that correct price but also like you speak about in the book there are wise crowds and then there are crowds that follow tyrants crowds that believe in magic so as we re thinking about investing and being a part of these crowds how can you tell if a crowd is a wise crowd how can you figure it out with all of this information that we re getting daniel kahneman well in general very few people would want to it s how to think that the market is not wise the market probably has a lot of wisdom in it it s extremely difficult to beat the market because of the feature that the market integrates judgments of the large number of people people who think that they can beat the market most of them are expensively wrong there are a few very few who are able to do this mostly with mathematical tools but individuals who have just the feeling that they can do it had better take a shower gallagher so then when you think about this too so you have that the market has this large crowd and then don t you have those subsections of crowds if you see things like the rise of reddit or of means stocks within these subsections of people do you think that there is the general wise crowd and then within it depending on who you re talking to you maybe talking to people who are wise or not wise kahneman well certainly there are what we see and that s in large part due to social media you can get a crowd that decides on a different valuation of the stock as happened recently and whether to doubt whether they are wise or unwise that is difficult that accounts really pass judgment on it in general you would say that the larger the market the closer it is likely to be statistically to be more or less wise more or less efficient and deciding that you can beat it is a risk that you re taking gallagher interesting through all of your research on noise is there an industry you found to be either the noisiest or the least noisy kahneman actually when we looked at it from the little information we have and this is really the study of noise in some way we always knew that there is noise because methods of judgment by definition we expect some disagreement what we didn t know is how much noise there is so the motivation for the book was that wherever there is judgment there is noise and much more of it than you think because it s a surprising amount of noise that justifies an effort in that direction now this is fairly recent it s recent for us certainly that wherever we look in terms of profession we found way more noise than we had expected and sadly way more noise than people in that field had expected we find it an underwriting you find it in the evaluation of business propositions by venture capitalists you find it in loan approval you find it in patent approval and you find it in medicine and i ve already mentioned symptoms seen so wherever we looked we found a lot of it and even in fingerprint reading now fingerprint reading is much less noisy than underwriting but even there there is some noise people disagree more than almost anyone would think anything that involves judgments you can be virtually certain will involve noise gallagher wow so now the natural question is what should we do to reduce noise in the book it talks a lot about noise hygiene so can you explain a little bit about how that works kahneman well one obvious way of reducing noise is taking judgment out of the equation by imposing rules or algorithms but we know and when that happens because algorithms are noise free when you present the same problem to an algorithm on two occasions you ll get the same answer which isn t true when you ask two underwriters one way of dealing with noise is to play algorithms but of course for the firm for the next few decades we can be certain that human judgment is still going to be the most important source of important decisions there we have a suggestion that we call decision hygiene and it s the deliberately off putting term because the same hygiene has no glamour to it it s like washing your hands like washing your hands you don t know what germ you re killing and if we re successful you ll never know and so those will address procedures that you ve got to trust and adopt and follow and there is a list of them now the simplest of them is to take more than one judgment because when you average judgments you can be mechanically certain if the judgments are independent of each other that averaging reduces noise so that s one piece of advice the other piece of advice is independence keep if you re averaging judges make them independent if you look at different aspects of the problem make the judgments or the different aspects independent of each other another idea that s related to this is breakup problems to the extent you can into fact based narrower assessments and that s the key delay intuition intuition is the global view that people have that gives them confidence that they ve got it and that their decision is right you don t want to do without intuition but intuition tends to jump to conclusions and so so you are better off by delaying intuition looking at the various facets of the problem and when you have the whole profile of the problem then and only then let your intuition free in integrating the information those are some of the examples of decision hygiene there are more gallagher how does one delay intuition because i would imagine if i m interviewing a candidate and i m breaking it down i m asking the same questions i m putting into the sheet these are going to be i m going to rank them in some numerical way if my gut tells me like i don t really like them and i keep filling out the form how do i delay that gut feeling kahneman well the gut feeling is going to be much attenuated when you are collecting information another thing that happens is that when you conduct an interview in what is called the non structured way then what happens is you get your gut feeling and you spend the rest of the time confirming your gut feeling by asking questions that effectively lead the candidate to confirm your initial hunters when you have a structured set of dimensions the gut feeling is less pronounced and it doesn t affect the intermediate judgments because they re fact based and so you give yourself an opportunity to be surprised you give yourself an opportunity to discover either good things or bad things that were not expected on the basis of your first impression that is an advantage whenever you re surprised when you collect information you are very likely to have learned something the way our mind works we resist surprises we tend to go with our intuition and confirm it and that leads to the lowest end to bias by the way hill if you re listening to us on the radio we have a new station to welcome to the motley fool money affiliate family krqx am 600 in youngstown ohio shout out welcome that s awesome our email address is from long time listener gary car in tucson arizona and he adds parenthetically warm dry and cicada free gary writes jason moser s slight bearishness about twitter a service he uses and appears to like makes me wonder how much should an investor weigh personal enthusiasm or even just constant usage for a product or service i m thinking facebook google spotify apple or on the flip side if the other aspects add up does it matter if you don t particularly like the service or product it s a great question jason because there are great investments to be had in businesses that for one reason or another rub people the wrong way you can look at a business like comcast which for years was routinely at or near the top of the list of the worst customer service brands in america over the long haul that s been a stock that has rewarded shareholders moser yeah i agree it is a great question i feel like we could have an entire show just centered around this question because it is not one simple answer i mean it does depend i think it s very easy to fall into the trap of loving a product and then thinking therefore it s a good investment even the other way around hating something and thinking oh that must be a bad investment and just clearly isn t always the case i mean twitter for example i mean yeah for a very long time i had a bullish outlook on it because it just seems so relevant to people continuing to use it and it just conveys so much information in real time the twitter blue thing was the straw that broke campbell s back because i feel like all of those things that they are asking me to pay for i feel like those are the things they should have been developing here over the last five six seven years that they just didn t then it makes me question management and makes me question vision costco i mean i want to go to a costco like i want to nod a hole in the head but i fully recognize the fact that 100 million families here in the country love the experience apparently and so being able to divorce yourself from your personal feelings and just recognizing the merits of the business it s not an easy thing to do it s an important skill to develop though gross yeah i take great pleasure in owning over long periods of time companies that i appreciate and costco is one of them actually disney would be another example then conversely i don t think i would enjoy being an owner of a company for five or ten years that i didn t think was doing a good job or didn t make the world a better place or didn t make a product or service that i agreed with the one thing to be careful about is those are all typically consumer product related companies and so you ll miss out on some great investments in cloud or biotech or tech in general that you don t come across in your average daily life just to exclude them because you don t have any personal exposure to them on a daily basis would be a mistake but as peter lynch would say finding companies that you use that you d love are a great place to begin an investing journey hill well and it s an opportunity particularly as you said ron consumer facing businesses to do your own boots on the ground research to see what the stores are like are they crowded what is the staff like all that sort of thing but it is important to make sure that you re not alone that you re not on an island like you re the person who loves this there have got to be ways to checkout like wait a minute i m the only one who loves this or do other people love it as well gross yeah i loved my kodak camera boy do i love that it seems i m the only one hill let s get to the stocks on our radar our man behind the glass dan boyd is going to hit you with a question jason moser you re up first what are you looking at this week moser yeah one i ve talked about on the show before one that i ve recommended and i own a company called masimo ticker is m a s i it s a medical device company that has traditionally focused on non invasive monitoring started with monitoring oxygen levels in the blood but they have evolved into much more as technology has allowed but the business itself has a lovely razor blade model they get those units in the hospitals installed and then they can sell these consumables over the last 10 years the razors the installed base machines they ve shipped approximately 2 2 million of these razors in that just as they tremendously installed a base that really ramps up those switching costs as time goes on and the adhesive sensors those consumables the blades that they re very high margin and that s something that they will continue to sell as long as they keep those machines installed something very similar to an intuitive surgical if you will but they ve developed a terrific new platform with a safety net multiple applications that capitalizes on the growth in remote healthcare telemedicine innovative founder leader there with joe kiani just a lot of things to really like about this business i think it s a little bit overlooked right now due to some tough year over year comps from the covid pull forward but there is sequential growth here that s a very positive sign and one that i m very encouraged by here very excited about the future of this company hill dan question about masimo dan boyd chris more of a comment masimo great medical stuff awesome great but let s think about massimo the clothing line real quick moser yes boyd i don t even know if it exists anymore but it was big in the 90s i just remember i knew this older kid in my neighborhood growing up he was ian that was his name he was always really cool he had cool glasses and he always wore a massimo t shirt that guy was just really cool moser yeah well hey listen they sold that stuff like hotcakes and target day and it was popular for a time i m not sure where it is right now but like i ve told you before my sartorial sensibilities are not the greatest gross if you re listening ian please write to us hill is our email address i don t know moser it seems like it could be a tuck in acquisition that masimo makes just to get all those brands under one roof gross now we re talking moser i like the way you re thinking hill ron gross what are you looking at this week gross i m looking at accenture acn a name derived from the phrase accent on the future accenture provides consulting technology and outsourcing services in more than 120 countries you may recall it began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm arthur andersen remember the days where they were big six accounting firms i don t know where they ve gone but this company has actually been incorporated in dublin ireland since 2009 so some changes to the company over the years but they produced steady growth strong cash flow they ve got a reliable dividend all thanks to their long term relationships with clients they have newer focus areas like cloud security supply chain and digital manufacturing those are all seeing really solid growth even as their traditional consulting business advances a bit more slowly which is not really surprising in addition to their organic growth they consistently make acquisitions to spur growth enter new markets that s really good but it also can be a risk keep an eye on their capital expenditures as it relates to acquisitions they ve raised their dividends for the last 15 years we love to see the current yields of 1 3 hill dan question about accenture boyd i was going to make fun of the name accent on the future but i was thinking about it just now and accenture is probably the best they could have done i mean what do you get fuacc accture there s nothing there except for accenture so i got to say good on them gross i believe that was an employee who won a contest who recommended that name glad you like it dan hill two very different businesses dan you ve got one you want to add to your watch list boyd chris you know i love a good employee contest i m going to go with accenture moser i hope that employee got some options or something for winning that contest hill no kidding right hopefully they got more than just a gift certificate or something like that all right jason moser ron gross guys thanks for being here moser thanks chris hill that s going to do it for this week s edition of motley fool money the show is mixed by dan boyd our producer is mac greer i m chris hill thanks for listening we ll see you next week
john templeton is said to have almost single handedly pioneered global investing in 1980 a maoist guerrilla organisation called the shining path took over peru imposing what it called a dictatorship of the proletariat western economies branded the organisation a terrorist group and curtailed economic activity the peruvian stock market collapsed peruvian stocks were dirt cheap and the bargains tempting as foreigners were not permitted to buy stocks templeton formed a peruvian corporation and used it as a holding company when the reign of the shining path ended and political stability was restored economic activity picked up taking the peruvian stock market along with it john templeton won hands down he is said to be the first western investor to see the potential of japan s post war economic miracle when templeton began investing in japan in the 1960s it was considered an emerging market and a risky investment adventure he found stocks trading at a p e ratio of only 4 times his estimate of earnings while stocks in the us were trading at around 19 5 times this despite the japanese economy growing faster than the us by 1985 when the country exploded onto the global economic landscape templeton had already made a fortune his optimism in the face of bleak pessimism was his greatest weapon as an investor but so was his ability to scout across borders for bargains good ideas don t have borders diversification is measured across numerous dimensions assets stocks industries sectors and strategy and it is not rare to find investors fairly well spread along these lines however when it comes to investing overseas many investors ditch diversification at the border don t be one of them global investing is not only about faang stocks which are undoubtedly coveted by investors across the globe an indian fintwit handle recently requested others to tweet the names of global stocks they would like to own nvidia which is into artificial intelligence home depot starbucks coca cola tesla and blackrock were a few mentioned global investing allows you to get exposure to sectors that are not publicly listed in india mining stocks for instance globally there are no shortage of options sibanye stillwater headquartered in south africa trilogy metals canada glencore switzerland bhp australia rio tinto london and vale brazil in a conversation in 2019 in chicago rupal bhansali the chief investment officer and portfolio manager of ariel s international and global equity strategies articulated this brilliantly if she wanted to own a tyre company and restricted herself to the us she would be forced to own goodyear which she believed was not idiosyncratically a good name to own its manufacturing process was not well evolved they had not invested sufficient in technology and r d or in training their workers they were facing difficulties in ramping to the higher rim size models of tyres which are prevalent in suvs and premium cars the traditional 16 inch tyre market was commoditized and that was not where the money was besides it was an extremely leveraged company but if she decided to scout for the best tyre company in the world she could invest in either michelin france or bridgestone japan if diversification is the only free lunch in investing as harry markowitz declared indians might be leaving a lot on the table by ignoring global stocks there is tremendous value in diversifying your portfolio across geographies the behavioural impact when the intangibles rest on misplaced conclusions investors tend to have a home bias because it is a preference for the familiar they feel that they know their local markets and firms better than those over seas in this day and age this is a flimsy excuse asymmetries in knowledge and information are not insurmountable the world is increasingly flat and barriers to the movement of information and capital continue to come down another intangible is the pride in their nation and its champions of industry misguided patriotism is not a legitimate reason to shirk global investing if it was an unpatriotic act the government would not have permitted retail investors the option of investing abroad further no one is suggesting that you invest globally to the exclusion of indian stocks it is only a portion of your portfolio that will have a global allocation maintaining your patriotism and investing internationally are not mutually exclusive similarly global investors who invest in the indian stock market are not unpatriotic to their respective countries either they are just logical and unemotional about it for americans domestic stocks represent 55 of the global stock market for australians their market represents only 2 of the global stock market when it comes to india we corner around 2 5 of global stock markets clearly by limiting our investments to only domestically listed companies we are curtailing our portfolio s wealth creation potential no country is destined or entitled to outperform and to invest with that assumption is extremely naïve the last decade has shone the spotlight on us stocks but don t forget the lost decade following the burst of the tech bubble when the s p 500 lagged behind europe and china in 2017 the stock markets in argentina turkey and nigeria had a banner year in 2018 ukraine and macedonia put up a spectacular performance followed by qatar in 2019 greece was not only the top performer in europe but across the globe russia italy and brazil also stood out in 2020 vietnam south korea taiwan and denmark delivered admirably in may 2021 european stocks have hit new all time highs as optimism over the economic recovery continues to lift share prices across the region diversification in all aspects makes your portfolio less vulnerable to vagaries of the market and if done judiciously will make meaningful contributions to your portfolio over the long haul disclaimer the stocks mentioned are purely for illustrative

st paul minnesota lawmakers and gov tim walz are sputtering toward approving a state budget that will set a record for spending but also a record for how much cash will go unspent walz along with top republicans in the senate and top democrats in the house have a general agreement for a two year state budget that will total about 52 billion that s the first time the state will burst the 50 billion ceiling and it compares to the current two year budget of 47 8 billion that feat is accomplished with no new taxes and some tax cuts in addition the plan calls for the state s rainy day fund to swell to 2 4 billion also a record on top of that the plan leaves 1 2 billion in federal relief funds unspent through 2025 and on top of that in may state tax receipts brought in an additional 1 8 billion above what had been forecast in the planning documents lawmakers were using to craft the current budget framework minnesota s government has never had so much money noted rep pat garofalo r farmington who serves as the lead republican on the ways and means committee and is a member of the taxes committee and he s among some lawmakers who think the flushness of minnesota s accounts is misguided people will try to couch it down but it really is a story of two different minnesotas garofalo said in the government big business sector things are really going great look at the stock market now contrast that with small businesses who are trying to claw their way out of the pandemic advertisement to be clear some of the tax cuts and key aspects of new spending are likely to target those hurt most by the pandemic although many details were unknown as lawmakers friday were still hashing out details in secret for many aspects of the budget as a june 30 deadline approached for years whenever minnesota s finances appear strong republicans have generally sought reductions in taxes or fees while democrats have generally sought to expand government programs a fundamental difference in how the two parties approach governing the economy is in unprecedented waters as it emerges from an unprecedented pandemic that carried with it unprecedented government restrictions on commerce it s also important to understand that while minnesota might be flush at the moment large piles of money are essentially one time windfalls and not guaranteed into the future and minnesota is hardly alone in such waters we like not to overuse the word unprecedented but in this case i think that s an appropriate word to use in terms of the challenges of accurately forecasting what would happen to states and specifically state revenues from the federal government said kathryn vesey white director of budget process studies at the national association of state budget officers roller coaster white who leads a team that tracks state spending across the nation said the roller coaster narrative ever since the coronavirus pandemic hit can t be overstated that narrative goes something like this advertisement before the pandemic the economy was growing but states were increasingly being frugal about how they handled it many had been stung during the great recession and a few states including and especially minnesota had adopted specific policies and laws requiring larger cash reserves to handle unforeseen economic catastrophe the pandemic hit the economy shut down and everyone including walz s budget team predicted catastrophe to the surprise of many the pandemic was catastrophic for some parts of the economy think restaurants tourism travel but had little effect on other parts such as finance while it was a boon for others like online retail predictions and forecasts went out the window still many states including minnesota planned to dip into their rainy day funds to ensure that they wouldn t have cash flow problems this spring when a clearer picture began to emerge of actual tax revenues many states including minnesota actually had much higher than expected income at the same time the federal government under a new president and a different makeup of congress was pumping record setting amounts of cash not just to citizens but directly into the accounts of state governments so those accounts became doubly flush to be clear white says as state governments stand today they re by and large actually still below where they were forecast to be under pre pandemic forecasts but they re way above where they were forecast to be mid pandemic minnesota prudence for years minnesota like many other states suffered from budgetary whiplash whenever the state s economy and thus tax revenues and often needs for services took unexpected turns under former gov mark dayton with a legislature often controlled by fellow members of the democratic farmer labor party minnesota sought to learn the lessons of the great recession in 2014 the state reformed its rainy day fund setting a target at 4 8 percent of the state s general fund and requiring a regular analysis of the state s economic volatility the process is unique among the nation s states and an analysis by the pew charitable trusts the following year found it the most rigorous in the country the size of minnesota s rainy day fund is hardly the largest in america such funds are all over the map nevada and illinois for example have all but drained theirs while wyoming and north dakota have funds that eclipse minnesota s as a percentage of their expenses in fact when the pandemic struck state rainy day funds when taken on the whole were at record levels advertisement minnesota s has generally served it well when the doom and gloom forecasts merged early in the pandemic lawmakers and walz essentially agreed to take a breath and see how things progressed they could afford to because even under the dire predictions at the time the state s rainy day fund formally called its budget reserves appeared to have enough money to weather the storm some states weren t so fortunate and had to scramble to make cuts while others with economies based more in tourism and energy were forced to dip into their reserves to keep up with cash flow something minnesota wasn t forced to do in the end there is no national consensus on how big or small a rainy day fund should be state government analysts often say the actual size of the fund depends on how predictable the state s economy is combined with the political and fiscal philosophy of state leaders federal money and timing in all about 8 5 billion in federal covid recovery funds have flowed into minnesota state and local governments of that some 2 8 billion has been designated for the state in largely unrestricted terms the specifics of those funds weren t actually clear until early last month creating a dilemma for leaders in a politically divided state democrats control the house and the governor s office while republicans control the senate working under a looming fiscal deadline as a result walz a democrat house speaker

last thursday us president joe biden signed legislation establishing june 19 juneteenth as a federal holiday to commemorate the end of slavery in the united states the law passed with overwhelming support from both capitalist parties went into effect immediately the holiday was first officially marked on friday since june 19 itself came on a weekend the final emancipation of slaves the culmination of the civil war what historians have aptly called the second american revolution cost the lives of more than 350 000 union soldiers the destruction of the slave oligarchy in the us south was an event of immensely progressive significance not just for american but for world history amidst the endless media commentary on the official marking of the holiday however there is no serious historical examination either of the emancipation of the slaves in 1865 or its revolutionary implications for the present juneteenth celebrates the date in 1865 when enslaved black people in texas learned that they had been freed this came over two months after the surrender of confederate forces by robert e lee to ulysses s grant at appomattox court house in far away virginia and the assassination of abraham lincoln five days later by the racist southern sympathizer john wilkes booth in washington d c in a legal sense the slaves freedom had come earlier still through the emancipation proclamation which liberated slaves in rebel controlled territory and went into effect on january 1 1863 the thirteenth amendment which was passed by congress on january 31 1865 and ratified by the states in december abolished slavery everywhere in the american union the masters attempted to keep slaves in the dark about all of this but on the morning of june 19 1865 union major general gordon granger arrived at galveston texas to take command of more than 2 000 union troops with the aim of enforcing the emancipation of texas enslaved population and ensuring a peaceful transition of power from the slavocracy to the federal government with his announcement of general order no 3 granger dissolved slavery in the last confederate state where it remained effective the order read the people of texas are informed that in accordance with a proclamation from the executive of the united states all slaves are free this involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor with these matter of fact words the union general crystallized the revolutionary content of the civil war the destruction of an entire social order and the freeing of the slaves but also the stark reality of the new order four million workers were no longer the property of others yes but they had no property of their own either they were now free to sell their labor power perhaps to their former masters notwithstanding its limitations the former slaves in galveston celebrated granger s announcement the end of slavery at the point of union bayonets was an enormous advance and the slaves knew it these freedmen as they were called did not sneer at the civil war or lincoln as the contemporary peddlers of racialist politics do on june 19 1866 one year after the announcement the freedmen organized the first of what became the annual celebration of jubilee day now commonly known as juneteenth later the holiday moved out of rural east texas with the sons and daughters of the slaves as they went from country to city and from sharecropping to wage labor none of these issues are even broached in the commentary on the significance of juneteenth in a political climate obsessed with racial identity the occasion of juneteenth has been usurped to advance racialist interpretations of the holiday new york times columnist jamelle bouie summed up the conceptions that are being promoted around juneteenth in a column published one year ago why juneteenth matters according to bouie it was black americans who delivered on lincoln s promise of a new birth of freedom he writes neither abraham lincoln nor the republican party freed the slaves who freed the slaves the slaves freed the slaves bouie s article was aimed to buttress nikole hannah jones claim made in her lead essay of the discredited 1619 project that black americans fought alone in their struggle for emancipation and civil rights a more recent comment on the same theme came on friday in the atlantic in an article by daina ramey berry chair of the history department at the university of texas at austin titled the truth about black freedom responding to the question what is the meaning of juneteenth berry answers by diminishing the importance of the emancipation proclamation and the thirteenth amendment she argues that self liberated black people continuously claimed their freedom in every historical moment always preceding and precipitating movements by governments institutions and corporations the claim that the slaves freed themselves makes the history of the civil war incomprehensible if slaves were able to simply free themselves why did they not do so in say 1750 rather than 1863 1865 why was the civil war necessary at all do berry and bouie believe the old lost cause myth that the civil war was a mistaken struggle waged between brothers to which slavery was only tangentially related and if the slaves freed themselves why was it necessary for general granger to enter galveston with an army some two months after appomattox to deliver the news as bouie absurdly puts it to claim that slaves freed themselves diminishes the horrors of the system of chattel slavery itself which was upheld with a staggering level of violence the abolition of this system required a civil war that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands until as lincoln put it in his second inaugural address every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword in reality the defeat of the wealthiest and most powerful slaveholding class on the planet was inconceivable without the victory of lincoln at the head of a political party that called for the destruction of human bondage lincoln s victory and the threat it posed to slavery was indeed the reason why the southern states seceded as was spelled out in their secession resolutions and the confederate constitution even more crucially the victory of the union would have been inconceivable without mass support in the north the endurance of the union army the resistance of slaves in the south and even the opposition of slaveless whites to secession as historian victoria bynum and others have shown and it was lincoln s proclamation as marx explained at the time that gave the conflict a definite social revolutionary character like those alive during the civil war we live in a time of irreconcilable conflict a similar number of american workers died from covid 19 in one year as union and confederate soldiers died over four years of bloody conflict meanwhile the stock markets continue to break records and the rich have seen their wealth skyrocket terrified of the explosion it is conjuring the american ruling class fears the past nearly as much as the present the essential purpose of the current campaign for the re writing of american history is to replace the dynamics of class and class conflict the slave system was in the end a system of labor exploitation with a racial interpretation that does not permit whites to have been anything other than oppressors of blacks in this new narrative the role of lincoln along with white union soldiers must be diminished or written out the emancipation of the slaves in the civil war like the american revolution of 1776 deserves to be celebrated but class conscious workers in the united states and the world over must not allow the revolutionary significance of the emancipation of four million slaves to be usurped for the defense of capitalism

this article is more than 2 years old photo by universal history archive universal images group via getty images universal images group via getty images pick up your paper carefully this week it is screaming at you inflation is already here the wall street journal inflation jumps to 13 year high the wall street journal fastest rate since 2008 the financial times inflation we all know by now is running hot investors shrug off inflation at their own peril barron s little room for the fed to be wrong on inflation maybe inflation isn t transitory after all wsj smoking hot and inevitably getting hotter it is likely to cause another sharp recession in the us the ft inflation is back squeezing families and businesses recovering from the pandemic biden should be worried cnn even transitory inflation will leave americans permanently worse off wsj inflation leaves global economies sitting on a time bomb we could be on the brink of excruciating economic pain a deutsche bank report reported by barron s the effects could be devastating deutsche bank everything screams inflation wsj how can anyone withstand this pandemonium it issues after all not from some twitter thread but from the experts and the authorities the people who are supposed to know more than you do i say relax and so does the market the media experts are wrong this will become clear over the next few months as things settle down still there is a real danger here if inflation is caused at least in part by an increase in the public s expectations about inflation a rather bizarre idea that has become mainstream thinking in monetary policy making well then these headlines are certainly doing their best to push the process along the symptoms of the media s unhingement are everywhere some journalists are so taken with this narrative that their analyses become de calibrated from the topic and stray into statistical zones that have nothing to do with inflation per se others are so determined to make their point they won t balk at a little disingenuous exaggeration one analyst has tortured the data to produce the misleading conclusion that inflation has now reached a shockingly high annual rate of 8 2 the worst offender in all this sad to say is my 2nd favorite newspaper conniptions at the wall street journal this outcry is the loudest and the most incoherent at what is normally the most sober of financial media outlets the journal s editorial page coverage is inflation phobic to such a degree that they seem to have trouble recognizing what inflation actually is and what it isn t in march for example responding to a surge in bond yields of about 4 tenths of 1 percent still well below pre pandemic levels and gone the following week a lead editorial nevertheless concluded that inflation already is here and they cited as their first bit of evidence bitcoin is up about 80 this is worth a guffaw bitcoin seriously in a subsequent editorial the journal went even further into the digital neverland to make its case lamenting the rising cost of non fungible tokens whatever those actually are but we do know what they are not bitcoins and nfts are not part of the market basket tracked by the bureau of labor statistics in fact bitcoin is not a consumer good at all if it is anything other than ransom fare it is an asset like a treasury bond or a gold ingot assets are never included in the inflation calculation of consumer inflation for the simple reason that they may appreciate or depreciate but they are not consumed do we expect to see inflation adjusted downward when elon musk s comments cause the next big dip in bitcoin the march editorial continued off track emerging market bonds have been issued in higher than normal quantities this year at abnormally low interest rates the s p 500 and nasdaq set new records this month again these are asset classes not components of the cpi basket and in any case normally one would think that higher stock market values would be applauded lower interest rates would be construed as deflationary cheaper debt service none of this has anything to do with inflation the fact that tesla stock is up 700 in the last year may have considerable significance but it does not signify consumer inflation by june the journal s reality distortion had amped up following the release of the may consumer price index figures they wrote the labor department s consumer price index surged 5 year over year in may the largest increase since when oil was 140 a barrel let us pray this 140 barrel reference is not even a red flag it is a red herring the price of oil is back where it was before the pandemic and nobody thinks it s going to 140 crude oil prices 2018 2021 chart by author the journal has more bad news over the last 12 months inflation is up 3 8 and much more for used cars 29 7 airline fares 24 1 jewelry 14 7 bikes 10 1 these are product categories that show very specific pandemic related distortions which do not reflect not sustained price trends they should know this and still more commodity prices for lumber have surged higher lumber prices are adding 36 000 to the price of a new home this is not consumer inflation consumers don t buy commodities they buy manufactured products they buy a house not a pile of 2x4 s and in any case why even cite the price of lumber this is certainly another bottleneck effect it is already resolving itself the way bottlenecks always do the wsj s headline june 15 just five days after the scare piece cited above reads lumber prices are falling fast lumber prices may 19 june 18 2021 chart by author lumber has been a hot topic in the inflation narrative we ll look more closely at lumber prices and the housing costs in an upcoming column the journal s final complaint makes no sense at all as an inflation indicator record low mortgage interest rates have enabled homeowners to lower their monthly payments to burn more cash on other things obviously a reduction in mortgage costs is not inflationary and the fact that this leaves more cash in consumers pockets to burn on other things is hardly a bad outcome the alarmism gets worse public unrest the journal s feature story following the may cpi release raised the possibility that inflation may even lead to civil disorder senior citizens march to protest inflation in chicago illinois october 1973 image courtesy john white us national archives photo via smith collection gado getty images getty images the full page headline read when americans took to the streets over inflation in the 1960s and 1970s spiraling prices wreaked havoc on the u s economy a warning for today the protests were against rising grocery prices a housewife revolt fed up with the increasing cost of living they marched outside of supermarkets with placards demanding lower prices the picketing started in denver and swept to other cities prompting time magazine to report that boycotts were spreading like butter on a sizzling griddle this is surely not an innocuous allusion given the social turmoil america has experienced in the past year somewhere in all this there are boundaries labeled responsible journalism but is this an accurate picture of the current state of the economy does any of this make sense the short answer is no the headline numbers are distorted they overstate the true inflation rate significantly real inflation the sustained trend in actual prices is probably half the raw cpi see my previous columns for the details more importantly the markets aren t listening to all this negative skew the market response the impact of real inflation and of the fear of inflation on the financial markets is said to be negative in three ways increased volatility sharp declines in bond prices and potentially the value of the dollar general weakening of equity valuations volatility the panic narrative calls for the markets to go haywire the wsj headline on june 2 told us so investors worry inflation will bring wild market swings investors are preparing for a more volatile world financial markets will be upended by inflation higher inflation is already making markets more volatile making things worse already more volatile actually no stock market volatility vix may 12 june 11 2021 chart by author following the may cpi release the equity markets were the calmest they had been in 16 months the same is true for bond market volatility bond market volatility move index may 12 june 11 2021 chart by author bond prices what about bond prices inflation is supposedly toxic for fixed income higher inflation should be bad for bonds which already yield far less than the inflation rate barron s the prospect of serious inflation should crush the bond market and this would show up as a surge in bond yields as investors dump bonds and force down prices this has not happened in the last month bond prices have surged the yield on the 10 year treasury absorbed the may cpi report with apparent equanimity and fell like a stone the decline last week the very week when the may cpi was released was the largest in quite some time in fact us treasuries had the best week in a year 10 year treasury yields may 12 june 18 2021 chart by author this has much of the commentariat stumped why would a rational investor buy bonds that yield under the rate of inflation barron s perhaps because there is no inflation in any case the bond market behavior does not align with the inflation scare narrative and until recently this inconvenient news has been buried in the back pages even there it has been presented as an anomaly in the context of inflation as a fact treasurys rally despite bubbling inflation wsj p b1 inflation bets run out of steam as bonds rally ft p 10 some analysts try to explain it away by ascribing falling bond yields to the effect of a cheaper dollar cheap dollars attract foreign investors to treasurys the low hedging cost makes the u s treasury attractive relative to others this argument does not hold up first of all the dollar is not cheaper lately it is up a bit since the beginning of the year and up in the recent weeks despite the inflation talk the dollar index may 12 june 18 2021 chart by author last week the top performing asset classes tracked by the wall street journal were us treasurys the 20 year 1 and the us dollar 2 both of which should have suffered under true inflationary trends german and japanese bond yields also fell over the last month 10 year german bund yields may 12 june 11 2021 chart by author 10 year japanese bond yields may 12 june 11 2021 chart by author the 10 year bond yields of the uk the netherlands sweden italy spain australia france all declined by similar amounts bonds prices all over the world are rising in value despite the media s inflation threat the much feared breakeven inflationistas love to cite a particular metric known as the 5 year breakeven inflation rate this is defined as the difference between the yield on the 5 year treasury bond and the yield on the inflation indexed version of the 5 year treasury bond for example on thursday june 10 the day of the may cpi release the yield on the 5 year treasury was 0 74 and the yield on the 5 year inflation indexed treasury was negative 1 74 the difference is 2 47 which is taken to be an expression of investors expectation of the average inflation rate in the next five years as shown here this metric has also declined significantly over the last month and especially over the last week despite the inflation warnings the five year breakeven rate may 12 june 18 2021 chart by author there are other rather technical indicators that some analysts follow for example the so called 5 year 5year inflation forecast a federal reserve measure of the expected inflation over a 5 year period starting 5 years from today so the projected inflation rate is for june 2026 june 2031 as derived from current yields on the relevant treasury instruments that measure also fell dramatically last week 5 year 5year inflation expectation forecast chart by author an even more exotic metric similar in spirit called the 5 year 5 year overnight indexed swap also fell on friday to its lowest level since february we could go on there are other market metrics that can be parsed for signs of inflation but what s the point it seems that no matter how you take the bond market s temperature the inflation fever has abated in summary market expectations of future inflation have dropped not risen despite the april and may cpi reports there is no evidence from the bond market at this moment of an increasing expectation or fear of sustained inflation in response to the cpi figures equities what about the stock market again the headlines have been dire following the release of the april cpi the market dipped briefly inflation surge rattles markets stocks log worst streak in months wsj may 13 however following this scare headline the market resumed its climb over the next month to an all time record on the day after the may consumer price index figure was released the market rose further the following week before sagging after fed chairman powell s press conference on june 17 and st louis fed president bullard s comments on june 18 equities the s p 500 index from may 12 to june 18 2021 chart by author as with all market movements there are a variety of possible interpretations mine is that the inflation figures in april and may obviously did not cause the stock market to pull back the market is not showing sensitivity to the inflation scare in the media the drop following the fed fomc meeting is not untypical the market has become extraordinarily sensitive to such pronouncements and probably will correct as the market absorbs the fed s slightly adjusted policy views we ll see the market s overall assessment low volatility record prices calm seas prosperous voyage of course the market weather could change at any time volatility was up a bit last week but for the media screamers the past month s performance is an embarrassment some pundits were nonplussed it is bizarre that investors are growing more comfortable as inflation keeps coming in higher than they expected bizarre others call it strange befuddled counterintuitive an extremely strange set of conditions perhaps it is investor complacency or frightening negligence on the part of the federal reserve it often feels as if no one is in charge of monetary policy in the world s largest economy in any case for many of these commentators the market reaction is unnerving and extreme this so called extreme reaction is actually no reaction the markets are acting like this is business as usual and probably it is it is only bizarre or extreme for those who buy into the hyperventilated inflation narrative if on the other hand there is no real sustained inflation in the system then market s behavior appears moderate sensible even shrewd on the well established principle that headline sentiment is generally a contrary indicator pointing left when the market is going right etc the markets are voting for normalcy here for recovery and prosperity this is also the scenario endorsed by the fed and by many most economists a strong recovery with some stress points and bottlenecks but not a lurch back to the sustained inflation of the 1970s
paul griffin university of california davis from news reports it might sound like the fossil fuel industry is on the defensive after a landmark court ruling and two shareholder votes challenging the industry s resistance to curbing its greenhouse gas emissions but how much power do decisions like these really carry when it comes to pressuring the industry to change as an academic who studies climate finance and is familiar with climate litigation i think there s something else at work here pressure from the courts this latest flurry of speculation about the future of the industry began on may 26 2021 when a dutch court ordered royal dutch shell to cut its emissions 45 by 2030 from 2019 levels that includes emissions from vehicles that burn shell s gasoline something for which the oil industry has never been held legally liable digging deeper into the court s decision it is clear that the judges paid attention to science the court agreed that greenhouse gas emissions pose a significant risk to the climate and that only so much more carbon can be released globally if the world hopes to avoid warming the planet by more than 1 5 degrees celsius over preindustrial levels the limit agreed to globally under the paris climate accord the court held shell partly responsible for this increase the decision appears to hinge on a violation of the dutch civil code s unwritten standard of care which according to the court means that acting in conflict with what is generally accepted according to unwritten law is unlawful shell must observe the due care exercised in society the court wrote shell plans to appeal the ruling in the dutch court and that doubtlessly will involve a protracted debate on what unlawful means in the context of the dutch civil code i cannot imagine that the dutch civil code will hold much sway with the u s federal court system despite dozens of u s lawsuits by cities states and people facing the consequences of climate change the industry has not yet been held liable by the supreme court for producing and marketing fossil fuels even though strong evidence attributes greenhouse gas emissions to oil and gas operations in several cases judges ruled that climate policy is the responsibility of the executive and legislative branches not the courts courts are also very slow to act recall that exxon s response to the exxon valdez oil tanker spill in 1989 tied up the courts for over a decade president joe biden s ban on new oil and gas leases on federal land and water is now caught up in the courts after a federal district judge issued a preliminary injunction on june 15 2021 halting it so while the lawsuits may add public pressure the courts aren t the major forces of change right now investors and the markets hold more power the same day the dutch court ruled on shell s case chevron shareholders approved a resolution to require their san francisco based company to also curb scope 3 emissions the emissions created by the use of the company s products and exxon shareholders with the support of the world s largest investment fund manager blackrock voted to oust three board members and replace them with experts in renewable energy and climate science with the chevron and exxon shareholder votes it is important to recognize that the bulk of majority vote proposals are either not implemented or are watered down in multiple rounds of subsequent votes whether they ultimately are successful depends much more on negotiations between the shareholders and the company it s investors like blackrock that can tip the scales with blackrock on the side of shareholders who are pushing for change it is possible that the two oil majors will be forced to adopt a more climate friendly investment strategy blackrock vanguard and state street have immense power in the boardroom they are now the among the biggest shareholders in u s oil and gas companies currently owning 18 5 of exxon and 19 4 of chevron they also own around 20 of companies in the s p 500 including a large chunk of shares in the big banks that finance these companies but their decisions are based on their own best interests they are also often required to generate returns broadly equivalent to a fully diversified stock index such as the s p 500 blackrock said in explaining its vote we believe more needs to be done in exxon s long term strategy and short term actions in relation to the energy transition in order to mitigate the impact of climate risk on long term shareholder value the strongest incentive for the fossil fuel industry to change may therefore be the discipline of large investors in the financial markets when large investors such as blackrock do not receive returns on their investments commensurate with the financial risk they take action either by cutting back their holdings or by using their voting power to effect change while i believe this is a step in the right direction don t count on this as an ideal solution however because blackrock and the other large asset funds tend to promote corporate change that benefits their investors not necessarily the public at large the market has started paying attention several years ago i produced evidence that when investors assessed firms with higher greenhouse gas emissions they considered the potential costs of future lawsuits and regulation both of which might affect stock prices at the time however the market paid little attention to this liability perhaps because of exxon s successful track record in defending against climate lawsuits in another paper i showed that the market paid lip service to the carbon budget the amount of carbon science shows can be emitted before the global temperature increase exceeds 1 5 degrees celsius and to evidence that fossil fuel assets might lose value in a warmer world that s no longer the case markets are now paying close attention to both the past decade has seen the strongest bull market in 50 years yet investments in fossil fuel stocks lost about 20 of their value over the same decade the price of carbon in europe meanwhile has doubled in the past 12 months both trends have occurred in my view because of a greater realization of the high risks and consequences of climate regulation and lawsuits can energy firms produce higher returns by embracing the energy transition to clean energy given their large shareholdings it is reasonable to conclude that blackrock vanguard and state street seem to think so so in my estimation it is not the courts that will force the fossil fuel industry to curb emissions at least in the near term it appears that what will make the difference will be a change in investors strategies away from high risk high carbon investments and toward cleaner products and services that can earn superior returns for shareholders time will tell but i would bet on blackrock vanguard and state street and the financial markets as better instruments to lower or eliminate the carbon emissions of the large oil and gas companies not the courts paul griffin distinguished professor of management university of california davis this article is republished from the conversation under a

the disarray of stable meaning allows a world such as ours to flourish a world where pornography and abortion are seen as normal in this world human sexuality is demystified to the point of banality in final preparation for an impromptu camping trip i was at the local walmart scanning items at the self checkout an attendant approached to approve my beer purchase he smiled and said you better stock up on food it s only going to get worse the prophet of wal mart i was surprised that the attendant wasn t wearing a mask though our governor had lifted a long standing mask mandate several days earlier the other employees and most of the customers were masked the attendant was middle aged and fit hair cropped short sporting a touch of gray at the temples i thought he might have insight about the distribution problems that had been plaguing our rural town for several months eager for information i asked why s that he said i m christian worried that i was in for a lecture on the evils of alcohol i replied so am i the attendant clapped me on the back i knew it it s good to see a face without a mask i was struck dumb come on he continued you get it jesus said he d return in two thousand years that s now my brother take a look around welcome to sodom in america pestilence has landed famine to follow i smiled and grabbed a bag of beef jerky from my cart and turned to scan the barcode over the face of the machine the machine beeped and i placed the jerky in a plastic bag i took the next item a can of pinto beans from the cart beep i had never felt so much like an automaton as i did in that moment the attendant started to walk away paused turned back and said i hope to see you again if not here in heaven there aren t many of us believers left my brother i smiled and nodded that concluded our exchange i don t know where the attendant got the return of jesus in two thousand years but i sympathized with him about societal decay i was also concerned about his welfare while i was grateful to see a christian voicing his faith in public i also imagined complaints from some of the more secular customers the world hadn t made sense in a long time but this moment seemed stranger than usual something was amiss vision at the city of rocks it was our first camping trip in what seemed like years wendy my wife was looking forward to it as much as me we packed the car and after the stop at wal mart wendy sat in the car with our trusty blue heeler we headed to the city of rocks state park about a two hour drive from our small desert town the city of rocks is in southwestern new mexico situated midway between the towns of silver city and deming it has been described as in the middle of a place very close to nowhere just south of somewhere and a little past over there in other words it s remote the new mexico bureau of geology mineral resources describes it like this city of rocks state park is truly a geologic monument it is formed by large sculptured rock columns pinnacles rising as high as 40 ft and separated by paths or lanes resembling city streets about 34 9 million years ago a large volcano erupted forming the rocks in an instant geologically speaking then erosion over millions of years slowly formed the sculptured columns that now provide a natural playground the park has been a favorite camping spot of ours for over a decade the drive went without incident i ignored the wind bending the branches of mesquite and creosote at the edges of the two lane highway the serrated silhouette of the florida mountains bruised the southern horizon dust devils as large as apartment buildings twisted over the chihuahua desert to the west cook s peak loomed to the north we turned north on us 180 from there it was a short jaunt to nm 61 the wind had picked up steam by the time we pulled into the park i stopped at the park entrance as i always had filled out a camping permit and peeled off a copy to stick on the windshield tucking a ten dollar bill in the permit envelope i deposited it in a hollow metal tube the familiarity of the routine had a calming effect though i had to hold my hat against the wind when i stepped out of the car we drove past the park s welcome center home to a small museum and public restrooms in search of a suitable campsite there weren t many campers around as was generally the case on weekdays a section boasting electric outlets and water hookups about twenty spots in all had several large motorhomes topped with satellite dishes parked just a few feet apart from each other the awnings on the contraptions were rolled up against the wind as we traveled the south side of the rock formations we noticed that each campsite had a new sign the words printed in big black letters on a white background reserved confused i drove back to the welcome center two young park rangers both hispanic wearing cowboy hats and masks walked out of the museum towards their government issued truck wendy opened her door and stepped out mask less to greet them i followed the rangers told us we now had to go online or call in to reserve a spot at the park they were nice about it and blamed state bureaucrats for the change they ve been wanting to do this for awhile said one of the rangers covid gave them the opportunity and they took advantage of it i didn t bother informing the rangers that i had already paid the camping fee or that they should post a sign about the change at the park entrance like i said they were nice i d cancel the check later perturbed at bureaucrats in general i took out my phone and was surprised to see i had a signal navigating to the appropriate website i clicked on a camping spot on the on screen map to find it had already been reserved the next two i clicked were reserved as well it turned out that most of the sites were booked i finally found a spot on the north side of the rock formations the north side was in the direct path of the wind stormtease on the drive to our designated spot i informed my wife that i was going to wait awhile to put up the tent we can sleep in the car she replied why we re camping i don t think the wind is going to die down anytime soon it ll will make the tent sound like a flag flapping in your ears all night have fun putting it up it ll die down i said i had purchased a new tent in celebration of covid s end and was determined to make use of it it ll die down with the sunset we pulled into the camp and parked wendy sat in the car with the dog reading a collection of gerard manley hopkins poems while i sat in a portable camp chair outside reading a novel my hat an indiana jones oilskin stayed snug so long as i kept the brim tipped low to the wind dust swirled through the air as i attempted to lose myself in shusaku endo s silence a powerful story of catholic martyrdom but the prose wasn t strong enough to compete with the wind i decided to shelter in car before i could take a step after standing the wind knocked my camp chair into the dirt i left it there about two hours later the wind lulled late afternoon figuring the blowing was over for the day i exited the car sat up my camp chair and opened a can of beer i watched a gray bank of cumulus clouds muster on the northern horizon the dog sat beside me the rock columns towered behind us the blue black silhouette of the mogollon mountains on northwestern horizon felt like an omen a dust devil the size of a locomotive standing on end twisted counterclockwise over the stretch of desert between the far off mountains and the city of rocks finished with my beer i crushed the can and tossed it into a wind protected space between a scrub oak and the slab of concrete that served as a floor for the campsite s metal picnic table a blast of wind tore the hat from my head i jumped up and grabbed it thinking the gust was a lingering scrap of that which had gone before it i popped the top on a fresh can of beer stillness i mused would soon be punctuated by starlight and a yapping of coyotes it was just then i thought about the wal mart attendant i don t know why i guess his warning of a looming apocalypse had but me on edge the societal decay that began with the turning away from metaphysical certainty of god in the late middle ages had now reached a fevered pitch the realism of st thomas aquinas had slowly eroded from the winds brought on by the likes of william of ockham and his notion of nominalism where the relation of words to reality becomes arbitrary at best logos under the nominalist s scheme the classical underlying principle that coheres reality and for christians is the word made flesh had over the centuries become just one more theory and an archaic one and that the disarray of stable meaning allows a world such as ours to flourish a world where pornography and abortion are seen as normal in this world human sexuality is demystified to the point of banality pope john paul ii got it right we live in a culture of death i had come to this place to get away from societal woes so much for the escape to nowhere and then the epiphany hit i don t know why abortion serves as lynchpins that hold the wheels of wickedness together and spurs them to ever greater momentum it is the twisted logic of evil a decision against life abortion works to ruin the souls of the living who dare enter under its shadow when the mystery of life is amputated from sexuality human spirituality withers on the vine pornography is the spiritless expression of desire that worships at the dark altar of abortion there is no creation in death no art only despair a flash of lightning pulsed through the clouds to the north the blue heeler whimpered ugh i thought did the wal mart guy really get to me that much i patted the dog s skull a surge of wind belted through the camp knocking the empty beer can from the protected crevice near the tree i ate some pinto beans and beef jerky read from the novel and spent the night in the car listening to the old dog snore as my wendy tossed and turned in the back seat i prayed the rosary silently over and over i prayed for the wal mart attendant for my family for us all when sleep finally found me i dreamt of horses galloping across the desert they were coming for me for all of us and all hell followed with them daybreak the wind died with the coming of light the clouds that had threatened rain had not produced and the horses of the apocalypse had not arrived with the thunder i witnessed the sun creep over the eastern horizon through the windshield of the car it s a pleasure to watch night giving way to day outside the air was chill so i set to work building a fire with the mesquite i had packed in the trunk i then set water and coffee to brew in a percolator at the edge of the flames i fed the dog and poured her some fresh water before setting up the camp chairs and sitting down to listen to the water percolate in the pot wendy emerged from the car just as the coffee was ready i poured her a cup and we sat in silence the air was still as a secret i noticed that the campsites surrounding ours were all empty though they had been reserved on the interactive internet map when i checked them the day before it occurred to me the sky above was the color of bluebells in bloom that the bureaucrats who sought to further regulate the campground by requiring reservations had got it all wrong so had the advocates of electric cars renewable energy and a reduction of carbon footprints to combat the environmental rape of our planet the desire to regulate human behavior misses the point behavior is one thing desire another evil can be likened to a virus of desire that attempts to keep the host alive via mutation abortion electric cars and renewable energy all attempt to regulate the consequences of desire depletion of spirit while at the same time promoting those very same desires to accomplish this slight of hand they reduce desire to behavior stripped of spirituality human nature is reduced to mechanical behaviors that can then be manipulated with technology a would be vaccine made from algorithms here god is simply forgotten or relegated to the realm of myth this is a formula for hubris where beauty is mass produced to provoke calculated desires which are then regulated through scientific and technological means the root problem desire is never addressed instead it acts like a cancer feeding on itself it is in this world that metaphysical certainty concerning a boundless god is fully eclipsed by faith in the formulaic reason of finite man faith however transcends reason without contradicting it when desire is reigned in by faith people realize that the common good is related to the ultimate good that is god faith leads to truth freed from of the shackles of the dark altar desire naturally seeks the good i had a dream i had a strange dream said wendy remembering the horses i said what was it she sipped coffee near the fire the smoke rising straight as a chimney onto the sky i was in a hospital nursery and the babies were crying all of them a woman walked in and started to sing her voice was beautiful i couldn t see her face she was dressed in white gown and wore a necklace of blue stones her voice was beautiful i knew the song i can t remember it now i started singing with her and the babies all stopped crying she took another sip from her coffee and stared into the flames it was strange but in the end good did you dream something about horses i said they were running something to do with the wind it s liable to come up again soon we better get a walk in while we have the chance our heeler knows the word walk and stood at attention wendy said thank god it died down standing i said it s a beautiful morning wendy stood from her chair like a song the dog yapped approval as we all walked together into the day

a rtisans associated with basketry are unaware that the precious raw material that they use is disappearing fast from their surrounding environment one of the most common material that they use is tamarix aphylla which is found along watercourses in arid zones in river beds and also on the coastal areas senior officials associated with the sindh social forestry department at mayani forest range hyderabad district said they had seen long trees and small shrubs of this species in the riverine forest now you may see scattered plants in the river bed from where the artisans collect this raw material to continue their work said alisher hajano managing the forest nursery though it is a flowering plant nobody knows how to collect its seed for using in nurseries for conservation of this valuable species hajano said that the seeds of the tree were spread by wind like some other wild plants it germinates wherever it falls near water bodies since the plant is disappearing from its natural habitats we cannot see its specific groves in any area he said the tree is often used as a wind breaker and fire barrier in dryer regions in australia and the united states in some regions of the world it is even considered an invasive species however here in pakistan where it is a native tamarix is getting neglected and is not as abundant as it used to be some decades ago nature conservationists believe that long ago conscious forest department officials used to grow this specific forest specie as a windbreaker and also for soil conservation and sand dune fixation in artificial forests this does not happen anymore concepts of forest conservation are not the same now and as a result sindh lost a lot of forested areas which has affected artisans and communities that relied on various trees like the tamarix for subsistence ramzan mallah a community activist from chotiari reservoir said once the area was a natural habitat of this forest specie tamarix aphylla large clusters of the wild shrubs are all lost now as the patches where these species grew went under the reservoir he added only a few plants have survived here and there around small water bodies in various neighbourhoods but even those face extinction as the tamarix is also used for construction by the communities for their makeshift houses and for weaving baskets mallah lamented the situation is the same at larger water bodies as well as the coastal areas of the province where this shrub is being cut for various purposes traditional artisans who collect stock of this plant to continue their ancestral work weaving small and larger baskets have also realised the depletion of these plants in the neighbourhood yaroo kehal weaving sticks of tamarix for small sized baskets at the river indus stream near hala old matiari district said they have to travel long distances now to collect live shrubs for the purpose talking about the small baskets that he was weaving he said it was not only the season of mango there was also demand from jamon and phalsa farmers and traders who used the baskets to stock the fruits shahryar bhanbhro a local activist said almost all people men women and younger children adopt basketry as a profession artisans from traditional families who have been associated with this work for generations all pointed out that the wild shrub was disappearing from their environment and procuring raw material was increasingly becoming a problem however they continue to use the shrub to extend their businesses each male and female can weave dozens of small baskets for clients to run this business without any concept of sustainability in general thus the exploitation of the tamarix continues and there have been no efforts from the provincial forest department or the community people themselves to save the shrub from extinction the need is for the government to spread awareness among artisans and if needed to even provide alternative livelihood options so the wild shrub can be rehabilitated and the areas reforested there is no denying the fact that the baskets made by these artisans are an integral part of the fruit and vegetable markets however there is a need to promote sustainable use of the baskets as well as a need to adopt sustainable methods of using the existing raw material resources the prices of these basketry products depend on its size which starts from rs50 to rs100 150 and rs500 on a visit to the thin stream of the river indus near hala old one may find many artisans who have set up an open gallery to display a variety of baskets woven by this specific plant growing at the river bed these people are aware of the ups and downs of the river and prefer to stay near so they can continue their traditional work which is their sole source of income according to them they do not have a specific place or permanent village where they may live and work it is a wide river bed near the embankment where they can live and work for whole the year whenever they see the change in water flow and fear flooding they move with raw material towards the embankment in fact occasionally some rowdy elements create disturbances for them which they ignore to continue with their work shakeel abro director sindh indigenous and traditional crafts company sitco said they have tried to mobilise these artisan communities especially those have been engaged in basketry products by using tamarix plants to get unorganised some families are like nomadic tribes traveling from one water body to another for finding raw material to continue work the reason they have turned nomadic was the fast depleting raw material along water bodies abro said they have apprised the chamber of commerce industries about the importance of handicrafts which have been an important part of the country s economy there are many unorganised clusters of artisans of this specific work residing near the river canals and wetlands across the province where entire families play their role in traditional work they collect raw material from water bodies for weaving sticks of this shrubs to prepare baskets but now the depletion of raw material might disturb these people who have depended solely on this craft for livelihood through generations presently they collect it free of cost from water bodies but later they may pay for it in case of wiping out of the tamarix groves the writer is a staff member

introduction the u s government is actively seeking to utilize the power of the blockchain or as it is more formally known distributed ledger technology or dlt to enhance government systems across various platforms and agencies this does not mean that the federal government wants to buy your nba top shot package of lebron james dunking in the 2020 nba finals instead the federal government wants to leverage the distinct and unique technological capabilities of the blockchain and dlt overall the government s foray into the world of blockchain is still very much in its nascent stages as such there is a world of opportunity in the coming years for contractors looking to do business with the federal government the senate removed language from the 2021 national defense authorization act ndaa that would have required the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering usd r e to brief the congressional committees about the potential uses of distributed ledger technologies for defense purposes however although the language was removed from the final bill the congressional conference report surrounding the ndaa still directed the usd r e to provide not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this act to the congressional defense committees the briefing required on the potential use of distributed ledger technology for defense purposes as directed in the conference report all signs point to increased government spending on blockchain solutions and technology in the next few years meanwhile major federal defense contractors who were reticent to enter the blockchain dlt arena back when bitcoin first dominated the headlines in 2017 18 have now set up entire divisions dedicated to blockchain and distributed ledger technology it focused contractors such as microsoft have homed in on the possibilities of blockchain for the government since at least 2017 with the addition of blockchain services to azure government but the beauty of blockchain is that it is not only for major businesses knowledgeable tech savvy organizations can and often do disrupt the status quo in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies for instance a recent phase ii small business innovation research sbir award from the u s navy to simba chain highlights the government s interest in working with government contractors big and small to solve its blockchain problems similarly constellation dag a publicly traded cryptocurrency was recently granted a phase i sbir award to streamline the air force s use and management of data this series of articles will hopefully serve as a primer to any government contractor looking to do business with the federal government or expand its business into the blockchain world as well as a primer for government agencies and businesses looking to enter the world of blockchain and dlt the digital gold rush over the past 12 years the headlines on blockchain technology and distributed ledger technology have centered on two primary subjects bitcoin btc and the myriad of alternative cryptocurrencies that followed in bitcoin s wake the basic concept of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is this the creation of an immutable digital asset that can be electronically transferred from person to person with the trust and assurance that nothing was added or subtracted in the transaction thus avoiding the double spend problem in other words bitcoin acts as digital cash with the primary difference being there are a limited and specific set amount of bitcoin in existence the max supply of bitcoin is 21 million 18 649 312 of which have already been mined the implications of this technology are most readily applicable to financial transactions in particular large financial transactions currently most transfers of large amounts of money are conducted on the dated and ponderous society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunications swift network while the swift network is undoubtedly slow its security vulnerabilities have also been recently exposed and while cryptocurrencies do come with their own unique security concerns there are a myriad of safeguards available to protect one s cryptocurrency the transaction speed as compared to swift however is exponentially faster and cheaper than your typical large wire transfer and while ach payments might be slightly cheaper than bitcoin they too suffer from a 3 5 day lag period it is important to note that cryptocurrencies have not taken over the payment realm from swift as many thought would occur back in 2017 even swift recognizes it needs to change the way it operates and does business but the basic premise remains the same cut the banks out of the system by allowing for verifiable and decentralized transactions quickly and cheaply cryptocurrencies achieve that goal but cryptocurrencies as currency is just the tip of what dlt and the blockchain can accomplish take for instance the ethereum eth blockchain which at the time of this article was the second largest utilized cryptocurrency in the world founded in 2013 the ethereum blockchain introduced the concept of smart contracts to the world of cryptocurrency a smart contract is essentially a preprogrammed and automated set of promises that are captured in digital form and in which form the parties perform on their promises so for example a particular cryptocurrency could be programmed to automatically release funds from buyer to seller upon receipt of goods or an rfid chip is imbedded in a product and when scanned immediately generates immutable data showing that product s location and status in the supply chain ethereum in particular made programming and utilizing the ethereum network easy and accessible and as a result many cryptocurrencies exist as decentralized applications or dapps that are built on top of ethereum compatible tokens most commonly known as erc 20s the rush to build dapps and cryptocurrencies like ethereum has led to numerous other ethereum like or platform projects on which a sprawling network of dapps is being built potential blockchain and dlt uses the following is a small sampling of what industries will and have been affected by blockchain and dlt technologies banking finance decentralized finance or defi refers to a variety of blockchain products wherein users borrow and lend against their cryptocurrencies as collateral defi products became the rage in the summer of 2020 the underlying concept behind many defi products is to take the bank out of the financial market thus lowering transaction costs and fees and making funding more available mark cuban has recently become a strong advocate of defi products as seen in this interview tokenizing stocks and other securities by wrapping traditional securities and assets on to the blockchain allowing for easier trading and liquidity ftx is a crypto platform that has taken the lead in this type of technology accounting audit blockchain allows for data and transactions to become immutable and more easily auditable supply chain one of the most promising use cases for blockchain technology is in improving inadequacies in the supply chain for instance rfid sensors can be placed on items to track movement temperatures and integrity of a product as it moves through a given supply chain simba chain is making a name for itself by tracking items in the aerospace and defense sectors pharmaceuticals similar to supply chain use case rfid and the blockchain can ensure that certain medicines for instance the more temperature sensitive of the covid 19 vaccines are kept at correct temperatures throughout the entire supply chain government and public records blockchain can be used to create immutable government records that are kept on the public blockchain the national archives and records administration drafted a report on the use of blockchain in the realm of public records that was generally hopeful about blockchain s prospects for the government in the future i think back to my navy career and the hassle of transferring from one duty station to another and making sure all adjoining paperwork made the trip with me and was in the format that each psd wanted with the blockchain these records could be digitized and tied to individual personnel members easily transferrable from one duty station to the next voting votes can be registered and kept on the blockchain and captured in real time digitizing elections and helping to ease fears of election corruption there is currently debate about the actual capabilities of blockchain elections but the idea is being experimented on a small scale with one utah county utilizing the technology in the 2020 presidential election cloud computing and storage one of the problems with cloud computing is that is still reliant on a few points of failure because it relies on server farms of some sort of variety decentralized cloud computing on the blockchain allows for data to be stored in a decentralized manner rather than a central network or server this is just a small sampling of what blockchain and dlt can and is doing for various industries bringing blockchain to the government blockchain and dlt technologies exist and are not going away ward berry is establishing this crypto contracting initiative to keep its clients and friends abreast of the rapid developments in this field while there are a myriad of stumbling blocks that stand in the way of the government adapting to this new technology all signs point toward government adoption and adaptation at the same time there is a giant gap in knowledge between those in the blockchain and dlt industry and government agencies looking for answers to their blockchain questions and needs there is a tremendous opportunity for growth and dialogue that ward berry hopes to broker between industry leaders and the federal government the following topics are just some of the areas the ward berry crypto contracting initiative looks to explore sbir sttr awards everyone in the blockchain and dlt world was rightfully excited when constellation dag was awarded a sbir phase i award in the fall of 2019 it was momentous because the air force recognized the need for a truly decentralized blockchain project however most observers mistakenly called the constellation sbir a government contract the sbir sttr program functions more as a government grant rather than a contract and while an sbir sttr award can often lead to a future government contract there is no guarantee of future performance ward berry has experience guiding small businesses through the sbir sttr process afwerx the air force established its afwerx program to help rapidly expand the air force s technological capabilities in conjunction with private industry the afwerx program is very similar to the federal government s sbir sttr program again ward berry has three former military jag corps officers who understand the military s needs and how private industry can help our forces effectively complete the mission bid protests and procurements for a business that does not have a lot of experience working with the federal government the world of bid protests and procurements can be a challenge to navigate ward berry is a boutique firm specializing in helping businesses do business with the federal government especially when it comes to bid protests and procurement actions compliance unfortunately sometimes blockchain and dlt projects and businesses have less than pleasant interaction with the federal government this is most recently seen by the sec s enforcement action against ripple where the sec sued ripple and two of its executives for selling the ripple xrp token xrp as an unregistered security the case is ongoing and will be important in setting a precedence for how the sec views blockchain and dlt projects in the future but sec compliance is only the tip of the iceberg contractors doing business with the federal government must abide by numerous rules and regulations that vary from agency to agency again ward berry has seasoned compliance specialists that can help your business continue a positive relationship with the federal government centralized vs decentralized projects not all blockchains are created equal the ward berry crypto contracting initiative will explore types of blockchains and what they mean for doing business with the federal government current blockchain initiatives ward berry will attempt to keep everyone in the know as to what s happening in the government contracting world of blockchain and dlt we ll highlight projects and opportunities for businesses looking to get into the business of government blockchain resources if you have ever done research on government blockchain projects you know that there s a score of different resources and information out there the ward berry will attempt to centralize a dirty word yes and keep up to date resources and information that will benefit the industry and help bring more blockchain to the federal government originally published march 18 2021 the content of this article is intended to provide

by david milliken london reuters britain s top central bank officials look set to remain divided this week over whether to pull the plug on their 875 billion pound 1 2 trillion government bond purchase programme after inflation hit its highest in nearly two years bank of england chief economist andy haldane was alone in may when he voted to halt the quantitative easing qe bond purchases in august once they reached 825 billion pounds economists expect haldane to retain this stance when the boe announces its latest policy decision on thursday and are looking to see if others on the monetary policy committee join him haldane has ramped up his anti inflation rhetoric ahead of what will be his final mpc meeting before leaving the boe in early june he described the policy outlook as the most dangerous since sterling dropped out of the european exchange rate mechanism in 1992 may s consumer price inflation came in above the boe s and other economists forecasts at 2 1 the first time it had surpassed the boe s 2 target since july 2019 some economists now see inflation exceeding 3 later this year versus boe forecasts of 2 5 for the end of 2021 stronger growth labour market and inflation data thus far should tilt next week s policy statement in a slightly more hawkish direction deutsche bank economist sanjay raja said although british inflation is below the 5 last recorded in the united states and its post covid recovery is less advanced financial markets expect the boe to begin raising rates before the u s federal reserve a historically rare sequence the boe is not aiming to overshoot the inflation target like the fed said bank of america economist robert wood who now predicts a first rate rise in britain in may 2022 interest rate futures price in the boe s main interest rate rising to 0 25 from its current 0 1 by june 2022 a turnaround from early 2021 when the boe was viewed as more likely to cut rates below zero gertjan vlieghe normally one of the more dovish boe policymakers said last month he expected rates would need to rise in late 2022 if the economy grew as expected but most economists polled by reuters still expect the boe to start raising rates only in 2023 fast growth britain s economic growth in april was the fastest since july 2020 as non essential shops pubs and restaurants reopened after widespread vaccinations but plans for a further easing on june 21 have been delayed by four weeks due to the fast spread of a new coronavirus variant economic output in april was still almost 4 below pre pandemic levels after a near 10 slump in 2020 and 1 7 million people 7 of employees were relying on government furlough support at the end of may uncertainty about what happens to them when furlough support stops at the end of september is a key reason why most boe policymakers are not expected to change policy also the boe has described energy prices and other factors pushing up prices as transient inflation spikes in britain after the 2008 financial crisis did not trigger 1970s style wage price spirals due to the weak bargaining power of many workers and public inflation expectations have fallen bank of america s wood also said reducing asset purchases now risked weakening their future power voting to end qe early would undermine the qe tool since it works in part by being a credible signal that rates will be lower for longer he said 1 0 7215 pounds reporting by david milliken editing by pravin char

gov gavin newsom and state legislative leaders are negotiating about whether to extend the state s ban on evictions for unpaid rent california s eviction protections will expire on june 30 newsom has proposed using federal coronavirus aid money to pay off 100 of the rent people owe ap photo rich pedroncelli file the associated press sacramento calif ap gov gavin newsom says california will pay off all the past due rent that accumulated in the nation s most populated state because of the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic a promise to make landlords whole while giving renters a clean slate left unsettled is whether california will continue to ban evictions for unpaid rent beyond june 30 a pandemic related order that was meant to be temporary but is proving difficult to undo federal eviction protections also are set to expire on june 30 california had passed its own protections that applied to more people newsom and legislative leaders are meeting privately to decide what to do part of the negotiations over the state s roughly 260 billion operating budget an extension of the eviction ban seems likely to give california more time to spend all the money to cover unpaid rent but landlords and tenants rights groups are arguing over how long that extension should last œthe expectation for people to be up and at em and ready to pay rent on july 1 is wholeheartedly unfair ť said kelli lloyd a 43 year old single mother who says she has not worked consistently since the pandemic began in march 2020 lloyd a member of the advocacy group alliance of californians for community empowerment is supposed to pay 1 924 a month for a two bedroom two bathroom rent controlled apartment in the crenshaw district of south los angeles but she says she s 30 000 behind after not working for most of the last year to care for her two children as day care centers closed and schools halted in person learning that debt will likely be covered by the government but lloyd said she recently lost a job at a real estate brokerage and hasn t found another one yet she s worried she could be evicted if the protections expire œsimply because the state has opened back up doesn t mean people have access to their jobs ť she said meanwhile in the wine country area of sonoma county property manager keith becker says 14 tenants are more than 100 000 behind in rent payments it s put financial pressure on the owners who becker says have œresigned themselves to it ť but they have grown weary of the seemingly endless protections which he noted were aimed at addressing a public health emergency and not meant to be permanent œwe should do our best to get back to the starting point where we were in december of 2019 anything other than that is taking advantage of a crisis ť he said california has 5 2 billion to pay off people s rent money from multiple aid packages approved by congress that appears to be more than enough to cover all of the unpaid rent in the state according to jason elliott senior counselor to newsom on housing and homelessness but the state has been slow to distribute that money and it s unlikely it can spend it all by june 30 a report from the california department housing and community development showed that of the 490 million in requests for rental assistance through may 31 just 32 million has been paid that doesn t include the 12 cities and 10 counties that run their own rental assistance programs œit s challenging to set up a new big program overnight ť said assemblyman david chiu a democrat from san francisco and chair of the assembly housing and community development committee œit has been challenging to educate millions of struggling tenants and landlords on what the law is ť landlords point to the state s rapid economic recovery as a reason not to extend the eviction moratorium much longer california has added 495 000 new jobs since february in april alone california accounted for 38 of all new jobs in the u s this week newsom lifted all restrictions on businesses heralding it as the state s grand reopening œwe re getting back to normal ť carlton said œit s time to go back to work it s time to pay the rent ť while employment among middle and high wage jobs has exceeded pre pandemic levels employment rates for people earning less than 27 000 a year are down more than 38 since january 2020 according to opportunity insights an economic tracker based at harvard university œthe stock market may be fine we may be technically reopened but people in low wage jobs which are disproportionately people of color are not back yet ť said madeline howard senior attorney for the western center on law and poverty some housing advocates are asking the state to keep the eviction ban in place until the unemployment rate among low wage workers has dropped to pre pandemic levels it s similar to how state officials would impose restrictions on businesses in counties where covid 19 infection rates were higher while those with lower infection rates could reopen more quickly advocates say they were encouraged when newsom told univision earlier this month that he œdefinitively ť wants to extend the eviction protections beyond june 30 œwe re cautiously optimistic ť said francisco duenas executive director of housing now california œwe definitely need these protections as part of our recovery ť
