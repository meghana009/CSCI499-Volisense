effects of capital spending these items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to the overall performance of the company s business ebitda is not a financial measure presented in accordance with u s gaap accordingly when analyzing our operating performance investors should not consider ebitda in isolation or as a substitute for net income cash flows from operating activities or other statements of operations or statements of cash flow data prepared in accordance with u s gaap our calculation of ebitda is not necessarily comparable to that of other similar titled measures reported by other companies 2 adjusted ebitda represents ebitda before the following charges a this adjustment removes the non cash income expense associated with the change in fair market value of the company s warrant liability b the company incurred certain restructuring costs related to severance and other costs related to its shut down of the shoals and roanoke facilities c the company

results for the second quarter of 2022 are indicative of the ongoing challenges that face the offshore industry inflation certain geopolitical events and the possibility of a prolonged recession continue to weigh on our customers abilities to commit to long term deepwater projects while some of these factors are systemic we remain focused on the levers within our control as we work to grow the business we are dedicated to the growth of our business and during the quarter we saw a glimpse of what that growth could entail we expanded our cable management expertise beyond our traditional oil and gas offerings by providing cable management services for a military project in the northern half of the united states and we received an order to provide hydrogen energy related services the scope of these projects not only demonstrate the transferability of expertise we developed over the past 25 years but it also validates our strategy to shift focus from core products and services to core competencies this is in addition to announcing the relocation of the business and a rebranding of the company in the first quarter of 2022 when the move is completed later in the third quarter of 2022 we are confident that our new headquarters will enrich our team s ability to support the needs of our clients while allowing us to spread our wings to discover even more diverse offerings secondly rebranding the company from deep down inc to koil energy solutions inc was the next step in promoting our core competencies to expand our product and service offerings into new markets while we are still awaiting approval from the financial industry regulatory authority finra for our name and ticker symbol change we have moved forward with this change operationally and are currently

revenues for the three months ended june 30 2022 q2 2022 decreased 23 percent to 3 5 million compared to 4 5 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 q2 2021 primarily due to a decline in product oriented fixed price contracts offset by an increase in short duration projects utilizing our support services and rental solutions gross profit for q2 2022 was 1 5 million or 42 percent of revenues compared to q2 2021 gross profit of 1 4 million or 31 percent of revenues the increase in gross profit was due to incurring less materials costs and decreases in lower margin passthrough service costs for the three months ended june 30 2022 operating expenses were 1 5 million or 42 percent of revenues in q2 2022 compared to 1 8 million or 40 percent of revenues in q2 2021 the 0 4 million or 19 percent decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to recording a 0 5 million reserve for doubtful accounts receivable related to prolonged customer payment terms and uncertainty around certain customers liquidity for the three months ended june 30 2021 due to the factors discussed above deep down reported a q2 2022 net profit of 0 2 million or 0 01 per diluted share compared

the senate passed legislation on sunday that would make the most significant federal investment in us history to counter climate change and lower the cost of prescription drugs as democrats banded together to push through major pieces of president biden s domestic agenda over unified republican opposition the measure large elements of which appeared dead just weeks ago amid democratic divisions would inject more than 370 billion into climate and energy programmes altogether the bill could allow the us to cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 40 per cent below 2005 levels by the end of the decade advertisement it would achieve democrats longstanding goal of slashing prescription drug costs by allowing medicare for the first time to negotiate the prices of medicines directly and capping the amount that recipients pay out of pocket for drugs each year at 2 000 the measure also would extend larger premium subsidies for health coverage for low and middle income people under the affordable care act for three years and it would be paid for by substantial tax increases mostly on large corporations including establishing a 15 per cent corporate minimum tax and imposing a new tax on company stock buybacks initially pitched as build back better a multi trillion dollar cradle to grave social safety net plan on the order of the great society democrats scaled back the legislation in recent months and rebranded it as the inflation reduction act it was projected to lower the federal deficit by as much as 300 billion over a decade though it remained to be seen whether it would counter inflation or lower costs for americans in the long term passage of the measure was a major victory for biden and democrats who are battling to maintain their slimhouse and senate majorities in november s midterm congressional elections facing unanimous opposition by republicans who have used filibusters to block many elements of their domestic agenda democrats took full advantage of the senate s special budget rules to force through as much of it as they could with the support of all 50 members of their caucus the final tally was 51 to 50 with vice president kamalaharris casting the tie breaking vote the house planned to interrupt its summer break to reconvene briefly on friday to clear the measure sending it to biden for his signature today senate democrats sided with american families over special interests voting to lower the cost of prescription drugs health insurance and everyday energy costs to reduce the deficit while making the wealthiest corporations finally pay their fair share biden said the senate vote was the culmination of more than a year of hard fought negotiations between the party s progressive core which demanded a plan that would touch every aspect of american life and a conservative leaning flank that sought a much narrower package new york times news service

chief procurement director of arista networks and michal lipson phd professor of physics at columbia university and pioneer and thought leader in silicon photonics as advisors to the company s board of directors the company intends to nominate both as directors at its annual general meeting currently scheduled for october 14 2022 joined the singapore hybrid integrated next generation ¬µ electronics shine centre located in the college of design and engineering at the national university of singapore nus its participation as a founding member gives the company access to a variety of advanced packaging tools and engineers as well as opportunities to showcase its technology and collaborate with a global industrial and academic network of companies and universities presented a wafer scale hybrid integration platform for co packaged photonics using a cmos based optical interposer at the 2022 ieee symposium on vlsi technology circuits in hawaii the acceptance of this paper through a peer review process is a recognition of the novelty and importance of poet s technology to hybrid integration in both optics and microelectronics presented at the pic international conference in brussels belgium as a sponsor lecturer and panel participant in which the company demonstrated that its optical interposer platform is available both as a solution to a variety of optical mechanical electrical thermal and packaging challenges in hybrid opto electronic integration and as a means to integrate newly developed components from a variety of innovative companies into real world applications participated in several investor conferences and 1 1 meetings with institutional and retail investors including the global chinese financial forum the sidoti micro cap conference the oppenheimer 7th annual emerging growth conference the 19th annual craig hallum institutional investor conference and the moneyshow virtual expo combined the conferences during the quarter reached dozens of institutional investors and thousands of retail investors in the u s and abroad the company has identified two key milestone objectives for the balance of 2022 a the development of a 400g fr4 multiplexed tx engine that will be combined with the existing 400g rx to create a full transmit and receive sub assembly for a 400g transceiver module and b the delivery of samples of a packaged light source assembly for celestial ai a lead customer in the emerging growth market for artificial intelligence machine learning ai ml accelerator chips the 400g fr4 tx and rx optical engines are the building blocks for an 800g fr4 optical engine that poet intends to introduce to the market in time to capture a major inflection point identified in the april 2022 lightcounting forecast report in which deployment of 800g 2x400g and 1 6t transceiver modules are expected to grow from about 2 million units in 2024 to 14 million units by 2027 a compounded annual growth rate of nearly 80 for packaged light sources the ultimate market potential is larger with estimates of the total market size being approximately 125 billion by 2027 which the company estimates will offer a serviceable market opportunity of over 4 billion by 2027 in support of the strategy to develop transceiver modules the company has also modified the optical interposer platform so that it can more readily accept lasers from leading global suppliers and included the capability to assemble the necessary electronic components directly onto the interposer platform poet has developed and will sample later this year a 400g rx with an integrated trans impedance amplifier tia and a 200g fr4 tx with an integrated laser driver this integration of additional electronics components has demonstrated a further increase in performance of the optical engines and simplified module board design for customers management comments following the live demonstration of our 200g fr4 multiplexed tx and rx optical engines and our ground breaking live demonstration of our 400g 800g fr4 multiplexed rx engine at the optical fiber conference in march we received multiple requests for technical data samples and meetings with interested customers and business partners we are executing well towards our dual strategy to make available integrated optical engines for 100 200g to promote market traction and acceptance while simultaneously delivering more differentiated solutions at 400 800g and beyond there is a strong desire among module companies to embrace our approach as we qualify our solutions and demonstrate the required levels of reliability and manufacturability by releasing our solutions to production we have already begun the process of validating performance reliability and manufacturability with select customers who are designing modules with our 100g and 200g optical engines said dr suresh venkatesan chairman ceo even though the vast majority of 100 200 400g optical transceivers sold today are built using discrete sub assemblies the discussions during the recent pic conference strongly indicate that the industry is rapidly approaching a period in which hybrid integration will be recognized as one of the few paths to meeting the scale size and energy performance requirements of the industry as the number of channels increase from 4 to 8 to 16 in going from 400g to 1 6t the balance between conventional assembly and integrated assembly transitions quickly in favor of chip scale integration and wafer level processing both fundamental tenants of the poet approach it is widely acknowledged that a small form factor 2x400g multiplexed fr4 integrated solution is needed at 800g and absolutely required at 1 6t and we believe that poet is in a pole position to deliver it further we believe the optical interposer platform is among a few if not the only packaging technology that can provide the scale size power and cost requirements needed for opto electronic applications outside of datacom and telecom including optical computing ar vr wearables lidar and other more consumer oriented products that will require vastly larger numbers of devices to be produced annually at lower cost and higher performance non ifrs financial summarythe company reported non recurring engineering revenue nre of 120 000 in the second quarter of 2022 compared to 209

currently approved covid 19 vaccines offer less protection against infection from new sars cov 2 variants especially ba 5 and we continue to see the need for an easily accessible once daily oral antiviral for the treatment of covid 19 edp 235 as demonstrated by its positive safety tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties is positioned to fill this need and to be an important tool in the global fight against this virus we look forward to initiating a phase 2 study in the fourth quarter of this year said jay r luly ph d president and chief executive officer of enanta pharmaceuticals we also continue to advance the rest of our pipeline with our ongoing and planned rsv studies including edp 323 our l protein inhibitor in phase 1 and edp 938 in a new phase 2 study in high risk adults starting in the fourth quarter of this year meanwhile we remain committed to identifying a third mechanism to combine with edp 514 and a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nuc for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis b virus infection fiscal third quarter ended june 30 2022 financial results total revenue of 19 5 million for the three months ended june 30 2022 consisted of royalty revenue derived primarily from worldwide net sales of abbvie s hepatitis c virus hcv regimen mavyret maviret this compared to total revenue of 21 6 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 which also consisted of royalty revenue from abbvie research and development expenses totaled 39 1 million for the three months ended june 30 2022 compared to 47 0 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 the decrease was due to the timing of activities in the company s virology and liver disease programs year over year general and administrative expenses totaled 12 9 million for the three months ended june 30 2022 compared to 8 5 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 the increase was due to an increase in headcount and related compensation expense enanta recorded an income tax benefit of 0 4 million for the three months ended june 30 2022 due to the release of a state tax reserve during the period compared to an income tax benefit of 9 4 million for the three months ended june 30 2021 which was driven by a federal net loss carryback available in fiscal 2021 under the cares act of 2020 enanta is still due a refund of 28 7 million for the tax losses carried back in 2021 to offset taxable income in prior years the net loss for the three months ended june 30 2022 was 31 7 million or a loss of 1 53 per diluted common share compared to a net loss of 24 0 million or a loss of 1 19 per diluted common share for the corresponding period in 2021 enanta s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 292 7 million at june 30 2022 enanta expects that its current cash cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities as well as its continuing royalty revenue will continue to be sufficient to meet the anticipated cash requirements of its existing business and development programs for the next two years pipeline update and business review respiratory virology covid 19 sars cov 2 enanta reported positive data in july for its completed phase 1 healthy volunteer study of edp 235 an oral inhibitor of coronavirus 3cl protease or 3clpro also known as mpro or main protease specifically designed for the treatment of covid 19 edp 235 has fast track designation from the u s food and drug administration fda data showed edp 235 increased approximately proportionally with ascending single and multiple doses of edp 235 with a half life consistently ranging from 13 to 22 hours resulting in a pharmacokinetic profile suitable for once daily dosing data demonstrated that edp 235 had strong exposure multiples over the ec 90 which is a measure of potency specifically the concentration of drug that results in 90 inhibition of viral replication in vitro edp 235 200mg taken once daily with food resulted in mean trough plasma levels at steady state that were 3 fold and 6 fold over the plasma protein adjusted ec 90 for the alpha variant and delta variant respectively while 400mg resulted in levels that were 6 fold and 12 fold over the plasma protein adjusted ec 90 for the respective variants these exposure multiples were achieved without the need for ritonavir boosting and its associated drug drug interactions further edp 235 is projected to have four times higher drug levels in lung tissue compared to plasma which would be expected to drive the 400mg multiples to 24 fold and 48 fold for the respective variants which is a measure of potency specifically the concentration of drug that results in 90 inhibition of viral replication edp 235 200mg taken once daily with food resulted in mean trough plasma levels at steady state that were 3 fold and 6 fold over the plasma protein adjusted ec for the alpha variant and delta variant respectively while 400mg resulted in levels that were 6 fold and 12 fold over the plasma protein adjusted ec for the respective variants these exposure multiples were achieved without the need for ritonavir boosting and its associated drug drug interactions further edp 235 is projected to have four times higher drug levels in lung tissue compared to plasma which would be expected to drive the 400mg multiples to 24 fold and 48 fold for the respective variants overall edp 235 was generally safe and well tolerated up to 400 mg for seven days adverse events aes were infrequent and the majority were mild with headache and gastrointestinal related symptoms being the most commonly reported aes during the mad phase there were three study discontinuations one moderate headache in the 400mg fasted cohort one severe headache in the 800mg fed cohort and one grade 3 alt grade 2 ast elevation in the 800mg fed cohort all aes subsequently resolved based on these positive data enanta is moving forward with the clinical development of edp 235 targeting a fourth quarter initiation of a phase 2 study exploring doses of 200mg and 400mg once daily pending review with the fda rsv edp 938 an n protein inhibitor which has fast track designation from the fda is being evaluated in a broad clinical development program in multiple high risk patient groups including pediatric and high risk adult populations enanta reported data in may from rsvp its phase 2b study evaluating edp 938 in otherwise healthy adults with community acquired rsv rsvp did not meet the primary endpoint of reduction in total symptom score compared to placebo or the secondary antiviral endpoints enanta believes this result was likely because the viral load and symptoms had already peaked and or were declining at the time of the first dose indicating rsv infection resolves quickly in this otherwise healthy low risk population however in this study a statistically significant difference in the number of subjects achieving undetectable rsv rna at the end of treatment at day 5 was observed with edp 938 compared to placebo p 0 033 edp 938 demonstrated a favorable safety profile consistent with that observed in approximately 500 subjects exposed to date in prior studies ongoing studies include rsvpeds a phase 2 randomized double blind placebo controlled study in hospitalized and non hospitalized pediatric rsv patients and rsvtx a phase 2b randomized double blind placebo controlled study in adult hematopoietic cell transplant recipients with acute rsv infection and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection the company expects these studies to continue beyond 2022 subject to the re emergence of rsv in broader populations at pre covid levels enanta plans to initiate an additional phase 2b study of edp 938 in another high risk adult population including the elderly and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease congestive heart failure or asthma in the fourth quarter of 2022 enanta is also evaluating edp 323 a novel oral direct acting antiviral selectively targeting the rsv l protein for the treatment of rsv edp 323 has shown sub nanomolar potency against rsv a and rsv b in vitro and is not expected to have cross resistance to other classes of inhibitors edp 323 could be used as a monotherapy or in combination with other rsv mechanisms such as edp 938 to potentially broaden the addressable patient populations or their treatment windows enanta plans to initiate a phase 1 study of edp 323 in the fourth quarter of 2022 human metapneumovirus hmpv enanta is on track to select a clinical candidate for hmpv in the first half of 2023 hmpv is a pathogen that causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections similar to rsv in young children and the elderly as well as in immunocompromised patients or those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma liver virology hepatitis b virus hbv enanta remains committed to developing a cure for hbv patients and is currently focused on identifying additional compounds with different mechanisms of action to combine with edp 514 its potent core inhibitor and a nuc edp 514 which has fast track designation from the fda has displayed a good safety profile and robust antiviral activity in multiple hbv patient populations with declines in hbv dna among the best published to date for core inhibitors corporate announced the appointment of scott t rottinghaus m d to

operations in a manner consistent with its current expectations pricing and cost estimates including with respect to commodity pricing and exchange rates and the general continuance of assumed operational regulatory and industry conditions in colombia and ecuador and the ability of gran tierra to execute its business and operational plans in the manner currently planned among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements in this press release are gran tierra s operations are located in south america and unexpected problems can arise due to guerilla activity strikes local blockades or protests technical difficulties and operational difficulties may arise which impact the production transport or sale of our products other disruptions to local operations global health events including the ongoing covid 19 pandemic global and regional changes in the demand supply prices differentials or other market conditions affecting oil and gas including inflation and changes resulting from a global health crisis the russian invasion of ukraine or from the imposition or lifting of crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by opec and other producing countries and the resulting company or third party actions in response to such changes changes in commodity prices including volatility or a decline in these prices relative to historical or future expected levels the risk that current global economic and credit conditions may impact oil prices and oil consumption more than gran tierra currently predicts which could cause gran tierra to further modify its strategy and capital spending program prices and markets for oil and natural gas are unpredictable and volatile the

the trading price of our common stock or bonds the risk that gran tierra does not receive the anticipated benefits of government programs including government tax refunds gran tierra s ability to obtain a new credit agreement and to comply with financial covenants in its credit agreement and indentures and make borrowings under any credit agreement and the risk factors detailed from time to time in gran tierra s periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission including without limitation under the caption risk factors in gran tierra s annual report on form 10 k for the

forward looking statements contained in this press release are based on certain assumptions made by gran tierra based on management s experience and other factors believed to be appropriate gran tierra believes these assumptions to be reasonable at this time but the forward looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties many of which are beyond gran tierra s control which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward looking statements in particular the unprecedented nature of the current economic downturn pandemic and industry decline may make it particularly difficult to identify risks or predict the degree to which identified risks will impact gran tierra s business and financial condition all forward looking statements

the online consumer lender upstart holdings projected a steep decline in revenue monday but also expressed confidence that its artificial intelligence based underwriting models are performing adequately the san mateo california company which uses ai to lend to people with lower credit scores reported 228 million in revenues during the quarter that figure was significantly below the roughly 300 million the lender had told investors to expect earlier this year upstart which said that fewer of its loans are being purchased by banks and other investors expects its revenue to fall further to 170 million during the third quarter co founder and ceo dave girouard called the projected decline unacceptable upstart said that its defaults have increased significantly but that an increase was expected in light of the expiration of pandemic era stimulus programs that helped keep many consumers stayed current on their loan payments adobe stock we re not happy with our results we re not a company that likes to have a declining revenue from one quarter to the next he said weaker revenues are a business problem that we need to address girouard told analysts adding that the company is taking steps to make the company stronger and better by seeking more stable sources of funding the comments came as early worries brew over subprime consumer lenders which after reporting stellar credit quality for much of the pandemic are starting to show signs of deterioration while delinquency figures remain below historical averages subprime borrowers are increasingly falling behind on their loan payments and lenders are being forced to charge off more loans upstart said monday that its defaults have increased significantly but that an increase was expected given that fiscal stimulus programs earlier in the pandemic helped keep many americans current on their loan payments upstart which was founded by google alums in 2012 and held an initial public offering in 2020 is as committed as ever to the mission of improving access to credit for those who deserve it girouard said some of you have questioned whether upstart veered too quickly into lending to riskier borrowers in 2021 in order to grow in our post ipo phase girouard said but i believe we ve done exactly what we set out to do and what we said we would do upstart funds its loans both by partnering with more than 70 banks and credit unions which hold loans on their balance sheets and by making loans that eventually get sold to institutional investors but several banks and investors reacted more quickly and abruptly than we anticipated to ongoing worries about a looming recession and they have temporarily paused or reduced their originations girouard said since fewer banks and investors are buying upstart s loans the company is making fewer loans than it expected leading to lower revenues from loan sales the funding constraints convinced upstart that it needs to upgrade and improve the funding side of our marketplace girouard told analysts right now upstart s loan purchase agreements are mostly decided on a month by month basis but the company is exploring whether it can get longer term commitments from partners who will invest consistently through cycles the company is evaluating a variety of opportunities to do just that though we expect this will take some time to bring to fruition girouard said as part of its sales pitch upstart released data showing that investors who would have equal exposure across its borrowers over time would have expected a 9 8 gross annualized yield that figure is above a target of about 8 and significantly better than the 2 9 annualized total return in the u s high yield bond index the company said our numbers show that institutional investors that have been with us for several years have done really well girouard said in an email to american banker adding that long term partnership agreements that recognize the long term opportunity make sense one option that upstart is ruling out becoming a bank two fintechs that focus more on higher income borrowers lendingclub and sofi technologies bought banks over the past two years and have touted the benefits of having access to low cost deposit funding upstart wants to partner with banks not compete with them girouard told american banker becoming a bank would mean forgoing our mission to improve access to affordable credit because banks aren t designed to change the way the credit system works girouard said adding that regulators give banks top scores when they are not exposed to consumers with lower credit scores upstart also says its ai models have utility far beyond any single bank by helping banks lend to a wider population than they usually do we believe that sharing our technology with banks and credit unions allows us to have a much larger impact girouard said consumer banking are subprime consumer lenders headed for a reckoning late payment rates are rising at nonbanks that lend to people with lower credit scores we re probably entering a stretch where you re going to see a separation between those that are relatively good underwriters and those that are not one analyst said august 7 but while girouard told analysts it doesn t make sense for upstart to become a bank he also said the company will start to hold more loans on its balance sheet as a transitional bridge to getting longer term funding from investors the company is also pointing to other sources of growth such as an auto lending business that hit 10 million in retail loan originations in the second quarter at the end of june upstart launched a small business loan program that division has since made 40 loans totaling more than 1 million that team is quickly ironing out operational issues with an eye toward rapidly expanding this product in the coming months and years girouard told analysts upstart s stock price which spiked to 390 in october has fallen roughly 78 this year and is now at 32 27

through the lower grade upper benches of the gibraltar pit these smaller complex ore zones are challenging sections for our mining equipment resulting in higher dilution and lower than expected copper grade the mill operated at design capacity in the second quarter but lower head grades contributed to lower recoveries resulting in copper production of 21 million pounds mining operations are now advancing deeper into the gibraltar pit where the higher grade ore for the upcoming quarters is located copper production is expected to be significantly higher in the second half of the year and we have already seen improvements since quarter end as 9 5 million pounds of copper was produced in the month of july we still expect to meet our original copper production guidance of 115 million pounds 5 but given the more challenging conditions in the first half of the year now expect to be at the lower end of that range our average realized copper price for the period was us 4 08 per pound but the decline in the price late in the quarter impacted our financial results as we recognized negative price adjustments and an inventory write down totalling 7 million going forward we have a valuable copper hedge position which protects a minimum price of us 3 75 per pound through june 2023 continued mr mcdonald mr mcdonald added on the cost side we continued to see the impact of higher fuel costs in the second quarter as diesel prices climbed by 23 quarter over quarter and nearly 70 over the prior year other than fuel our total site spending is generally in line with the prior quarter and prior year although total operating costs c1 per pound of copper has been driven higher by the lower production in the second quarter these unit costs will drop significantly in the second half of

review gibraltar produced 20 7 million pounds of copper for the quarter head grades averaged 0 17 in the quarter which was lower than expected due to the complexity of the ore in the upper benches of the gibraltar pit which resulted in higher than normal mining dilution ore grades are expected to improve for the remainder of the year as mining progresses deeper into the gibraltar pit where ore zones are more consistent and less complex in nature a total of 22 3 million tons were mined in the second quarter with the decrease from 2021 rates due to longer haul distances in the current phase of mining mill throughput improved over the prior quarters due to the softer gibraltar ore in line with expectations the strip ratio of 2 8 was inline with the average for the gibraltar pit and the prior quarter ore stockpiles also decreased by 1 8 million tons in the second quarter to supplement mill feed from the mine in accordance with the mine plan total site costs at gibraltar of 76 1 million which includes capitalized stripping of 11 9 million for taseko s 75 share was generally consistent with the first quarter but was 11 6 million higher than the same quarter last year due to higher diesel costs with diesel prices nearly 70 higher than 2021 and with some other input costs increasing including grinding media used in the mill non gaap performance measure see end of news

mining progresses deeper in the gibraltar pit as ore quality and grade improves management still expects to meet the original copper production guidance of 115 million pounds 5 but given the more challenging conditions in the first half of the year now expect to be at the lower end of that range the company currently has copper price collar contracts in place that secure a minimum copper price of us 3 75 per pound for a substantial portion of its attributable production until june 30 2023 improved production combined with this copper hedge protection should continue to provide the

copper will be one of the greenest sources of copper for us domestic consumption with carbon emissions water and energy consumption all dramatically lower than a conventional mine it is a low cost copper project with an annual production capacity of 85 million pounds of copper over a 21 year mine life with the expected c1 operating cost of us 1 10 per pound florence copper will be in the lowest quartile of the global copper cost curve and will have one of the smallest environmental footprints of any copper mine in the world the company has successfully operated a production test facility ptf since 2018 at florence to demonstrate that the in situ copper recovery iscr process can produce high quality cathode while operating within permit conditions the next phase of florence copper will be the construction and operation of the commercial iscr facility with an estimated capital cost of us 230 million including reclamation bonding and working capital based on the company s published 2017 ni 43 101 technical report at a conservative copper price of us 3 00 per pound florence copper is expected to generate an after tax internal rate of return of 37 an after tax net present value of us 680 million at a 7 5 discount rate and an after tax payback period of 2 5 years florence copper continued in december 2020 the company received the aquifer protection permit app from the arizona department of environmental quality adeq during the app process florence copper received strong support from local community members business owners and elected officials the other required permit is the underground injection control permit uic from the u s environmental protection agency epa which is the final permitting step required prior to construction of the commercial iscr facility on november 22 2021 the epa provided the company with an initial draft of the uic permit taseko s project technical team completed its review of the draft uic permit in early december 2021 and no significant issues were identified we are awaiting the epa to begin the public comment period for the draft uic all indications from the epa are that there are no outstanding items remaining with the permit and they are completing final internal sign offs the public comment period is expected to be 45 days detailed engineering and design for the commercial production facility was completed in 2021 and procurement activities are well advanced with the company having made most of the initial deposits and awarding the key contract for the major processing equipment associated with the sx ew plant the company incurred 52 2 million of costs for florence in the first half of 2022 which includes commercial facility activities florence copper also has outstanding purchase commitments of 22 3 million as at june 30 2022 for the remaining equipment to be delivered deploying this strategic capital and awarding key contracts will assist with protecting the project execution plan mitigating inflation risk and the potential impact of supply chain disruptions and ensure a smooth transition into construction once the final uic permit is received long term growth strategy taseko s strategy has been to grow the company by acquiring and developing a pipeline of complementary projects focused on copper in stable mining jurisdictions we continue to believe this will generate long term

commentary we made good progress advancing certain key growth initiatives during the second quarter in particular expanding our automotive repair and original equipment categories and enhancing the product catalog and margins for our adjacent verticals said nino ciappina chief executive officer of parts id unfortunately these positive results were offset by inflationary pressures and unfavorable vehicle sales trends that are pressuring our core accessories business especially when compared to last year s stimulus fueled demand in response to the current operating environment which also includes continued supply chain challenges we ve taken important steps towards protecting profitability we recently made difficult decisions to reduce our workforce further optimized our advertising spend and eliminated certain other non essential expenses we also moderated capital expenditures and increased our gross margin target we believe these actions will yield approximately 12 million in annualized savings and provide us with the financial flexibility to navigate the current macroeconomic headwinds we continue to be optimistic about the long term potential of our technology driven capital efficient business model and our ability to expand our share of the 440 billion automotive aftermarket and the multiple adjacent industry verticals in which we operate second quarter 2022 financial results second quarter 2022 revenue decreased 20 1 to 104 3 million compared to 130 4 million in the second quarter of 2021 this decreased was attributable to a 15 5 decline in traffic and a 15 4 decrease in the conversion rate partially offset by a 10 3 increase in average order value gross profit for the second quarter of 2022 decreased to 20 6 million compared to 26 1 million in the same prior year period gross margin was 19 7 for the second quarter 2022 compared to 20 0 in the second quarter of 2021 the decrease in gross margin was attributable to a change in product category revenue mix combined with a year over year increase in product and shipping costs associated with the ongoing global supply chain disruptions operating expenses were 21 5 million for the second quarter of 2022 compared to 25 3 million for the second quarter of 2021 the decrease in operating expenses was primarily attributable to a 1 5 million decrease in advertising expenses due to lower

loss for the second quarter of 2022 was 0 9 million compared to operating income of 0 8 million for the second quarter of 2021 net loss for the second quarter of 2022 was 0 9 million compared to net

the company had cash of 7 3 million compared to 23 2 million at december 31 2021 the decrease in cash was driven primarily by the impact of a net cash loss of 0 8 million and a negative net change in operating assets and liabilities of 11 5 million primarily comprising of a decrease in accounts payables and customer deposits cash used in investing activities was 3 6 million primarily related to

since become a market leader and proven brand builder fueled by its commitment to delivering a revolutionary shopping experience comprehensive accurate and varied product offerings and continued digital commerce innovation non gaap financial measures this press release includes non gaap financial measures that differ from financial measures calculated in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap these non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to other measures prepared in accordance with gaap management uses non gaap financial measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business additionally management believes certain non gaap measures provide meaningful incremental information to investors to consider when evaluating the performance of the company to this end we provide ebitda and adjusted ebitda which are non gaap financial measures ebitda consists of net income loss plus a interest expense b income tax provision or less benefit and c depreciation expense adjusted ebitda consists of ebitda plus stock compensation expense and other costs fees expenses write offs and other items that do not impact the fundamentals of our operations as described further below following the reconciliation of these metrics management believes these non gaap measures provide useful information to investors in their assessment of the performance of our business the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating ebitda and adjusted ebitda facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period to period basis as these costs may vary independent of business performance accordingly we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors 2 ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are although depreciation is a non cash charge the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in our working capital ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect income tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect depreciation and interest expenses associated with the lease financing obligations and other companies including companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations you should consider ebitda and adjusted ebitda alongside other financial performance measures including various cash flow metrics net income loss and our other gaap results reconciliations of these non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are included in this press release cautionary note regarding forward looking statements all statements made in this press release

recurring core business operating results over multiple periods with other companies in its industry although qualys does not focus on quarterly billings qualys provides calculated current billings defined as total revenues recognized in a period plus the sequential change in current deferred revenue in the corresponding period to assist investors and analysts in assessing its operating performance qualys has not reconciled non gaap net income per diluted share guidance to gaap net income per diluted share guidance because qualys does not provide guidance on the various reconciling cash and non cash items between gaap net income and non gaap net income i e stock based compensation amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions and non recurring items the actual dollar amount of reconciling items in the third quarter and full year 2022 is likely to have a significant impact on the company s gaap net income per diluted share in the third quarter and full year 2022 a reconciliation of the non gaap net income per diluted share guidance to the gaap net income per diluted share guidance is not available without unreasonable effort in order to provide a more complete picture of recurring core operating business results the company s non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share are adjusted for non recurring income tax items and tax effect of non gaap adjustments to achieve the effective income tax rate on a non gaap basis the company s non gaap effective tax rate may differ from the gaap effective income tax rate as a result of these income tax adjustments the company believes its estimated non gaap effective income tax rate of 24 in 2022 is a reasonable estimate under its current global operating structure and core business operations the company may adjust this rate during the year to take into account events or trends that it believes materially impact the estimated annual rate the non gaap effective income tax rate could be subject to change for a number of reasons including but not limited to significant changes resulting from tax legislation material changes in geographic mix of revenues and expenses and other significant events the presentation of this non gaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap a

according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap specifically the company is presenting distributable earnings which constitutes a non gaap financial measure within the meaning of item 10 e of regulation s k and is net income under gaap while we believe the non gaap information included in this press release provides supplemental information to assist investors in analyzing our results and to assist investors in comparing our results with other peer issuers these measures are not in accordance with gaap and they should not be considered a substitute for or superior to our financial information calculated in accordance with gaap the methods of calculating non gaap financial measures may differ substantially from similarly titled measures used by other companies our gaap financial results and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated distributable earnings distributable earnings is a non gaap measure which we define as gaap net income loss attributable to holders of common stock computed in accordance with gaap including realized losses not otherwise included in gaap net income loss and excluding i non cash equity compensation ii depreciation and amortization iii any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non cash items that are included in net income for that applicable reporting period regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income loss or net income loss and iv one time events pursuant to changes in gaap and certain material non cash income or expense items after discussions with the company s board of directors and approved by a majority of the company s independent directors distributable earnings mirrors how we calculate core earnings pursuant to the terms of our management agreement between our manager and us or our management agreement for purposes of calculating the incentive fee payable to our manager while distributable earnings excludes the impact of any unrealized provisions for credit losses any loan losses are charged off and realized through distributable earnings when deemed non recoverable non recoverability is determined i upon the resolution of a loan i e when the loan is repaid fully or partially or in the case of foreclosures when the underlying asset is sold or ii with respect to any amount due under any loan when such amount is determined to be non collectible we believe that distributable earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income loss and cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap we believe distributable earnings is a useful financial metric for existing and potential future holders of our common stock as historically over time distributable earnings has been a strong indicator of our dividends per share of common stock as a reit we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our taxable income subject to certain adjustments and therefore we believe our dividends are one of the principal reasons stockholders may invest in our common stock furthermore distributable earnings help us to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and gaap adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan portfolio and operations and is a performance metric we consider when declaring our dividends distributable earnings does not represent net income loss or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income loss or an indication of gaap cash flows from operations a measure of our liquidity or an indication of funds available for our cash needs gaap to distributable earnings reconciliation three months

50 770 53 672 ________________________________________ 1 we calculate adjusted gross margin per barrel by dividing adjusted gross margin by total refining throughput adjusted gross margin for our washington refinery is determined under the last in first out lifo inventory costing method adjusted gross margin for our other refineries is determined under the first in first out fifo inventory costing method the definition of adjusted gross margin was modified beginning with the financial results reported for periods in fiscal year 2022 we have recast adjusted gross margin for prior periods when reported to conform to the current presentation please see discussion of adjusted gross margin below 2 management uses production costs per barrel to evaluate performance and compare efficiency to other companies in the industry there are a variety of ways to calculate production costs per barrel different companies within the industry calculate it in different ways we calculate production costs per barrel by dividing all direct production costs which include the costs to run the refineries including personnel costs repair and maintenance costs insurance utilities and other miscellaneous costs by total refining throughput our production costs are included in operating expense excluding depreciation on our condensed consolidated statement of operations which also includes costs related to our bulk marketing operations 3 we believe the 3 1 2 singapore crack spread or three barrels of brent crude oil converted into one barrel of gasoline and two barrels of distillates diesel and jet fuel is the most representative market indicator for our operations in hawaii 4 we believe the pacific northwest 5 2 2 1 index is the most representative market indicator for our operations in tacoma washington the pacific northwest 5 2 2 1 index is computed by taking two parts gasoline sub octane two parts middle distillates ultra low sulfur diesel ulsd and jet fuel and one part fuel oil as created from five barrels of alaskan north slope ans crude oil 5 the profitability of our wyoming refinery is heavily influenced by crack spreads in nearby markets we believe the wyoming 3 2 1 index is the most representative market indicator for our operations in wyoming the wyoming 3 2 1 index is computed by taking two parts gasoline and one part distillates ulsd as created from three barrels of west texas intermediate crude oil wti pricing is based 50 on applicable product pricing in rapid city south dakota and 50 on applicable product pricing in denver colorado non gaap performance measures management uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are considered non gaap financial measures these measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes or alternatives to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap these non gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies since each company may define these terms differently we believe adjusted gross margin as defined below provides useful information to investors because it eliminates the gross impact of volatile commodity prices and adjusts for certain non cash items and timing differences created by our inventory financing agreements and lower of cost and net realizable value adjustments to demonstrate the earnings potential of the business before other fixed and variable costs which are reported separately in operating expense excluding depreciation and depreciation and amortization management uses adjusted gross margin per barrel to evaluate operating performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry and to industry benchmarks we believe adjusted net income loss and adjusted ebitda as defined below are useful supplemental financial measures that allow investors to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods capital structure or historical cost basis the ability of our assets to generate cash to pay interest on our indebtedness and our operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to other companies without regard to financing methods and capital structure we believe adjusted ebitda by segment as defined below is a useful supplemental financial measure to evaluate the economic performance of our segments without regard to financing methods capital structure or historical cost basis beginning with financial results reported for periods in fiscal year 2022 the inventory valuation adjustment was modified to include the first in first out fifo inventory gains losses associated with our titled manufactured inventory in hawaii this modification was made to better align adjusted net income loss and adjusted ebitda with the cash flow of the hawaii refining business prior to 2022 the impacts of fifo inventory gains losses associated with hawaii titled manufactured inventory were eliminated through the inventory valuation adjustment beginning with financial results reported for the second quarter of 2022 adjusted gross margin adjusted net income loss and adjusted ebitda also exclude the mark to market losses gains associated with our net rins liability this modification was made to better reflect our operating performance and to improve comparability between periods we have recast adjusted gross margin adjusted net income loss and adjusted ebitda for prior periods when reported

toronto aug 08 2022 globe newswire martinrea international inc tsx mre a diversified and global automotive supplier engaged in the design development and manufacturing of highly engineered value added lightweight structures and propulsion systems today announced the release of its financial results for the second quarter ended june 30 2022 and that it has declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0 05 per share total sales of 1 113 9 million up 25 9 year over year second quarter diluted net earnings per share and adjusted net earnings per share 1 of 0 32 of 0 32 second quarter adjusted operating income 1 of 45 5 million up 16 6 year over year of 45 5 million up 16 6 year over year second quarter results were generally consistent with the first quarter of 2022 as lower quarter over quarter production sales were offset by a higher adjusted operating income margin 1 financial results were much improved in the first half of 2022 compared to second half of 2021 financial results are expected to improve further in the third quarter of 2022 and beyond as production disruptions subside launch activity normalizes and we drive further cost recoveries through commercial activity 2023 outlook remains intact including our expectation of over 200 million in free cash flow 1 our net debt to adjusted ebitda 1 ratio was 3 21x for bank covenant purposes the net debt to adjusted ebitda 1 ratio was 2 38x this calculation excludes third and fourth quarter adjusted ebitda 1 with the remaining quarters pro rated as per our amended lending agreement with our banking syndicate ratio was 3 21x for bank covenant purposes the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio was 2 38x this calculation excludes third and fourth quarter adjusted ebitda with the remaining quarters pro rated as per our amended lending agreement with our banking syndicate quarterly cash dividend of 0 05 declared overview pat d eramo president and chief executive officer stated our second quarter financial results were generally consistent with our first quarter performance as the impact of lower production sales was offset by a better adjusted operating income margin 1 while our performance year to date is much improved compared to the back half of last year we continue to face a challenging environment on several fronts including supply related disruptions from our customers and inflationary cost pressures with energy costs being a notable headwind in our european operations at the same time we have been successful in offsetting a portion of these costs through commercial activity i am proud of the work our team has done here and we expect more positive results to come from this commercial activity in the weeks and months ahead overall our second quarter results are where we expected them to be and confirm our view that the worst of the customer production issues are likely behind us we expect our results to improve in the third quarter and beyond as supply chain bottlenecks improve our launch activity normalizes and we drive further cost recoveries through commercial activity this should set the stage for a multi year period of strong production volumes margins and free cash flow 1 with the majority of our plants running at full capacity as vehicle inventories remain historically low and industry demand is still high he added i am pleased to announce that we have been awarded 85 million in new business which consists of 70 million in lightweight structures including additional volume on the ford mach e additional content on general motors bev 3 electric vehicle program and 15 million in propulsion systems including additional volume on the samsung battery enclosure for stellantis we continue to win meaningful work on electric vehicle platforms with key customers fred di tosto chief financial officer stated sales for the second quarter excluding tooling sales of 61 2 million were 1 052 6 million and adjusted net earnings per share 1 was 0 32 adjusted operating income 1 of 45 5 million and adjusted ebitda 1 of 114 3 million were generally consistent quarter over quarter and up approximately 17 and 15 year over year respectively a good quarter overall considering the volatile environment free cash flow 1 was positive 23 5 million for the quarter compared to a negative level in the first quarter mainly reflecting the timing of working capital flows we expect free cash flow 1 to be breakeven to slightly positive for the full year of 2022 he continued net debt 1 was approximately flat quarter over quarter at 931 million recall that under our amended lending agreements with our banking syndicate announced earlier this year adjusted ebitda 1 in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 are ignored with the remaining quarters in the trailing twelve month period pro rated when calculating net debt to adjusted ebitda 1 for covenant purposes our leverage ratio is also subject to higher limits through the third quarter of 2022 on this basis our calculated net debt to adjusted ebitda 1 ratio under the revised terms was 2 38x in the second quarter down from 2 43x in the first quarter a comfortable level and well below the covenant maximum of 4 5x for the quarter our leverage ratio should continue to improve in the coming quarters as we generate an increasing amount of adjusted ebitda 1 and free cash flow 1 a portion of which we will use to pay down some debt we have strong relationships with our lenders and we thank them for their ongoing support rob wildeboer executive chairman stated better times are ahead for us and other automotive suppliers despite all you read about war in ukraine interest rates inflation recession house prices supply chains labour shortages erratic production schedules we had a good quarter and our results should continue to improve moving forward the fact is that automotive parts suppliers have technically been in a recession for over two years we are hit when production volumes are down we were hit badly in 2020 when the industry stopped for three months we came back strong in the second half of 2020 but since that time we have been hit by supply related production disruptions inflationary cost pressures and a heavy launch cycle things are looking up there is a lot of pent up demand for vehicles given a persistent lack of supply and a need for oems to rebuild depleted inventory levels this should help to offset the negative impacts from any potential economic slowdown we are maintaining our 2023 outlook which calls for production sales excluding tooling sales of 4 6 to 4 8 billion an adjusted operating income margin 1 exceeding 8 and over 200 million in free cash flow 1 i believe our company has never been stronger and our future looks bright results

company s europe operating segment increased by 52 2 million or 11 2 to 517 3 million from 465 0 million for the six months ended june 30 2021 the increase can be attributed to the recovery in production volumes of certain light vehicle platforms that were disproportionately impacted by the industry wide shortage of semiconductor chips during 2021 the launch and ramp up of new programs including mercedes new electric vehicle platform and the lucid air the impact of aluminum material passthrough on customer pricing and a 9 8 million increase in tooling sales these positive factors were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on the translation of euro denominated production sales which had a negative impact on overall sales for the six months ended june 30 2022 of 38

million from 91 1 million for the six months ended june 30 2021 the decrease was largely driven by lower year over year production volumes including a program that came with the operations acquired from metalsa that ended production during or subsequent to the six months ended june 30 2021 and a 0 9 million decrease in tooling sales these negative factors were partially offset by the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the six months ended june 30 2021 namely with geely and a 1 9 million positive foreign exchange impact from the translation of foreign denominated production sales

washington an hour after democrats released the text of their climate and tax legislation washington lobbyists for the private equity industry sprang into action with a final senate vote nearing on the major package on sunday a late addition would have subjected companies controlled by private investment funds to a new 15 percent corporate minimum tax in the legislation that was supposed to apply to america s biggest corporations but a last minute mobilization of political muscle and direct pleas to senator kyrsten sinema the arizona democrat who opposes tax increases and is sympathetic to private equity got the measure scrapped the blitz was emblematic of the messy nature of tax policymaking and how policies meant to curb tax avoidance can spring new carve outs on the fly the issue stems from how private equity firms work they typically invest in a portfolio of companies under the provision that was the point of contention if the combined book income of companies controlled by the same private equity fund exceeded 1 billion all of those companies even if they were small or medium size would be liable to pay the new 15 percent tax on the income they reported to their shareholders

the biden administration said monday it was shipping its biggest yet direct delivery of weapons to ukraine as that country prepares for a potentially decisive counteroffensive in the south against russia sending 1 billion in rockets ammunition and other material to ukraine from defense department stockpiles the new u s arms shipment would further strengthen ukraine as it mounts the counteroffensive which analysts say for the first time could allow kyiv to shape the course of the rest of the war now at the half year mark kyiv aims to push russian troops back out of kherson and other southern territory near the dnipro river russia in recent days was moving troops and equipment in the direction of the southern port cities to stave off the ukrainian counteroffensive at every stage of this conflict we have been focused on getting the ukrainians what they need depending on the evolving conditions on the battlefield colin kahl undersecretary of defense for policy said monday in announcing the new weapons shipment get south florida local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc south florida newsletters president biden arrived in spain on tuesday for a nato summit where spoke after meeting with spanish president pedro s√°nchez where they discussed how to continue to support ukraine and hold russia accountable for its assault the new u s aid includes additional rockets for the high mobility artillery rocket systems or himars as well as thousands of artillery rounds mortar systems javelins and other ammunition and equipment military commanders and other u s officials say the himars and artillery systems have been crucial in ukraine s fight to block russia from taking more ground while the u s has already provided 16 himars to ukraine kahl said the new package does not include additional ones these are not systems that we assess you need in the hundreds to have the type of effects needed kahl said these are precision guided systems for very particular types of targets and the ukrainians are using them as such he declined to say how many of the precision guided missile systems for the himars were included in monday s announcement but said the u s has provided multiple hundreds of them in recent weeks the latest announcement brings the total u s security assistance committed to ukraine by the biden administration to more than 9 billion in his nightly video address ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy thanked the united states for the package and said 100 of it we will use to protect freedom our common freedom until now the largest single security assistance package announcement was for 1 billion on june 15 but that aid included 350 million in presidential drawdown authority and another 650 million under the ukraine security assistance initiative which provides funding for training equipment and other security needs that can be bought from other countries or companies monday s package allows the u s to deliver weapons systems and other equipment more quickly since it takes them off the defense department shelves in addition to the rockets for the himars it includes 75 000 rounds of 155mm artillery 20 mortar systems and 20 000 rounds for them 1 000 shoulder mounted javelin rockets and other arms explosives and medical equipment for the last four months of the war russia has concentrated on capturing the donbas region of eastern ukraine where pro moscow separatists have controlled some territory as self proclaimed republics for eight years russian forces have made gradual headway in the region while launching missile and rocket attacks to curtail the movements of ukrainian fighters elsewhere kahl estimated that russian forces have sustained up to 80 000 deaths and injuries in the fighting though he did not break down the figure with an estimate of forces killed he said the russian troops have managed to gain incremental ground in eastern ukraine although not in recent weeks but that has come at extraordinary cost to the russian military because of how well the ukrainian military has performed and all the assistance that the ukrainian military has gotten and i think now conditions in the east have essentially stabilized and the focus is really shifting to the south the new funding is being paid for through 40 billion in economic and security aid for ukraine approved by congress in may this is the 18th time the pentagon has provided equipment from defense department stocks to ukraine since august 2021 ukraine s first lady olena zelenska spoke in front of members of congress on wednesday the u s and allies still are evaluating whether to supply aircraft to ukraine kahl said it s not inconceivable that western aircraft down the road could be part of the mix he said zelenskyy early in the war made near daily appeals for warplanes calling them essential to protecting ukraine s skies the u s and some other nato countries feared that could draw them into more direct involvement with ukraine s war against russia and have not provided western aircraft separately monday the treasury department said it was sending 3 billion more in

the pentagon on monday said it is sending ukraine an additional 1 billion in military assistance including tens of thousands more munitions and explosives the largest such package since russia launched its invasion in february the announcement comes as ukrainian forces undertake a counteroffensive aimed at reclaiming the southern city of kherson the operation is seen in kyiv and in washington as a vital bid to prevent the kremlin from making good on its vow to absorb occupied territories via planned referendums senior u s officials have denounced moscow s annexation plan as a sham the new security assistance package includes ammunition for the high mobility artillery rocket systems known as himars and 75 000 howitzer rounds as well as mortar systems surface to air missiles javelin anti armor missiles claymore mines and demolition explosives it pushes the total u s military support for ukraine past 9 billion since the war began officials said advertisement these are all critical capabilities to help the ukrainians repel the russian offensive in the east and also to address evolving developments in the south and elsewhere said undersecretary of defense for policy colin kahl he characterized the package as comprising the types of weaponry the ukrainian people are using so effectively to defend their country kahl said the russian military has encountered considerable setbacks as a result of u s efforts to arm and equip ukraine indicating its forces have suffered an estimated 70 000 to 80 000 casualties in the past six months the figure includes personnel killed and wounded he said but the counteroffensive in kherson will probably be a challenge for ukrainian forces the government in kyiv has signaled for weeks that it intends to move on the city which before the invasion was home to approximately 300 000 and while the ukrainians efforts have already helped recover some nearby villages russian units have taken notice said dmitry gorenburg a senior research scientist at the think tank cna and an expert on the russian military advertisement it remains to be seen he added whether washington s latest arms transfer will prove sufficient to enable the ukrainians to achieve their immediate objectives the russians have redeployed a lot of defenses in that area gorenburg said kherson is a large city and the same problems of attacking a large city that the russians faced in the early stages of their attack the ukrainians would face if the russians chose to defend it while the influx of munitions and antitank systems in monday s aid package are good for stopping offensives gorenburg said it s not necessarily going to be as useful if you ve got a bunch of infantry dug in share this article share in ukraine the sense of urgency is dire officials say president volodymyr zelensky told members of congress late last month that his military had only a few weeks to change the course of the war a timeline driven in part by russia s threat to annex parts of occupied ukraine as soon as next month and by the knowledge that the operation would become exponentially more complicated if it drags into the winter advertisement ukrainian leaders have pleaded with the west for more himars which along with other sophisticated weapons systems have enabled them to destroy russian command posts ammunition depots air defense sites radar and communication nodes and long range artillery positions to date they have received 16 u s produced systems three british made equivalents and a promise from germany that another three will be delivered according to kahl zelensky s top advisers have said they need dozens more if ukraine is to drive back the russian advance when asked monday if the absence of additional himars was an indication that the united states was running low on its stock of the systems kahl declined to answer directly the weapons he said have been very effective in hitting things while making it more difficult for russia to move forces around the battlefield the pentagon kahl added is committed to delivering weapons from the united states stocks when they are available though the long range precision capabilities of himars are not particularly suited to the close range combat of a slow moving counteroffensive they have been useful in keeping russian logistics the weak underbelly that crippled its effort to sack kyiv early in the war on the back foot experts say by targeting russian munitions depots within occupied parts of ukraine himars strikes have made it more complicated for russia to resupply its own front lines causing havoc in the supply lines that could provide ukraine with openings to make additional gains gorenburg said advertisement but the ukrainian military has to be ready to take advantage of such opportunities he said though western governments have steadily pledged military assistance to ukraine in many cases the promised munitions have been slow to reach the front lines according to the kiel institute for the world economy as of july 1 the united states and germany had delivered less than half of the military aid announced for ukraine the institute said it plans to update its figures this month but zelensky wants his benefactors to do more than provide arms to help his country stave off the threat of annexation a looming fate made more real monday when the russian appointed head of the occupation administration in zaporizhzhia signed a decree to move forward with a sept 11 referendum in an interview zelensky told the washington post that the united states and its allies should take the unprecedented step of banning all russian travelers from their countries the most important sanctions are to close the borders because the russians are taking away someone else s land zelensky said russians should live in their own world he added until they change their philosophy

the biden administration said monday it was shipping its biggest yet direct delivery of weapons to ukraine as that country prepares for a potentially decisive counteroffensive in the south against russia sending 1 billion in rockets ammunition and other material to ukraine from defense department stockpiles the new u s arms shipment would further strengthen ukraine as it mounts the counteroffensive which analysts say for the first time could allow kyiv to shape the course of the rest of the war now at the half year mark kyiv aims to push russian troops back out of kherson and other southern territory near the dnipro river russia in recent days was moving troops and equipment in the direction of the southern port cities to stave off the ukrainian counteroffensive at every stage of this conflict we have been focused on getting the ukrainians what they need depending on the evolving conditions on the battlefield colin kahl undersecretary of defense for policy said monday in announcing the new weapons shipment get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters president biden arrived in spain on tuesday for a nato summit where spoke after meeting with spanish president pedro s√°nchez where they discussed how to continue to support ukraine and hold russia accountable for its assault the new u s aid includes additional rockets for the high mobility artillery rocket systems or himars as well as thousands of artillery rounds mortar systems javelins and other ammunition and equipment military commanders and other u s officials say the himars and artillery systems have been crucial in ukraine s fight to block russia from taking more ground while the u s has already provided 16 himars to ukraine kahl said the new package does not include additional ones these are not systems that we assess you need in the hundreds to have the type of effects needed kahl said these are precision guided systems for very particular types of targets and the ukrainians are using them as such he declined to say how many of the precision guided missile systems for the himars were included in monday s announcement but said the u s has provided multiple hundreds of them in recent weeks the latest announcement brings the total u s security assistance committed to ukraine by the biden administration to more than 9 billion in his nightly video address ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy thanked the united states for the package and said 100 of it we will use to protect freedom our common freedom until now the largest single security assistance package announcement was for 1 billion on june 15 but that aid included 350 million in presidential drawdown authority and another 650 million under the ukraine security assistance initiative which provides funding for training equipment and other security needs that can be bought from other countries or companies monday s package allows the u s to deliver weapons systems and other equipment more quickly since it takes them off the defense department shelves in addition to the rockets for the himars it includes 75 000 rounds of 155mm artillery 20 mortar systems and 20 000 rounds for them 1 000 shoulder mounted javelin rockets and other arms explosives and medical equipment for the last four months of the war russia has concentrated on capturing the donbas region of eastern ukraine where pro moscow separatists have controlled some territory as self proclaimed republics for eight years russian forces have made gradual headway in the region while launching missile and rocket attacks to curtail the movements of ukrainian fighters elsewhere kahl estimated that russian forces have sustained up to 80 000 deaths and injuries in the fighting though he did not break down the figure with an estimate of forces killed he said the russian troops have managed to gain incremental ground in eastern ukraine although not in recent weeks but that has come at extraordinary cost to the russian military because of how well the ukrainian military has performed and all the assistance that the ukrainian military has gotten and i think now conditions in the east have essentially stabilized and the focus is really shifting to the south the new funding is being paid for through 40 billion in economic and security aid for ukraine approved by congress in may this is the 18th time the pentagon has provided equipment from defense department stocks to ukraine since august 2021 ukraine s first lady olena zelenska spoke in front of members of congress on wednesday the u s and allies still are evaluating whether to supply aircraft to ukraine kahl said it s not inconceivable that western aircraft down the road could be part of the mix he said zelenskyy early in the war made near daily appeals for warplanes calling them essential to protecting ukraine s skies the u s and some other nato countries feared that could draw them into more direct involvement with ukraine s war against russia and have not provided western aircraft separately monday the treasury department said it was sending 3 billion more in direct

sector is an integral component to the economy as automation becomes more widespread the demand for computer chips is set to remain elevated however this strong demand hasn t stopped the sector from experiencing a sharp correction in the past several months another key feature of semiconductors are their tendency to behave as a leading indicator for stocks in other words it s not unusual to see growth related sectors peak and bottom out before the broader market this makes chips a sector to always monitor closely is there gain after the pain semiconductors have been a secular leading sector since late 2008 their outperformance hasn t gone unnoticed and it became a favorite of many traders and investors over the years however the sector s drawdown in 2022 has been its worst in over a decade the pain in semiconductors was only exacerbated by the chip shortage over the past year as producers were unable to source the required materials due to supply chain constraints but what was a shortage could soon turn into a supply glut as chip factories race to catch up with pent up demand once these orders are satisfied though could the industry face a period of lackluster demand for

you may have noticed some empty lifeguard chairs or even some closed beaches at the jersey shore recently as august rolls along this issue may get worse as kids head off to college leaving behind a lifeguard shortage beaches in sea girt belmar and avalon are prepared to give their existing lifeguards extra shifts if needed to cover the gap as reported by news 12 on tuesday aug 2 the swimming beach at a paul king county park in manahawkin closed because there just were not enough lifeguards to man the beach asbury park beaches were short seven lifeguards this summer than last year said beach safety supervisor joe bongiovanni some guards didn t return other guards are college students who took internships this summer and were only available to lifeguard a couple of days a week ap that really hurt the beach patrol he said but bongiovanni hopes that as the internships wrap up some may still be available to grab a shift or two to help out the rest of the summer starting aug 15 is when it can get challenging to man the beaches with enough lifeguards he added i also have some older guards guys who have worked here for years and years and years they have other businesses or have moved out of state but they come in toward the end of the summer for a week or two to fill those spots bongiovanni said he thinks with their help the asbury park beach patrol will be able to get through labor day weekend without too much of a problem creative scheduling may also have to happen he said some guards may have to work on their days off he said the guys and girls have been great about chipping in and helping when it s been tough the good news is that no beaches had to be closed during the summer despite the lifeguard shortage bongiovanni said he also believes another reason why there was a lifeguard shortage all summer was due to the pay scale we were trying to stay pace with the state with the minimum wage the minimum wage goes to 15 an hour next year so we were trying to stay pace with that he said but with inflation other places like some big box stores and restaurants were paying between 18 and 20 to get people when you think about it where you rather go sit out in the sun learn first aid and cpr and be responsible for thousands of people s lives for 15 an hour or go stock shelves for 17 an hour in an air conditioned building bongiovanni said he thinks they are going to have to restructure the whole salary guide for next year to bring the pay scale up and attract more kids sunset beach cape may point bud mccormick in cape may five lifeguard stands are not open so the beaches are about 10 guards short this summer according to rich demers with the cape may county beach patrol however 21 stands remain open on the beachfront and more than 20 beaches have been able to stay open at all times all summer at the end of next week however they will lose eight lifeguards as college kids return to school he said that means they will most likely have to close individual beaches and do a lot more guarding from the sand that means making sure people swim in front of the lifeguards and not in unguarded areas demers said most beachgoers are extremely cooperative just like in asbury park another reason for the lifeguard shortage revolves around salary he said other beach patrols in the south jersey region have upped the pay scale tremendously for example avalon and stone harbor pay their rookie lifeguards 150 a day and our 25 year guards make 150 a day demers said housing has also been an issue many cape may lifeguards come from far away and to travel back and forth daily is too much in years past lifeguards would just get housing for the summer the housing in cape may is very difficult for the lifeguards to find in the summertime at a reasonable price next season demers hopes the city will recognize the need to have an equitable pay scale with other municipalities hopefully we can find a way with the housing that s going to be the biggest issue we re going to do a little bit more recruiting to the local swim teams obviously if the kid lives locally that takes care of the housing issue demers said jen ursillo is a reporter and anchor for new jersey 101 5 you can reach her at jennifer ursillo townsquaremedia com click here to contact an editor about feedback or a correction for this story
investors can turn to thematic exchange traded fund strategies to focus on rising trends in today s market environment jay jacobs u s head of thematics and active equity etfs at blackrock inc pointed out that many investors are using thematic etfs to hedge against inflation and capture rising trends like the rebound in value stocks this year bloomberg reports now it s really pivoted especially as we ve seen broader shifts within the market from growth to value people are looking for more themes that are in the value space especially themes that we think are going to be more resilient in this high inflationary environment jacobs told bloomberg etf investors can target the value style with strategies like the ishares s p 500 value etf ive ishares russell 2000 value etf nysearca iwn ishares msci usa value factor etf vlue and ishares focused value factor etf fovl beyond these broader strokes jacobs also highlighted several targeted thematic plays that have popped up recently so we ve seen a lot of interest in infrastructure as a theme we ve seen an incredible amount of interest in food related themes especially as we ve seen inflation at the supermarket jacobs added and then also we ve seen interest in clean energy as a play on inflation as well as some of the most recent news out of washington as a way to gain exposure to the infrastructure sector investors can look to something like the e ishares u s infrastructure etf cboe ifra a lot of infrastructure asset owners companies that run airports run toll roads run seaports or utilities companies they literally get to change their tolls based off of cpi so that is a natural built in business hedge for inflation when inflation is higher they get to raise their rates especially if their regulated rates are tied to cpi and that just neutralizes those businesses from an inflation perspective jacobs explained the ishares emergent food and agtech multisector etf iveg can help investors focus on companies expected to benefit from creating or using agricultural technologies or innovative food products or services we ve seen a rising emerging market consumer which is spending more money on food and more complex foods like proteins and dairies we ve seen a growing global population which will reach 10 billion people by the year 2050 and we re seeing a change in food preferences where people are increasingly demanding sustainable food jacobs said lastly the ishares global clean energy etf icln offers exposure to the global clean energy sector and then the third theme is clean energy where we ve seen that a lot of the cost in clean energy is really in the initial build out you build out a solar farm you build out a wind turbine that cost is mostly up front jacobs added so in an inflationary environment where you have rising commodity prices upfront payment of a lot of those costs tends to be beneficiary for more news information and strategy visit vettafi
the european union on monday said it put forward a final text to revive the 2015 iran nuclear deal as four days of indirect talks between u s and iranian officials wrapped up in vienna what can be negotiated has been negotiated and it s now in a final text however behind every technical issue and every paragraph lies a political decision that needs to be taken in the capitals eu foreign policy chief josep borrell tweeted if these answers are positive then we can sign this deal he added as eu iranian and u s prepared to leave vienna earlier a senior eu official told reporters that no more changes could be made to the text which has been under negotiation for 15 months and said he expected a final decision from the parties within a very very few weeks it is a package proposal you cannot agree with page 20 and disagree with page 50 you have to say yes or no he said a u s state department spokesperson said washington was ready to quickly reach an agreement to revive the deal formally called the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa on the basis of the eu proposals iranian officials suggested that they did not regard the eu proposals as final saying they would convey their additional views and considerations to the european union which coordinates the talks after consultations in tehran iran has also made demands the united states and other western powers view as outside the scope of reviving the deal for example iran has insisted the international atomic energy agency the u n nuclear watchdog drop its claims iran has failed to fully explain uranium traces at undeclared sites each side sought to put the onus on the other to compromise they the iranians repeatedly say they are prepared for a return to mutual implementation of the jcpoa let s see if their actions match their words the u s spokesperson said iran and six major powers struck the original accord in 2015 under which it agreed to restrict its nuclear program to make it harder to use it to develop atomic weapons an ambition it denies in return for relief from u s eu and u n sanctions in 2018 then u s president donald trump ditched the deal and reimposed harsh u s sanctions designed to choke off iran s oil exports its major source of export income and government revenue in response tehran which says its nuclear program is for power generation and other peaceful purposes began about a year later to breach the agreement in several ways including rebuilding stocks of enriched uranium it has also enriched uranium to 60 purity far above the 3 67 that is permitted under the deal but below the 90 that is regarded as weapons grade u s president joe biden has sought to revive the agreement since he took office in january 2021 and negotiations indirect because iran refuses to deal directly with the united states on the issue began in vienna in april 2021 iran has also sought to obtain guarantees that no future u s president would renege on the deal if it were revived as trump did in 2018 washington cannot provide such ironclad assurances because the deal is a political understanding rather than a legally binding treaty iranian state media hinted at this issue on monday the final agreement must ensure the rights and interests of the iranian people and guarantee the effective and stable removal of sanctions iranian foreign minister hossein amirabdollahian told borrell in a call state media reported

russia s central bank announced steps on monday aimed at preventing investors from unfriendly countries from taking advantage of plans to allow those from friendly nations to resume trading on the moscow stock market the moscow exchange said on friday it would allow clients from friendly jurisdictions or those that have not imposed sanctions against russia over its actions in ukraine to start trading after an almost six month hiatus but it later said this would apply only to the derivatives market not the main stock market and did not say when the wider access would be permitted analysts said the delay was partly due to concerns that investors from the european union united states and britain which are currently banned from trading in moscow might be able to use the resumption of trading by friendly nations as a back door to offload any russian stocks they still hold the central bank said on monday it was blocking russian depositories and registrars from executing transactions with securities received from foreign counterparts including from friendly countries for six months the regulator said it had seen brokers offering the option to purchase securities from non residents in foreign jurisdictions and then transfer the assets to a russian depository a move which it described as risky and with no guarantee of obtaining the expected financial result western sanctions have severely restricted russians access to global stock markets while countermeasures from moscow have also blocked most foreigners from buying and selling russian shares source reuters reporting by reuters editing by mark potter

when joe biden departs on wednesday for a vacation on kiawah island south carolina he will have reasons to be cheerful last friday the labor department reported that employers created more than half a million jobs in july confirming that biden was right when he said the economy isn t in recession the house of representative looks set to pass the inflation reduction act of 2022 later this week senate democrats voted the legislation through over the weekend and it includes parts of the president s build back better policy agenda perhaps the most remarkable thing about the new legislation which provides extensive tax breaks for clean energy and authorizes medicare to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs is that it survived at all just a month ago when senator joe manchin told chuck schumer the senate majority leader that he wouldn t support the bill it seemed dead thanks to manchin s change of mind and schumer s cat herding the bill was resurrected and rushed through the senate before the summer recess a feat that prompted at least one democratic senator brian schatz of hawaii to shed tears going into the midterms biden and the democrats will also be able to tout other legislative accomplishments in june congress passed the first gun control bill in thirty years which tightened background checks for young buyers and provided incentives for states to expand red flag laws that allow the authorities with the approval of a judge to disarm dangerous individuals in the past couple of weeks two more bills have been passed the chips act provides more than fifty billion dollars to encourage the manufacture of semiconductor chips in the united states a new veterans bill creates an entitlement program for veterans who may have been exposed to toxic waste from fires on military bases known as burn pits taken together these pieces of legislation should put to bed the notion that biden and the democrats can t get anything done and they also demonstrate that his election pledge to pursue bipartisan initiatives wasn t an empty one despite the hyper partisanship in washington three of the four bills gained some republican support and senate democrats after months of disarray held together and passed the inflation reduction act on a party line vote of fifty one to fifty using the reconciliation process i was one of the folks who was first in supporting now president biden when he was candidate biden and i think he s done good things for our country the delaware senator chris coons told abc news s george stephanopoulos on sunday i think he s got a strong record of accomplishments to run on the inflation reduction act so named to placate manchin contains the biggest effort to tackle climate change that the u s government has taken right now thanks largely to the retirement of coal fired electricity plants the country is on track to reduce its carbon emissions by about thirty per cent by 2030 compared to 2005 by providing about 370 billion in tax credits over ten years for solar and wind producers as well as for the purchase of electric vehicles the new bill will increase the emissions reduction to about forty per cent according to several expert analyses although hitting that figure would fall short of the white house s initial target of a carbon reduction of fifty per cent it would represent a historic move in the right direction in addition the bill should boost employment in the clean energy and clean manufacturing sectors which are already attracting significant private investment how big a boost a study from the political economy research institute at the university of massachusetts amherst says that the new legislation bill would create more than nine million jobs in this sector over the next ten years another important element of the bill is that it would empower medicare to use its heft to negotiate lower prescription drug prices other public health care systems such as the united kingdom s national health service have long haggled over the prices that they pay pharmaceutical companies in this country the big pharma lobby has managed to maintain a system in which drug companies can largely dictate their own prices at last congress has challenged this cozy arrangement albeit in a modest way the new legislation would cover ten drugs starting in 2026 as critics have pointed out that s not very many but it seems likely that this number will expand once the general principle is accepted the legislation also places an annual cap on prescription drug outlays for people covered by medicare in this way and others it reflects some long standing progressive priorities the best that can be said of the bill is that it represents a significant reorientation of policy in a number of areas felicia wong the president of the liberal roosevelt institute told me it starts things in the direction we need to be going as additional examples wong cited the eighty billion dollar boost to the i r s budget which is designed to enable the agency to go after wealthy tax dodgers more effectively and the taxing of stock buybacks which is intended to incentivize corporations to invest in capital equipment and research rather than boosting their stock prices wong also emphasized that the new spending bill doesn t go far enough a point that is indisputable for all the worthwhile things it contains many others got left out from biden s original agenda a short list incudes the enhanced child income tax credit which dramatically reduced child poverty before being phased out last year paid leave guaranteed pre school for four year olds and expanded child care a reversal of the high income tax cuts in trump s 2017 tax bill and an end to the carried interest loophole for private equity and hedge funds which represents another indefensible blemish on the tax code the common theme is that efforts to tackle pressing social problems and rising inequality got left out unlike private equity tycoons poor and working class families don t have the entire republican party platoons of highly paid lobbyists and a certain democratic senator from arizona looking out for their interests unlike green energy producers and manufacturers of electric vehicles they aren t making hefty investments that need tax breaks to succeed in shifting the economy away from fossil fuels as often before their needs will have to wait that s more an endemic failing of the american political system and a fifty fifty senate than of this particular piece of legislation in making a serious commitment to green energy the enactment of the bill would be a landmark moment in u s policymaking in demonstrating that this generation of democrats can pass major legislation unaided it would upend the previous narrative of a faltering biden administration relative to where things stood a couple of months ago the change seems momentous

washington the biden administration said monday it was shipping its biggest yet direct delivery of weapons to ukraine as that country prepares for a potentially decisive counteroffensive in the south against russia sending 1 billion in rockets ammunition and other material to ukraine from defense department stockpiles the new u s arms shipment would further strengthen ukraine as it mounts the counteroffensive which analysts say for the first time could allow kyiv to shape the course of the rest of the war now at the half year mark kyiv aims to push russian troops back out of kherson and other southern territories near the dnipro river russia in recent days was moving troops and equipment in the direction of the southern port cities to stave off the ukrainian counteroffensive at every stage of this conflict we have been focused on getting the ukrainians what they need depending on the evolving conditions on the battlefield colin kahl undersecretary of defense for policy said monday in announcing the new weapons shipment the new u s aid includes additional rockets for the high mobility artillery rocket systems or himars as well as thousands of artillery rounds mortar systems javelins and other ammunition and equipment military commanders and other u s officials say the himars and artillery systems have been crucial in ukraine s fight to block russia from taking more ground while the u s has already provided 16 himars to ukraine kahl said the new package does not include additional ones advertisement these are not systems that we assess you need in the hundreds to have the type of effects needed kahl said these are precision guided systems for very particular types of targets and the ukrainians are using them as such he declined to say how many of the precision guided missile systems for the himars were included in monday s announcement but said the u s has provided multiple hundreds of them in recent weeks the latest announcement brings the total u s security assistance committed to ukraine by the biden administration to more than 9 billion in his nightly video address ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky thanked the united states for the package and said 100 of it we will use to protect freedom our common freedom until now the largest single security assistance package announcement was for 1 billion on june 15 but that aid included 350 million in presidential drawdown authority and another 650 million under the ukraine security assistance initiative which provides funding for training equipment and other security needs that can be bought from other countries or companies monday s package allows the u s to deliver weapons systems and other equipment more quickly since it takes them off the defense department shelves advertisement in addition to the rockets for the himars it includes 75 000 rounds of 155mm artillery 20 mortar systems and 20 000 rounds for them 1 000 shoulder mounted javelin rockets and other arms explosives and medical equipment for the last four months of the war russia has concentrated on capturing the donbas region of eastern ukraine where pro moscow separatists have controlled some territory as self proclaimed republics for eight years russian forces have made gradual headway in the region while launching missile and rocket attacks to curtail the movements of ukrainian fighters elsewhere kahl estimated that russian forces have sustained up to 80 000 deaths and injuries in the fighting though he did not break down the figure with an estimate of forces killed he said the russian troops have managed to gain incremental ground in eastern ukraine although not in recent weeks but that has come at extraordinary cost to the russian military because of how well the ukrainian military has performed and all the assistance that the ukrainian military has gotten and i think now conditions in the east have essentially stabilized and the focus is really shifting to the south the new funding is being paid for through 40 billion in economic and security aid for ukraine approved by congress in may this is the 18th time the pentagon has provided equipment from defense department stocks to ukraine since august 2021 the u s and allies still are evaluating whether to supply aircraft to ukraine kahl said it s not inconceivable that western aircraft down the road could be part of the mix he said zelensky early in the war made near daily appeals for warplanes calling them essential to protecting ukraine s skies the u s and some other nato countries feared that could draw them into more direct involvement with ukraine s war against russia and have not provided western aircraft separately monday the treasury department said it was sending 3 billion more in direct economic assistance to ukraine that s part of a previously approved 7 5 billion in economic assistance with 1 5 billion yet to be disbursed send questions comments to the editors previous next

reconciles noi to net income the most directly comparable gaap metric in thousands see notes to reconciliation of ffo normalized ffo normalized fad and noi notes to reconciliation of ffo normalized ffo normalized fad and noi these supplemental performance measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other reits consequently our funds from operations ffo normalized ffo and normalized funds available for distribution fad may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other reits since other reits may not use our definition of these performance measures caution should be exercised when comparing our ffo normalized ffo and normalized fad to that of other reits these financial performance measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap these measures do not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of performance or to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs beginning in the first quarter of 2021 the company is no longer presenting adjusted funds from operations as a supplemental measure of operating performance funds from operations ffo ffo as defined by nareit and applied by us is net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures if any the company s computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from that of the company therefore caution should be exercised when comparing our company s ffo to that of other reits diluted ffo assumes the exercise of stock options and other potentially dilutive securities normalized ffo excludes from ffo certain items which due to their infrequent or unpredictable nature may create some difficulty in comparing ffo for the current period to similar prior periods and may include but are not limited to impairment of non real estate assets gains and losses attributable to the acquisition and disposition of assets and liabilities and recoveries of previous write downs ffo and normalized ffo are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative and should be supplemented with a measure such as ffo the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue funds available for distribution fad in addition to the adjustments included in the calculation of normalized ffo normalized fad excludes the impact of any straight line rent revenue amortization of the original issue discount on our senior unsecured notes amortization of debt issuance costs non cash stock based compensation as well as certain non cash items related

s is home to thousands of advisors that can meet your specific needs based on the methodology outlined below smartasset identified these financial advisor firms as among the top 5 financial advisor firms in the u s rank financial advisor assets managed 1 714 587 898 072 2 173 418 270 044 3 46 803 858 104 4 94 617 046 882 5 19 851 537 239 methodology to find the top financial advisors in the u s we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure firms with a fee only as opposed to fee based compensation structure are ranked higher these stats are updated annually and accurate as of may 25 2023 this list may include firms that have a business relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

the biden administration said monday it was shipping its biggest yet direct delivery of weapons to ukraine as that country prepares for a potentially decisive counteroffensive in the south against russia sending 1 billion in rockets ammunition and other material to ukraine from defense department stockpiles the new u s arms shipment would further strengthen ukraine as it mounts the counteroffensive which analysts say for the first time could allow kyiv to shape the course of the rest of the war now at the half year mark kyiv aims to push russian troops back out of kherson and other southern territory near the dnipro river russia in recent days was moving troops and equipment in the direction of the southern port cities to stave off the ukrainian counteroffensive at every stage of this conflict we have been focused on getting the ukrainians what they need depending on the evolving conditions on the battlefield colin kahl undersecretary of defense for policy said monday in announcing the new weapons shipment get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters president biden arrived in spain on tuesday for a nato summit where spoke after meeting with spanish president pedro s√°nchez where they discussed how to continue to support ukraine and hold russia accountable for its assault the new u s aid includes additional rockets for the high mobility artillery rocket systems or himars as well as thousands of artillery rounds mortar systems javelins and other ammunition and equipment military commanders and other u s officials say the himars and artillery systems have been crucial in ukraine s fight to block russia from taking more ground while the u s has already provided 16 himars to ukraine kahl said the new package does not include additional ones these are not systems that we assess you need in the hundreds to have the type of effects needed kahl said these are precision guided systems for very particular types of targets and the ukrainians are using them as such he declined to say how many of the precision guided missile systems for the himars were included in monday s announcement but said the u s has provided multiple hundreds of them in recent weeks the latest announcement brings the total u s security assistance committed to ukraine by the biden administration to more than 9 billion in his nightly video address ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy thanked the united states for the package and said 100 of it we will use to protect freedom our common freedom until now the largest single security assistance package announcement was for 1 billion on june 15 but that aid included 350 million in presidential drawdown authority and another 650 million under the ukraine security assistance initiative which provides funding for training equipment and other security needs that can be bought from other countries or companies monday s package allows the u s to deliver weapons systems and other equipment more quickly since it takes them off the defense department shelves in addition to the rockets for the himars it includes 75 000 rounds of 155mm artillery 20 mortar systems and 20 000 rounds for them 1 000 shoulder mounted javelin rockets and other arms explosives and medical equipment for the last four months of the war russia has concentrated on capturing the donbas region of eastern ukraine where pro moscow separatists have controlled some territory as self proclaimed republics for eight years russian forces have made gradual headway in the region while launching missile and rocket attacks to curtail the movements of ukrainian fighters elsewhere kahl estimated that russian forces have sustained up to 80 000 deaths and injuries in the fighting though he did not break down the figure with an estimate of forces killed he said the russian troops have managed to gain incremental ground in eastern ukraine although not in recent weeks but that has come at extraordinary cost to the russian military because of how well the ukrainian military has performed and all the assistance that the ukrainian military has gotten and i think now conditions in the east have essentially stabilized and the focus is really shifting to the south the new funding is being paid for through 40 billion in economic and security aid for ukraine approved by congress in may this is the 18th time the pentagon has provided equipment from defense department stocks to ukraine since august 2021 ukraine s first lady olena zelenska spoke in front of members of congress on wednesday the u s and allies still are evaluating whether to supply aircraft to ukraine kahl said it s not inconceivable that western aircraft down the road could be part of the mix he said zelenskyy early in the war made near daily appeals for warplanes calling them essential to protecting ukraine s skies the u s and some other nato countries feared that could draw them into more direct involvement with ukraine s war against russia and have not provided western aircraft separately monday the treasury department said it was sending 3 billion more in direct economic assistance to ukraine that s part of a previously approved 7 5 billion in economic assistance with 1 5 billion yet to be disbursed associated press writers eric tucker and fatima hussein in washington contributed

cann was one of the very first ready to drink rtd cannabis beverage companies launching in 2018 in california and has since produced 10 million cans of product with distribution in california nevada illinois massachusetts rhode island and arizona plus ontario and british columbia in canada however the years leading up to that 10 million can benchmark were not easy according to coo ishan kapoor and required a tenacious belief in the product to grow cann from startup to store shelves at the recent cannabis drinks expo in chicago kapoor detailed for attendees the company s rise and consequential decisions that helped build the brand his advice works just as well for any cpg startup cannabis or otherwise and here we highlight some of cann s strategies that helped fuel its upward trajectory define your market niche cann launched with a clear vision of where its microdose 2 to 5 mg thc per can product fit within the cannabis beverage market the company could have had a less defined approach since it was among the first companies in a relatively undefined category kapoor says there were only three other brands when cann started instead cann asked several crucial questions from the outset that helped bring its brand into focus cannabis drinks expo can we put a cannabis beverage product in a can and make it shelf stable can we build a brand in the cannabis category around a microdose product when buyers are here for dollar per milligram sales kapor explained to attendees can we develop a product that has the onset of beverage alcohol and a competitor to beverage alcohol for when people don t want a hangover or when they want something to take to a barbecue and can we create a brand that stands out not just in a dispensary environment but on a whole foods shelf believe in your product the simplicity and bigness of cann s business plan as kapoor describes it made it easier to present in meetings with potential investors that could help get cann off the ground as we ve learned time and again whether it s on the fundraising side the manufacturing side or the sales relationship side you have to keep knocking on doors and keep believing in what you are pitching and selling and be consistent and then you re ultimately able to convert a no into a yes and you can start the waterfall of value capture and bring funding into the business kapoor says back in early 2019 cann was just an idea it was a hand formed can that we had to seam 20 times with a hand seamer to take to pitch meetings that didn t even look like our product today but it was really an idea and belief in ourselves and the vision of what we were trying to sell through what kapoor calls the power of hype and the necessity of hustle cann secured an adequate amount of seed round funding to get started we needed it he says i came into this not understanding how many unexpected hurdles we would see so bringing in money at the seed level allowed us the runway to experiment to fail and to jump over hurdles it was really critical in getting this thing off the ground cann fight for survival kapoor says fighting for survival was the next stage of growth for cann even though the company had the seed money to start production i was like oh man we gotta figure out how to do it kapoor remembers what fighting for survival was for me and my team in 2019 was figuring out how to make this product at scale our first 15 000 cans were made by hand because we didn t have resources or strong partnerships says kapoor in early 2019 we selected a co packer in california who promised us for months that their facility would be ready we went out in april of 2019 to audit the facility and they didn t even have power this was very much the early years of cannabis and thankfully we have more scrupulous operators now but at the time we had orders we had the money to go fulfill these orders and we had no idea how to get this product to market cann quickly pivoted to new partnerships that allowed it to set up a full production facility on an expedited timeline with used equipment mobile contractors and cann s own beverage production standard operating procedures those at cann also helped their new facility partner with employee training and drinks production skills we networked with folks in the industry who had licenses and were willing to take a risk on us kapoor says we iterated rapidly to make sure we can make this product but never compromised the core tenets that we raised the initial funding on which was this product has to compete on a whole foods shelf it has to taste really good the quality must be consistent there can t be any preservatives and that we maintain our story around a microdose product cann eventually found a co packing partner with a brand new facility where cann could consistently scale up manufacturing to meet demand cann also built a first mile distribution company to avoid stock gaps we realized that we couldn t get enough product into warehouses and inventory rooms fast enough because distribution in this industry is set up to move pre rolls jars and flower kapoor explains cann new customer window a new company in a nascent category like cannabis beverages has according to kapoor probably 90 to 180 days to capture a first time consumer upon regulatory change nevada and california were hard markets for us because we lost that window so we had to put a lot of money behind getting that customer back into the channel whereas in states like massachusetts and illinois we ve been able to acquire that customer just through their own curiosity and then retain that customer so the new markets have been really powerful to us partnerships prevail perhaps the biggest takeaway from kapoor s presentation is that quality partnerships are the true foundation of a successful business and that settling for less is a recipe for failure like anything else in a startup scenario the amount of time and effort invested in finding like minded business partners pays dividends well into the future but it can be a lot of work i remember a time in march 2020 we were discussing a trip to seattle and we just started hearing about covid and we re like do we make the trip is it worth the risk and all three of us in the room decided that absolutely we had to get out there we had to meet partners face to face because we d had enough partnerships already with folks who had disappeared says kapoor we needed to make sure we were looking people in the eye and selling them on the vision of cann

the european union on monday said it put forward a final text to revive the 2015 iran nuclear deal as four days of indirect talks between u s and iranian officials wrapped up in vienna what can be negotiated has been negotiated and it s now in a final text however behind every technical issue and every paragraph lies a political decision that needs to be taken in the capitals eu foreign policy chief josep borrell tweeted if these answers are positive then we can sign this deal he added as eu iranian and u s prepared to leave vienna earlier a senior eu official told reporters that no more changes could be made to the text which has been under negotiation for 15 months and said he expected a final decision from the parties within a very very few weeks it is a package proposal you cannot agree with page 20 and disagree with page 50 you have to say yes or no he said a u s state department spokesperson said washington was ready to quickly reach an agreement to revive the deal formally called the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa on the basis of the eu proposals iranian officials suggested that they did not regard the eu proposals as final saying they would convey their additional views and considerations to the european union which coordinates the talks after consultations in tehran iran has also made demands the united states and other western powers view as outside the scope of reviving the deal for example iran has insisted the international atomic energy agency the u n nuclear watchdog drop its claims iran has failed to fully explain uranium traces at undeclared sites each side sought to put the onus on the other to compromise they the iranians repeatedly say they are prepared for a return to mutual implementation of the jcpoa let s see if their actions match their words the u s spokesperson said iran and six major powers struck the original accord in 2015 under which it agreed to restrict its nuclear program to make it harder to use it to develop atomic weapons an ambition it denies in return for relief from u s eu and u n sanctions in 2018 then u s president donald trump ditched the deal and reimposed harsh u s sanctions designed to choke off iran s oil exports its major source of export income and government revenue in response tehran which says its nuclear program is for power generation and other peaceful purposes began about a year later to breach the agreement in several ways including rebuilding stocks of enriched uranium it has also enriched uranium to 60 purity far above the 3 67 that is permitted under the deal but below the 90 that is regarded as weapons grade u s president joe biden has sought to revive the agreement since he took office in january 2021 and negotiations indirect because iran refuses to deal directly with the united states on the issue began in vienna in april 2021 iran has also sought to obtain guarantees that no future u s president would renege on the deal if it were revived as trump did in 2018 washington cannot provide such ironclad assurances because the deal is a political understanding rather than a legally binding treaty iranian state media hinted at this issue on monday the final agreement must ensure the rights and interests of the iranian people and guarantee the effective and stable removal of sanctions iranian foreign minister hossein amirabdollahian told borrell in a call state media reported
the ongoing war in ukraine is hardly a distant matter for the average american given the parallel crises of rising inflation and tumbling stock values for many a once unthinkable question suddenly feels legitimate can the united states maintain its status as a global power indeed president joe biden blames russia for today s high gas prices and other conundrums but going beyond pointing figures at moscow the united states must focus on concrete strategic actions such as by turning to a recent landmark european union eu agreement for inspiration on july 18 european commission president ursula von der leyen announced that a memorandum of understanding mou had been signed to more than double the supply of gas from azerbaijan to the eu through the expansion of the southern gas corridor sgc which spans nearly 2 200 miles across seven countries and three pipelines the route s gas supplies from azerbaijan to eu nations will increase from 8 billion cubic meters in 2021 to 12 billion cubic meters this year and then to 20 billion cubic meters over the next few years crucially von der leyen declared that the eu took this step to diversify away from russia and to turn towards more reliable trustworthy partners and i am glad to count azerbaijan among them although the russo ukrainian war and its associated energy crisis have thrust the sgc into the spotlight the initiative s strategic significance has been mounting for far longer first proposed in 2008 in the european commission s second strategic energy review an eu energy security and solidarity action plan the sgc became fully operational in november 2020 from that point onward the days of russia s monopoly over the european energy sector have been numbered as von der leyen acknowledged already before russia s brutal invasion of ukraine the russian gas supplies to europe were no more reliable now the expansion of the sgc during this urgent moment of the ukraine war powerfully affirms azerbaijan s broader vision behind the triple pipeline project s establishment this is where years of preparation have met opportunity in addition to the benefits of energy diversification for its own continent europe s new mou with azerbaijan has dealt an unprecedented blow to russia by hitting the kremlin where it hurts the most its bottom line russia has historically been the world s leading exporter of natural gas and approximately half of its crude oil exports went to europe in 2021 additionally eu countries paid 105 billion for russian energy imports last year to date the u s strategy to counteract russia has relied on sanctions and bans on imports yet the eu s new agreement with azerbaijan displays an extra layer of strategic sophistication in that it is simultaneously poised to strengthen the european economy and diminish moscow s influence while they have sought to send a strong message to moscow the biden administration s moves have resulted in heightened gas prices and other economic challenges for americans washington should also take note of the eu s effort to forge closer ties with azerbaijan recognizing the south caucasus nation as a cornerstone of the north south and east west transport corridors as well as a unique bridge between the asian and european continents this month the united states and azerbaijan marked the thirtieth anniversary of diplomatic relations a partnership in which the nations work together to promote european energy security expand bilateral trade and investment and combat terrorism and transnational threats in a fraught and complex region azerbaijan s rare status as a secular and moderate muslim majority nation in fact the muslim world s first parliamentary republic and first state to grant women the right to vote underscores not only baku s strategic significance for washington but the enduring importance of the countries shared values as russia continues its aggression in ukraine and receives increased support in countering the west from radical actors like iran it is incumbent upon u s policymakers to cultivate a levelheaded eurasian ally such as azerbaijan the only country that borders both russia and iran as two wars the russo ukrainian war and the u s russia influence war seemingly have no end in sight the united states can work toward preserving its global standing by putting more energy into strategically beneficial alliances paul miller is a media and political consultant based in the chicago area his commentary has been published in usa today the new york daily news the new york post newsweek and the hill follow him on twitter at pauliespoint image reuters

washington ap the biden administration said monday it was shipping its biggest yet direct delivery of weapons to ukraine as that country prepares for a potentially decisive counteroffensive in the south against russia sending 1 billion in rockets ammunition and other material to ukraine from defense department stockpiles the new u s arms shipment would further strengthen ukraine as it mounts the counteroffensive which analysts say for the first time could allow kyiv to shape the course of the rest of the war now at the half year mark kyiv aims to push russian troops back out of kherson and another southern territory near the dnipro river russia in recent days was moving troops and equipment in the direction of the southern port cities to stave off the ukrainian counteroffensive at every stage of this conflict we have been focused on getting the ukrainians what they need depending on the evolving conditions on the battlefield colin kahl undersecretary of defense for policy said monday in announcing the new weapons shipment file u s air force staff sgt cody brown right with the 436th aerial port squadron checks pallets of 155 mm shells ultimately bound for ukraine april 29 2022 at dover air force base del the biden administration has announced another 1 billion in new military aid for ukraine the aug 8 pledge promises what will be the biggest yet delivery of rockets ammunition and other arms straight from department of defense stocks for ukrainian forces the new u s aid includes additional rockets for the high mobility artillery rocket systems or himars as well as thousands of artillery rounds mortar systems javelins and other ammunition and equipment military commanders and other u s officials say the himars and artillery systems have been crucial in ukraine s fight to block russia from taking more ground while the u s has already provided 16 himars to ukraine kahl said the new package does not include additional ones these are not systems that we assess you need in the hundreds to have the type of effects needed kahl said these are precision guided systems for very particular types of targets and the ukrainians are using them as such he declined to say how many of the precision guided missile systems for the himars were included in monday s announcement but said the u s has provided multiple hundreds of them in recent weeks the latest announcement brings the total u s security assistance committed to ukraine by the biden administration to more than 9 billion a ukrainian serviceman of fireflies reconnaissance team operates a drone at his position at the frontline in mykolaiv region ukraine on monday aug 8 2022 until now the largest single security assistance package announcement was for 1 billion on june 15 but that aid included 350 million in presidential drawdown authority and another 650 million under the ukraine security assistance initiative which provides funding for training equipment and other security needs that can be bought from other countries or companies monday s package allows the u s to deliver weapons systems and other equipment more quickly since it takes them off the defense department shelves in addition to the rockets for the himars it includes 75 000 rounds of 155mm artillery 20 mortar systems and 20 000 rounds for them 1 000 shoulder mounted javelin rockets and other arms explosives and medical equipment for the last four months of the war russia has concentrated on capturing the donbas region of eastern ukraine where pro moscow separatists have controlled some territory as self proclaimed republics for eight years russian forces have made gradual headway in the region while launching missile and rocket attacks to curtail the movements of ukrainian fighters elsewhere ida svystunova 89 looks out the damaged room adjoining her apartment from a may rocket attack in sloviansk donetsk region eastern ukraine sunday aug 7 2022 svystunova is one of only four people left living in the block and spends most of her day looking out the window i sit and wait for the end of this war or maybe the end of ourselves she said kahl estimated that russian forces have sustained up to 80 000 deaths and injuries in the fighting though he did not break down the figure with an estimate of forces killed he said the russian troops have managed to gain incremental ground in eastern ukraine although not in recent weeks but that has come at extraordinary cost to the russian military because of how well the ukrainian military has performed and all the assistance that the ukrainian military has gotten and i think now conditions in the east have essentially stabilized and the focus is really shifting to the south the new funding is being paid for through 40 billion in economic and security aid for ukraine approved by congress in may this is the 18th time the pentagon has provided equipment from defense department stocks to ukraine since august 2021 the u s and its allies still are evaluating whether to supply aircraft to ukraine kahl said it s not inconceivable that western aircraft down the road could be part of the mix he said

call we will also be discussing certain non gaap financial measures more information about these non gaap financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are contained in our earnings release and sec filings this afternoon s conference call is hosted by broadmark s chief executive officer brian ward and chief financial officer david schneider management will make some prepared comments after which we will open up the call to your questions now i will turn the call over to brian brian ward thank you nevin and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call this afternoon i ll begin with some remarks on the macro environment and briefly highlight our second quarter performance and then turn the call over to david to provide additional detail on our financial results investment activity and portfolio we will then open up the call for your questions 2022 has presented unique and perhaps unprecedented challenges to the economy and financial markets spiraling supply side inflation in the first half of the year caused the federal reserve to begin a rate hike cycle that continued into july within the target fed fund√¢ s range of 250 basis points since january mortgage rates rose in response reaching over 6 in june before falling over the past few weeks the recent drop in interest and mortgage rates while welcome news is most likely due to recession fears which are now front and center with two consecutive quarters of negative real gdp growth on the books with the crosscurrents of inflation and recession financial market volatility has hit levels not seen since the global financial crisis while employment figures remain strong we are carefully watching for concerning signs in both the high and low wage sectors of the economy while these factors certainly impact broadmark i want to emphasize that the foundational principles of our company position us well to perform throughout the cycle in whatever the environment indeed over the last few years as many in the industry chose to juice near term earnings with high leverage we did not yet we continue to produce steady and solid unlevered results now as markets have shifted and the risks and cost of higher leverage come to the floor we can continue to execute on our growth strategy as others are forced to pull back or in many cases cease originations as a result we are in a great position to outperform as we move into the next cycle we have a strong and experienced team of ground level real estate investment experts that understand and can underwrite complex credit investments and we utilize conservative underwriting standards including significant equity committed to any project equally important we have the lowest levered balance sheet in the industry among public peers this competitive advantage provides us with the potential to take on capital to fund future originations and with almost entirely all fixed rate debt our balance sheet shields us from the impact of higher interest costs affording us significant stability in today s shifting markets while we have invested in a handful of floating rate loans all have interest rate floors that protect our downside while allowing us to capture upside if the current interest rate trajectory continues when i joined broadmark as chief executive officer earlier this year my intentions were not to change what has made the company successful but rather build on our strong foundation to expand our growth opportunities to that end we have built a national underwriting team that while geographically diversified will focus greater attention on uniform underwriting standards for complex real estate credit and provide better opportunity to scale our financial analysis in relation to our growing originations efforts additionally we have implemented greater rigor and focus around both our pre and post funding asset management capabilities which now operate as the primary credit function for our business from our last earnings call we anticipated minor increases in headcount in both our pre and post funding asset management roles with a smaller reallocation of existing resources when compared to our underwriting team we have now completed almost all of those hires with a few notable ones from our competitors one part of strategy that we plan to evolve in the coming quarters is our approach to defaults and reo historically our team has rightfully worked through each situation to achieve the most favorable results for shareholders this however has resulted in us taking longer to cure defaults than may be optimal and has impacted our ability to expeditiously resolve challenges and redeploy capital while we ve rarely incurred a principal loss from these defaults these extended workout periods have and will continue to cause a meaningful drag on near term performance looking forward our strategy will be to strike a more effective balance between maximizing collections economic efficiency and opportunity costs recognizing that in certain instances exiting defaulted loans and reinvesting that capital into new opportunities more quickly could prove a more profitable path on the origination side we will continue to be very active in the small to middle market investment space which we define as 5 million to 75 million per investment we will continue to make smaller investments where there is an important relationship play however we will seek to move our average loan balance up from about 7 million today to ideally around 15 million but would anticipate this will take more than 12 to 18 months to accommodate the normal originations and payoff cycle we seek to move our average investment balance up because we believe there remains more market fragmentation and less capital markets efficiencies in the space that fits between the small balance fix and flip business purpose loans and the larger institutional loans we also think our capital is more efficient in this space from a total profit perspective in addition to continuing our focus on construction loans which we think remains viable through all parts of the cycle we re beginning to look at other investments and otherwise gearing our infrastructure to include bridge and transitional financings asset repositionings mezzanine loans and participating preferred structures which could enhance our risk adjusted returns on the construction side we re starting to see better borrowers and better transactions in the high yield space as other lenders are forced to pull back or cease origination due to the pronounced recent changes in the capital markets now turning to our second quarter performance we executed on about 197 million in new originations and amendments for the quarter at an average unlevered yield of 10 1 as a reminder origination volumes naturally vary from quarter to quarter based on the timing of loan closings we continue to prudently expand our geographic footprint and we are now active in 20 states in the district of columbia improving the diversification of our portfolio and we√¢ ll look to add more states as we grow our national platform as a result we grew our portfolio to 1 6 billion of loans secured by high quality real estate with a weighted average loan to value ratio at origination of approximately 59 9 this growth was achieved even as we remain disciplined with our investments and we will remain prudent in our origination approach to ensure we maintain a high quality loan book which we believe can withstand the current uncertain macroeconomic environment finally i would like to thank our strong and committed team for their hard work and contributions amid challenging times due diligence and expertise are the true sources of our success with that i ll turn it over to david to review the financials david schneider thanks brian and good afternoon everyone our operating results are detailed on slide 7 of our earnings presentation for the second quarter of 2022 we reported total revenue of 28 5 million and net income of 15 9 million on a per share basis this reflects a gaap net income of approximately 0 12 per diluted common share adjusting for the impact of nonrecurring costs and other noncash items our distributable earnings prior to realized loss on investments for the second quarter were 20 7 million or 0 16 per diluted common share interest income on our loans in the second quarter was 22 1 million and fee income was 6 4 million on the expense side for the second quarter we had cash compensation and employee benefit expense of 2 9 million and g a expense of 3 million our total cash compensation and g a expense normalized relative to the first quarter of 2022 and while up 5 9 from the second quarter of 2021 due primarily to increased headcount in the second half of 2021 we maintain our expectation of approximately 24 million in total cash compensation and g a expenses for the full year 2022 with regard to origination volumes we continue to benefit from our increasing size and scale which has enabled us to grow our average loan size while keeping our percentage exposure to any individual loan very low in the second quarter we executed on 25 originations with an average loan size of 7 9 million as we look ahead and have stated before we believe one of our growth opportunities is that as we increase our network we will be in a position to underwrite larger loans achieve greater efficiency from an expense perspective and reach a borrower cohort that typically has better credit metrics as of june 30th our portfolio yield was 13 1 down from 16 a year ago and over the coming quarters we expect the portfolio yield to stabilize in the range of 10 to 12 additionally our loans remain short term with a weighted average term of 14 months at origination for the second quarter the short term nature of our loans reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations it also allows us to be nimble and pivot quickly as the environment evolves turning to portfolio management as of june 30th we had a contractual default rate of 13 8 of the total portfolio by value as a percent this was up slightly from the first quarter of 2022 but improved nearly 14 from the second quarter of 2021 and as a reminder these are largely not monetary defaults but rather represent proactive asset management focused on early identification of potential problems to ensure protection of our investment during the second quarter we foreclosed on three loans and received payoff on three loans in contractual default representing 75 million in total commitment in addition we sold one reo property with a carrying value of 28 million for a gain of nearly 700 000 and at quarter end we owned 10 foreclosed properties with 93 million in carrying value from an earnings perspective as of june 30th we had approximately 92 million in principal outstanding on loans in nonaccrual status and loans in nonaccrual status and foreclosed properties continued to result in a drag on earnings of approximately 0 04 per share for the second quarter of 2022 we continue to work diligently to resolve these issues to achieve the best results for broadmark shareholders and while we expect the tactical changes described by brian will ultimately reduce new defaults and enhance default management this is likely to take time one part of the strategy shift will be that there could be times where we determined that exiting a loan in default or foreclosed property with a principal loss and reinvesting that capital into income producing loans is the most favorable outcome ultimately the goal is to generate strong cash flows and earnings so we will utilize this strategy as we work to maximize performance now turning to our balance sheet as detailed on slide 17 of our earnings presentation we had 36 million of cash and a fully undrawn 135 million credit facility for total liquidity of 171 million as of june 30th in july we drew 20 million on our revolving credit facility to support borrower draws and new originations while we rated several large loan payoffs and we then repaid the balance in full at month end following the receipt of loan repayments this demonstrates the value of our credit facility as a cash management tool we finished july with 56 million of cash and a fully undrawn credit facility for total liquidity of 191 million with our 100 million of five year 5 fixed coupon senior unsecured notes outstanding we currently have a debt to equity ratio of 8 6 which is unrivaled in the mortgage reit space maintaining a fortress balance sheet has always been a foundational principle for broadmark which provides a significant competitive advantage that will enable execution on opportunities in an evolving market this completes our prepared remarks we will now open the line for questions operator question and answer session operator our first question is from steve delaney with jmp securities stephen laws i guess my first thing david is directed to you i m just looking at the expenses and i was wondering if you could give us some color on the real property management expenses they were just under 1 1 million this year and pretty significantly increased from prior periods thank you david schneider sure thanks steve for joining and thanks for the question so what s happening there is we ve got our reo properties have become a little bit more seasoned and under the gaap accounting guidance once a property is no longer under construction and is ready for its intended use it s no longer you re no longer going to capitalize expenses into the principal or the investment in the property so what you re seeing is for some of these seasoned properties that were now completed construction and we re looking to exit in the coming quarters we can no longer capitalize any kind of maintenance property taxes other expenses so that s what that 1 1 million represents expenses that we cannot capitalize under gaap so we re expensing them now there s a good chance we re going to collect those upon exit we just need to expense them now and then when we exit the property they won t be included in the investment in the property but we may be able to sell it at a gain similar to what we did for the what we did for the one property that we sold in the second quarter stephen laws great so ultimately not necessarily a greater economic loss but it s more optics as to whether it s through the it s been expensed or whether it s capitalized and with the balance and remind me david the what triggers that if you would again i was trying to take notes what triggers the change is it when it goes to reo or what trigger the capital or the expense versus capitalization david schneider sure yes so as long as if you take over a project and the construction is not complete and you re finishing the construction any of those expenses associated with completion of the remaining construction can be capitalized once the property is in a position where it s ready for its intended use and can be rented out and it has a certificate of occupancy then any of those expenses going forward are going to be expensed directly still can be recovered through the sale of the property but they can no longer be capitalized once it s ready for intended use stephen laws got it thank you for clarifying that and brian one for you as well i m just curious gosh you haven t been in the job for six months yet but my question was sort of framed in that respect last week we heard a lot of this the bridge lenders that you clos comment on the loan pricing kind of year over year but i might as well just say six months ago and then we re saying generally a year ago they were l plus 300 to 350 that now they are quoting l plus 400 to 450 just curious how you guys may be i know you re changing your mix a little bit and looking more for to add some bridge versus construction but have you been able to or decided to up your prices as well or is it more of an upgrade in terms of property types thank you brian ward yes sure i mean so i m surprised they re quoting that number i would have guessed even more than that what i can say steven is that we certainly have seen as a result of sort of market dislocation some pretty rapid movements in pricing i think there is there is a difficulty in sort of figuring out the bid ask a little bit for some folks and i d say price discovery is a little bit challenged right now i mean one of the things that we like obviously being the lowest levered balance sheet amongst public peers is these types of dislocations disruptions would suggest the market sort of coming our way i don t want to leave the audience with the impression that that somehow gives us a definitive standard or a sustainable standard going forward because i think right now it s really hard to call but certainly the markets are the pricing is widening very quickly which for us playing in the small to medium balance high yield space presents us with competitive advantage particularly with the unlevered balance sheet stephen laws yes and it would seem that you have more flexibility given that your leverage and your structure doesn t really force you into a clo financing you can hold most of your loans on an unlevered and still get the return you want so seems like brian ward all right yes i m sorry i m stepping on you but you ve hit the nail on the head i mean the unlevered balance sheet we believe is significant with respect to our competitive advantage we believe particularly in situations like we ve got where markets do get dislocated and leverage plays a heavy hand with some of the other folks in the industry it just allows us to have a clearer runway and a clear path in terms of our investment strategy of course we are unlevered in returns that we deliver as opposed to levered which sometimes people get either get skewed or can be confused with folks but having an unlevered balance sheet and unlevered returns right now we think is particularly unique operator our next question is from christian mark with piper sandler crispin love thank you this is crispin love from piper sandler so good afternoon brian and david can you just give an update on the construction lending environment here and just how it s progressed over the last few months from your seat and i guess what i m asking is just some color on the shortages in raw materials construction time lines labor inflation just have all these factors or have any of these factors have been improving from what you ve been seeing and then what s your outlook brian ward there s a couple of dynamics at play here first with respect to our role as a small to middle market construction lender what i can tell you is that we are seeing today more transactions with better borrowers and better opportunity that doesn t mean that the door is wide open we re still very carefully underwriting investments and there are other challenges at play which are necessitating us to make sure we re very careful but because of the pullback from others in the market because of what s occurred we re seeing increased opportunity but again still being very selective in the investments that we re making that being said answering kind of part two of your question certainly there are still pressures in the broader markets around overall construction costs and supply chain those and labor those matters anecdotally are getting better but they re not nearly to where they were pre crisis and so our borrowers are certainly in certain instances wrestling with those things i wouldn t say it s across the board it depends on asset market and a whole host of other things but yes we re still seeing some of that generally it feels like it s improving crispin love all right my next question was going to be on kind of demand for construction lots and just based on your commentary there it seems like the demand has stayed stable or actually increased do you think that demand is coming from competitors of yours pulling back or there being more demand from the borrowers brian ward it s the former competitors pulling back and opening up the door for us more in the high yield space to provide value to our clientele we talked about this in the last conference call we hoped that it would occur the near term signs suggest that it is occurring but i cannot tell you that it will continue to occur it s there s just too many unknowns right now and like i said earlier in my comments between sort of price discovery and bid ask it s a little bit too soon to call the ball on this but early indications would suggest that this is playing out in some respect how we thought it might crispin love and then just one last one for me just on the dividend you ve held it consistent at 0 07 per month for a while now despite falling short of covering that with distributable earnings so i m just curious if you can share your thoughts on the dividend level how the board thinks about the dividend level and if you think you can get back to covering it with distributable earnings over kind of the near to intermediate term brian ward sure i mean what i can say is this the board is hyperconscious of all of the different forces at play in making dividend decisions we have a very experienced board and they certainly again understand the various issues or concerns that might be raised and they look at it as a board would consistently in relation to our business and i guess that would be my best way of answering it crispin is they get it and the board will make those determinations as they go operator our next question is from stephen laws with raymond james stephen laws i think you guys both touched on the reos and the process perhaps if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail it looks like you resolved or sold one for a gain that you foreclosed on about a year ago can you talk about what a normal resolution path and time frame is and david you may have been pointing us or both of you may have mentioned it about best interest maybe to sell something at a loss now to recycle capital to new investments so maybe the thought process and thoughts around timing of disposition of some of these assets to resolution brian ward yes thanks stephen i ll take it and then i would ask david if you could please add color commentary as we go i ve been in the role only five months and what i can say is that because of the nature of how we invest where we invest some of these will just take longer to sort out than others i ve talked previously about some of the tactical changes that we ve made to put us in position to more proactively address the asset management of npls we now have that team really in place and are going it will continue to be a question of fact as to how we proceed on a particular investment but i guess suffice it to say that we understand that time is of the essence with respect to these investments but we also are very conscious about our responsibilities to shareholders and trying to maximize value wherever we can and because this is real estate sometimes these things take a little bit longer than people would like so with that i would ask david to chime in here further david schneider sure yes stephen just on your commentary on so yes we sold the sage creek moab utah that we had talked about we foreclosed on that about a year ago i think we were expecting hopefully two two to three quarters we ended up just in the first half of the second quarter being able to exit that at a positive economic situation a gain of about 700 000 in terms of the other reos we foreclosed on three two primarily being the senior housing facilities in terms of time line it s a bit unique to each project the sage creek one that we just sold this quarter had limited construction that needs to get done so it was really cooperating getting any limited construction done and then finding the right exit that was the best economic outcome i d say we ll take the same approach for the senior housing facilities the others and just look to we re not property managers we re not in the business to be operators of reo so any construction that needs to get complete or if there s an opportunity to exit prior to completing construction we re going to look at all those options and do what s right from an earnings per share perspective and redeploy that capital into income earning loans so i think you ll see us be more aggressive with those and hopefully bring that time line 12 months it was for this one that we just closed i m hoping that near term time lines are going to be significantly less than that for other reo properties operator our next question is from eric hagen with btig eric hagen maybe a couple of questions for me first just what is a rough time line to think about with respect to the unfunded commitments in the portfolio and how you balance the paydowns and the reinvestments and the just the overall flexibility that you have to fund those commitments and then maybe you can talk about the relative attractiveness that you see in different call it property types loan purposes geographies like where do you expect to lean with respect to again just the various types of loans that you re able to originate and why those are more compelling than others per se thanks david schneider thanks eric i ll start with the kind of liquidity i think question how you put it so we have a lot of flexibility from our liquidity perspective as we mentioned in our prepared comments we got some nice payoffs post quarter end and we re probably at about 60 million of cash now and a fully undrawn credit facility of 135 million and the real the reason we got we thought it was so critical to get the credit facility was managing those unfunded commitments those are going to come in over a year the way we think about those is we ve got the credit facility as a cash management tool in between large payoffs we re expecting some healthy payoff production in q3 which will keep our liquidity relatively high we think about it as a total liquidity perspective so i would say our current total liquidity is about 14 months of operating cash requirements without getting sourcing any new capital so we re quite comfortable getting through the rest of the year executing on our pipeline drawing on the credit facility as needed and then repaying it back as large payoffs come in we ve got some storage facility deals that we expect to pay off in q3 which are pretty sizable so we re thinking about it from a total liquidity perspective 12 to 14 months of operating cash requirements is what we want between our cash on balance sheet and the credit facility itself so a lot of flexibility if things come to fruition and as brian can talk to you more and there s lots of opportunities out there we don t need to source capital if there s windows of stability that open and we can raise capital we re going to take advantage of those to make sure we can execute on our pipeline brian ward eric forgive me so the second part of your question could i summarize it in saying it s really questions about markets and asset class is that fair eric hagen that s right yes that s right just the relative attractiveness that you see across the spectrum of what you re able to originate right now brian ward got it okay so while in our prepared remarks we mentioned that we re invested in 20 markets really 70 of our portfolio is invested in washington colorado utah and texas and by the way you can correlate that to probably four of the most robust markets in terms of job growth not just today but really for the long term future in the united states so while we will continue to expand our markets and are certainly actively exploring growth opportunities and think that if the present trajectory continues those growth opportunities in terms of markets come our way it s just really important to back up and understand that 70 of our book is in 4 of the best markets in america secondly if you look at the composition of our portfolio by asset class we re heavily heavily invested in multifamily and what i ll call business oriented single family which is we have a large investment in town homes a much smaller investment in condos and even smaller in single family and so that s about 70 of our overall book between the what i ll call the broader resi space and 30 of our book spread between commercial with the largest asset class in commercial being on storage and obviously a very robust and well proven asset class through all parts of the cycle so i envision broadmark as we go forward to continue our focus in the space i m sure you and the entire audience are very aware of the broader longer term supply and demand dynamics around housing generally and really this significant long term shortage we are very long and very bullish on that strategy generally and will continue to be for the foreseeable future and by the way i should note that broadmark also because of our focus and expertise in construction it becomes and construction being one of the more complex asset classes to invest in it becomes a great baseline for our ambitions to embark into other opportunities whether it be bridge or value add asset repositioning or mezz and the like the underwriting the cognitive requirements for construction just play really well for those other opportunities operator and our final question is from matthew howlett with b riley matthew howlett first you said the capital markets can you just little talk about what type of pricing or access you√¢ d have to the capital markets today in terms of debt david schneider sure yes i mean i think we talked a little bit i think steve delaney mentioned the spread obviously the 5 fixed rate coupon deal we did in november looks pretty magical right now and is not something we could execute currently i think there s still kind of like brian s comments on the asset yield side i think there s still some price discovery going on in terms of what folks can execute on we saw a couple of deals get priced and done more in the convert market we haven t seen a lot of the private placement unsecured bonds that we really like and we did the first time around so we re still understanding the interest looking for those windows of stability but yes it s going to be anything that we would execute at is we re going to wait for something competitive brian ward yes and i want to i just want to drive on a really important point here which is we can we have the balance sheet we can execute and we have because of our current liquidity situation as david has mentioned in earlier comments not only do we have the ability to execute because of our balance sheet but we also have the time and we ll continue to try and make the best decisions we can for the benefit of our shareholders in light of those two benefits to what we ve got again i sort of finish where i started which is i just can t emphasize enough the importance of an unlevered balance sheet david schneider and matt i would just add it s ultimately math right we look at the widening of spreads we look at the fed funds rate and you can take what a 5 coupon was and layer on and get to a number but we again we re not in a rush we don t need to execute until something is attractive and accretive for us to do it operator we have reached the end of our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr ward for closing comments brian ward thank you again i appreciate all of your great questions and for your interest in broadmark we re honored and we will look forward to speaking with you next quarter operator thank you this does conclude today s conference you may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation
u s pledges 1 billion more rockets other arms for ukraine washington the biden administration said monday it was shipping its biggest yet direct delivery of weapons to ukraine as that country prepares for a potentially decisive counteroffensive in the south against russia sending 1 billion in rockets ammunition and other material to ukraine from defense department stockpiles the new u s arms shipment would further strengthen ukraine as it mounts the counteroffensive which analysts say for the first time could allow kyiv to shape the course of the rest of the war now at the half year mark kyiv aims to push russian troops back out of kherson and other southern territory near the dnipro river russia in recent days was moving troops and equipment in the direction of the southern port cities to stave off the ukrainian counteroffensive at every stage of this conflict we have been focused on getting the ukrainians what they need depending on the evolving conditions on the battlefield colin kahl undersecretary of defense for policy said monday in announcing the new weapons shipment the new u s aid includes additional rockets for the high mobility artillery rocket systems or himars as well as thousands of artillery rounds mortar systems javelins and other ammunition and equipment military commanders and other u s officials say the himars and artillery systems have been crucial in ukraine s fight to block russia from taking more ground while the u s has already provided 16 himars to ukraine kahl said the new package does not include additional ones these are not systems that we assess you need in the hundreds to have the type of effects needed kahl said these are precision guided systems for very particular types of targets and the ukrainians are using them as such he declined to say how many of the precision guided missile systems for the himars were included in monday s announcement but said the u s has provided multiple hundreds of them in recent weeks the latest announcement brings the total u s security assistance committed to ukraine by the biden administration to more than 9 billion in his nightly video address ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy thanked the united states for the package and said 100 of it we will use to protect freedom our common freedom until now the largest single security assistance package announcement was for 1 billion on june 15 but that aid included 350 million in presidential drawdown authority and another 650 million under the ukraine security assistance initiative which provides funding for training equipment and other security needs that can be bought from other countries or companies monday s package allows the u s to deliver weapons systems and other equipment more quickly since it takes them off the defense department shelves in addition to the rockets for the himars it includes 75 000 rounds of 155mm artillery 20 mortar systems and 20 000 rounds for them 1 000 shoulder mounted javelin rockets and other arms explosives and medical equipment for the last four months of the war russia has concentrated on capturing the donbas region of eastern ukraine where pro moscow separatists have controlled some territory as self proclaimed republics for eight years russian forces have made gradual headway in the region while launching missile and rocket attacks to curtail the movements of ukrainian fighters elsewhere kahl estimated that russian forces have sustained up to 80 000 deaths and injuries in the fighting though he did not break down the figure with an estimate of forces killed he said the russian troops have managed to gain incremental ground in eastern ukraine although not in recent weeks but that has come at extraordinary cost to the russian military because of how well the ukrainian military has performed and all the assistance that the ukrainian military has gotten and i think now conditions in the east have essentially stabilized and the focus is really shifting to the south the new funding is being paid for through 40 billion in economic and security aid for ukraine approved by congress in may this is the 18th time the pentagon has provided equipment from defense department stocks to ukraine since august 2021 the u s and allies still are evaluating whether to supply aircraft to ukraine kahl said it s not inconceivable that western aircraft down the road could be part of the mix he said zelenskyy early in the war made near daily appeals for warplanes calling them essential to protecting ukraine s skies the u s and some other nato countries feared that could draw them into more direct involvement with ukraine s war against russia and have not provided western aircraft separately monday the treasury department said it was sending 3 billion more in direct economic assistance to ukraine that s part of a previously approved 7 5 billion in economic assistance with 1 5 billion yet to be disbursed ___ associated press
