by eric williams wondering about your credit score and can t tell what s true or a myth the average credit score in the united states is 698 based on vantagescore data from february 2021 and this is considered in the good range almost all americans over the age of 18 owe some form of debt during the third quarter of 2020 u s household debt surged to 14 35 trillion so what seems to cause this rise in credit card debt among many things with credit scores credit history credit utilization credit reports annual percentage rate grace periods and debt there are a lot of misunderstandings misrepresentations run of the mill theories and myths in this article we ll decipher credit myths and truths common credit terms it is of great importance that you familiarize yourself with the common credit terms used in the credit industry here are some common credit terms often used 1 credit score a numerical three digit rating that symbolizes your creditworthiness scores can range anywhere from 300 to 850 and the higher your score is the better you look in the eyes of potential lenders lenders will feel confident in lending you a larger sum of money knowing that you are able to pay in a timely manner 2 credit report think of it this way your credit report acts as your financial resume it speaks of your financial health to potential lenders and creditors moreover your credit report is a detailed document of your credit activity and credit history not a myth not only that the report contains personal information such as your address phone number and social security number as time goes by additional information will be added by credit bureaus to your credit report the additional information comprises the companies that have offered your credit and or loans as well as the loan amounts credit limits and your payment history don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free 3 credit history as mentioned previously listed on your credit report is your credit history this is more like your web browsing history throughout your adult life your credit history reveals how you ve handled your credit this is not a myth any run ins with debt collectors or bankruptcies are indicated in the report 4 annual percentage rate apr sometimes confused with an interest rate the annual percentage rate is almost always higher than the interest rate not only does the annual percentage rate include the interest expense on the loan but also all fees and other costs concerned with obtaining the loan fees can include broker fees rebates closing costs and discount points finding the best deal in some cases the lender may also offer a special deal offering a rebate on a portion of your interest expense if you re comparing two loans to find the best value choose the lender offering the lowest nominal rate this is because the majority of the loan amount is financed at a lower interest rate two lenders same deal but different annual percentage rates another confusing situation for borrowers is when the nominal rate and monthly payments are the same but the annual percentage rates differ in this example there are two lenders offering the same deal but only the annual percentage rates are different so what should you do in a scenario like this the lender offering a better deal is the one with the lower apr also they require fewer upfront fees do exercise caution when annual percentage rates are used the lender will usually spread out the servicing costs in the annual percentage rates throughout the complete loan cycle the annual percentage rate never lies to find the actual cost of financing pay attention to the annual percentage rate when determining which loan provider to borrow money from you get a clear picture of the entire borrowing cost because the annual percentage rate considers other costs connected with obtaining a loan especially a mortgage it is important that you check with your creditor to make sure they properly brief you on each one having a good credit score can lower your annual percentage rate not a myth 5 grace period this refers to the time period automatically granted to you the borrower will not have to pay any amount to the lender or towards the loan keep in mind that as long as you pay the balance in full by the due date you will not be charged interest not all credit card companies provide grace periods you should check with your credit card provider to be careful that it is clearly represented 6 credit utilization one of the biggest factors in your credit score is your credit utilization rate usually computed as a percentage credit utilization is your credit balance divided by your credit limit multiplied by a hundred for example you may be given 1 000 a month but only use 250 of it that would mean your utilization rate would be 25 how utilization affects your credit score an important factor in your credit score is your credit utilization rate thus having a high utilization rate could potentially lower your credit score and vice versa while being aware of these terms and creating a good credit score is financially essential you need to know what makes the score go up or down there are several common myths about what affects your credit score with credit it s tricky to discern credit fact from credit myth things can get really complicated especially if you are new to the realm of credit credit fact or myth in this section we will dissect the following credit facts and myths the goal is for you to distinguish fact from myth hoping this will help free you from debt or avoid it altogether 1 your credit score is low because you don t have a college degree this credit myth is simply not true education level is irrelevant in credit scores it is not part of the credit report only debt information is the same goes for demographic information your age and where you were born have no bearing on your credit scoring lenders and creditors are more concerned with your ability to pay off a loan so they focus on your history of paying bills equal credit opportunity act a creditor s scoring system forbids credit discrimination on the account of race color religion national origin sex marital status or age as factors as stated under the equal credit opportunity act don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free credit reports don t include information such as profession sexual orientation or disabilities as long as it s not on your credit report it won t affect your credit score what is included in a credit report the data included in credit reports is usually debt related information you have personal identifying information credit account information inquiry information bankruptcies and collections accounts we have things that will not be in a credit report such as income investments assets specified as stocks or bonds also savings accounts checking accounts certificates of deposit or other non debt banking relationships are not included 2 credit bureaus do not have the same information this is not a credit myth it s a fact there are three main credit bureaus equifax experian and transunion each credit bureau has its own method of ascertaining your score this explains why your score can vary across bureaus do note that lenders and creditors can voluntarily choose to report to any or all of them they can also release updates of your credit report on different dates so what can you do have a list and make sure you are tracking your expenses and where they are coming from be specific and note your expenses identify if you ve paid for it in cash debit or credit it is also good practice to continue paying on time and ensure your credit reports are free of error 3 there are different credit scoring models this is not a credit myth it s the truth as alluded to in the previous fact each credit bureau has its own formula for checking your score what is the purpose of your credit score credit scores are there to measure how financially stable you are they are also there to determine how capable you are of paying back debt in the credit marketplace there are thousands of scoring models a company can implement depending on the situation it is critical that you know the types of credit scores used in the industry understanding the two major credit scores and others the three major credit bureaus equifax experian and transunion each organize their own credit reports you could have different credit scores for example lenders and other creditors could check your score for various reasons several factors come into play such as the computer systems used by each company which can be disparate to work with a particular arrangement taking into consideration the different credit details examined in each type of score framework an excellent score in one credit bureau may only be considered good for another the credit score methods can be classified into three major types fico vantagescore and other credit scores fico scores established in 1956 the fair isaac corporation fico is a commonly used scoring method fico scores are based on the type of loan a consumer is applying for they can also be tailored for customer specific needs don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free fico scores have updated their formulas over the years which explains why so many lenders use different fico score versions fico score 9 which was released in 2014 now includes rental payment history and aims to reduce the negative impact of unpaid medical accounts and paid third party collections with its updated system vantagescore in 2006 vantagescore revealed its scoring method through equifax experian and transunion as an alternative to the fico score this was done in order to help more people qualify for a credit score four separate methods of the vantagescore model were launched over the years vantagescore 1 0 in 2006 2 0 in 2010 3 0 in 2013 and then 4 0 in 2017 although there are newer vantagescore methods many creditors and individuals still use the 3 0 model to track credit history or acknowledge creditworthiness vantagescore ranges may vary depending on the method used for example a vantagescore 2 0 has a 501 to 990 credit score range while the 3 0 and 4 0 versions range from 300 to 850 other types of credit scores apart from the two most commonly used credit scores fico and vantagescore methods aren t the only ones out there jeff richardson a vantagescore spokesperson said that these custom built scoring models use credit bureau based risk scores as input also several large lenders use custom built scoring methods created by in house statisticians or external third parties in general credit scores usually fall somewhere between 300 and 850 having a score above the 670 range is considered good while a score over 800 on this same scale is viewed as excellent scores that fall below 579 are seen as poor how can you check your credit score once a year you can check and request copies of your credit reports from each bureau for free amidst the covid 19 pandemic the credit industry is working to help people better manage their credit and by april 2022 you can actually get your reports weekly it is good to note that you only get your report and not your score when you get your free credit reports if you want to check your actual credit score visit credit to view your score for free or you ll need to buy it from the credit bureau or other service the key to understanding your credit scores understanding your credit scores can be a challenge with several credit scores out there so in order for you to stand a chance against a potential lender focus on good credit behaviors they ll reflect positively on you no matter which scores they are looking at here are some good credit activities that you should put into practice keep a strong credit utilization rate pay on or before your due date if possible avoid closing old accounts monitor your credit score regularly 4 checking your own credit report will negatively affect your score this is a credit myth in fact keeping tabs on your report will help you stay on top of things there are actually two types of credit inquiries two types of credit inquiries what s the difference take this scenario if you gave your lender permission to check your credit then it is going to be reported as a hard inquiry if you didn t it should be reported as a soft inquiry but how do you tell the difference between the two and why do they happen do you know what the ramifications are for soft credit inquiries and hard credit inquiries how would you know whether an inquiry is going to be hard or soft before it happens take this as your general guide so that you get a better footing of where you stand when making those credit inquiries what is a hard credit inquiry let s look at what a hard credit inquiry is hard credit inquiries also known as hard credit checks or hard pulls usually take place when you apply for something when a lender checks your credit before giving you the green light for a loan such as a credit card car loan or mortgage you ve applied for that s a hard credit inquiry when does a hard inquiry happen and will it affect my credit score normally you will probably know when a hard credit inquiry takes place because you will have to give the lender consent also there s a chance it could lower your credit score however it is unlikely a single hard inquiry will have a huge dent in whether you re approved for a new card or loan typically the harm to your credit scores falls or fades away even before the inquiry drops off your credit reports for good not a myth hard credit inquiries are temporary and often stay on your credit reports for about two years which are unlikely to have a significant impact although that doesn t sound too bad you shouldn t be applying for a handful of credit cards at the same time or even within the next couple of months so consider spreading out your credit card applications lenders and credit card issuers might consider you a high risk customer if they notice multiple hard inquiries during a brief span of time this has a greater impact on your credit scores and makes you look like you are short on cash or on the way to turning up in a lot of debt why are hard credit inquiries important statistics show that new applicants for credit have a higher risk than consumers who don t this is because when a lender pulls your credit report there s a high probability that your credit score will decline a recent study by fico revealed that people with credit inquiries that exceeded five in the last 12 months have a higher probability of becoming 90 days past due on a credit obligation than people with zero inquiries the numbers go up if you have six or more credit inquiries which resulted in people being more likely to file for bankruptcy compared with zero inquiry consumers the reason lenders and other companies use credit scores are to help determine the risk of doing business with you as well as the possibility of your defaulting on any credit obligation within the next 24 months your credit score could dwindle if there are signs on your credit report indicating that you re more likely to default on a credit obligation not only that but there are also activities that increase your credit risks such as late payments high credit card utilization and other derogatory credit information listed below are examples of hard inquiries requests for an increase in your credit limit applying for lines of credit mortgage applications new utility applications auto loan applications credit card applications student loan applications personal loan applications apartment rental applications how many points will a hard inquiry cost you in general a single new inquiry will lower a credit score by less than five points as stated by fico the older the inquiry becomes the lesser impact it will have on your score until it no longer counts at all once broken down the real credit scoring process is a bit more complicated than one would expect taking into consideration other components hard credit requests don t check about as much toward your credit score calculation for instance utilizing the fico scoring models credit inquiries affect 10 of your credit score contingent on your fico score your payment history is worth 35 not a credit myth under the vantagescore credit scoring models hard inquiries are much less important vantagescore works out only 5 of your score hinging on hard inquiries there are no specific point values across the board when it comes to individual credit inquiries by way of illustration your credit score will lower by five points if you make a new hard inquiry credit scoring doesn t work like that in contrast the overall number of inquiries that appear on your credit report in addition to the age of those inquiries is examined in a credit scoring model your other credit information is important as well those with established credit reports will have a lesser impact on their credit score versus those with a new hard inquiry with little credit history what is a soft inquiry when an individual or company checks your credit as part of a background check these are called soft inquiries otherwise known as soft credit checks or soft pulls they normally take place when a credit card issuer checks your credit without your consent to see if you meet the requirements for specific credit card offers a soft inquiry may also be conducted by your employer prior to hiring you other instances when a soft inquiry happens include checking your own credit or receiving an offer from a lender like a pre approved credit card as opposed to hard inquiries soft inquiries may or may not be documented in your credit reports subject to the discretion of the credit bureau they usually won t affect your credit scores and are only visible to you when you view your credit reports this is because soft inquiries aren t linked to a particular application for new credit soft credit inquiries won t show up at all if a lender checks your credit report they are only visible on consumer disclosures credit reports that you request personally here are some examples of soft inquiries personal credit checks pre approved credit offers insurance applications reviews on your account by current creditors employment applications and verifications how long do inquiries stay on your credit nearly all credit reporting is voluntary for instance credit card issuers aren t obligated to give out customer information to the credit bureaus also the inclusion of credit card accounts on credit reports isn t required of the credit bureaus however in order to help the companies involved improve their bottom lines account information is reported and included in credit reports on the other hand inquiries are legally required to be disclosed when they give anyone access to your credit information almost all inquiries should remain on your credit report for at least 12 months as stated by the fair credit reporting act fcra for example employment inquiries have to remain on your credit report for 24 months normally credit reporting agencies choose to hold on to inquiries on your credit reports for two years but fico only considers hard inquiries that occurred in the last year there is zero influence on your fico score once a hard inquiry is older than a year yet again vantagescore is more tolerant when it comes to inquiries in the event a hard inquiry lowers your vantagescore credit score it will almost always bounce back in three to four months granted that no new negative information appears on your credit report will checking my own credit scores result in a hard inquiry this is a credit myth checking your own credit is deemed a soft credit check so it won t have a negative effect on your scores it is important to note that other types of credit checks could appear as either a hard or soft inquiry for example providers who will often check your credit are the following utility cable internet and cellphone have a hard time distinguishing whether it s a hard or soft credit inquiry you can ask the company credit card issuer or financial institution involved to clarify any particular inquiry how to dispute hard credit inquiries it is highly recommended that you check your credit reports frequently consider disputing any errors you find with the credit bureau such as a hard inquiry that occurred without your permission for further assistance you can contact the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb at the very least this could be an indication of identity theft as reported by experian make sure you look into it and understand what s going on be mindful hard inquiries that occur without your permission can only be disputed once you ve authorized a hard inquiry normally it could take up to two years to fall off your credit reports 5 will canceling my credit card improve my credit score the answer is no in fact closing your card will cause a lower credit score a good reason for this is that once you close your account your total available credit goes down resulting in your credit utilization going up credit utilization secret formula a key term to remember is credit utilization for those who aren t familiar with the term credit utilization is the link between your credit card balance and your credit limit you can use this formula to calculate your credit utilization rate credit card balance credit limit 100 credit utilization rate this will tell you how much of the credit you re using maximize your credit to maximize your credit scores you can maintain a credit utilization under 10 otherwise a utilization of 30 below is adequate if you re looking to apply for financing in the near future having good credit is all about finding balance and controlling the impulse to splurge if you want to earn some extra cash you can check with your credit card rewards that offer referral bonuses consult with your credit issuer on how to refer a friend every time you refer someone for a credit card and their application gets approved you have a chance to earn referral bonuses typically around 50 to 150 to receive these kinds of bonuses there are some requirements but it s a relatively straightforward way to earn extra cash up to 500 in most cases 6 credit bureaus are owned and managed by the government another myth debunked credit bureaus operate as private or commercial companies although many consumers think that credit bureaus like experian equifax and transunion are operated or are under the thumb of the federal government but they re not protect your rights however the federal government protects your rights as per the fair credit reporting act consumers like you are protected from harmful credit practices while permitting insurance companies lenders employers and others to use credit reports to find out credit risk 7 having a lot of money in the bank means you have a good credit score a statement that is definitely untrue with your bank balance or the amount of income you have credit bureaus do not consider them in your credit scoring what affects my credit score factors that have a role in your credit score are amounts owed payment history credit mix and new credit with that said you need to avoid missing payments defaulting on accounts applying for a lot of credit in a short time and using too much available credit a good rule of thumb to improve one s credit score is to keep your credit utilization below 30 8 having a lot of debt means that your credit score will be low this is a myth not all debts are identical this will depend on your situation for example a credit card bill is something you can pay off sooner while a 30 year mortgage is a long term investment sometimes having no debt could mean that you don t have a credit history as well 9 once a bad credit score always a bad credit score all these can seem overwhelming and complex but it doesn t have to be the case you can educate yourself and take the actions to prevent a low credit score we are not immune to making poor decisions although you can t change the past you can certainly take steps to improve your score you can reach out to your lenders find something that works for you for example you can set up an alternative payment schedule ignoring the situation will only add fuel to the fire be responsible and practice good credit management 10 settling my debt will get rid of any late or missed payments although this is partly true paying off any debt will not bring down the impact of late payments or take it away from your credit report normally these negative items stay on your report for up to seven years the bright side is having positive credit practices can help lessen the implications of a negative item over time 11 i have a good credit score so they will approve my credit application false information in your credit reports and other data included on your application such as your income solely depends on the discretion of the lender to decide whether to grant you credit while a good credit score is good each application is unique so it s not wise to consider a loan credit card or mortgage entirely established on credit scores final thoughts be patient in trying to build your credit scores prior to applying for credit your credit scores are instrumental in your financial well being the chances of being approved for the financial products may increase with stronger credit you want to have the best possible terms and rates steer clear from applying for multiple credit cards within a short span of time although one hard inquiry may ding a few points off your scores several inquiries in a short amount of time may result in more damage an exception would be if you re rate shopping for a home or car as so then you ll probably have a grace period to shop around this post was previously published on the financially independent millennial

the quarter amounted to 124 8 million an increase of 39 3 million or 46 0 sales for the quarter were positively impacted by increased shipments by the company s north american french and italian operations of large orders recorded in the previous fiscal year primarily destined for the petrochemical nuclear and oil and gas markets respectively the company s sales were also positively impacted by a revaluation of its provision for performance guarantees of 8 8 million additionally the positive trend in terms of quarterly mro sales continued this quarter due to the higher bookings 1 of such orders in the first half of the current fiscal year this positive trend has allowed the company s quarterly sales to build momentum as the year progressed bookings 2 for the quarter amounted to 77 1 million a decrease of 3 8 million or 4 7 this decrease for the quarter is primarily attributable to lower bookings 2 in the company s european subsidiaries primarily in the nuclear market partially offset by a strong booking performance in the company s north american operations notably in terms of mro orders gross profit for the quarter amounted to 47 7 million an increase of 24 7 million or 106 8 the gross profit percentage for the quarter of 38 2 was an increase of 1 120 basis points compared to last year s final quarter the improvement in gross profit for the quarter is primarily attributable to the higher sales volume which helped to cover the company s fixed production overhead costs more efficiently the company s improved margins are also stemming from the delivery of a product mix with a greater proportion of higher margin product sales as well as margin improvement activities implemented over the course of the past fiscal years within the scope of the v20 restructuring and transformation plan the gross profit also benefited from a positive revaluation of the company s provision for performance guarantees of 8 8 million for the quarter finally the increase in gross profit percentage was such that it could more than offset the impact of a lower amount of cews of 1 3 million for the quarter compared to last year the subsidies are allocated between cost of sales and administration costs administration costs for the quarter amounted to 38 8 million an increase of 14 7 million or 60 7 the increase in administration costs for the quarter is primarily attributable to a non recurring 13 1 million increase in the costs related to the company s ongoing asbestos litigation in order to revise based on new estimates the assessment of the provision that would account for all outstanding litigations rather than only settled amounts the increase is also attributable to a general increase in administration expenses such as travel expenses marketing and office maintenance costs that significantly decreased when the global pandemic broke out in 2020 and an increase in sales commissions for the quarter due to the higher sales volume finally the increase in administration costs is also attributable to a decrease of 1 0 million for the quarter of cews compared to last year the subsidies are allocated between cost of sales and administration costs net loss1 for the quarter amounted to 25 6 million or 1 19 per share compared to a net income of 0 3 million or 0 02 per share last year the net loss1 for the quarter was significantly impacted by a 32 6 million non cash tax adjustment to derecognize a portion of the company s deferred tax asset excluding this non cash tax adjustment the company s adjusted net income2 for the quarter amounted to 7 0 million or 0 32 per share ebitda2 for the quarter amounted to 16 6 million or 0 77 per share compared to 1 6 million or 0 08 per share last year the increase in ebitda2 for the quarter is primarily due to an increase in gross profit for the reasons mentioned previously and a 4 6 million non recurring net gain after minority interests on the disposal of the company s investment in juwon special steel co ltd in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year the improvement was also due to the absence of restructuring and transformation costs which totaled 1 3 million in the final quarter of the previous year this improvement in ebitda2 was partially offset by an increase in administration costs as explained previously the movement in the company s adjusted net income2 for the quarter was primarily attributable to the same factors as explained above coupled with an unfavorable movement in income taxes year ended fiscal 2022 unless otherwise noted all amounts are in u s dollars and all comparisons are to the prior fiscal year sales for the fiscal year amounted to 411 2 million an increase of 109 2 million or 36 1 sales for the year were positively impacted by increased shipments by the company s north american french and italian operations of large orders recorded in the previous fiscal year primarily destined for the petrochemical nuclear and oil and gas markets respectively the company s sales were also positively impacted by a revaluation of its provision for performance guarantees of 13 2 million for the fiscal year bookings 2 for the fiscal year amounted to 363 5 million a decrease of 63 1 million or 14 8 the decrease for the fiscal year is primarily attributable to lower bookings 2 in the company s french and italian operations which both recorded significant nuclear and downstream oil and gas orders in the previous year this decrease was partially offset by a significantly higher amount of mro orders recorded by the company s north american operations in the current fiscal year the company is encouraged by the recovery of its mro order bookings 2 which were severely impacted by the global pandemic at the end of the prior fiscal year and ultimately adversely affected the sales of the latter part of the previous fiscal year and the first half of the current fiscal year as a result of sales outpacing bookings 2 in the fiscal year the company s book to bill ratio 2 was 0 88 for the year furthermore the total backlog 2 decreased by 61 3 million or 10 9 since the beginning of the fiscal year amounting to 501 2 million as at february 28 2022 the reduction of the backlog 2 is primarily due to a book to bill ratio 2 below 1 00 combined with the weakening of the euro spot rate against the u s dollar since the beginning of the fiscal year alternatively the company s backlog 2 deliverable within a year is at a similar level than last year gross profit for the fiscal year amounted to 135 0 million an increase of 54 4 million or 67 6 the gross profit of 32 8 represented an increase of 610 basis points compared to last year the improvement in gross profit for the year is primarily attributable to the higher sales volume which helped to cover the company s fixed production overhead costs more efficiently the company s improved margins are also stemming from the delivery of a product mix with a greater proportion of higher margin product sales as well as margin improvement activities implemented over the course of the past fiscal years within the scope of the v20 restructuring and transformation plan the gross profit also benefited from a positive revaluation of the company s provision for performance guarantees of 13 2 million for the fiscal year additionally the company s gross profit for the fiscal year benefited from 6 1 million of favorable foreign exchange movements which were primarily made up of unrealized foreign exchange translations related to the fluctuation of the u s dollar against the euro and the canadian dollar when compared to similar movements from the previous year finally the increase in gross profit percentage was such that it could more than offset the impact of a lower amount of cews of 5 9 million for the fiscal year compared to last year the subsidies are allocated between cost of sales and administration costs administration costs for the year amounted to 113 0 million an increase of 32 9 million or 41 1 the increase in administration costs for the year is primarily attributable to a non recurring 13 1 million increase in the costs related to the company s ongoing asbestos litigation in order to revise based on new estimates the assessment of the provision that would account for all outstanding litigations rather than only settled amounts the increase is also attributable to a general increase in administration expenses such as travel expenses marketing and office maintenance costs that significantly decreased when the global pandemic broke out in 2020 and an increase in sales commissions for the year due to the higher sales volume finally the increase in administration costs is also attributable to a decrease of 4 7 million for the year of cews compared to last year the subsidies are allocated between cost of sales and administration costs net loss1 for the year amounted to 21 1 million or 0 98 per share compared to a net income1 of 2 9 million or 0 13 per share last year the net loss1 for the year was significantly impacted by a 32 6 million non cash tax adjustment to derecognize a portion of the company s deferred tax asset excluding this non cash tax adjustment the company s adjusted net income2 for the year amounted to 11 5 million or 0 53 per share ebitda2 for the year amounted to 39 6 million or 1 83 per share compared to 15 6 million or 0 72 per share last year the increase in ebitda2 for the year is primarily due to an increase in gross profit for the reasons mentioned previously and a 4 6 million non recurring net gain after minority interests on the disposal of the company s investment in juwon special steel co ltd in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year the improvement was also due to a reduction in other expenses of 2 7 million for the fiscal year primarily due to land clean up costs of a former factory incurred in the second quarter of the prior fiscal year this increase in ebitda2 was partially offset by an increase in administration costs as explained previously as well as the absence of restructuring and transformation income which totaled 3 9 million in the previous year the restructuring and transformation income in the prior fiscal year resulted primarily from a 9 6 million gain recognized on the disposal of one of the company s montreal plants an integral part of the north american manufacturing footprint optimization plan which was planned in the scope of v20 the movement in the company s adjusted net income2 for the year was primarily attributable to the same factors as explained above coupled with an unfavorable movement in income taxes dividend the board declared an eligible quarterly dividend of ca 0 03 per share payable on june 30 2022 to all

united nations may 18 xinhua un secretary general antonio guterres called on wednesday for concerted and quick action to combat the current surge in global food insecurity during a ministerial meeting on global hunger at the un headquarters in new york the un chief said the number of severely food insecure people had doubled in just two years from 135 million pre pandemic to 276 million today with more than half a million experiencing famine conditions an increase of more than 500 percent since 2016 these frightening figures are inextricably linked with conflict as both cause and effect he said if we do not feed people we feed conflict the climate emergency is another contributor to global hunger he said pointing out that 1 7 billion people were affected by extreme weather and climate related disasters over the past decade in addition the covid induced economic shock has compounded food insecurity by reducing incomes and disrupting supply chains resulting in an uneven economic recovery access to financial markets has been restricted with some developing countries now on the brink of debt default now the war in ukraine is amplifying and accelerating all these factors climate change covid 19 and inequality guterres said between them ukraine and russia produce almost a third of the world s wheat and barley and half of its sunflower oil russia and belarus are the world s number two and three producers of potash a key ingredient of fertilizer the conflict between russia and ukraine threatens to tip tens of millions of people over the edge into food insecurity followed by malnutrition mass hunger and famine in a crisis that could last for years warned the un chief in the past year global food prices have risen by nearly one third fertilizer by more than half and oil prices by almost two thirds meanwhile most developing countries lack the fiscal space to cushion the blow of these huge increases with many unable to borrow because markets are closed to them if high fertilizer prices continue today s crisis in grain and cooking oil could affect many other foods including rice impacting billions of people in asia and the americas he detailed additionally children are threatened by a lifetime of stunting millions of women and children will become malnourished girls will be pulled from school and forced to work or get married and families will embark on dangerous journeys across continents just to survive high rates of hunger have a devastating impact on individuals families and societies said the un chief however if we act together there is enough food for everyone he said adding that ending hunger is within our reach the secretary general outlined five urgent steps to solve the short term crisis and prevent long term damage beginning with reducing market pressure by increasing food supplies with no restrictions on exports and surpluses available to those most in need in closing the un chief said that the global crisis response group on food energy and finance is tracking the impact of the crisis on vulnerable people identifying and pushing for solutions the food crisis has no respect for borders and no country can overcome it alone he said our only chance of lifting millions of people out of hunger is to act together urgently and with solidarity he said
many american parents are searching for infant formula amid a combination of short and long term problems facing u s formula brands thus causing anxiety among many families and expecting mothers my baby isn t even here yet and i m experiencing anxiety over this shortage even though i plan to nurse if possible said taylor gassel a michigan resident who is expecting her first child in october nationwide about 40 of large retail stores are out of stock up from 31 in mid april according to datasembly a data analytics firm more than half of u s states are seeing out of stock rates between 40 and 50 according to the firm which collects data from 11 000 locations related baby formula shortage has parents on the hunt for product emily ingrich a 31 year old mother told fox television stations group that the process of finding baby formula has been challenging it s been horrible my son has a dairy allergy so he needs a specific formula that has been impossible to find she shared we live in a rural area of north carolina and have driven over three hours away to find his formula baby formula is offered for sale at a big box store on january 13 2022 in chicago illinois baby formula has been is short supply in many stores around the country for several months photo by scott olson getty images dr kelsey klaas a pediatrician at mayo clinic agrees calling the current baby formula shortage anxiety provoking we all should be concerned when the needs of our most vulnerable including nutritional needs are unmet klass said the formula shortage is absolutely contributing to parents anxiety because a large part of what we do as parents is nourish and feed our kids to support their growth and development why is baby formula in short supply this is likely not the first story you ve heard especially recently from families struggling to find baby formula due to a nationwide shortage the problem was initiated by supply chain disruptions which have caused major delays among retailers and companies this has also caused stores to put limitations on how much baby formula customers can buy a safety recall issued earlier this year has also compounded these challenges in february the food and drug administration warned consumers to avoid some powdered baby formula products from a sturgis michigan facility run by abbott nutrition which then initiated a voluntary recall according to findings released in march by federal safety inspectors abbott failed to maintain sanitary conditions and procedures at the plant the fda launched its investigation after four babies became sick with a rare bacterial infection after consuming formula manufactured at the plant all four babies were hospitalized and two died chicago based abbott said in a statement there is no evidence to link our formulas to these infant illnesses abbott noted that samples of the bacteria collected from the infants did not match those found in the company s factory related what s driving the baby formula shortage the fda announced it would allow abbott to resume producing certain baby formula products on a case by case basis the combination of supply chain issues and the recall has wiped out many brands covered by women infants and children wic a federal program like food stamps that serves to help families though the program now permits brand substitutes when will baby formula shortage end president joe biden stepped up his administration s response to the baby formula shortage last thursday discussing with executives from gerber and reckitt how they could increase production and how his administration could help biden also talked with leaders from walmart and target about how to restock shelves and address regional disparities in access to formula the white house reported we recognize that this is certainly a challenge for people across the country something the president is very focused on and we re going to do everything we can to cut red tape and take steps to increase supply white house press secretary jen psaki told reporters related baby formula shortage 2022 continues nearly 30 of popular brands sold out firm estimates the administration plans to monitor possible price gouging and work with trading partners in mexico chile ireland and the netherlands on imports even though 98 of baby formula is currently domestically made so what should parents do if they re having trouble finding baby formula should mothers try breastfeeding should expecting parents stock up on a supply of formula if they can find it breast milk and baby formula are both excellent sources of nutrition for infants both provide the right balance of fat carbs protein vitamins and minerals to help babies grow steven miller a pediatric gastroenterologist at johns hopkins children s center told fox breastfeeding is recommended if possible choosing whether to breastfeed or formula feed a baby can be one of the biggest decisions expectant and new parents will make the decision is an important one as formula and breast milk provide an effective balance of certain minerals that a cow s milk cannot provide according to the american academic medical center mayo clinic breastfeeding provides the best nutrition for an infant and is the most widely recommended way to feed a newborn breast milk contains the right balance of nutrients for your baby and boosts your baby s immune system jay l hoecker an emeritus pediatrics specialist at mayo clinic said it s considered the gold standard for infant nutrition dr cynthia blanco a neonatologist in texas and a member of the american academy of pediatrics aap echoed hoecker sayiing if you have a healthy term baby your best choice will always be breast milk and a number of health organizations including the aap the american medical association ama and the world health organization who agree recommending breastfeeding as the best choice for babies experts say breastfeeding has chemicals that help defend against infections prevent allergies and protect against a number of chronic conditions additionally breast milk is the most cost effective option since it doesn t cost a cent and formula quickly adds up this shortage is a major headache and if moms make their own milk rather than buying it from the store that is one less thing to worry about miller noted adding the other thing doctors like about breastfeeding is that when babies breastfeed they can decide when they are full more easily than they can with formula this is part of why babies who are breastfed turn into kids who have a lower chance of being obese i am definitely a big fan of breastfeeding klaas noted she always encourages mothers to breastfeed when possible i absolutely support breastfeeding when possible we know that breastfeeding has benefits to both the infant and mother over formula feeding klass explained adding the current formula shortage highlights one particular benefit of breastfeeding which is that for a parent who is able to produce enough milk to meet the infant s needs infant nutrition is not reliant on external supplies health experts suggest that mothers who are exclusively breastfeeding asking their baby s pediatrician about vitamin d supplements for their baby since breast milk alone does not provide an adequate amount of the vitamin which helps the baby absorb calcium and phosphorus nutrients necessary for strong bones women who are breastfeeding will also need to be aware of what they eat and drink since this can be passed to the baby through the breast milk it s always exhausting and amazing to have a new baby but right now it s extra stressful because of the added worries around how to feed the baby miller continued if you want to breastfeed now is an especially good time to do it and don t be afraid to ask for help if you choose to use formula be flexible about the brand and know that formula works really well to grow healthy kids mothers who are anxious about breastfeeding may want to contact friends or family who have successfully breastfed as they may be a good source of information support organizations such as la leche league along with lactation consultants at many hospitals and clinics are available to help as well routine milk pumping is the best way to increase supply said jackee haak a north dakota based registered nurse and board member of the united states lactation consultant association related baby formula shortage which foods and techniques boost breast milk production rachel taylor a registered nurse postpartum and lactation advocate from birmingham alabama told fox news digital that she mainly recommends lactation cookies teas water and a few dietary supplements or ingredients that have demonstrated beneficial results for nursing mothers how long should i breastfeed my baby the american academy of pediatrics recommends mothers exclusively breastfeed for the first six months after birth followed by a combination of breast milk with solid foods until at least the age of one extended breastfeeding is recommended as long as the mother and baby wish to continue major infant formulas are safe effective while most health experts believe breast milk is the best nutritional choice for infants breastfeeding may not be possible for all women for many the decision to breastfeed or formula feed is based on their comfort level lifestyle and specific medical situations the topic has sparked controversy and forced parents into online groups across social media with many users citing momshaming to those criticizing other mothers for opting to use formula if it s affecting the mother s life it s affecting the mother s mental health if it s affecting you as a woman that s not good for your baby either blanco shared most doctors agree that major infant formulas are an effective source of nutrition and can help babies grow and keep them healthy and thus parents can feel safe supplying it despite this most doctors agree that major infant formulas are an effective source of nutrition and can help babies grow and keep them healthy and thus parents can feel safe supplying it we need to recognize that breastfeeding is a lot of work if breastfeeding doesn t work formula feeding is a safe alternative which provides adequate nutrition for the infant klaas explained when prepared as directed infant formula supports healthy babies who have typical dietary needs in fact a baby who has special nutritional needs might require a special formula baby formula is of course an attempt to approximate breast milk as closely as possible it contains macronutrients carbohydrates fat and protein as well as micronutrients these elements can be replicated pretty effectively which means that properly made formula will meet an infant s nutritional needs klaas continued most formulas are made from protein from cow s milk that has been altered to be easier to digest and has been enhanced with extra nutrients needed for growth and development related alaska mom says baby formula shortage creating extra panic as she launches group for struggling parents the fda also regulates formula companies to ensure they provide all the necessary nutrients including vitamin d in their formulas according to a survey by the centers for disease control and prevention 84 1 of infants born in 2017 started breastfeeding but only 58 3 of infants were breastfeeding at six months this means after the six month time period more than 40 of parents were still required to find formula as a baby s digestive system isn t ready for cow s milk until they re about one year old according to pampers mothers face a number of challenges to long term breastfeeding including returning to work and finding the time and equipment needed to pump breast milk some women who breastfeed including sarah jobin smith are worried they may need to join other mothers in the hunt for formula if they are not able to produce enough milk my oldest is about to turn three but when she was a newborn i struggled producing jobin smith told fox our second was just born on april 18th and i have this fear of not producing enough again she continued i do worry that as she grows i won t be able to keep up with the demand and i may be another parent out there looking for formula where can i find formula there are many reasons women choose to use formula instead of breast milk so what should a parent do if they can t find formula my advice in the time of formula shortages is not to be brand specific miller suggested adding this means that you can look around for other brands or store brands which are often very good experts say generic formulas are also fda approved and meet the same requirements as brand names in addition no generic formulas were impacted in february s recall however doctors suggest talking to your pediatrician first especially if your baby must use a hydrolyzed or amino acid based formula also it s not advised to give toddler formulas to young infants especially under 9 months of age if you re still struggling to find formula or your baby requires a specific brand experts suggest talking with your pediatrician or calling a local food bank to see if they can help locate some options they also recommend checking with smaller stores and pharmacies which may still have supplies when larger stores run out baby formula can also be very costly so for families who qualify based on income the wic can provide formula free of charge doctors also suggest seeking out local groups online many local parent groups have postings about unopened unexpired formula canisters available to give away or sell during this time experts say it s okay to look for formula online but check that it is sold by a reputable supplier unopened and unexpired bottom line blanco says if you cannot find any formula at all to call your pediatrician or local hospital there is not a parent that we have not been able to help blanco added should i make homemade baby formula stock up amid shortage while the baby formula shortage is a challenge for many parents doctors say parents should not try to make their own formula at home from cow s milk or add extra water to the formula to stretch supplies both of these things could make the baby sick related pediatrician s plea to parents do not make your own baby formula sarah adams who is with ohio s pediatric primary care hudson made it quite clear on this point i do not recommend making your own formula adding the aap strongly advises against homemade formula she continued these are not safe and not fda approved infant deaths have been reported many do it yourself formula recipes are made from cow s milk and granular sugar that may be difficult for young babies to digest they also lack the specific vitamins and proteins found in breastmilk and fda approved formulas that are needed for basic nutrition adams also recommends not watering down formula citing this practice as dangerous that can lead to poor nutritional balance and serious complications additionally most experts don t defend stocking up on formula for just in case scenarios in general i m not in favor of parents buying up a ton of formula that they aren t sure they will need people stockpiling formula is part of why stores are running low miller explained that being said it would be ok for new parents to have a can or two of formula at home especially if they are thinking of using formula if you are actively using baby formula the aap advises buying no more than a ten day to two week supply of formula the shortage is temporary parents are in this together please avoid stockpiling help your neighbors and focus on infant safety klaas concluded blanco added don t panic that you may not have any next week you will have some next week and if you don t then again seek out your medical team of experts the associated press and fox news contributed to

photo illustration curbed photo getty images the fever isn t breaking there are now bidding wars for one in every five manhattan rental apartments and one in three luxury units according to the most recent douglas elliman report inventory in all of manhattan brooklyn and northwest queens has been hovering well below 10 000 units as of april the number was just 7 669 which is several thousand less than the number of entire apartment and entire home airbnb rentals available in new york city right now 10 572 according to airdna a third party site that tracks short term rentals inside airbnb another site that scrapes airbnb for listings data puts the number even higher at 20 397 ever since airbnb came on the scene in 2008 there have been concerns that the short term rental company would deplete the housing stock by sucking up available rooms causing prices to rise in cities like new york and san francisco where there were already severe housing shortages the absolute number of available apartments and houses on the site peaked before the pandemic and has since dropped back according to both inside airbnb and airdna but there s a difference now there are just so few apartments to be had that airbnbs make up the majority of the city s available rentals airbnb doesn t release listings or bookings data and wouldn t comment on the data collected by airdna and inside airbnb though its representatives were willing to confirm that its new york city listing inventory has fallen since the start of the pandemic they pointed to several other factors none related to airbnb that may have contributed to the housing shortage over the past two years our entire space listing supply citywide has decreased and it now represents a fraction of a percent of the city s rental units and all while rent prices have trended upward and city issued permits for new unit development remain down by a double digit percentage a spokesperson for the company wrote in an email that number is somewhat gamed airbnb is comparing its inventory to the total number of rental units in new york not just the available ones which as of 2017 was 2 18 million but of course only a tiny fraction of those are open in any given year let alone any given month the company has for its part always vehemently denied that it plays any role in the housing shortage insisting that it provides income that helps people remain in expensive cities they d otherwise have to leave its representatives also pointed to several factors that can make scraped third party data inaccurate multiple listings for the same property and listings that show up as active but are rarely available for example a townhouse that homeowners only rent out when they travel meaning it s active year round but only available for a few weeks a year but even if airdna and inside airbnb are overestimating the number of apartment and home listings on the site by a wide margin and with the caveat that douglas elliman s rental reports don t cover the bronx or staten island it seems likely that the number is at least broadly accurate inside airbnb counts only 624 entire apartment or house listings in those two boroughs so they re a minor factor in the overall numbers on top of the full home listings there are nearly 9 000 private and shared rooms available on airbnb according to airdna does it matter that there are more airbnbs than rental listings right now doesn t that point to just how scarce all rentals are except hotel rooms that is well yes but with people fighting over every decent apartment that comes on the market it s worth taking note of how many apartments have been taken out of circulation to become short term rentals some may be townhouses or condos rented for only a few weeks a year of course but lots are surely brownstone garden apartments that a decade ago might have gone to long term tenants on a brooklyn listserv i belong to every few months someone asks about airbnbing instead of renting their brownstone s garden level the city s housing market always tight is now close to crisis you d have much better luck finding a one bedroom in a brownstone for a few weeks than a year long lease which doesn t seem likely to change anytime soon although the common wisdom has been that more apartments would come on the market in spring and early summer as leases that were signed during the influx of returning new yorkers turned over that doesn t appear to be happening jonathan miller of miller samuel who wrote the douglas elliman report said that while things seemed to be improving in march with rising inventory and stabilizing rents in april the shortage began to worsen again the net effective median rent in manhattan went up year over year to a new high 3 925 at the largest rate on record and listing inventory had the most significant annual decline on record the market isn t turning it s actually accelerating miller said greater affordability is not right around the corner more and more people are hunkering down after all why move if there s nowhere to go
washington may 18 xinhua u s president joe biden on wednesday invoked the defense production act to boost production of baby formula and approved flights to bring in overseas infant formula amid a nationwide shortage the president is requiring suppliers to direct needed resources to infant formula manufacturers before any other customer who may have ordered that good according to a white house fact sheet directing firms to prioritize and allocate the production of key infant formula inputs will help increase production and speed up in supply chains it said biden has also directed the department of health and human services and the department of agriculture to use department of defense commercial aircraft to pick up overseas infant formula that meets u s health and safety standards so it can get to store shelves faster covid 19 induced supply chain disruptions have already led to low stock levels for infant formula but the problem was worsened after the food and drug administration issued a wide ranging recall of abbott s infant formula and closed an abbott nutrition facility in february after several babies fell ill with bacterial infections and two died for the week ending may 8 out of stock rate for baby formula nationwide hit 43 percent up 12 percent from april according to statistics from datasembly which tracks supply in real time datasembly s real time hyper local data analysis shows that baby formula stock was relatively stable for the first half of 2021 with out of stock fluctuation between 2 8 percent this issue has been compounded by supply chain challenges product recalls and historic inflation said datasembly ceo ben reich

about inflation and a recession in parts of the global economy while it was expected that this bounce would be short lived the rapidity with which it has unravelled will mean that even more investors will start heading for the exits he noted that one positive from these recession fears was the way they have managed to cap oil s gains if key parts of the global economy do slip into negative growth then demand for oil is unlikely to hold up beauchamp said while that is of little comfort to hard pressed consumers it does at least offer the chance of some relief from higher inflation in the medium

spending despite tighter economic conditions said ipek ozkardeskaya senior analyst at swissquote bank unfortunately the resilience of spending means that the federal reserve s fed actions don t result in the desired cooling effect on inflation she noted that price pressures are mostly due to rises in the supply side mainly from soaring energy and food prices while monetary policy is intended to control demand if demand doesn t ease fast enough the fed must tighten faster she added investors are worried that the fed may consider hiking rates even more quickly in moves that might crimp economic growth and threaten corporate bottom lines so far this year the fed has already raised interest rates by a total of three quarters of a percentage point in efforts to stamp out inflation which is at its highest level in decades elsewhere oil prices were higher indicating that commodity price pressures are not letting up partly due to russia s invasion of ukraine wti crude oil futures

persistently rising inflation is putting a tighter squeeze on a wide range of businesses and could cut deeper into their profits these retailers are having to balance how much of the higher inflation

stores around the city and i ve had to call up family outside the area and in some cases outside the state to find formula rubio s hometown is one of the cities hit hardest by the nationwide formula

percent nationwide the rate surged from 30 percent in early april to 43 percent the supply crunch is expected to ease but maybe not until summer abbott nutrition maker of some of the most popular brands of baby formula including similac said on monday it had reached an agreement with federal regulators to reopen its sturgis mich plant and begin making baby formula again advertisement article continues below this ad a woman shops for baby formula at targetas a nationwide shortage of baby formula continues due to supply chain crunches tied to the coronavirus pandemic that have already strained the country s formula stock an issue that was further exacerbated by a major product recall in february jim watson afp tns as the nation faces a formula shortage gov greg abbott saw an opportunity to slam president joe biden and immigrant babies ariana drehsler str nyt but it likely will take months for the facility to once again reach full production the plant was shut down in february after the food and drug administration found that four babies were sickened after consuming formula made at abbott s facility two of the infants died and abbott voluntarily recalled almost all of its formula products the company said in a news release that there was no conclusive evidence to link abbott s formulas to these infant illnesses with abbott products suddenly off the market parents scrambled to buy other brands of formula resulting in a widespread shortage advertisement article continues below this ad broken supply chain venky shankar the director of research at the center for retailing studies at texas a m university said the shortage is just hitting the ceiling in terms of impact store owners are feeling anxious too it s exacerbated to a certain extent for the

walgreens are restricting in store and online purchases of formula h e b the largest grocery retailer in the san antonio area said it is limiting customers to two cans of formula per trip to the store advertisement article continues below this ad but supermarket and drug stores aren t the only ones having a hard time keeping baby formula on their shelves the san antonio food bank which typically stocks baby formula along with baby food and other nutritious needs for mothers and infants also has little of it on hand eric cooper the food bank s president and ceo said many mothers have been calling and coming in to see if any formula is available some have even offered to pay for the formula if the food bank has it in stock which cooper sees as a sign of panic we had at one point a semi truckload of infant formula and it s gone now he said we re pretty much empty parents hunt for formula isn t the food bank s only challenge in recent weeks cooper has seen a roughly 10 percent increase in people seeking assistance many working san antonians can t keep up with rising inflation which has relentlessly pushed up the price of groceries gas and other necessities and are reaching out to the food bank shelves empty for a long time robyn franklin is a san antonio mother whose 6 month old son elijah has been formula fed since he was two months old franklin wasn t producing enough breast milk to fully nourish him so she began supplementing elijah s feedings with formula advertisement article continues below this ad shortly after she began formula feeding though she noticed it was disappearing from store shelves she was able to find some on amazon but now that s gone too franklin has little hope that the problem will be fixed soon even with abbott s plant reopening normally in manufacturing it s not immediate so i don t think there s going to be a solution for the next couple of weeks she said those shelves have been empty for a long time she added rocio martinez is a san antonio nurse who has had trouble finding the formula for her 7 month old daughter analea with gas at about 4 a gallon in san antonio she said it s even more difficult to drive from store to store search searching for the formula her baby needs it s honestly very scary thinking about this going on for the next few months she said even with abbott pledging to reopen its michigan plant it s just terrifying to not be able to have that hope that there may or may not be any formula anytime soon

as morgan fabry drives around chicago looking for baby formula that is in short supply she can t help but be bothered by comments from people who don t understand why she can t breastfeed exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first six months of life by major medical entities like the world health organization giving rise to the saying breast is best but breastfeeding doesn t work for everyone and that mantra is only adding to the stress fabry and other parents feel as the shortage drags on the bottom line is fed is best said fabry 34 i m getting triggered by people who say oh just breastfeed at the center of the shortage is the largest domestic manufacturing plant in michigan which the u s government is working to reopen the biden administration is also allowing more imports from other countries corryn chini avoided the baby formula aisle during her grocery shopping trip in dayton ohio this week with enough formula in her cupboard at home for a week or two there was no sense in letting the empty shelves trigger feelings of anxiety and guilt for chini the guilt comes from lingering feelings of failure after she was unable to exclusively breastfeed starting with her first baby in 2018 breastfeeding was a huge struggle and i felt an immense amount of guilt around not succeeding chini said in the end i was never able to produce enough and we had a late diagnosis of tongue tie and it was a mess when i had my second i thought i can do this i can advocate for myself and again it just didn t work her youngest evangeline was born three months ago chini is supplementing with formula there are various barriers to breastfeeding including medical issues for the baby or mom and work and living conditions dr lori feldman winter chair of the american academy of pediatrics breastfeeding group said exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months is recommended and safe for most babies but meeting the recommendations can be very challenging infants with an uncommon condition called classic galactosemia are unable to metabolize sugar in breast milk and need to be fed formula feldman winter said some medical conditions make it difficult for women to breastfeed and it isn t recommended for those with hiv or undergoing cancer treatment and exclusive breastfeeding is difficult for working women who have to pump repeatedly throughout the day there s even greater barriers in underserved areas women working for hourly wages in low paying jobs those women tend to have even fewer supports to be able to continue to breastfeed stress releases a hormone that makes it difficult to produce milk she said millions of babies in the u s rely on formula which is the only source of nutrition recommended for infants who aren t exclusively breastfed shortages have forced some parents to switch formulas which doctors say is fine in most cases but two children in memphis tennessee were recently hospitalized due to a switch in formula related to the shortage dr mark corkins of the le bonheur children s hospital told the associated press wednesday the division chief of pediatric gastroenterology at the hospital said the two children who previously required a specific dietary needs formula were admitted earlier this month for dehydration after the parents attempted to switch to a separate formula one child was discharged tuesday while the other remained in the hospital in stable condition the two received iv fluids and supplemental nutrition when isabel ramos gave birth in february she worked hard to try to breastfeed her son believing it would be beneficial for his immune system and enhance the mother child connection she tried pumping and worked with lactation consultants but the infant wouldn t latch onto her breast you feel like a failure because you re not able to give your baby what it needs and what it wants said the first time mom from lawrenceville georgia because of the stigma it took her a while to tell people she wasn t breastfeeding she s struggling with those feelings again because she keeps hearing things from relatives and strangers online like she should try harder to breastfeed because of the formula shortage a lot of men have opinions on it i m sorry are you trying to breastfeed then no leave me alone ana rodney who runs momcares a baltimore organization that provides baby supplies and support to new mothers in the city s black community said the shortage has hit many families there hard formula feeding is typically more common among black women often because they don t get breastfeeding encouragement or support from the white medical community rodney said breastfeeding requires time being able to sit with your baby being able to bond with your baby and working on your milk supply not being able to go back to work she said it s not that easy for some of us even if we want to callie salaymeh s baby hazel was just a couple of weeks old when salaymeh found blood in her diaper and took her to a chicago emergency room the baby had an intolerance to some of the proteins in salaymeh s breastmilk and cutting foods from salaymeh s own diet didn t help hazel had to be switched to a special prescription formula for babies with gastrointestinal conditions the shortage felt like it hit us before it hit the general public salaymeh said when her pharmacy called to say the prescription formula was out of stock when they had just one can left salaymeh began mixing the prescription formula with an over the counter formula for babies with sensitive tummies until more of the prescription formula could be found they mixed formulas for about three weeks hoping little hazel wouldn t get sick luckily hazel seemed to do fine with the mix and salaymeh hopes she might soon outgrow the food intolerance as most babies eventually do before her twins arrived five weeks early alexandra clark of sawyer michigan decided she would breastfeed and supplement with formula working full time as owner of a detroit chocolate company clark knew she d be facing enough new mom challenges without trying to produce enough milk for two babies clark 34 said she s grateful for support even from friends with a breast is best mindset instead of feeling judgment some of my really breastfeeding advocate friends who are still lactating have offered to pump for me if i need it which is

the number and size of homeless encampments in cities like la have spiked upward sharply over the past two years and so have profits for one company that serves them business is booming for a manufacturer of the small prefab homeless shelters known as tiny homes between 2019 and 2020 the washington state for profit company pallet saw a staggering 7 000 growth in demand for its product according to founder and ceo amy king kind of crazy king said we ve been growing really really really rapidly in march the startup announced that it had raised 15 million from a half dozen investors to expand its business the investors include individuals and social impact focused funds like citi ventures and dbl partners so can a company banking on the homelessness crisis also help alleviate it or does growing investment in a short term better than the sidewalk solution mean politicians are losing focus on upstream efforts like increasing affordable housing stock and preventing people from falling into homelessness in the first place king noting that pallet s workforce includes formerly unhoused and incarcerated people says her company can both profit and help as she sees it the company provides both upward mobility to its employees and a badly needed emergency option for people living on the streets still she said i will be very happy to celebrate the day that we shut the doors of the shop because our product is no longer needed critics see pallet s success as an indicator of a troubling pendulum swing the only thing that solves this crisis is housing says pete white executive director of the los angeles community action network an unhoused advocacy and organizing nonprofit based in skid row we find ourselves now in a place where there has been a backpedaling away from anything akin to permanent housing we refuse to refer to a tool shed as a tiny home he adds pallet isn t the only company manufacturing small free standing shelters but it has cornered the market so far the company has supplied 82 of the fenced in communities known as tiny home villages around the country and in canada including 10 sites in the city of la an 11th site for unhoused veterans stands on a federally owned veterans affairs campus in west los angeles this growth was fueled partly by the need for individual shelter options amid the pandemic in la demand was also pushed by litigation the city has long been severely short on shelter beds for the more than 41 000 people estimated to live unhoused inside its limits by last count at the same time a federal court ruling prevents the city from ticketing or arresting people for camping in public spaces unless shelter is available to them that s one reason street encampments have grown in 2020 a group largely made up of downtown business owners and residents sued la city and county over encampments and conditions on the streets city officials recently settled and agreed to build potentially thousands of new shelter beds the goal is to create enough shelter housing or some combination of both to accommodate 60 of the unhoused people in each council district a threshold expected to allow city officials to enforce anti camping laws pallet which lobbied the mayor s office city council members and various city departments throughout 2020 and 20201 on homelessness policy and projects was in the right place at the right time the company s eight foot by eight foot product they also offer larger models sell for approximately 7 000 each plus shipping and can be put together in less than an hour villages can also be assembled on oddly shaped pieces of publicly owned land that might not work for traditional construction so far la has spent 48 452 115 to construct tiny home villages according to the city administrative officer s cao office plus 25 133 900 annually to operate the sites the cao says the villages account for 1 252 beds that number assumes two people per tiny home which some city council districts are starting to require including part of the san fernando valley represented by paul krekorian and the district that includes much of downtown and boyle heights represented by kevin de leon the structures are equipped with climate control and electricity and the villages include on site social services three meals a day and access to shower and restroom trailers to many tiny home villages represent a long overdue emergency response to the thousands of people living and dying on la s streets each year and an untenable number of encampments on public property the streets can t be the waiting room for permanent housing says ken craft ceo of the nonprofit hope of the valley during a recent tour of a tiny home village in north hollywood his organization has been hired by the city to operate five villages in the san fernando valley we ve got to bring people indoors because the longer we leave them outside the worse things are getting city officials including la mayor eric garcetti say the city is finally doing it all expanding emergency relief and investing in permanent housing through efforts such as proposition hhh a voter approved bond measure to help pay for new subsidized apartments and project homekey a state funded initiative to buy and convert commercial properties into homeless housing but in a city with finite resources pete white of la can sees the scales tipping toward temporary shelters and sweeping unhoused people off the streets rather than investing in permanent solutions the rush to reach the 60 threshold he says and the embrace of tiny homes is about enforcement more than compassion it s all criminalization when you peel the onion back a little bit he says people staying in tiny home villages give mixed reviews while many are grateful for privacy meals and a roof over their heads they also say that the cramped quarters and 24 7 security gets old quickly a typical stay according to craft of hope of the valley ranges from four to 12 months because of the lack of permanent affordable housing in and around la i ve been homeless for a long time says steve mason 58 who moved into a village in north hollywood about a month ago while it s been a welcome relief in the short term he says it s my time to trade one of these gorgeous tiny homes to someone else less fortunate than me and move on

diligent stewardship of taxpayer dollars is a fundamental responsibility for anyone in public service from the president of the united states and speaker of the house of representatives to the financial manager at a local base or contracting office generally speaking it takes 10 15 households to generate 100 000 in taxes this money should be spent wisely therefore direction for the use of federal resources to confront and overcome the nation s challenges and priorities is a serious duty of any national decision maker we often see these responsibilities and duties come in second to political ambitions or even well meaning but misguided attempts to serve an alternative goal this wobbliness of focus tends to happen in particular when developing and debating supplemental spending supplementals can be large and move quickly since by their nature they are meant to support emergencies this can lead to mischief adding things that don t belong and that are not subject to scrutiny as the bills skip steps like hearings committee markups and normal review processes the current ukraine supplemental is an exception united states president joe biden speaks in the roosevelt room of the white house april 28 2022 biden will ask congress to provide 33 billion for military economic and humanitarian aid to ukraine as well as the power to seize and sell the assets of wealthy russians samuel corum pool via cnp instarimages cover images the ukraine supplemental request itself at 33 billion was focused on ukraine related expenses did not sneak in a myriad of other priorities and was accompanied by proposals to allow the capture of russian resources to assist ukraine close reading reveals that the house supplemental bill on the request is also worded to provide support specific for federal government incremental expenses related to ukraine it contains no major tangential adds or policy riders but it does contain numerous reporting requirements and funding restrictions to facilitate oversight during house floor debate where mischief often takes place on supplemental bills approved amendments to increase the requested amount by 7 billion actually largely adhere to the purpose of the bill and in the case of the defense department provide for real military utility for example the house added funds to further replenish us stocks of equipment provided to ukraine accelerate missile production expand domestic capacity of strategic and critical minerals and procure critical munitions use of the 500 million provided for critical munitions would first require a 60 day congressional notification on the execution plan for the purchases the bill appropriates funds to dod for ukraine security assistance and increased assistance to allies one could argue these resources should be provided to and managed by the state department but they are focused on ukraine and confronting russian aggression in the region the bill includes authority for dod to transfer over 9 billion to other accounts that would remain available until the end of the next fiscal year this is critical in addressing any lost equipment and allows for execution beyond the current fiscal year this could be especially important in the event congress does not pass regular annual appropriations before the start of the fiscal year this fall even the 364 million in defense research and development requested which can prompt skepticism in an emergency supplemental seems reasonable given the explanations pointing to the need for unmanned vehicle modifications export control systems and other cyber and intelligence capabilities specific to supporting ukraine as to oversight dod funding in the bill comes with a number of required reports including some with aggressive timelines for example within 30 days the secretary of defense in coordination with the secretary of state is required to provide a written report describing us security assistance provided to ukraine since the february 24 2022 russian invasion including a comprehensive list of the defense articles and services provided to ukraine within 45 days the secretary of defense again in coordination with the secretary of state must provide a report on us accounting for and end use monitoring of defense articles designated for ukraine since the invasion one can usually find tangential and unrelated funding in domestic agency supplemental appropriations but in this case the bill provides funds for humanitarian aid refugee assistance and resettlement medical support food and energy security investigation seizure and forfeiture of assets related to russian aggression and economic and foreign aid all activities that are part of us assistance and response to ukraine requirements as with the funds provided to defense these resources come with reporting requirements and restrictions the bill does include one anomalous general provision that provides 174 000 seemingly unrelated to ukraine but otherwise is pretty clean by supplemental standards one can debate us foreign policy priorities laid next to domestic challenges the importance of supporting ukraine the estimated costs of doing so and the need to find offsets from less immediate and responsive federal priorities as part of fundamental stewardship duties but it is tough to find a lack of transparency oversight or diffusion of stated purpose in the current ukraine supplemental

james s brady press briefing room 2 11 p m edt ms jean pierre good afternoon everybody sorry we re starting a little late we had to finish for the president to complete his remarks and that was a request that we got from whca so we wanted to make sure we adhered to it as you all know national security advisor jake sullivan is here he s going to take your questions preview asia and he has a hard out at 2 30 so we re going to try and get him out of here okay all yours mr sullivan and i have 20 minutes of remarks so laughter i hope you guys will bear with me i actually do have a number of things to get through because we have quite a stretch ahead here with respect to the president s foreign policy and national security priorities very good to be back with you guys today today finland and sweden submitted their applications for nato membership president biden has welcomed those applications and he looks forward to working with nato allies and with congress on a swift accession process audio playback of press briefing interrupts oh sorry q it s all happening again laughter q i m sorry mr sullivan not a problem q we got the audio mr sullivan small interruption of the accession process right there but everything will be on track just fine laughter tomorrow morning the president will welcome the president of finland and the prime minister of sweden to the white house to coordinate on the path forward and the three leaders will also have the chance to compare notes on our united efforts to support ukraine in its defense against russia s brutal invasion they will also have the opportunity to speak to the press and the public to affirm our shared vision for a peaceful and secure euro atlantic region this is a historic event a watershed moment in european security two nations with a long tradition of neutrality will be joining the world s most powerful defensive alliance and they will bring with them strong capabilities and a proven track record as security partners and president biden will have the opportunity to mark just what a historic and watershed moment this is when he meets with them tomorrow after that meeting concludes president biden will board air force one for a trip to the republic of korea and japan this will be his first trip as president to the indo pacific and it comes at a pivotal moment president biden has rallied the free world in defense of ukraine and in opposition to russian aggression he remains focused on ensuring that our efforts in those missions are successful but he also intends to seize this moment this pivotal moment to assert bold and confident american leadership in another vital region of the world the indo pacific that began last week with his hosting of the u s asean summit here at the white house where he welcomed nine leaders from southeast asia for a substantive set of meetings that covered a diverse agenda from economics and security to technology and energy president biden made a series of significant announcements to show that when it comes to engagement with asean we re not just talking the talk we re walking the walk as well this week the president turns his attention to northeast asia and on this trip he ll have the opportunity to reaffirm and reinforce two vital security alliances to deepen two vibrant economic partnerships to work with two fellow democracies to shape the rules of the road for the 21st century and to thank his allies in korea and japan for their remarkable and in some ways unexpected contributions to the effort to support ukraine and to hold russia accountable in korea president biden will meet with the newly inaug excuse me the newly inaugurated korean president president yoon who campaigned on the platform of strengthening the u s rok alliance and on improving relations between the rok and japan president biden will engage with technology and manufacturing leaders in korea who are mobilizing billions of dollars in investment here in the united states to create thousands of good paying american jobs he will see american and korean troops standing shoulder to shoulder in defense of our collective security and consult on the challenge posed by the dprk s nuclear and missile programs and he will highlight the truly global nature of the u s rok alliance from climate and energy and technology to economic growth and investment in japan president biden will meet with prime minister kishida and his team and we believe that the u s japan alliance at this moment under these two leaders is at an all time high this visit can take us even higher the two leaders will consult on the broad and deep economic relationship between our two countries as well as on a range of regional and global security issues we ll also cover the dprk as well as a number of other security issues both in the indo pacific and more broadly around the world the u s japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace and stability in the indo pacific and japan s contributions as a security partner are rightly growing as the regional security picture becomes more challenging and dynamic president biden and prime minister kishida will also be able to compare notes on the g7 agenda as the g7 summit approaches next month in germany in japan president biden won t just have a bilateral program he ll also have the opportunity to participate in the second in person quad summit following on the summit he hosted here in washington last september he will do this alongside the prime minister of japan the prime minister of india and the prime minister of australia and we believe that this summit will demonstrate both in substance and in vision that democracies can deliver and that these four nations working together will defend and uphold the principles of a free and open indo pacific while he s in tokyo president biden will also launch a new ambitious economic initiative for the region the indo pacific economic framework ipef as we affectionately call it is a 21st century economic arrangement a new model designed to tackle new economic challenges from setting the rules of the digital economy to ensuring secure and resilient supply chains to managing the energy transition to investing in clean modern high standards infrastructure president biden will be joined in person by the prime minister of japan for the launch of ipef and virtually by leaders from a number of indo pacific partners from down under to southeast asia to northeast asia on security and economics on technology and energy on investment in infrastructure we think this trip is going to put on full display president biden s indo pacific strategy and that it will show in living color that the united states can at once lead the free world in responding to russia s war in ukraine and at the same time chart a course for effective principled american leadership and engagement in a region that will define much of the future of the 21st century and with that i d be happy to take your questions yeah q thanks so much can you talk to us about turkey and what the administration is doing and what conversations you might be having with turkey about their plans to block finland and sweden s applications is there a deal to be struck with turkey mr sullivan we re confident that at the end of the day finland and sweden will have an effective and efficient accession process that turkey s concerns can be addressed finland and sweden are working directly with turkey to do this but we re also talking to the turks to try to help facilitate i spoke with my counterpart today secretary blinken is meeting with his counterpart perhaps as we speak in new york and we feel very good about where this will track to and president biden will express that confidence as we believe the president of finland and prime minister of sweden will express that confidence tomorrow yeah q the korean media is reporting that president biden will meet with former president moon jae in during his visit to seoul is that accurate mr sullivan we don t have a meeting scheduled with president moon at this time q have there been any discussions between u s officials and korean officials about moon jae in potentially taking on a special envoy to north korea like role mr sullivan i m not familiar with any discussions along those lines yeah q in the statement today welcoming finland and sweden s application to nato at the very or almost at the very end it said that while their applications for nato membership are being considered the will work with finland and sweden to remain vigilant against any threats to our shared security and deter and confront aggression does that mean that the u s is extending like the nato security umbrella to them while their applications are in process mr sullivan article 5 only kicks in once all 30 allies have ratified the accession protocols and they become full fledged members of the alliance but the united states is prepared to send a very clear message as are all of our european allies that we will not tolerate any aggression against finland or sweden during this process and there are practical measures that we can take along those lines that secretary austin will coordinate with his counterparts in both finland and sweden yeah q jake two questions one on the accession and one on your trip so when the initial nato expansion happened of course there was a huge debate in washington about whether it was a good idea or not i remember kennan himself wrote in the new york times that he wasn t in favor of it was there any similar debate that went underway here about whether or not bringing finland and sweden in was a good idea or whether it would further corner putin and on the trip tell us a little bit about what you know on the evidence that north korea may attempt either a nuclear test hard to imagine what they would accomplish by a seventh test but the seventh test or a missile launch and what your preparations are if that happens during the trip mr sullivan on the first question president biden posed the question to his national security team to his cabinet principals who cover national security as to whether they supported the accession of finland and sweden and for them to consider the risks as well as the benefits of bringing finland and sweden into the alliance unanimously president biden s national security team emphatically supported the entry of finland and sweden into the nato alliance on the grounds that they have already proven themselves as highly capable security partners in the parlance we say net security contributors meaning they give a heck of a lot more than they take when it comes to a security partnership or an alliance and that we believe that russian aggression has only reinforced the argument for the kind of defensive alliance that that nato presents and poses and finally we have the principle of the open door and the open door says that if countries meet the criteria of nato membership and display that they can be net contributors to the alliance and to overall european security they should be admitted that is a principle that president biden has believed since long before he occupied the oval office and finland and sweden are two cases that are pretty clear cut when it comes to meeting those terms with respect to the issue of north korea we ve said from this podium we ve said at the state department and we ve indicated in quite clear terms that our intelligence does reflect the genuine possibility that there will be either a further missile tests including a long range missile test or a nuclear test or frankly both in the days leading into on or after the president s trip to the region we are preparing for all contingencies including the possibility that such a provocation would occur while we are in korea or in japan we are coordinating closely with our allies in both korea and japan on this we have spoken with counterparts in china i met i spoke with my chinese counterpart this morning and covered this issue of the dprk and we are prepared obviously to make both short and longer term adjustments to our military posture as necessary to ensure that we are providing both defense and deterrence to our allies in the region and that we re responding to any north korean provocation yes q jake thank you two questions on different topics one could you update us on the situation with the russian blockade on grains and also on haiti what happens with the title 42 with the haitian migrants and maybe migrants of south america as well in the caribbean when it comes to the end of title 42 on may 23rd if that happens mr sullivan so first it is russia s war of aggression against ukraine and nothing else that is stopping tens of millions of tons of food from getting out of the breadbasket of europe ukraine and onto the world market to feed people in africa the americas asia and everywhere else and that is true in two critical respects first russia is bombarding odessa which is the port from which that food departs on large cargo ships bound through the black sea and then on to the world market second russian ships are engaged in an effective blockade of commercial ship traffic that would could leave odessa port were not under this bombardment and head out to the world so we have publicly called upon russia to end its attacks on odessa and to end the blockade and to permit the traffic the commercial and humanitarian traffic of ships into and out of odessa port we are working closely with both ukraine and the united nations on this issue as well as other allies and partners and we are supporting efforts to facilitate the delivery of that grain to the world market so that it can alleviate food prices everywhere and we would like to see an outcome in which the facts not just the rhetoric the facts bear out the actual permission by russia of large numbers of ships moving through the black sea and onto the world market q is russia responding to that request and also the question i asked you about title 42 mr sullivan there are ongoing intensive diplomatic conversations the united nations secretary general is involved in this the ukrainians are involved in this some of our other partners are involved in this i m not going to get ahead of those discussions i m only going to say that the united states stands ready in any way to help facilitate and deliver on that diplomacy to try to produce an outcome in which food is getting to the world stage with respect to haiti we will have to see obviously there are a number of issues bound up in the courts right now but with the end of title 42 the united states has put in place a process by which those individuals who claim asylum and have legitimate asylum claims can stay and those who come and don t will go through the process the legal process that exists and has existed for some time even when title 42 was in effect large numbers of individuals were not subject to title 42 they were subject to the standard legal process by which we deal with claims at our border for people who want to come and stay here q jake on ukraine again u s intelligence chiefs recently offered assessments that putin continues to bank on the fracturing of western resilience to continue this war is turkey s concern about finland and sweden joining up perhaps an example of that and what about the i guess also congressional pushback or the growing congressional pushback to ukrainian aid what are you guys doing sort of in both regards to make sure that that doesn t continue to happen i know you ve described some of it but it does seem now that there are examples of these growing concern or criticism resistance and then i got one other on another part of the world mr sullivan so first growing congressional pushback to me is a strange premise for a circumstance in which the house of representatives voted overwhelmingly not just in favor of approving what the president sent up which was 33 billion but actually adding 7 billion to it to make a 40 billion package and we expect a similar overwhelming bipartisan vote in the senate once the final procedural hurdle hurdles are cleared over the next 24 to 48 hours so there are some voices against this but the chorus of voices on both sides of the aisle from all sides of the political spectrum in favor of standing up in defense of ukraine s sovereignty and freedom and independence it s quite powerful and frankly in a way quite moving and it sends a clear message to the world that the united states can pull together behind the brave people of ukraine in their hour of need what was your other question q well just turkey s continued concern here and whether there might be others who are going to raise concern about nato expansion mr sullivan look the great thing about the free world about the western alliance about nato is that you ve got a raucous collection of states that all have opinions that all have perspectives that all have interests but they also know how to and when to pull together and how to settle any differences and i expect these differences will be settled i expect that nato will speak with one voice in support of finland and sweden at the end of the day and i think the remarkable unity you ve seen with respect to sanctions coming out of the eu the united states and our indo pacific partners the support that we have provided ukraine in terms of military and humanitarian assistance it s only grown stronger over the course of the last 12 weeks and we expect that that momentum will continue and it s having a major impact on the battlefield ukraine won the battle of kyiv ukraine has now beaten russia back from kharkiv and ukrainian defenders are putting the military assistance we provided to good use in defending territory in the donbas as well yes q just a little bit about the challenges of trying to focus on the indo pacific a priority for you all to get go given just i mean look a bulk of the questions even here today have focused on other parts of the world tomorrow finland and sweden are going just the juxtaposition of what is going on in the world right now as you all are trying to focus inaudible mr sullivan and you know it s interesting we actually don t regard this as a tension between investing time energy and attention in europe and time energy and attention in the indo pacific we regard this as mutually reinforcing first look at the indo pacific partners that have stepped up to help make these sanctions and export controls as effective as they are korea japan australia even singapore second look at the extent to which european countries are increasingly invested in the indo pacific in helping ensure that our vision of a free and open indo pacific is actually realized we see that with the aukus partnership where you ve got the united kingdom alongside australia and the united states we see it with the way the european union has for the first time ever put out an indo pacific strategy and so actually we think that there is something quite evocative about going from meeting with the president of finland and the prime minister of sweden to reinforce the momentum behind the nato alliance and the free world s response in ukraine and getting on a plane and flying out to the indo pacific not just to deal with security issues but to unveil a new far reaching economic initiative to host a quad summit that will cover climate and cyber and emerging technologies and to deal with korea and japan on issues that actually affect working people here in the united states including major investments that will create jobs in states across the country so for us there is a certain level of integration and a symbiosis in the strategy we are pursuing in europe and the strategy we re pursuing in the indo pacific and president biden s unique capacity to actually stitch those two together is i think going to be a hallmark of his foreign policy presidency q jake mr sullivan yes q jake can you provide an update on when the president will visit israel and secondly can you elaborate further on the specific security guarantees that the united states has made finland and sweden in the interim period mr sullivan so first on israel we are actively working with the israelis to fix a date for the visit at some point in the not too distant future the president is very much looking to go but unfortunately i don t have an announcement of a trip or a timetable for it standing here today other than to say the president is excited to get the opportunity to go to reaffirm the strength of the u s israel relationship with respect to the specifics on security commitments or assurances or actions that we will take with finland and sweden those are ongoing conversations that are happening at an operational and technical level between our department of defense and their ministries of defense and also with other nato allies and partners and so i ll leave it in those channels for now only to say that the u s stands ready to ensure that deterrence and defense for finland and sweden will be there should they need it even though they don t get the full benefits of the article 5 alliance until the accession process is properly complete as is required frankly under our constitution where we need to get advice and consent from the senate for that treaty yes ms jean piere last question q regarding the trip to what extent is the message on this trip going to be like a cautionary tale delivered to china to say look what happened in ukraine look how we ve responded don t do anything similar is that going to be part of the messaging during the president s trip mr sullivan the message we re trying to send on this trip is a message of an affirmative vision of what the world can look like if the democracies and open societies of the world stand together to shape the rules of the road to define the security architecture of the region to reinforce strong powerful historic alliances and we think putting that on display over four days bilaterally with the rok and japan through the quad through the indo pacific economic framework it will send a powerful message we think that message will be heard everywhere we think it will be heard in beijing but it is not a negative message and it s not targeted at any one country it s targeted at an audience the world over about what american leadership working flanked by allies and like minded partners can deliver for people everywhere and we think we go into this trip very much with the wind at our back with a strong case to make that we have what it takes to be able to deliver against the security and economic challenges of our time and president biden will head into the indo pacific with a spring in his step and we re very much looking forward to this visit q will the president visit the dmz jake will the president visit the dmz mr sullivan you can ask karine laughter ms jean pierre he will not visit the dmz q he will not ms jean pierre he will not he will not q why not why not visit the dmz ms jean pierre just not on this trip he will not he will go to south korea as you know they will have an agenda to talk about a lot of things including north korea but he s not going to the dmz and just to just to reiterate here is that as vice president he has been there before but on this trip q but now he s president and his predecessor went ms jean pierre he s just not q former president obama went ms jean pierre but he s just not going to go on this trip he s going to go to south korea he s going to show his support for the region and but he s not going to go to south korea on this trip i m sorry the dmz on this trip okay we all love jake thank you so much for your patience and i have one topper and then we ll get to it okay the senate took an important step today with the bipartisan agreement announced by chair tester and ranking member moran to advance their vision of the hon of the honoring our promise to address comprehensive toxics act of 2022 president biden has championed legislation to deliver the benefits and healthcare services that veterans impacted by toxic exposures have earned this historic comprehensive bill will do just that the pact will not only help deliver more timely access to benefits and services for veterans and their survivors it will also ensure that the department of veterans affairs can act more nimbly to add future presumptive conditions when the evidence warrants and the legislation will help the va provide our veterans the level of service they deserve president biden believes that we have a sacred obligation to support veterans their families caregivers and survivors that s why as part of this first state of the of his first state of the union address he identified supporting veterans as a key pillar of his unity agenda and an issue that can unite the country republicans and democrats passing the pact act would be a welcome and long awaited achievement for the veterans who have served us well darlene you have the floor q thanks thank you i wanted to ask jake this question but i ll ask you it s about the quad summit and there is a possibility that saturday s election in australia will not produce a winner in time for someone to go to tokyo to participate in the quad summit so what contingencies are there will the one meeting go ahead if australia cannot participate ms jean pierre i believe that the quad meeting will go ahead i don t have any more specifics than that about the you know how that s going to affect any further deeper but from what i understand and even jake said this that there s going to be a quad summit it s going to happen we can we can talk more about the specifics of what will you know what it will look like with australia q and then the first lady s office informed us that ashley biden the president s daughter is positive for covid can you tell us when was the last time the president tested negative is he testing today in preparation for travel ms jean pierre yep so the president tests regularly throughout the week as part of a cadence determined by his doctor as we ve as we ve communicated the president is not a close contact with ashley it s been several days that they last he and the first lady last saw ashley i think about a week is what i ve been told if his testing were to change because of a close contact we d let all of you know but his cadence has not changed i don t have when he last tested q and then one final question on the church attack in california over the weekend we haven t seen the president comment on that at all is he concerned that what happened there could somehow destabilize relations between taiwan and china does he have any plans to call or reach out to taiwan or china or anything like that ms jean pierre so i don t have any calls to preview of calls with chinese and taiwan as it relates to this particular case our thoughts are with all those affected by gun violence including the incidents the other incidents that at that happened this weekend in houston in milwaukee in chicago and as we know in buffalo federal law enforcement is supporting as needed and the white house has been in touch with local leaders these shootings and of course the one in buffalo as the president and the first lady went to offer went to grieve with the community yesterday as all of you know are a sad reminder of how important it is to redouble our eff our fight against gun violence and violent crime and as part of the president s comprehensive strategy to fight gun crime we re putting more cops on the beat as you ve heard us say this past year and a half as we re talked about a gun comprehensive approach here cracking down on firearms trafficking investing through the art and community programs to prevent crime but i don t have any more to share on any calls that may have had occurred okay i m going to go to people who haven t asked a question go ahead ashley q thank you two questions following up on darlene on ashley biden having covid she s in good company in this white house in that the vice president had it the second gentleman had it you had it jen psaki had it twice a number of top cabinet officials had it a number of other aides in the west wing and no one so far that i can remember has been deemed a close contact of the president why are none of these people close contacts of the president and his sister actually including family members and also are there steps that the president is taking beyond the cdc guidelines that you could lay out are meetings in the oval being kept ms jean pierre yeah q under 15 minutes is everyone masked ms jean pierre well i m glad to be said i was in good company appreciate that but so it is we take extra precautions to your last question i ll answer that first here at the white house and we ve said this before when we re in a meeting i was in a meeting with the president earlier today i got tested first i put my mask on and we socially distanced those are the extra protocols that we do take with the president and all the principals not just him just to make sure that we just take that extra added step there look you know the close contact is as it s deemed by cdc and he hasn t seen ashley in several days and it s also there s a time component to how long that person was in the room we all wear masks so yeah i mean the way we if he if he is if there was a close contact or he s a close contact of someone we would let you know q and on guns yesterday when he was leaving buffalo the president said i ve got to convince the congress that we should go back to what i passed years ago i just want to confirm that he was referring to the 1994 assault weapons ban and my question is you know when he was the point person for president obama after sandy hook manchin toomey which went far less far than an assault weapons ban failed what makes him think that he could get that through when so far no meaningful legislation has gone through in the past decade ms jean pierre i mean look this is what the president said yesterday right he understands it s not going to be easy but he knows that there s more to do you know our country is facing an epidemic that is very real as we have seen this past weekend as gun violence is costing lives every single day and so you know when he was in buffalo we saw examples of that he talked to the family talked to them in a very personal way and this is a top priority for the president as it s been throughout his career as you just mentioned he mentioned his own legislation that he passed look the president continues to urge congress to act to pass universal background checks to keep guns out of the wrong hands and to renew a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines to keep weapons off our streets it s not going to be easy he understands that but he s going to continue to work very hard to make that happen but i do want to add ashley is that this administration has done more on gun violence reform via executive action than any other president in its first year in their administration so that is the his commitment and what he s what he s done just this year and a half go ahead q thanks karine jake mentioned his conversation with his chinese counterpart this morning the readout you guys gave was pretty sparse and so i was wondering if you can give any more details of that conversation and particularly sort of an update on how the white house has seen china s actions towards russia in light of ukraine i know that ms jean pierre i i don t have any more to read out outside of what you what was put out by us earlier today i m just going to keep it to that readout and and you know jake has spoken to this before about china and their relationship with russia we haven t seen any evidence of any like material that has been provided to russia that continues to be the case i don t have any more to add on that q i wanted to ask about a pair of bills on capitol hill right now ms jean pierre sure q both being forwarded by house democrats one is a consumer fuel price gauging gouging prevention act and the other is this domestic terrorism legislation i haven t seen statements of administration policy on either and i m wondering how supportive the president is particularly on the domestic terrorism legislation he kind of on the tarmac yesterday he seemed to say that he didn t think it was necessary ms jean pierre so on the the price the gas price gouging legislation that you just mentioned look the president welcomes all ideas to protect consumers and to make sure that oil companies aren t taking advantage of putin s war and are competing fairly he s been very clear on that president biden has been also very clear that no company should be engaging in unfair practices to hike prices on american consumers as the president has said president putin s actions are what is driving the price increase at the pump the president is focused on doing everything in his power to address the putin price hike including the largest ever release from the strategic petroleum reserve as we ve talked about here at this podium and working around the clock diplo to diplomatically build a coalition of countries for the largest release in foreign reserves ever we know that there are a number of ideas being suggested by our allies and in congress and look forward to engaging on this issue so we can get americans some relief especially as we re in this particular time right now with high prices q and then one last on the dow it s down 1 100 points so far today chairman powell did an interview with the wall street journal in which he said he d push forward on additional rate hikes even if it resulted in unemployment coming up also presumably baked into that is that the stock market we ve seen the stock market do poorly as the fed hikes rates so you know do you still i guess stand behind chairman powell s vision on rate hikes and broadly you guys have said that you re not following day to day market tribulations but we re now getting to a point where some of the gains that defined the president s tenure are being erased and so is there a new level of alarm within the white house about the stock market ms jean pierre well as you know and we say this all the time josh you know it s justin the fed chair you know the federal reserve is independent we leave them to make their own policy decisions we do not get involved in that and nothing has changed on how we see the stock market we do not that s not something that we keep an eye on every day and so i don t i m not going to comment about that from here i do want to touch base on the domestic terrorism and what the president said yesterday about the about domestic terrorism look it s a it s a growing and evolving threat and one that the biden administration has taken very seriously since our first day in office we have said we have been studying the details of different proposals and there are a range of ideas that have been proposed in congress that could improve our ability to detect and respond to these threats what the president was specifically referring to yesterday when he was on the tarmac was the set of existing laws on the on the books that provide law enforcement with authorities to investigate and prosecute domestic terrorism and hold those who commit hate filled attacks accountable as part of our national strategy for countering domestic terrorism we increased our support for federal state and local law enforcement as they address domestic terrorism nationwide including increasing resources and providing traines trainings to thousands of law enforcement entities doj has made domestic terrorism related investigation and prosecution a top priority at the national and local level and plus dog doj earlier this year announced the creation of a new domestic terrorism unit with the counterterrorism section sec section of the national security division that will enforce the expertise and experience on these issues available to federal prosecutors nationwide so there is a commitment there and that s what he was talking about go ahead go ahead q we re about three weeks away from the summit of the americas you got chris dodd down in mexico today ms jean pierre yeah q trying to convince president lópez obrador to come what s the president s level of optimism that mexico will attend this summit of the americas and well is the guest list finalized has the president decided who to invite ms jean pierre the guest list is not finalized hopefully that will happen soon and i promise once we have it we will share it you know the president is optimistic you know we don t have anything to share at this moment again once we have it we ll be happy to share it with all of you go ahead q thanks karine dhs said today that they ll be pausing the disinformation governance board did the white house play a role at all in perhaps expressing frustration on how it was rolled out or expressed any involvement in how it whether or not it should be paused and then also some experts have said that it was sort of set up to fail the way it was rolled out do you have a response to that ms jean pierre so the board has never convened it so that s it never convened and the board is yes the board is pausing in the sense that it will not convene while former secretary chertoff and former deputy ag gorelick do their assessment but the department s work across several administrations to address disinformation that threatens the security of our country is critical and that will indeed continue and again neither nina jankowicz nor the board have anything to do with the censorship or with removing content from anywhere their role is to ensure that national security officials are updated on how misinformation is affecting the trea the threat the threat environment she has strong credentials and a history of calling out misinformation from both the left and the right and that s and that s our focus q so did the white house did the white house play a role at all in whether it should be paused or what should happen with with the board ms jean pierre no first of all like i said this this is what s happening there is a pause we did not have an involvement in this at all q and just another quick question congressman schrader who received a rare endorsement from the president in a democratic primary is on track to lose what does that say about the power of the president s endorsement ms jean pierre i mean look i as it comes to you know i have to be careful about what i can say here laughs but we you know the race in oregon was focused on just how much each candidate support the president supported the president that s what we saw in this particular race his his counterpart in the race mcleod skinner ran on a an agenda of president biden s priorities including lowering the price of prescription drugs and tackling climate change and the fossil fuel pledge her support for president biden extends back to 2020 election when she said he s the guy he knows how to choose a great team on the campaign trail mcleod skinner has sought to tie herself to president biden and paused and praised his presidency even on day one president biden endorsed representative schrader mcleod skinner wrote i respect biden s work to tackle covid 19 and rebuild our economy in february mcleod skinner praised president biden s effort at diplomacy around the situation in ukraine mcleod praised president biden s plan to lower health and care costs eldercare costs childcare costs and prescription drug costs as a transform formative transformative investment in the future of oregon s families so that s how we see it we think it s both both sides were very much supportive of the president q thank you karine just to follow up though i mean the question is this both of them had similar platforms to your point ms jean pierre yep q and yet president biden endorsed one of them and that candidate is on track to lose so are there concerns within the president and i know you can t speak to politics of this is the president concerned ms jean pierre not at all q that he doesn t have enough juice heading into these critical midterms ms jean pierre no not at all because again both candidates were running on a platform that supported embraced the president s pla the president s agenda q has the president reached out to any of the democratic winners overnight particularly john fetterman who is still in the hospital cheri beasley ms jean pierre i don t have any calls to read out but i do believe the one thing that i can say here is that he spoke last night the president did speak to gisele fetterman and wished the governor wished the lieutenant governor a speedy recovery q okay and the president said of fetterman s win and of the republicans who were still locked in a pretty tight battle in pennsylvania hoever emerges will be too dangerous too craven and too extreme to represent pennsylvania and the united states do the democrats run the risk of underestimating the republican senate nominee in pennsylvania ms jean pierre look q and gubernatorial nominee ms jean pierre you know the president remains really focused on delivering for the american people and what you see from congressional republicans and what you see from the gop is the plan for american people is to raise taxes to in the middle class to sunset social security and medicare and to take away a woman s right to reproductive healthcare he s going to speak against that he is going to continue to speak for the american public and so he s not going to stay quiet and that and this is something that is incredibly important to make sure that the american people and and what he s doing to for the american people is is you know is made sure that it s it happens right what the what the other side is trying to do is trying to stop us from trying to lower costs for for folks as we as i just laid out q and just very quickly senator raphael warnock is saying that he s coming to the white house to meet with the president today can you talk a little bit about that about student loans and is the president open to increasing the forgiveness rate it seems like he s in the 10 000 range senator warnock wants it to be closer to 50 000 would the president come up ms jean pierre so we meet with members of congress on a variety of issues q is he going to meet with senator warnock today ms jean pierre laughs these are senators who have been leaders on college affordability and sent and student debt the president values their perspective and looks forward to the discussion this afternoon so yes but i don t have more to read on that there s we you know i ve said this a couple of times we don t a decision hasn t been made yet q is there timeline yet for ms jean pierre i don t have a timeline a decision hasn t been made yet yeah q thank you karine a follow up to the disinformation board last week you guys said that you needed this disinformation governance board at dhs to make sure that freedom of speech is protected across the country and that these platforms are not used for forms of disinformation so what changed ms jean pierre look the department of of homeland security they began their statement report repeating that the board had been intentionally mischaracterized which is a little bit of what you were asking me and they were explicit about what it does and doesn t it does not do it was never about censorship poli policing speech or removing content from anywhere its function was to keep homeland security officials aware of how bad actors including human smugglers transnational criminal organization and foreign adversaries could use disinformation to advance their goals as secretary mayorkas said he has asked former dhs secretary michael chertoff and former do dag jamie gorelick to lead a thorough review this is the pause that i was talking about and assessment as members of the bipartisan homeland security council advisory council the board will not convene during that period but the department s work across several administrations to address disinformation that threatens the security for our country is critical and will continue so that work is going to continue q so if it s pausing because you think the board was mischaracterized then the disinformation board is being shut down because of disinformation is that what s happening here ms jean pierre look i mean the the board was put forth for a purpose right to make sure that we really did really did address what was happening across the country when it came to disinformation q and it s okay to wait now at 75 days to address ms jean pierre well no it s it s just it s going to pause there s been a mischaracterations from outside outside forces and so now what we re going to do is going to we re going to pause it and we re going to do an assessment but the work does the work doesn t stop we re still going to continue the work the dhs is still going to continue the work q okay there s a bulletin now that dhs is worried if roe v wade is overturned there could be violence against the supreme court building or supreme court justices are these threats from pro abortion activists or anti abortion activists ms jean pierre so look the president is clear on this question he believes the right to peace to peacefully protest in this country is fundamental but he also believes that violence threats and intimidation have no place in political discourse anywhere that is true whether it is in front of a courthouse or in front of a healthcare clinic and that s the thing i feel it seems like to us it is very one sided on what we call out as as intimidation or as violence so we want to make sure we re calling out on on ei on both sides of what is happening and what we re seeing while protests but while protests have been peaceful to date the department of justice has u s marshals providing support to support court marshal and the pres and the president believes congress should pass the legislation to fund increased security for court and judges as soon as possible yesterday in reference to this the department of homeland security said they are committed to protecting americans freedom of speech and other civil rights and civil liberties including the right to peacefully protest dhs is also committed to working with our partners across every level of government and the private sector to share timely information and intelligence prevent all forms of violence and to support law enforcement enforcement efforts to keep our communities safe q and then final question on gas prices americans are now spending 5 000 a year on gasoline that s almost double what they did a year ago where are people supposed to go to get all that extra cash ms jean pierre to get the extra cash to pay for gas q yeah ms jean pierre well i mean one of the things that we ve been very clear about is to do everything in our power to make sure that we lower costs you know it is important we see it the president understands what the american people is are is going through and that s why we re doing everything that we can we ve made multiple announcements in the past several several months of what we re doing whether it s just the strategic petroleum reserve whether it s the ethanol 15 to make sure that that that the american people are not feeling putin s price hike this is where this is coming from sixty to seventy percent of the current price hike that we have seen has come from putin s aggression against ukraine q so the president announces on march 31st that he s got all these steps to lower gas prices and it s still putin s fault seven weeks later ms jean pierre well because what i m saying is since the war since putin s war aggression against ukraine started back in february we did see a spike but before then it had the price the the price per gallon had fallen down about 10 cents or more and then putin started his aggression on ukraine his violent aggression on ukraine against their democracy against their against their sovereignty and we saw about i mean the facts show it went up about 60 to 70 percent so it is putin s tax hike this is what we re talking about q karine q on that same subject q would you come to the back q on inflation q at some point ms jean pierre sure q thank you q the inflation concerns are now rubbing off on quarterly earnings reports for a lot of big companies target for example today says it missed its estimates because of increased costs of transportation in gas that s part of what s driving this at least 1 100 point drop in the dow so far what would you say what does the white house say to investors and everyday americans who are concerned that there s no end in sight to these price hikes ms jean pierre look you know i m not again i m not going to speak to the stock market but you know this is something that is very important to the president when it comes to inflati inflation and making sure that we lower costs for the american people last week we announced new steps with private sector to lower the price of high speed internet for ten tens of millions of americans the president traveled to illinois to announce new actions to give farmers the tools and resources so they need to boost production lower prices and and feed the world the nonpartisan congressional budget office found that the deficit fell by 1 5 trillion this year putting us on track for the fastest deficit reduction in any year on record these actions build on other actions the president has taken to lower costs in recent weeks again you know this is to this is to address putin s price hike at the pump the president as i was saying and allies and partners around the world they came together and he was talking about the strategic petroleum reserve the 1 million barrels of oil per day for the next six months in addition to a to the 60 million barrels of oil from other countries reserve i talked about the e15 gasoline that we have allowed to happen so that it could be sold this summer the president also announced administrative actions to save hundreds of thousands of families hundreds of dollars per month by fixing the affordable care act s family glitch these are the things that we have been working on this president has been working on for the past several months understanding that it is important to lower the cost of the costs for american families and we re going to continue to do that i m going to try and go to the back go ahead you sir q thank you oh sorry q thank you very much thanks a lot karine ms jean pierre oh yeah go ahead laughs go ahead q can you talk a little bit about president biden s long term thinking on ukraine there s a possibility this war could go on for months or years and what is the president s commitment to supplying weapons to ukraine in the long term ms jean pierre well as you know there is a there is a supplemental there is a funding a ukraine funding that s in the senate right now for about 40 billion that we are encouraging the senate to pass and so that is going to be part of helping continuing to help ukraine with material with defense material and humanitarian aid look this is something that s incredibly important to the president but also to our partners and allies that we make sure that ukraine is able to defend their democracy it is important for us as a country as a leader in this in this world to make sure that we re doing everything that we can so that happens what hap what is happening in ukraine defending their democracy defending their territorial integrity defending their sovereignty affects us all so this is something that we are going to continue to be partners with with our allies our partners the jake was talking about the nato alliance and how strong they are how unified how they re speaking in one voice in a in a way that we have not seen in years and so this is something that we need to be continue to be a leader on and that s what he believes and it s important to make sure that we protect our country s democracy q what preparations is the president making if putin escalates after the after finland and sweden join nato ms jean pierre well i m not going to go into hypotheticals we re going to focus on what s happening here and now you know again i think one of the things that we have to remember this is a war that putin started this is a war his aggression his violent very violent war that we have seen the ukraine ukrainians and their government have fought very bravely and we ve seen that with kharkiv we ve seen that what they ve done in kyiv it is remarkable what they have been able to do in fighting back this aggression against their against their country and so that is going to be our focus to make sure that they have everything that they need to be to have a to strengthen their kind of their table when it comes to hopefully having some diplomacy and getting to an end of this war but in the meantime we have to support them q karine ms jean pierre yep okay go ahead jonathan q thank you karine in the wake of the buffalo shooting there been several civil rights groups who have expressed some unhappiness at the lack of outreach from the biden white house and frustration about a lack of progress on hate crimes gun violence and so on i ll just read you one the reverend al sharpton who has visited the white house several times says quote this administration has met less with civil rights and civil liberty groups than previous administrations in a formal substantive way he goes on to say that they even asked for meeting here in the wake of this shooting and quote we ve got no response from the white house can you give an update on this and will there be a meeting with civil rights groups and can you address his frustrations ms jean pierre so i don t have any meetings to read out for you or any meetings scheduled at this time you know we respect the reverend he has been here many times before as you know are you talking about the letter that the that the from gun gun rights groups have written there were about 40 plus that q he says ms jean pierre i think it was in your q yeah that that there s that but ms jean pierre okay q he says civil rights groups have also asked the white house for a meeting inaudible ms jean pierre yeah we ve met with civil rights groups over the last year and a half i don t have any meetings to read out to you at this time look the one thing i do want to say is that you know the president agrees with these groups on the urgency of acting and he applauds the work that they re doing to rally support around the country for a commonsense agenda to fight the epidemic of gun crime he understands that that s one of the reasons he went to buffalo to have that conversation to grieve with the family and he spoke to them in a very personal way there s a couple of things from that letter that i do want to just just talk about a little bit since it was in your publication he agrees that innovative neighborhood based crime prevention programs like community violence intervention need to be at the core of our toolkit to make our common sense safer that s why the president has unlocked existing money within the government to invest in community violence intervention that s why he secured more than more money for that in his 2022 budget and that s why he s calling for a significance increase in funding in his 2023 budget he is calling for a 5 billion investment over 10 years the president also is going to continue to call on congress he talked about this yesterday when he was in buffalo to pass commonsense gun violence legislation that would keep weapons off our streets and keep guns out of the hands of criminals we re working closely with leader schumer and speaker pelosi on this and other issues and will defer to their judgment on legislative mechanics give them space to work on that and to do that and finally on the question of a gun violence coordinator i was asked that yesterday i think i was asked specifically about an office you know ambas we have ambassador susan rice here who is the chair of the domestic policy council as you all know and she is coordinating the president s whole of government approach to reducing gun violence leading a 12 person team that connects violence reduction to broader resources like mental health supports workforce development opportunities and more she has decades of experience coordinating interagency process in the federal government there s no one who is better at bringing stakeholders to the table to drive progress and we know that s so that s important because tackling an issue as complex and gun vi and gun violence requis requires a multidisciplinary approach and we re talking about housing mental health community support all of the things apprenticeship all of the things that are so important in order to deal with this issue i m trying to cross talk by reporters oh my gosh i m trying to call on people i haven t gotten yet q karine ms jean pierre oh we have to go all right guys i m so sorry we have to go but we will we will hopefully i ll see some of you in asia all right q have a good trip ms jean pierre bye q we re all the way back here in siberia you can visit anytime laughter ms jean pierre i know i next time next time i promise i did call somebody back there q thank you 3 08 p m edt

more firings in the first two weeks of may than in any full month since january 2021 while more than half the companies in an internal poll of andreessen horowitz s portfolio say they re pulling back on 2022 hiring f or the past couple of years startup founders got used to the love they received from venture investors who seemed to be climbing over one another to secure deals alas that was so 2021 the lovefest is over it just dried up overnight venture investor dharmesh thakker told forbes it s left many founders in a state of shock said thakker a general partner at battery ventures in menlo park california it s also left many startup employees without jobs so far this month more than 5 400 workers have been let go according to data from layoffs fyi a website that tracks tech employment that s more people in two weeks than were cut in any full month since january 2021 an internal poll of andreessen horowitz s portfolio companies shared with forbes showed that more than half of them are pulling back on 2022 hiring celebrity shout out app cameo which announced it was cutting 87 employees or one quarter of its workforce and consumer products seller thrasio were among the companies that blamed their downsizing on decisions to hire too quickly during better times so was robinhood the asset trading app which said at the end of april it would let go of 340 employees or 9 of its staff record investment created a boom that seemed as if it would go on forever more than 329 billion was poured into u s based startups last year nearly double the then record amount of capital deployed in 2020 according to pitchbook startups are learning the hard way that what goes up too fast often comes down even faster with the world s economy buffeted by russia s unprovoked war in ukraine playing havoc with stock and energy prices the worst inflation since the reagan administration and a worldwide pandemic that doesn t look like it s going away investors have suddenly put the brakes on with money going to startups in the first quarter of 2022 down to 70 7 billion 26 less compared to the previous three months it s unclear whether this is a bump in the road or a washout but market participants told forbes to expect at least a slow summer for vc investment no one knows where the market is anymore says redpoint ventures managing director tomasz tunguz six months ago the recommendation was for every company to try to grow as fast as you can today i think with more companies than not we re being conservative in terms of hiring and burn no one knows where the market is anymore tomasz tunguz redpoint ventures managing director a skittishness has wormed its way into the industry that sentiment is evident among companies in venture firm andreessen horowitz s portfolio a survey of its companies ceos distributed this month in a private social media group found that more than half were pulling back on hiring plans for the rest of 2022 according to a copy viewed by forbes of the 90 respondents 39 43 said they were slowing down hiring five 6 were freezing hiring and two 2 were letting workers go on the flip side only 8 of ceos said they are planning to accelerate hiring the remaining 41 said they would make no changes torben friehe a founder who participated in startup accelerator y combinator this past winter says he halted plans to build out a sales and marketing team for his seed stage startup this year and is instead limiting headcount growth to core engineering hires his 12 person startup wingback which makes tools to help companies price and package their software currently plans to grow to 16 people instead of the 25 it targeted a couple months ago it s a different way of approaching business because you re consciously thinking about strategy now friehe says which dollar should i spend and which dollar should i not spend these things were just not top of mind before because you always wanted to move as quickly as you can hiring freezes and layoffs are a common way for startups to extend runway or the amount of time they can stay in business before running out of cash tunguz says that even companies with the strongest fundamentals are preparing to have at least 12 months of runway startups that haven t yet found a market for their product he predicts will likely have to reduce their team size to a skeleton crew until they begin to generate revenue ullas naik founder of early stage practice streamlined ventures says he s recommending the companies in his portfolio get to 18 months of runway through a combination of hiring slowdowns and creative financing often in the form of venture debt he s encouraging about 10 to 15 of the founders he backs to seek debt financing compared to 5 prior to the market downturn he says mallun yen founder of venture firm operator collective estimates that about three times as many portfolio companies are at least exploring debt options compared with before the downturn most investors who spoke to forbes say the slide in venture capital is here to stay for the foreseeable future but some see an opportunity for early stage companies to ramp hiring back up in the next three to six months after a lull in the immediate term i m actually encouraging all of our portfolio companies to find fantastic talent at bigger companies naik says many growth stage startups he predicts will soon be forced to accept down rounds in which they raise funds at a valuation lower than their previous funding round tech employees are often given stock option grants as part of their pay packages and those who still have jobs would see the value of the options shrink in down rounds there s probably going to be an opportunity in three to six months to poach away some of those people naik says in the survey of andreessen horowitz backed companies 47 of the 58 companies at the seed series a or series b stage said they planned to at least slow down hiring compared to 59 among the 32 respondents at series c or later early stage founders are like kids in candy stores now with the quality of people they can hire thakker says you have proven people from some incredible companies who either don t want to see their netflix or facebook stock go back to what it was three months ago because it might take three years to get there or they re seeing their stock options washed away because their company shouldn t have raised at 2 billion when they had no revenue thakker takes it one step further and predicts that for companies that raised lots of capital before the market dried up there s an opportunity to add headcount at a cheaper price through acquisitions that capital is now your competitive advantage he says it gives you the ability to buy competitors at a deep discount because they weren t smart enough to raise money at streamlined ventures naik says he is halting investments into new companies for at least the next two to three months historically his firm has made about one new investment per month instead of working on new investments we need to spend the time on the existing portfolio to make sure that they have a chance of coming out of this in a stronger position he says this summer is going to be a slow summer for venture investors more from forbes more from forbes best places to retire in 2022 sioux falls and other

reuse planning with the city of concord walks through the concord naval weapons station in august 2019 michael short special to the chronicle 2019 the new developer of the bay area s largest housing development the 13 000 unit reuse of the concord naval weapons station now says the project is not economically feasible and is demanding a series of extensions and financial guarantees to proceed with the plan in an april 27 letter to the agency overseeing the redevelopment of the mothballed naval base developer concord first partners a partnership led by the contra costa county based seeno family says the combination of infrastructure costs community benefits and land use requirements all cause the project to be impracticable from an investment standpoint we have re examined our assumptions over and over we are applying actual construction costs based upon our knowledge of the area the letter states the conclusion is that the project as we have analyzed it in its current form does not work for any responsible development entity advertisement article continues below this ad in the letter concord first partners asks for a 90 day extension of the exclusive negotiating agreement which is set to expire on may 26 in addition the developer wants an extra year in which to get the project approved which would move that date from may 2024 to may 2025 in addition the development partnership led by albert seeno jr discovery builders president louis parsons and well known oakland builder phil tagami is asking the city to guarantee that it will be reimbursed for some third party costs should the city council eventually reject their proposal the reimbursement would only cover pre development work that is used by subsequent developers they are also asking that the development and disposition agreement which outlines what the developer will pay for the land and when it will be transferred by the navy be shifted from the end of the approval process to the beginning advertisement article continues below this ad the dispute comes more than three years after the previous developers lennar and fivepoint walked away from the project after they were unable to come to terms with the contra costa county building trades council that plan had called for 13 000 new homes 2 700 acres of parks and 6 million square feet of commercial and academic space in october the concord city council picked the seeno group over two other builders one of which was brookfield properties among the largest developers in the world so far the concord first partners request has not gone over well with concord city officials a report to the concord city council economic development staff recommends that a one month extension on the exclusive negotiating agreement be granted but that the rest of the request be rejected in particular guaranteeing that the developer be reimbursed for costs accrued during the entitlements engineering architecture transportation studies could leave the city on the hook for millions said guy bjerke concord s director of economic development and base reuse that is asking for long term trouble bjerke said in an interview they are asking for an enforceable right to the property before they will spend any money on the specific plan or the environmental impact report advertisement article continues below this ad we understand they are looking to limit their political and financial risks but we have analyzed it and come to the conclusion that it would not be in the best interest of the local reuse authority in winning city council approval the concord first group signed a project labor agreement with the building trades something lennar had been unwilling to do that allowed it to beat out brookfield properties which is behind mega bay area projects like pier 70 5m and the stonestown galleria redevelopment all of which are in san francisco at the time lennar quit the project it had spent 15 million on its plan and the city had shelled out about 14 million in a statement wednesday afternoon concord first partners said all we re asking for is an agreement that confirms concord first partners as the master developer prior to our making a material financial investment into this opportunity we are ready to invest millions and millions of dollars and to devote multiple years studying and preparing environmental and development plans for this project the group said advertisement article continues below this ad matt regan senior vice president of policy for the business advocacy group bay area council called the disagreement between the developer and the reuse agency one massive mess we are probably getting close to the time when we have to ask the question is the city of concord capable of getting this project done regan said we are at the point where we are on our third developer tens of millions of dollars have been spent and we have made zero progress it s becoming a bit of a laughingstock the lack of progress on the redevelopment is particularly upsetting because the site represents such a phenomenal opportunity he said the east bay desperately needs the jobs and housing we can t afford to stumble along

the jr 15 is little more than an ar 15 that is made a bit smaller for smaller shooters namely kids we all know that teaching gun safety and marksmanship at an early age does a lot to help kids grow up into responsible people when they re around firearms advertisement they re generally far less likely to do something stupid when they find a gun laying around because they know better but for some anti gunners the idea of a firearm designed for children is so vile that they want the company investigated eleven democratic senators are demanding that the federal trade commission launch an investigation into the marketing of guns to children specifically focusing on a company marketing an ar 15 style weapon for kids the letter which will be sent on wednesday continues gun control advocates new strategy of focusing on the marketing of firearms earlier this year families of some of the victims of the 2012 newtown elementary school massacre settled with gunmaker remington for 74 million after arguing the company s marketing had targeted troubled men the ftc has the power to investigate unfair or deceptive marketing the senators led by massachusetts democrat ed markey argue that the marketing of guns to children is inherently unfair even if there is nothing deceptive about a company s advertising they specifically point to a new company wee1 tactical that has started selling a jr 15 which is intended to serve as a kids version of the ar 15 an assault rifle that is the most popular firearm in america for years republicans bankrolled by the nra have put the safety of their campaign donations ahead of the safety of the american people markey told huffpost in a statement thoughts and prayers aren t enough while republicans in congress block common sense gun safety efforts we have to use every tool at our disposal i m calling on the ftc to crack down on dangerous and irresponsible marketing tactics peddling ar 15 style assault rifles to children too young to use the stove much less a firearm advertisement except there s nothing dangerous about marketing a firearm designed for younger shooters nothing at all nor is it unfair in any way after all the gun is exactly what it s described as it s not like this weapon is marketed directly to kids either i mean it s not like they re running commercials on cartoon network for this thing it s also not like kids can save their pennies then walk into the gun store and walk out with one of these it s still a firearm and its marketing is limited to people already interested in firearms it s unlikely the kids are even seeing it that s right the marketing is actually geared toward the parents who coincidentally are the ones who can buy this weapon in the first place what this really is besides an attempt to stifle the second amendment by attacking the marketing is an effort to equate guns with sin think about it we keep sinful things away from children you can t market whiskey to kids or tobacco for kids you simply cannot get away with it and for pretty good reason but firearms aren t the same thing we have a right to keep and bear arms for one thing and parents have a right to purchase firearms sized to fit their children advertisement in fact the jr 15 isn t even overly unique in a lot of ways youth versions of various rifles have been around for ages youth stocks are available for firearms like the ruger 10 22 even which is functionally no different than the jr 15 those have apparently never been an issue so really this is all a pile of male bovine excrement and i really hope the ftc tells the senators to go pound sand
stock image st george news st george a hurricane man is in jail following an early morning fuel theft that reportedly took place at a business in hurricane on tuesday one of several recent gasoline thefts reported by the company officers in hurricane responded to a theft reported by a local business off state route 9 involving fuel that was siphoned from a number of recreational vehicles parked near the business according to charging documents filed with the court officers arrived to learn the business had recently installed security cameras that captured the early morning incident footage that was turned over to police several still shots depicted a man with several tattoos on both arms entering the property and making several trips between the vehicles taking fuel the suspect later was identified as troy scott ringlee 49 of hurricane resident officers responded to the suspect s residence and when asked about the incident ringlee initially denied any involvement in the theft until the officer told the suspect he was caught on surveillance footage captured during the incident the officer said the tattoos from the footage matched his and wrote that ringlee didn t say anything but he nodded in agreement with what i was saying some 15 gallons of fuel valued at roughly 80 was taken from the vehicles the officer also noted the suspect had previous charges involving similar thefts reported at the same location the case was filed in november following an investigation into a report involving 200 gallons of gasoline stolen from the same location in july digital photos captured by multiple security cameras clearly showed a man entering the property with a gas can and from there the suspect was seen siphoning fuel from multiple vehicles as he made the rounds through the property while viewing the images officers noted the suspect had long hair and a full beard and was wearing a short sleeved shirt with a distinctive logo while canvassing the area officers knocked on the door of an rv located in a yard that was not far from where the alleged thefts took place and the man who answered the door matched the suspect in the video he was still wearing the same distinctive shirt that was captured on the security footage the officer told the suspect who was later identified as ringlee that even though the business declined to press any charges following the incident if there were any thefts going forward involving the suspect then he could face possible felony theft charges the suspect denied taking any fuel from the vehicles but according to the report ringlee told the officer he understood the suspect was also advised that he was trespassed from the property less than a month later officers responded to the same business in hurricane to follow up with the owner who reported that over the past few months there had been several instances where fuel was missing from a number of vehicles the suspect believed to be responsible had been captured on the company s security footage that showed a man entering the property wearing a baseball cap dark jeans boots and a light colored shirt with the sleeves cut off the suspect in the footage also had several tattoos that were clearly visible that matched ringlee s tattoos and when officers responded to the suspect s home in hurricane they advised ringlee that there were security cameras covering the property that showed a suspect matching his description siphoning gasoline from several vehicles during two separate trips in august ringlee denied taking any fuel and said he hadn t entered the property when authorities informed ringlee that the suspect in the footage shared the same tattoos the report states the suspect said he had nothing to do with the thefts the suspect was later charged with one misdemeanor count each of theft and trespassing and was convicted of the charges in january on jan 4 ringlee was arrested and charged with felony burglary after a homeowner

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video some moms looking for baby formula are dealing with another layer of stress people asking why they don t just breastfeed as morgan fabry drives around chicago looking for baby formula that is in short supply she can t help but be bothered by comments from people who don t understand why she can t breastfeed exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first six months of life by major medical entities like the world health organization giving rise to the saying breast is best but breastfeeding doesn t work for everyone and that mantra is only adding to the stress fabry and other parents feel as the shortage drags on the bottom line is fed is best said fabry 34 i m getting triggered by people who say oh just breastfeed at the center of the shortage is the largest domestic manufacturing plant in michigan which the u s government is working to reopen the biden administration is also allowing more imports from other countries corryn chini avoided the baby formula aisle during her grocery shopping trip in dayton ohio this week with enough formula in her cupboard at home for a week or two there was no sense in letting the empty shelves trigger feelings of anxiety and guilt for chini the guilt comes from lingering feelings of failure after she was unable to exclusively breastfeed starting with her first baby in 2018 breastfeeding was a huge struggle and i felt an immense amount of guilt around not succeeding chini said in the end i was never able to produce enough and we had a late diagnosis of tongue tie and it was a mess when i had my second i thought i can do this i can advocate for myself and again it just didn t work her youngest evangeline was born three months ago chini is supplementing with formula there are various barriers to breastfeeding including medical issues for the baby or mom and work and living conditions dr lori feldman winter chair of the american academy of pediatrics breastfeeding group said exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months is recommended and safe for most babies but meeting the recommendations can be very challenging infants with an uncommon condition called classic galactosemia are unable to metabolize sugar in breast milk and need to be fed formula feldman winter said some medical conditions make it difficult for women to breastfeed and it isn t recommended for those with hiv or undergoing cancer treatment and exclusive breastfeeding is difficult for working women who have to pump repeatedly throughout the day there s even greater barriers in underserved areas women working for hourly wages in low paying jobs those women tend to have even fewer supports to be able to continue to breastfeed stress releases a hormone that makes it difficult to produce milk she said millions of babies in the u s rely on formula which is the only source of nutrition recommended for infants who aren t exclusively breastfed shortages have forced some parents to switch formulas which doctors say is fine in most cases but two children in memphis tennessee were recently hospitalized due to a switch in formula related to the shortage dr mark corkins of the le bonheur children s hospital told the associated press wednesday the division chief of pediatric gastroenterology at the hospital said the two children who previously required a specific dietary needs formula were admitted earlier this month for dehydration after the parents attempted to switch to a separate formula one child was discharged tuesday while the other remained in the hospital in stable condition the two received iv fluids and supplemental nutrition when isabel ramos gave birth in february she worked hard to try to breastfeed her son believing it would be beneficial for his immune system and enhance the mother child connection she tried pumping and worked with lactation consultants but the infant wouldn t latch onto her breast you feel like a failure because you re not able to give your baby what it needs and what it wants said the first time mom from lawrenceville georgia because of the stigma it took her a while to tell people she wasn t breastfeeding she s struggling with those feelings again because she keeps hearing things from relatives and strangers online like she should try harder to breastfeed because of the formula shortage a lot of men have opinions on it i m sorry are you trying to breastfeed then no leave me alone ana rodney who runs momcares a baltimore organization that provides baby supplies and support to new mothers in the city s black community said the shortage has hit many families there hard formula feeding is typically more common among black women often because they don t get breastfeeding encouragement or support from the white medical community rodney said breastfeeding requires time being able to sit with your baby being able to bond with your baby and working on your milk supply not being able to go back to work she said it s not that easy for some of us even if we want to callie salaymeh s baby hazel was just a couple of weeks old when salaymeh found blood in her diaper and took her to a chicago emergency room the baby had an intolerance to some of the proteins in salaymeh s breastmilk and cutting foods from salaymeh s own diet didn t help hazel had to be switched to a special prescription formula for babies with gastrointestinal conditions the shortage felt like it hit us before it hit the general public salaymeh said when her pharmacy called to say the prescription formula was out of stock when they had just one can left salaymeh began mixing the prescription formula with an over the counter formula for babies with sensitive tummies until more of the prescription formula could be found they mixed formulas for about three weeks hoping little hazel wouldn t get sick luckily hazel seemed to do fine with the mix and salaymeh hopes she might soon outgrow the food intolerance as most babies eventually do before her twins arrived five weeks early alexandra clark of sawyer michigan decided she would breastfeed and supplement with formula working full time as owner of a detroit chocolate company clark knew she d be facing enough new mom challenges without trying to produce enough milk for two babies clark 34 said she s grateful for support even from friends with a breast is best mindset instead of feeling judgment some of my really breastfeeding advocate friends who are still lactating have offered to pump for me if i need it which is pretty much the kindest thing ever clark said ___
