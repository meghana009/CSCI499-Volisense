and weight loss myths there is a lot of misconception on weight loss which is also why people fail to lose weight even when they are using legit supplements exipure has changed the perception of these myths but for those who do not know these myths still require a detailed answer some of these myths are as follows number one weight loss and carbs people believe they will lose weight when they cut carbs from the diet the truth is that carbs provide the energy that is used to run the body functions and cutting healthy carbs is never a good idea alternatively what you can do is boost metabolism such as offered by exipure ingredients so that the body maintains a healthy weight without restricting its diet number two calorie counting most people count calories then focus on what they eat and expect weight loss which is wrong you can never lose weight if you are not eating healthy and even if junk food fits into your daily calories the weight loss will have its own side effects a better idea is to make adjustments in the metabolism and lose weight naturally such as with exipure diet pills number three fat intake cutting fat from the diet does not ensure weight loss because just like other dietary sources fat is also necessary it is just that you should opt for healthy fat sources so that the body does not have to compromise on energy a balanced diet with exipure pills may help the body lose all unnecessary weight within a few weeks exipure frequently asked questions is there a risk of acquiring exipure side effects the company explicitly mentions that this supplement only includes natural ingredients taken from high quality vendors moreover no chemicals have been added to its core composition hence the possibility of encountering any exipure side effects or complications is unlikely can everyone use exipure everyone above the age of 18 can safely consume exipure pills if they are not allergic to any of its ingredients and do not suffer from any

it helps you save money moreover you may need to take this supplement for 3 to 6 months to experience full benefits so ordering in bulk can be helpful what if i do not like exipure for customers who are not satisfied with the exipure results there is a money back guarantee according to this policy you can return your bottles and get the money back within six months of order placement to place

japan s prime minister and ruling liberal democratic party ldp leader fumio kishida centre attends a news conference at the party s headquarters in tokyo on monday afp photo tokyo japan s prime minister fumio kishida declared victory on monday after his ruling coalition won a strong majority in national elections vowing to boost the virus hit economy and take a leading role in asia s push towards carbon neutrality kishida a soft spoken centrist who has been in office for a month said he would set out plans for a pandemic spending package this month in a bid to revive the world s third largest economy before heading to the cop26 summit his first international engagement as prime minister kishida said he was committed to climate targets set by his predecessor yoshihide suga we will not only stand firm on our 2050 carbon neutral goal but also take a leading role in working towards zero emissions in asia he said the long ruling liberal democratic party ldp and its junior coalition partner komeito won 293 of the 465 seats in parliament s lower house local media reported while the official result was finalised the coalition had previously held 305 seats low approval ratings for kishida and a more cohesive opposition had posed challenges for the ruling bloc but the result was better for the coalition than exit polls had predicted it was a very tough election but the people s will that they want us to create this country s future under the stable ldp komeito government and the kishida administration was shown the prime minister said investors cheered the results with the benchmark nikkei stock index closing up 2 6 per cent kishida took office after suga resigned just a year into the job partly due to public discontent over his response to the covid 19 crisis large scale stimulus japan has recorded about 18 000 virus deaths a comparatively low toll for its population of 126 million and has never imposed a blanket lockdown but many businesses especially bars and restaurants have suffered through prolonged periods of restrictions on commercial activity kishida said he would improve the health system s capacity to treat covid patients and start booster shots from december he also promised to deliver a large scale economic stimulus as soon as possible this year without specifying how big it would be the 64 year old has outlined plans to tackle inequality heightened by the pro business policies of suga and shinzo abe japan s longest serving prime minister the ldp has also pledged to increase defence spending to counter threats from china and north korea what do we really need in order to protect people s lives in this changing landscape kishida said on monday adding that the sum of a budget should not come first tokyo residents told afp they were surprised by the election s outcome i had thought the ldp would lose more seats but more people actually supported it than i expected said kimio okada a 72 year old retiree and michiko kitamura 73 said she did not know why people voted for the ruling party which has been in power almost continuously since the 1950s i have the impression that the ldp has not been working for the country even though it has been in power for such a long time she said newspaper editorials urged kishida to act decisively to shore up public support ahead of a key upper house vote next summer he needs to fully prepare for a possible sixth wave of virus infections as early as this winter and firm up how his economic ideas will work in practice the asahi shimbun daily said in an editorial in recent decades votes against the ldp have been split between multiple major opposition parties but this time five rival parties boosted cooperation in a bid to dent its stranglehold the yomiuri shimbun daily said the ruling party had been forced to fight tough election battles throughout japan but differences in key policy positions between the two main opposition parties the constitutional democratic party of japan and the japanese communist party especially over the country s relationship with the united states led to their defeat the newspaper said just under 56 per cent of voters cast their ballots a continuation of the low turnout rates that have plagued the country s elections in recent years

the asx climbed 0 6 yesterday boosted by several mergers and acquisitions ausnet services led the way with a 3 6 gain following the announcement that its board and major shareholders had backed a 10 2 billion brookfield takeover bid that will see the aussie company fall under canadian control this is obviously a full price that is very attractive for shareholders and you would expect though if it was to fail at a shareholder vote especially because a large shareholder blocked it it s pretty unlikely you re going to see a transaction like this for the company again anytime in the near future asia pacific chief executive at brookfield asset management tsx bam a stewart mr upson said so if shareholders including state grant had any interest in exiting it on such an attractive basis they need to do it now if they want to do it the canadian asset manager likes ausnet s growth prospects including its more than 11 billion regulated and contracted asset base at a time when energy transition is fast accelerating rba decision looms the rba will meet at 2 30 today half an hour prior to the opening of the gates holding the melbourne cup runners back while it s nearly impossible to choose a winner in the race we can predict with far more certainty that the rba will keep interest rates on hold despite rising inflation however rates won t be at record lows for as long as expected some analysts are saying rba governor phillip lowe will today officially announce the end of the covid economic crisis the record low 0 1 cash rate has sent house prices soaring but it also meant interest rates on savings were slashed which meant your bank account was making no money but you could invest for the long term in house prices or try your luck on the stock market which many retail investors and millennials have done as trading apps such as superhero which make investing easy have become more and more popular it is expected that the governor will now announce that the mooted 2024 interest rate rise date will be reconsidered and moved forward nab today released a statement saying rba the main draw today and where last week s de facto abandonment of the 0 1 april 2024 yield curve control target is expected to be formalised in doing so presumably the broad contours of the rba s forecast revisions to be revealed in the statement today prior to publication in friday s would if realised allow for rates lift off potentially occurring somewhat earlier than april 2024 the bank of america has also chimed in the bank will need to recover some credibility over forward guidance as the assertion that rates will remain unchanged until 2024 now looks untenable the lack of communication in stepping back from defence of the apr 24 target has resulted in a disorderly repricing of the policy outlook a full unwind of the yield targeting regime looks more likely this week and the rba may prepare the stage for bond purchases to end or tapered aggressively in february 2022 we see several reasons why the rba might stress patience on normalisation but even modest changes to guidance are likely to be interpreted as a more hawkish rba stance even after the recent extreme repricing while the belly of the rates curve is cheap and the rate hike premium priced in is too aggressive we struggle to see how the rba will re establish credible dovish guidance and we would not fade it here aud outperformance is consistent with changes to g10 1y1y forward differentials we are now looking at 2023 as a potential timeframe for rates to lift however it could happen earlier all eyes will be on the rba ahead of the running of the cup australian indices asx 200 rose 0 64 to 7 370 80 asx24 futures rose 0 2 to 7 360 s p asx small ordinaries rose 0 92 to 3 535 30 all ordinaries rose 0 70

key driver of sales for retailers according to td s latest retail experience index a bi annual survey that tracks purchasing habits particularly when it comes to big ticket items the survey polled around 1 000 americans who made a major purchase in the last year defined as spending 500 or more on a single item it found that 70 of consumers are likely to make a large purchase in the next six months and a third 31 expect to spend more this holiday season than they did last year this anticipated spending creates opportunities for retailers with robust financing programs to capture market share according to the findings one in five 21 consumers said they financed their most recent big purchase and of this group 92 said the retailer s financing program was an important factor in proceeding with the purchase financing options influence purchasing decisions the survey found that financing options are a significant consideration when shopping for a major purchase nearly half 46 of consumers report they are more likely to purchase from retailers who offer a variety of financing options such as installment loans buy now pay later solutions bnpl and store branded credit cards another 78 said the ability to finance affected the amount they were willing to spend financing options are no longer viewed as a perk for shoppers when selecting a retailer for their next big purchase but rather a key differentiator in where they buy these goods says mike rittler head of retail card services at td bank as consumer preferences vary and evolve it s important for retailers to not only offer financing but a variety of options to meet their customers individual needs and ultimately increase repeat business with more options available than ever consumers are taking advantage of both short and long term financing nearly half 47 of consumers said they have a store branded credit card of this group millennials are most likely to carry three or more store cards and most frequently swipe those cards meanwhile 23 have used a point of sale installment loan and 63 of survey respondents said they would be more comfortable using an installment loan from a respected

percentage of large purchases during the past year with electronics and music equipment 43 home appliances 39 furniture 35 and home improvement items 35 as the top spending categories among consumers surveyed pandemic keeps some shoppers online it s well understood among retailers that maintaining a strong online presence is essential and this became even more critical during the pandemic eighty one percent of consumers shifted a portion or all of their shopping online during the pandemic and 32 expect to do more of their shopping online moving forward additionally amid ongoing covid 19 concerns 44 of consumers report trying to minimize their time in stores and about half 52 said they would prefer to use contactless technologies to place and finance purchases rather than speaking with a person the shopping experience is evolving and retailers are tasked with providing their customers with a fully integrated cohesive experience that easily translates from online to store adds rittler many retailers have invested in contactless financing virtual showrooms and robust online customer service to provide the most seamless and safe experience possible across channels getting your website right a retailer s website also plays an important role in the research phase by allowing shoppers to explore products and financing options even if they ultimately purchase in store the survey found that a third 31 of consumers said the retailer s website was the biggest influence in their decision making for their last major purchase this marked the first time the online channel overtook brick and mortar stores as most influential in this question s responses and 41 said they prefer to browse and research products online and then purchase in store to minimize time spent in retail locations with these findings delivery time has become increasingly important as well ninety one percent of consumers say that they re more likely to purchase from a retailer who can deliver

the american institute of cpas sent a letter to congress s tax writing committees asking lawmakers to reconsider the rules around the corporate minimum tax rate that s currently part of the reconciliation bill now under consideration while many of the tax proposals seem to have been dropped by democrats from the build back better act in recent weeks in response to objections from sen joe manchin d virginia and kyrsten sinema d arizona the 15 minimum corporate tax rate remains as a way to help pay for the reduced 1 75 trillion social spending and climate package instead of raising the corporate income tax rate to 28 as the biden administration had earlier proposed democrats have gradually been trimming it down first to 26 5 and now to the 15 minimum tax rate backed by the organization for economic cooperation and development the proposal was reinforced over the weekend when president biden and other g 20 leaders endorsed the 15 global minimum tax rate which was agreed to earlier this year by the oecd and finance ministers from the group of 20 countries as a way to curb corporate tax avoidance and profit shifting see story however the proposal still faces objections from republicans in congress whose approval would probably be needed for the senate to ratify any changes in tax treaties in the meantime the aicpa wants more clarity on the actual provisions democrats are expected to unveil the formal text of the reconciliation bill this week in hopes of a vote in the house on both that and the 1 2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill although manchin expressed lingering objections monday to some of the provisions which may delay a vote in the senate and hold up the vote in the house the corporate profits minimum tax would be a minimum tax based on 15 of adjusted financial statement book income rather than recognized income the aicpa noted in its letter to leaders of the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee the proposed corporate minimum tax would operate much like the corporate alternative minimum tax which was eliminated by the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 requiring corporations to compute their taxes first on taxable income and then again on book income based on adjusted financial statements that include current value of assets and pay the higher of the two the u s capitol in washington d c andrew harrer bloomberg the aicpa argues that imposing taxes according to adjusted financial statement income would take the definition of taxable income out of congress s hands and put it in the hands of industry regulators and others it pointed to some key differences between adjusted financial statement income and taxable income including the idea of materiality the aicpa wants congress to further consider and clarify the rules associated with the senate proposal surrounding implementing a minimum tax on corporate book income as this will likely be complex and have many significant and potentially negative implications public policy taxation goals should not have a role in influencing accounting standards or the resulting financial reporting the aicpa said in its letter independence and objectivity of accounting standards are the backbone of our capital markets system some accountants have also expressed concerns about some of the earlier proposals from democrats in terms of raising taxes on taxpayers who earn more than 400 000 many of which have now been dropped as well those clients that are in the 400 000 to 450 000 range depending upon whether they re joint or single a 2 rate increase is fairly significant especially given some of these other provisions said brent lipschultz a partner in eisneramper s personal wealth group in reaction to earlier proposals from democrats on the house ways and means committee these provisions are essentially additional rate increases because they re eliminating certain deductions and other things the qualified small business stock exclusion would go down for certain people that are in certain income ranges that s a tax increase it seems to me like every provision in this bill is representative of a tax increase for individuals corporate taxes are likely to rise as well under the international agreement the g20 s endorsement of the global minimum rate last weekend is just the starting point as the key topic is set to become the effective global tax rate said rob mander head of international tax services at rsm international perception of equity in the global tax system is crucial for example if multinational companies have an effective tax rate of 15 20 while mid market companies have an effective rate of 25 or more then the system will still be perceived as inequitable he noted that multinational companies are already changing their structures given that the direction of tax policy has been clear for some time given their size and scale multinational companies have the resources to restructure and the oecd reform now ratified also by the g20 is only a bump in the road said mander some of the bigger issues for multinationals will be more difficult due to their dominant market position this will transpire with regard to anti competition laws and community attitudes to their social media dominance for instance he believes tax competition will remain but not as we currently

noted kim olsan senior vice president at fhn financial what the market thought was a path toward higher individual and corporate rates has turned more suspect and brings into question how much additional demand may develop or current inquiry be sustained she said these factors combined to create weakness across most municipal sectors last month despite low yields she said defensive duration

bonds up 1 25 to 2 on the year a curve slope of about 150 basis points will hold enough lure for inquiry stretching past short term bonds to reach hard yield or taxable equivalent yield targets taxable munis were helped by a ust rally earning 0 39 last month and sitting with a near 1 gain for the year she said issuance totaled 12 billion per bloomberg data well off last year s election driven surge but ahead of the yearly pace of 9 7 billion the luster of high yield is coming down and recent fund flows suggest buyers have turned more cautious on the category perhaps realizing credit

will end with a taper announcement some concern remains no matter what the fed is going to need to thread the needle very carefully this week given recent bond market dynamics said john hancock investment management s co chief investment strategists emily roland and matt miskin a flattening yield curve is a problem for the fed as it limits the amount of tightening they can do without inverting the curve a classic harbinger of recessions they said however if the fed stays on the sidelines for too long inflation may get out of hand the latest data showing high inflation lower incomes and continued consumer spending may further complicate the fomc s decision process said robert eisenbeis vice chairman and chief monetary economist at cumberland advisors regardless of the measure used the fed finds itself confronting inflation that at this point is difficult to characterize as transitory he said and transitioning monetary policy is never easy the fed does not sport a stellar record of policy transitions and this week s meeting will be met with some trepidation said daniela mardarovici co head of us multisector fixed income at macquarie asset management federal reserve chair jerome powell is faced with the difficult task especially when observed by markets through a microscope of acknowledging inflation pressures while reassuring markets that the fed will not stifle the demand recovery in its infancy she said recent data suggest the possibility of stagflation grew mardarovici said and while the fed has been historically adept at managing rising inflation it is not well equipped to manage supply side pressures in an era of fragile and woefully unequal economic growth expect an overhaul of the post meeting statement according to morgan stanley research the committee will offer more guidance on inflation they said which will require a substantial rewrite of the statement during his press conference they said powell is likely to continue to stress that liftoff remains far off grant thornton chief economist diane swonk agrees the fomc will have to address the thorny issue of inflation in its statement on policy that could take the form of removing the word transitory while she believes taper will begin with a 15 billion reduction the fed could accelerate the tapering process if necessary to get to liftoff sooner that is looking more probable she said this despite slowing inflation it may not slow fast enough to become insignificant for the public swonk said the reason the fed has a 2 target on inflation is because few struggle to deal with prices moving up too rapidly or falling too quickly when overall inflation is close to 2 if covid becomes a major issue again the economy could take another hit and that would change the fed s thinking she added but despite the high levels of inflation greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate noted much can change in the months ahead economic growth employment financial stability and geopolitical concerns are all variables that will come into play in addition to inflation despite a weak gdp report and slowing labor growth john farawell managing director and head of municipal trading at roosevelt cross said the fed won t delay taper the gdp number unemployment and the slight inversion of the 20 year and 30 year ust bond hints at a not so vibrant economy he said so the taper should occur as scheduled but the fed raising rates soon seems unlikely the question is inflation really transitory also adds to the fed s dilemma two scenarios exist for taper according to ed al hussainy senior interest rate and currency analyst at columbia threadneedle investments the generally expected 15 billion to 20 billion monthly reduction in asset purchases beginning this year and ending by june or a faster taper allowing rate hikes earlier in 2022 under the first possibility the fed would emphasize inflation labor market thresholds for hikes remain high he said if this occurs expect a steeper curve lower front end rate volatility pain concentrated in longer end higher s should the fed hasten taper the statement will emphasize inflation momentum is likely to require a fed response al hussainy said leading to a flatter curve pain concentrated in 2 5 year sector elevated front end rate volatility higher real rates lower bes strong earnings and other data offset the weakness in the employment report said peter cramer senior managing director and head of insurance portfolio management at slc management long real yields and inflation expectations appear to disagree with the signals emanating from the front end of the curve he said 30 year real yields are lower month to date and are now near their all time lows which is historically inconsistent with an imminent taper and while risks of a policy mistake tend to increase as greater hawkishness enters the forecast cramer said not this time despite aggressive hikes getting priced in the fed s 5y 5y which is a calculated level of inflation expectations for a five year period that begins five years from today moved higher his takeaway while tapering remains on track the road to rate hikes remains treacherous

jon quast the motley fool it s tempting to think of all businesses the same way in reality companies create all kinds of business models and different business models are better at creating shareholder value than others and some business models are really out of the box for three unique examples consider riskified nyse rskd 23andme nasdaq me and coinbase global nasdaq coin all three have interesting approaches to their respective industries that give them undeniable long term upside riskified zero downside for its customers let s set the stage here e commerce is still a red hot growth industry according to emarketer global e commerce sales amounted to 4 2 trillion in 2020 but by 2025 global sales could be approaching 7 4 trillion good for a compound annual growth rate cagr of almost 12 the problem for e commerce companies is that some sales are fraudulent to prevent this e commerce companies can decline suspicious charges but they risk denying legitimate purchases hurting their own sales volume in the process enter riskified stage left it says that its machine learning software can increase the amount of purchases that are approved while simultaneously decreasing the amount of fraud that slips through according to the company from november 2020 through january 2021 its top 10 customers decreased costs by 39 and increased revenue 8 just by using riskified it processed just 63 billion in sales volume in 2020 or just 1 5 of the total global e commerce market so you can certainly see the case for growing its business as it gains market share and as the industry continues its impressive growth trajectory the daily money get our latest personal finance stories in your inbox but how can riskified get more customers here s where the uniqueness of its business model really shines it offers its clients its chargeback guarantee with this policy the company promises to increase approval rates and if fraud gets through it assumes the cost in other words there s literally zero downside for riskified s customers that s a hard to beat business model as long as its machine learning is up to the task when riskified s machine learning software makes a mistake the company refunds its customers therefore this expense is listed under cost of revenue meaning we can track the effectiveness of its software simply by measuring improvements to the company s gross margin in the second quarter of 2021 it had a gross profit margin of 60 as opposed to just 53 last year in other words it appears the business model is indeed working making riskified a stock to take very seriously right now 23andme getting paid to build its real business 23andme s mission statement is to help people access understand and benefit from the human genome you re probably familiar with its genetic testing kits these help people find out more about themselves where they come from and whom they re related to therefore genetic testing kits speak to two parts of 23andme s mission statement access and understanding in the first quarter of 2021 revenue was up 23 year over year to 59 million all of this revenue came from testing kits and related subscription services but in my opinion this part of 23andme s business ultimately won t create meaningful shareholder value the true value proposition will come from the third aspect of its mission helping people benefit from the genetic data it has right now 23andme is partnering with pharmaceutical companies like glaxosmithkline to leverage genetic data into effective drugs in this particular case sharing the costs of development could result in a 50 50 split of the profits from a drug to treat cancer which is currently in phase 1 trials but this is bigger than one drug there are currently more than 40 programs underway using 23andme s unrivaled genetic data set if any of those 40 programs result in a breakthrough medical treatment 23andme could enjoy unprecedented growth and it s all made possible because it has genetic data that no one else has and this is what makes the company unique it didn t pay to buy this data set it got paid 59 million in the second quarter by consumers therefore i think it s fair to say that 23andme is getting paid by consumers to build a business with a lot of upside and that should excite investors coinbase global powering a new economy the cryptocurrency industry didn t even exist until 2009 so this is a new economy but it s staggering to think how far it s come according to coinmarketcap com the value of all cryptocurrencies combined is around 2 6 trillion as of this writing and consider that this is just the market capitalizations of the cryptocurrencies there s far more to this space including the cryptocurrency mining hardware ancillary products and services and non fungible tokens nfts and coinbase is looking to power it all everywhere ethereum is a drug and cardano is a cheese if you re confused by crypto you re not alone cryptos are now in 401 k s are they the right investment for your nest egg we could focus on coinbase s recent announcement to launch an nft marketplace or how the company was selected to perform custodial services for facebook s new cryptocurrency project but here i want to discuss something called coinbase cloud which management says is like the cryptocurrency equivalent of amazon s cloud computing business amazon web services aws let s say you have an e commerce business and want to allow payments by cryptocurrency coinbase cloud can both facilitate the transaction and provide a wallet to store the payment or perhaps you want to build a cryptocurrency exchange that competes directly with coinbase yes coinbase cloud could provide everything competitors need to power their own platforms and given the complexity of supporting hundreds of different cryptocurrencies it might make a lot of sense to outsource the infrastructure to coinbase rather than build it from scratch it might sound well unique to provide a cloud service that allows competitors to build a product that rivals your own but this could actually provide coinbase with long term upside if more financial services companies started offering cryptocurrency services then perhaps long term adoption would be pushed further than where it is today moreover coinbase s cryptocurrency exchange relies on unreliable trading volume to generate revenue if it was primarily powering other cryptocurrency exchanges it would mitigate the uncertainty that comes with trading volume and make revenue more sustainable the one for me right now riskified 23andme and coinbase global have all caught my eye with their uniqueness and long term potential however riskified is the one i believe is most worthy for inclusion in your portfolio today coinbase and 23andme need small parts of their business to grow in order to be long term winners in my opinion since that future is less certain i d go with riskified its business model is already showing signs that it s working offer from the motley fool 10 stocks we like better than coinbase global inc when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all

yellowstone county commissioners heard an earful during their monday discussion meeting from community organizations and others eager to give their opinions on privatizing management of metrapark almost to a person the message was slow down get the facts first said rick reed a past president of the metrapark board and one of the officials who traveled with commissioner don jones to visit privately run public arenas the commission is preparing to put out a request for proposals from private companies who want to bid their services to manage metrapark and the events it would host reed told commissioners he was impressed with what he saw at the ford wyoming center in casper wyoming and the way privatizing the facility there had been handled and was working for the city privatizing works he said but he also pointed out that running a facility publicly also works he told commissioners their job was to find the right fit for yellowstone county the commissioners discussion meeting was packed nearly 60 people sat or stood in the board room on the third floor of the stillwater building in attendance were representatives from the metrapark advisory board nile stock show and rodeo 4 h metra employees the chase hawks rough stock rodeo bretz rv marine and the arabian horse association i would love to see a separate third party a neutral party come in and give us their thoughts said charlie loveridge metrapark advisory board president jones stressed that the county was still exploring both options either continuing on as a publicly run organization or bringing in a private company to run the facility we re going down both routes he said the decision to explore privatization originated with jones he visited the arena in casper as well as the public events facility in nampa idaho that s now privately run he said each facility privatizing has increased efficiency and revenue which in turn has lessened the tax burden on residents in the two areas yellowstone county is nearly two years into a master plan process that could dictate a major overhaul for metrapark a master plan for the complex once completed will guide what happens to metrapark and jones sees that as an opportunity to look at various management options for the future including privatization commissioner john ostlund expressed some frustration at the timing of the decision to explore more options given that the county is now so far down the road on the metrapark master plan process this comes as somewhat of surprise to me he said he argued for taking the time to study thoroughly the option to privatize i want it really well vetted he said i want a complete analysis hanging over the meeting was the specter of cascade county s attempt to privatize its arena in great falls which failed a handful of speakers at the meeting referred to the incident currently metrapark is managed by county employees along with an advisory board and the commission one of the first people to address commissioners was jim soumas the secretary treasurer of the teamsters union local 190 which represents the maintenance and work crews at metrapark my paramount concern are these guys he said he wanted to know what would happen to metra employees in the event of a management change noting that many of them had been at metrapark for decades and had an in depth institutional knowledge of the facilities there jones agreed with soumas highlighting the arduous work the metra crews do under sometimes pressure filled conditions they re definitely critical to the organization jones said if we go down this road we re going to make sure they re taken care of brad murphy the general manager of casper s ford wyoming center was also at the meeting and worked to dispel what he described as some of the misconceptions around privatization the city of casper which owns the ford wyoming center still calls the shots for the arena giving direction to murphy s company murphy also explained that the arena s public employees were all offered jobs when it privatized five years ago he said almost everyone stayed the contract with casper dictates that the company that runs the arena doesn t take a profit until the city makes money on events he also pointed out that written into the contract were the agreements the city had with various nonprofits who had used the arena at reduced or no costs prior to it being privatized commissioners took no action monday as it was the county s weekly discussion meeting jones emphasized again to those who had commented that the county is still exploring the issue and that if the proposals they receive don t meet the county s needs they won t move forward if it doesn t work we don t do it jones said

dallas tx united states 11 01 2021 top wire news verizon communications 8 4 billion the newest big investment from warren buffett is telecom stock verizon nyse vz the oracle of omaha and his team acquired nearly 9 billion worth of verizon shares in the first and second quarters of 2021 on one hand there s a good likelihood that verizon will benefit from the rollout of 5g wireless infrastructure though its high growth days are long gone verizon should benefit from increased data consumption as more consumers and businesses upgrade their devices since data is the company s key margin driver the profitability arrow is pointing higher on the other hand the real lure for buffett and his team might be verizon s rock solid 4 8 yield with inflation rising and bond yields still near historic lows a dividend stock like verizon is a smart and safe way to generate income source a new position appeared in the equity portfolio of berkshire hathaway in the third quarter of 2020 the company had acquired 58 million equity shares of verizon communications vz this was the first in a series of transactions over the next few quarters by the end of the first quarter of 2021 when berkshire had stopped acquiring further shares its portfolio contained more than 159 million shares in the telecommunications giant as this holding is worth more than 1 billion and figures in the top 10 holdings with a portfolio weight of 3 it s reasonable to assume that buffet himself had some input in this transaction as it s believed that warren buffett tends to oversee the most significant holdings in berkshire s portfolio while todd combs and ted weschler manage the smaller holdings based upon information provided by buffett himself in the past and this may or may not be true today verizon shares have fallen by 10 since the third quarter of 2020 despite the broad rally in equity markets the stock recently hit its 52 week low and it seems that the position has not worked out well for berkshire hathaway buffett s decision to buy verizon is a bit surprising as he has criticized asset heavy companies in the past as they consume a large amount of capital and tend to generate lower returns for the capital employed buffett has explained in his 2020 letter to the investors the best results occur at companies that require minimal assets to conduct high margin businesses and offer goods or services that will expand their sales volume with only minor needs for additional capital he further adds asset heavy companies however can be good investments indeed we are delighted with our two giants bnsf and bhe in 2011 berkshire s first full year of bnsf ownership the two companies had combined earnings of 4 2 billion in 2020 a tough year for many businesses the pair earned 8 3 billion bnsf and bhe will require major capital expenditures for decades to come the good news is that both are likely to deliver appropriate returns on the incremental investment it s quite possible that buffett may see similarities between verizon and the two berkshire businesses that we discussed above he has remarked in the past how he sees his equity stakes as pieces of whole businesses if buffett wanted to build or acquire a stake in an asset heavy business in the telecommunications sector without wanting to spend tens of billions of dollars fighting for market share and building telecom infrastructure in an industry that he doesn t perfectly understand then buying a stake in a well run telecommunications firm would be the next best thing of course this is pure speculation but there are certain similarities between verizon bnsf and bhe according to gurufocus data the company s weighted average cost of capital is around 3 1 and its return on investment is around 7 8 source source story kisspr com there is no offer to sell no solicitation of an offer to buy and no recommendation of any security or any other product or service in this article moreover nothing contained in this pr should be construed as a recommendation to buy sell or hold any investment or security or to engage in any investment strategy or transaction it is your responsibility to determine whether any investment investment strategy security or related transaction is appropriate for you based on your investment objectives financial circumstances and risk tolerance consult your business advisor attorney or tax advisor regarding your specific business legal or tax situation

by now it is obvious to everyone that the u s has a supply chain problem this is a consequence of the two shocks the pandemic has caused in consumption patterns orders dropped hard at the start on the pandemic when people went into lockdown a second shock came when consumption recovered to a higher than ever levels the higher consumption was not for services as restaurants were often still closed instead the money went into buying things things that are produced elsewhere any lean supply system without reserves and redundancies will break down under such impulses the supply chain has many critical points producers in asia need containers to ship their goods the containers must go to harbors ships must be available as well as loading capacity the harbor at the receiving end must have capacity to unload the containers and to store them trucks must be available as well as container trailers the goods then go to distribution centers where there must be capacity to repack them and to send them out again the empty containers must travel back to their origin to get filled again all these levels need people capable and willing to work if one element of the chain reaches its maximum capacity and clogs up all others will be affected meanwhile demand for goods continues to be strong more goods are still coming in while every element of the system that still had reserves is clogging up too the supply chain from asia to the u s has reached that point other global supply chains are also straining from side effects of the pandemic and may well clog up too one major problem are the u s harbors on the west coast even before the pandemic they were already the least efficient of the world in a review of 351 container ports around the globe los angeles was ranked 328 behind tanzania s dar es salaam and alaska s dutch harbor the adjacent port of long beach came in even lower at 333 behind turkey s nemrut bay and kenya s mombasa the groups said in their inaugural container port performance index published in may the total number of ships waiting to unload outside the two adjacent ports hit a new all time record of 100 on monday americans purchases of imported goods have jumped to levels the u s supply chain infrastructure can t handle causing delivery delays and snarls government control 24 7 operations and automation help make many non u s ports more efficient southern california port executives are coaxing terminal operators importers truckers railroads dock workers and warehouse owners to adopt 24 7 operations in a bid to clear clogs that have backed up dozens of ships offshore and delayed deliveries to stores and e commerce fulfillment centers describing the problems at every level of the u s side of the supply and distribution chain ryan johnson a twenty year truck driver explains why going to 24 7 will not help and why the problems will get worse truck drivers have to sleep at least once a while they also have to make money they get paid by the load not for the time it takes them to load it drive it from a to b and to unload it if there are hours long lines for loading and unloading the work is simply unprofitable so when the coastal ports started getting clogged up last spring due to the impacts of covid on business everywhere drivers started refusing to show up congestion got so bad that instead of being able to do three loads a day they could only do one they took a 2 3 pay cut and most of these drivers were working 12 hours a day or more while carriers were charging increased pandemic shipping rates none of those rate increases went to the driver wages many drivers simply quit however while the pickup rate for containers severely decreased they were still being offloaded from the boats and it s only gotten worse the u s once had a well regulated transport system but that has long been neo liberalized to death the system will not unclog itself because the incentives are set all wrong the people who have an interest in removing the blocks are the fright buyers and sellers but the container owners harbors and distribution centers and freight carriers are now simply increasing their prices for prioritized goods without delivering more capacity they even can ask for penalties from those who have containers stuck in their system they refuse to pay more for their workers and drivers and to hire and qualify additional ones it will take some strong political initiative or a lot of time to rearrange and unclog the current system the political initiative is simply not there the biden administration guy who is responsible for the issues says he can not do anything us transportation secretary pete buttigieg predicted on sunday that supply chain issues plaguing multiple industries at the moment are going to continue as long as the coronavirus pandemic does confronted about the supply chain issues by fox news chris wallace including the fact that standstills at the port of los angeles have only worsened after it began operating on a 24 7 basis buttigieg could only say that businesses should expect relief from the issues when the pandemic ends as the problems are a direct results of the virus strain on the world fundamentally it s up to the producers the shippers and the retailers and we re doing everything we can to help them move those goods across the infrastructure that s often outdated he said buttigieg s can t do attitude will have political consequences the supply chain crisis will continue well into next summer and fall discussing ryan johnson s piece yves smith remarks the severity of the supply chain crisis combined with the near certainty that the only actor that could partially stress partially clear this logjam is the feds they are guaranteed not to do enough even if they understood how the moving parts interconnect so it is now a safe bet that the democrats will suffer a wipeout in the midterms even if biden gets his big bills passed some stimulus and there is no covid surge worsening supply shortfalls particularly of drugs and medical staples will make the bad press of the iran hostage crisis look tame president joe biden s job rating has already sunk to 42 the supply chain crunch will lead to price increases and will have strong inflationary effects the central bankers which have doused the economy with way too much money have yet to understand that the supply chain problem is systemic and will have long term consequences the world s top central bankers acknowledged that inflation which has spiked higher across many advanced economies this year could remain elevated for some time and that though they still expect it to fade as pandemic related supply disruptions calm they are carefully watching to make sure that hot price pressures do not become more permanent jerome h powell the federal reserve chair spoke wednesday on a panel alongside christine lagarde president of the european central bank andrew bailey governor of the bank of england and haruhiko kuroda head of the bank of japan it is frustrating to acknowledge that getting people vaccinated and getting delta under control 18 months later still remains the most important economic policy that we have mr powell said it is also frustrating to see the bottlenecks and supply chain problems not getting better in fact at the margin apparently getting a little bit worse we see that continuing into next year probably and holding inflation up longer than we had thought mr powell said powell and his colleagues still see the inflationary effects as transitory and rejected to act on them but the supply chain crunch will have not only temporary price effects it shows that the u s transport system is too lean and too cheap in its current configuration it needs updated infrastructure better paid people the right incentives and more redundancies all of these will continuously cost more money and have long term inflationary effects in a paywalled financial times piece economist steven roach recently warned of such complacency echoes of an earlier darker period of economic history are growing louder when i warned in early 2020 of a 1970s style stagflation my concerns were primarily on the supply side today a full blown global supply shock is at hand energy and food prices are soaring shipping lanes are clogged and labour shortages prevalent one popular theory is that supply disruptions and price spikes are transitory glitches related to the pandemic that will ultimately self heal the inflationary build up of the early 1970s was also presaged by a focus on transitory events the opec oil embargo and el niño related weather disturbances this has lured into a sequencing trap responding to surprises such as inflation first through a tapering of asset purchases and then by raising the benchmark policy interest rate in baby steps yet aggregate demand is likely to be far less sensitive to central bank balance sheet adjustments than to the real cost of money and monetary policy actions have a long lag time this is particularly worrisome for the fed which has embraced a new average inflation targeting approach designed to delay policy responses to compensate for earlier undershoots of inflation the lessons inflation is unlikely to peak soon what seems transitory now will last longer than we think and it will take far more monetary tightening than financial markets are expecting to avoid stagflation 2 0 roach is not the only one who warns of economic stagnation combined with high inflation in his remarks at last week s g20 summit russia s president vladimir putin made it his major point he emphasized that the necessary changes in monetary policies must be accompanied by social measures last year the economic authorities of the g20 member countries and many other countries decided to significantly increase their budget deficits against the backdrop of the deep crisis caused by the pandemic which allowed for launching global economic recovery however such extraordinary measure accompanied by securities buyouts by central banks should be limited in time in fact this is what was said here earlier excessive stimulation has resulted in the general lack of stability growing prices of financial assets and goods in certain markets such as energy food etc once again significant budget deficits in the developed economies are the main cause of these developments with these deficits persisting there is a risk of high global inflation in the medium term which not only increases the risk of lower business activity but reinforces and exacerbates the inequality that was also mentioned today that is why it is important to prevent aggravating stagflation and instead do what can be done to normalise the budgetary and monetary policies improve the quality of demand management in the economy and update economic priorities and primarily prioritise overcoming inequality and boosting public welfare higher taxes for the top 1 who have profit most during the pandemic can correct the budget deficits the central banks can then stop the securities buyouts that have financed the deficits and doused the rich they can raise the interest rates to starve of inflation before it increases further a part of the additional money the states take in must be distributed to the lower income people who are most affected by the increase of basic prices while that may sound like a reasonable plan one thing is assured it will not be acted on the current lack of government action to fix the supply chain issues shows that things will only change after a total breakdown has happened we ain t there yet but it is by now assured to happen

second quarter accelerated in the third bolstering our confidence that the industry is in the front end of a recovery during the third quarter we grew our operating horsepower after adjusting for non core asset sales drove improved contract compression bookings for the second consecutive quarter and delivered aftermarket services revenue growth said brad childers archrock s president and chief executive officer in addition our contract operations gross margin percentage remains within guidance expectations and above prior cycle lows even in the face of sharp cost inflation in response to higher costs we began taking necessary action to implement price increases during the fourth quarter and expect these to be broad based next year the recent change in energy supply and demand fundamentals and resulting breakout in commodity prices highlight the need for higher industry activity levels and reinforce our expectation for natural gas demand growth as the global energy mix transitions to lower carbon fuels over time all positive news for our compression business although our customers will finalize their budgets early next year our initial discussions with customers indicate that bookings momentum and therefore our participation in the upcycle will continue building into 2022 we ve taken significant measures over the past several years to reposition our fleet for a more efficient and sustainable future our installed base of large digitized and standardized compression horsepower is deployed in stable midstream applications in critical u s basins we expect the steady and modest growth in demand for natural gas compression forecasted ahead will require higher growth capital in 2022 for lower emitting and electric motor drive horsepower as we selectively invest in high profit large midstream compression units required to meet the needs of our customers we will remain steadfast in our commitment to both maintaining a solid balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders concluded childers contract operations for the third quarter of 2021 contract operations segment revenue totaled 158 9 million compared to 175 2 million in the third quarter of

voters in the sprawling coastal city of virginia beach will decide whether to approve one of the larger municipal bonds in the u s that would be used to protect against rising seas and intensifying hurricanes if it passes tuesday the 568 million would fund anything from elevating roads to closing a 100 acre 40 hectare city golf course to collect stormwater if it fails economists say the city could lose billions of dollars in the next half century as recurrent flooding inundates roads businesses and homes the referendum underscores the mounting costs of adapting to climate change for u s cities but it will also be a measure of americans willingness to approve such bonds as more communities seek funding related cop26 biden calls this decade decisive on climate change apologizes for trump s actions i m not confident that it will pass said virginia wasserberg whose virginia beach home was among 1 400 houses and businesses flooded by heavy rains from the remnants of hurricane matthew in 2016 wasserberg 41 is a conservative republican who home schools her children and supports the bond she s campaigned for more flood protections ever since her neighborhood s drainage systems were overwhelmed by weeks of rain that culminated with matthew homes that are miles from the city s beaches on the atlantic ocean and chesapeake bay were inundated for the first time wasserberg said she and her family fled to the second floor and called 911 only to be told that responders couldn t reach them i like to say it took a disaster to wake me up wasserberg said related cop26 crucial climate summit begins in scotland voter approval is far from guaranteed in this city of nearly half a million people which some political observers say can lean libertarian if the bond passes property taxes would rise by 115 to 171 a year for a home of median assessed value city officials say the need for money to protect communities against climate change is growing across the globe particularly in the world s poorest countries it will be an area of discussion at an upcoming un climate change conference which starts sunday in glasgow in the u s 26 of zip codes are highly exposed to floods according to moody s esg solutions which tracks climate risks and sustainable finance as climate change becomes a greater threat more governments will focus on climate adaptation and resilience projects said matt kuchtyak the group s vice president of outreach research several cities have already approved significant bonds for instance miami residents voted in 2017 to fund a 400 million bond nearly half of which would pay for such things as storm drain upgrades and sea walls san francisco voters passed a 425 million bond to pay for the first phase of strengthening a sea wall that protects against earthquakes and rising oceans the same year houston area voters supported 2 5 billion in bonds for flood control projects in the wake of hurricane harvey related biden eu believe deal on steel tariffs will help with climate change bonds could emerge as the principal vehicle for funding said richard wiles executive director of the center for climate integrity which argues that oil companies should cover such costs because of fossil fuels link to climate change none of these cities has hundreds of millions of dollars hanging around wiles said adding that virginia beach has proposed one of the biggest bonds the city could prove to be an interesting testing ground a 2021 telephone survey of 400 residents found that just over half were willing to pay more in taxes for flood protection projects according to a report by old dominion university but half also agreed that people who do not experience flooding on their properties should not have to pay for such projects and yet the land in virginia beach is sinking and the seas are rising at an alarming rate since 1960 sea levels have risen by nearly a foot 0 3 meter and they re likely to rise by 1 5 feet to 3 feet 0 5 to 1 meter over the next half century much of virginia beach sits on low coastal plains water can drain slowly into tidal rivers and tributaries sometimes with nowhere to go during heavy rains and high tides the bond funded projects could help the city avoid up to 8 billion in losses to flooding as well as associated economic impacts in the coming decades according to the old dominion university report the losses are equivalent to about a quarter of virginia beach s gross domestic product or its total output of goods and services as flooding becomes more prevalent insurers will raise premiums refuse coverage and at some point exit virginia beach entirely economics professor robert mcnab said businesses will have more difficulty in moving goods to market and of course residents will have more problems moving around the region john moss a city councilman who s been a large force behind the referendum said virginia beach could still complete the flood protection

the biden administration is calling on congress to pass legislation that would strengthen government regulation of stablecoins a form of cryptocurrency that has soared in popularity in the last year in a 22 page report issued monday the treasury department and several other regulators said the legislation should require that stablecoin issuers become banks which would potentially subject them to a wide range of rules including those requiring that banks hold sufficient cash reserves and implement measures to prevent money laundering and other illicit activities the absence of appropriate oversight presents risks to users and the broader system treasury secretary janet l yellen said current oversight is inconsistent and fragmented with some stablecoins effectively falling outside the regulatory perimeter advertisement the highly anticipated report was prepared by an interagency committee known as the president s working group on financial markets led by the treasury department it also includes the federal reserve the securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission the agencies believe that legislation is urgently needed to comprehensively address the prudential risks posed the report said the working group said that the financial stability oversight council a broader collection of financial regulators responsible for spotting risks to the financial system could coordinate steps to protect investors and oversee stablecoin issuers reserves until congress acts it would force them into the regulatory perimeter which is the thing that most people think is appropriate said howell jackson a financial regulatory expert at harvard law school some of those regulators have already taken a tough line such as sec chair gary gensler who has said stablecoins can be used for money laundering tax avoidance and circumvention of u s financial sanctions stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to a specific value usually the dollar or another currency or gold unlike better known cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin that can fluctuate wildly in price stablecoins are potentially better suited to commercial transactions many holders of bitcoin see it as an investment and won t spend something that could appreciate in value advertisement there are more than 200 stablecoins worth nearly 130 billion a sixfold increase from a year ago they are mostly used on cryptocurrency exchanges to purchase other digital assets such as bitcoin many of those exchanges don t have relationships with banks that would enable traders to use cash but the report noted that the coins could soon be used more widely to purchase goods or send money overseas such as remittances by immigrants which are currently done through expensive wire transfers the explosive growth of stablecoins and the risks they pose to the financial system have quickly concentrated the minds of government officials on what kinds of regulation might be needed large banks have also urged that stablecoins be required to abide by the same rules they do and even some stablecoin issuers have called for clear regulations to bring some order to the industry the primary concern about the coins is that they could be anything but stable should a large number of holders of a particular stablecoin decide to redeem them for dollars they could create the equivalent of a run on the bank stablecoin issuers typically say they hold a dollar in reserve for every coin to facilitate redemptions some issuers say they keep the dollars in cash and short term treasurys which can be quickly converted to cash but some hold their cash reserves in riskier assets the report said including short term business loans known as commercial paper corporate and municipal bonds and even other cryptocurrencies if those assets were to plunge in value as commercial paper did in previous market meltdowns in 2008 and in 2020 that could make it impossible for a stablecoin issuer to maintain its 1 peg that could further fuel panic among investors advertisement the largest stablecoin issuer tether has been fined by both new york state authorities and the cftc for misleading investors by claiming that all its tokens were backed by dollars and other fiat currencies when they were not there are extensive webs of regulations that govern banks securities exchanges and investment funds to protect consumers and avoid market collapses senior treasury officials said that stablecoins were largely falling through gaps in those rules if we re going to have something that looks just like a money market fund or a bank deposit or a narrow bank and it s growing really fast we really ought to have appropriate regulation fed chair jerome h powell said in congressional testimony earlier this year and today we don t some progressive organizations have opposed the call for new legislation because it will be subject to lobbying by well funded companies and trade groups that support the broader use of stablecoins legislation is also likely to take a considerable period of time given the partisan polarization in washington even as stablecoins are growing rapidly the working group s report represents at least a partial victory for circle a company that issues usd coin the second most widely used stablecoin with nearly 33 billion in circulation circle has announced that it is already taking steps to convert itself to a bank we are fully supportive of the call for congress to act and establish federal banking supervision for stablecoin issuance jeremy allaire circle s chief executive said in a statement this is huge progress in the acceptance of stablecoins

for several months this summer 65 year old gary miller underwent chemotherapy to treat a bone marrow cancer called myelodysplastic syndrome we didn t do anything by way of treatment until the blood started showing blast cells he says then came the chemo at home in new jersey under the care of his abramson cancer center care team followed by a stem cell transplant which he had about two weeks ago at the hospital of the university of pennsylvania hup they call it my rebirthday he says this past saturday just a few days before his planned discharge home miller joined 310 patients who crossed a new bridge over civic center boulevard to reach the pavilion a 17 story 1 5 million square foot addition to the hup campus home to penn s new emergency department and inpatient services for an array of complex care it s hard not to reach for superlatives when describing the pavilion at a cost of 1 6 billion it s the biggest capital building project in the university s history it s one of the largest hospital projects in the nation in recognition of its sustainable features it became the largest certified project to achieve leed healthcare v4 gold certification and while the scale of the tangible building project was immense its impact on care today and into the future will be even greater the opening of the pavilion marks the next game changing chapter in penn medicine history says penn president amy gutmann this new facility built by thoughtful design to boldly meet whatever challenges the future brings will undoubtedly transform health care in philadelphia and serve as a model across the world care by design more than six years ago penn medicine staff joined with architects designers engineers and construction managers to form pennfirst an integrated project delivery team that could work through concepts and obstacles together in one office in university city rather than operating in silos a design emerged from the team s coordinated complementary expertise so many details reveal that coordination and thought from the exterior a glossy bronze colored oval shape that ties it to the neighboring historic penn museum and franklin field to the interior divided into onstage patient care areas and offstage staff areas to prioritize the comfort and rest of patients and their families the pennfirst team didn t rely on their training and instincts alone however incorporating rigorous and iterative feedback into the design process late in 2015 they erected a 30 000 square foot mock up made of styrofoam blocks in a warehouse in northern liberties it represented half of one of the pavilion s inpatient floors which at the time was built around a central atrium and included patient rooms of different shapes and configurations hundreds of staff came through to simulate their work some wearing gopro video cameras and to interact with patients played by actors their feedback led to a significant design reimagining as an example recounts university of pennsylvania health system uphs ceo kevin mahoney on a recent pavilion tour when were delivering the food around the circular hallway they were slowing down because they couldn t see around the corners the architects thought the wide hall offered enough space but the gopro footage was undeniable in the new design the building took on a new layout and footprint and patient rooms became uniform in size and orientation anita mcginn natali an advisor on hup s patient and family advisory council for nearly a decade work she was drawn to after caring for her husband as he received treatment for oral cancer also toured the mock up along with other patient and family advisors they noticed the bathroom was on the same side of the room as the patient s head we said that can make it difficult with a patient getting out of bed and needing to get around their equipment to reach the bathroom she says and they changed that 01 07 mcginn natali calls the fact that patient and family advocates could influence the new building s design a revolutionary move while they have long provided feedback on health system initiatives and research this was the first time they d been involved from the outset of a building project much of the time a building s conceptual design and development is accomplished among a small group of core people she says but here they brought that all to the patients and families and staff members among the group s many suggestions and recommendations mcginn natali is particularly gratified by the presence of a family care center where caregivers can find peace and quiet a massage chair a cup of coffee and support staff to listen to concerns penn medicine recognizes that patients families and caregivers are experts in their own right she says the executive leadership has 100 embraced patient and family centered care future proofing though a hospital stay can be stressful for patients and families alike the floor plan and room features offer patients control and comfort striking views dominate and abundant natural light streams into patient rooms which line the building s exterior stephanie maillie a clinical nurse specialist at hup says that alone can improve a patient s experience we have found that windows can be a huge benefit for our patients she says letting them know when it s daytime and when it s nighttime can go a long way toward providing a nonpharmacologic way to treat delirium with a single bedside remote patients in the pavilion can control the lighting and window shades and operate the television the same control can also frost the glass window at the touch of a button offering patients additional privacy from the rest of the hall this separation from the hospital bustle is further supported by a patient server a pass through cabinet that allows hospital staff to stock supplies such as linens and medications without entering the room the set up also improves infection control minimizing the in and out flow of staff patients tend not to get a lot of sleep and rest in a typical hospital environment mcginn natali says with this server people don t have to keep running in and out it s just a fabulous environment each room has a delineated family area with a pull out bed for visitors from a care perspective maillie says the separation will help nurses avoid needing to work around family members or have them feel like they re in the way of care it creates a sense of welcoming to the family knowing they were thought of in the room design she says each of the 504 spacious patient rooms can flex between icu and non icu level care equipping the building to respond in case of a surge in need a valuable asset underscored by some of the most devastating waves of the covid 19 pandemic outside each room a small touchscreen allows nurses and other care providers to easily read pertinent care instructions while inside a 75 inch monitor serves not only as a television but also displays photos and names of care team members triggered by a door sensor that reads a chip in each staff member s badge when they enter plus a schedule of the day s procedures expected discharge date and more services moving to the pavilion include cardiology and cardiac surgery oncology neurology and neurosurgery transplant and hup s new two story emergency department ed the transition frees up space in the original hup building for services remaining there to expand and for all patient rooms to be updated and become singles the new ed which began receiving patients early saturday morning was designed to speed patient triage and reduce wait times it includes an internal waiting room ample exam rooms and four specialized behavioral health rooms designed to keep safe those patients experiencing a mental health emergency the whole space is designed for flexibility and speed of care says kathy gallagher a long time nurse and clinical liaison on the pennfirst team the assessment area is right near the entrance and the x ray machine is close by the ct machine is close by all to be able to quickly respond dress rehearsals with the design elements locked in excavation began on the pavilion in september 2016 two and a half years later alyson cole uphs associate executive director began the monumental task of contemplating how to safely move hundreds of patients and train thousands of employees i ve been part of penn medicine for 16 years and i ve been involved in a number of changes that have happened here cole says many projects end up affecting a handful of departments this really impacted everyone so cole and her team put pen to paper methodically documenting how systems and departments interacted at hup plus what would be novel and different in the new space we started by writing everything down she says that doesn t always happen from there they held virtual meetings with departments pivoting from paper to tabletop those conversations led to the creation of a broad training for anyone who would work in the pavilion called the building orientation and life safety training plus 26 discipline specific customized training plans then the transition team started bringing people into the building 250 training ambassadors showed their colleagues around the massive space introducing them to updated technologies new workflows cole s team also ran three dress rehearsals 90 60 and 14 days prior to opening in each phase the building was a little more complete she explains the first dress rehearsal was just after labor day we were still wearing hard hats the rehearsals included tasks as simple as clocking in and as complex as infection control for cancer patients we borrowed from best practices that were out there cole says it s cooking in a new kitchen but it s so patient focused it s just different we wanted to get everyone used to that to make them comfortable moving day the day before he was set to move to the pavilion gary miller sounded excited i ve heard so many things about it i hear it s beautiful i m fortunate it s going to happen for me on the day of miller was still upbeat he waited patiently for his turn to take the ride across the street bags of his belongings surrounded him in bed in his hand he held a clear ziploc full of chocolates he loves halloween and he d been giving out candy to anyone on rhoads 7 the floor he was about to leave who would take it every few minutes another patient was wheeled by part of a logistical effort coordinated down to the minute just six hours earlier the new ed began seeing patients once the light went on at 7 a m here it had to go off over there says gallagher the pennfirst clinical liaison pointing to the emergency room at hup by 7 05 the first walk in patient had arrived at the ed the team soon handled an obstetrical emergency caring for both a new mom and baby born prematurely before arriving at the hospital all the while transport teams were moving patients floor by floor to their new rooms in the pavilion they moved smoothly through the balloon lined tunnel that crossed civic center blvd by a quartet from the philadelphia orchestra past the maya lin sculpture made of more than 50 000 blown glass orbs and artist odili odita s colorful mural field and sky three people transported miller who was also joined by p j brennan uphs chief medical officer and senior vice president for the walk to the pavilion s 14th floor where miller will stay the next several days what a view this is fantastic amazing miller says when he arrived what a great ride this is quite something he could be talking about the care he s received at penn about which he s equally as emphatic though the final patients of moving day settled in at the pavilion around 4 p m cole s work is far from finished next she and her team must figure out what s working and what s not she calls the first two weeks a stabilization period after which they ll revisit the areas that they anticipated would be potential challenges and new ones that arise we don t see getting in as the end she says it s the start of our overall transition mahoney the uphs ceo is already thinking about future projects like his desire to build a women s health hospital or the next research building for its part the pavilion years in the making is already bustling as thousands of employees work to treat

corvus pharmaceuticals provides business update and reports third quarter 2021 financial results tweet burlingame calif nov 01 2021 globe newswire corvus pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq crvs a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company today provided a business update and reported financial results for the third quarter ended september 30 2021 corvus is a leader in the development of precisely targeted therapies targeting the adenosine pathway this includes mupadolimab our anti cd73 antibody and ciforadenant our small molecule antagonist of the adenosine a2a receptor said richard a miller m d co founder president and chief executive officer of corvus we continue to advance mupadolimab with a focus on non small cell lung cancer nsclc and hpv positive human papilloma virus head and neck cancers hnscc two expansion cohorts in our phase 1b 2 trial are enrolling patients with these tumors and we are evaluating treatment with a combination of mupadolimab and pembrolizumab we believe mupadolimab is well positioned to potentially improve patient outcomes based on its mechanism of inhibiting immunosuppressive adenosine in the tumor microenvironment and by enhancing immune responses to the tumor its novel immune enhancing properties are based on its known b cell stimulating activities which have been observed in our cancer and covid 19 clinical trials we also continue to expand our other oncology programs including with our chinese partner angel pharmaceuticals who recently received an ind approval notice in china to initiate phase 1 1b clinical development of cpi 818 for the treatment of t cell lymphomas 2021 key areas of focus the company is efficiently advancing its clinical programs mupadolimab cpi 818 and ciforadenant along with pre clinical programs in its pipeline the highlights from the company s clinical pipeline include mupadolimab for nsclc and head and neck cancer the company has completed enrollment of patients with nsclc and head and neck cancer in its phase 1 1b clinical trial of mupadolimab monotherapy combination with ciforadenant corvus small molecule inhibitor of the a2a receptor combination with pembrolizumab or triplet combination with ciforadenant and pembrolizumab we anticipate that the results will be presented at the annual meeting of the society of immunotherapy of cancer sitc in november 2021 mupadolimab for hpv oropharyngeal cancer of the head and neck the company is enrolling a phase 1b 2 clinical trial in patients with hpv oropharyngeal cancers that have failed previous treatment with anti pd 1 therapy and chemotherapy up to 15 patients will be enrolled in this clinical trial and will receive mupadolimab in combination with pembrolizumab the endpoint of the clinical trial is response rate and initial results are anticipated in 2022 mupadolimab for nsclc in september 2021 the company began enrolling patients in a phase 1b 2 clinical trial in patients with relapsed refractory nsclc who have failed previous treatment with anti pd l 1 therapy and chemotherapy up to 15 patients will be enrolled in this clinical trial and will receive mupadolimab in combination with pembrolizumab the endpoint of the trial is response rate and results are anticipated to be reported in 2022 mupadolimab for viral associated cancers and viral diseases the company is evaluating mupadolimab in other viral associated tumors such as cancer of the cervix and head and neck cancers caused by epstein barr virus ebv which is a member of the herpes virus family and one of the most common human viruses the company is evaluating partnership opportunities to continue the development of mupadolimab as a therapeutic for the treatment of covid 19 we believe this approach is supported by results from the company s discontinued phase 3 randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical trial of mupadolimab for hospitalized patients with covid 19 which were published in september the primary endpoint of the clinical trial was the proportion of patients progressing to respiratory failure or death during the 28 days after dosing with either mupadolimab 2mg kg 1mg kg or placebo forty patients were enrolled in the clinical trial prior to its voluntary discontinuation in the 2mg kg cohort 93 3 of patients were alive and free from respiratory failure compared to 85 7 in the 1mg kg cohort and 81 1 in the placebo cohort in addition positive trends favoring mupadolimab treatment compared to placebo were seen for all the key secondary endpoints including time to clinical improvement time to sustained clinical improvement and time to hospital discharge due to the number of participants enrolled in the trial before it was discontinued the foregoing results were not sufficiently powered for statistical significance cpi 818 phase 1 1b clinical trial for t cell lymphoma in partnership with angel pharmaceuticals the company s ongoing phase 1 1b trial with cpi 818 has been expanded to enroll patients with certain types of t cell leukemias in addition to t cell lymphomas the company s partner in china angel pharmaceuticals plans to initiate a phase 1 1b clinical trial of cpi 818 for the treatment of refractory t cell lymphomas with the potential to expand into autoimmune diseases over time in october the center for drug evaluation cde of the china national medical products administration nmpa approved angel s ind for cpi 818 and the trial is expected to open by early 2022 angel pharmaceuticals will be responsible for all expenses related to executing the trial in china ciforadenant phase 2 clinical trial for front line rcc in addition to developing mupadolimab for blocking adenosine production the company is developing ciforadenant a small molecule antagonist of the adenosine a2a receptor it is designed to disable a tumor s ability to subvert attack by the immune system by blocking the binding of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment to the a2a receptor the company also discovered the adenosine gene signature which has demonstrated the potential to serve as a biomarker to identify patients most likely to respond to treatment with ciforadenant the company plans to collaborate with the kidney cancer consortium to initiate a phase 2 clinical trial of ciforadenant in first line therapy for metastatic renal cell cancer rcc in combination with pembrolizumab and another approved therapeutic agent for rcc the clinical trial is expected to enroll up to 60 patients and is intended to increase complete responses and deep responses in the front line setting preclinical studies and data from earlier clinical trials with ciforadenant indicate adenosine may be a cause of resistance to current therapies with anti pd l 1 tumor biopsies will be evaluated for expression of the adenosine gene
