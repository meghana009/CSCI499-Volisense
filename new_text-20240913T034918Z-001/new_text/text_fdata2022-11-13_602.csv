back in 2018 target prompted an outcry when it announced plans to shutter two of its south side chicago locations one of them the store at 87th street and cottage grove anchored a retail hub in the heart of the chatham community for a decade and employed over 150 people thanks to our sponsors view all sponsors three years later the 100 000 square foot building got a new lease on life when riverwoods based discover financial services announced its intention to transform the former store into a call center that would employ 1 000 people mostly from the surrounding neighborhood by 2024 the ambitious plan included a community center a technology hub partnerships to offer free tuition and provisions for contracting with chatham s small service businesses in the 11 years juatise gathings has worked for discover financial services she has managed call centers across the country her role as regional operations director of the discover customer care center in chatham is something of a homecoming for gathings who spent some of her childhood living in chicago for me well before being a discover employee i was a girl from the south side first she said but it s also something of a departure since the dense urban chatham has little in common with discover s other call centers all of which are in suburban office parks where the workforces are majority white there is this ecosystem a family and connectedness unlike we have in any other location because we do have a focus on neighborhoods and communities and our employees grow up and live in these neighborhoods we re proud that almost 90 of our employees live within five miles of the center gathings said we ve been operating for a little over a year we have well over 150 employees that have been promoted and some of them have been promoted multiple times since starting here ceo roger hochschild says when discover began making plans in 2019 to open their first new call center in over 20 years the company took a fresh look at their approach call centers are critically important for us at discover we re the only major bank with 100 u s based customer service we picked chatham because we wanted to do what we could to bring opportunity to communities that have been under invested hochschild said i strongly believe that something that large companies can do and only large companies can do is bring jobs at scale into the community close to 90 of our employees here in the center are black and so as part of our focus around diversity and equity and inclusion and changing the racial makeup of discover this center is critically important to that said hochschild now with about 500 employees in place after a year and half in operation hochschild says the data shows their community focused approach is paying off the attrition rate is less than half of what we see in our other centers there s a faster speed to proficiency this is our best performing call center and i couldn t be more excited about that he said greater chatham initiative executive director nedra sims fears says the community was indeed disappointed by target s departure but discover s presence has exceeded her expectations she says their results a year in show it makes good business sense to bank on chatham we have good housing stock that s affordable we have good schools we have good transportation we have an able and willing workforce and we have good retail said sims fears what else do you want employees at the chatham center say working close to home in jobs with growth opportunity is paying dividends for them team leader katherine bland was among the first to join the chatham center when she applied after seeing a billboard advertising openings she said she did her remote interview with her infant son on her lap i was really really fortunate that this was available for me said bland it s been kind of like a dream come true because i could be a mom a really really great mom and i can come to work and be in corporate america essentially team leader aaron curtis says cutting his commute from more than an hour each way to just 10 minutes has meant more time with his children before i wasn t basically able to be in my family s life at all really i wasn t responsible for dropping my daughter off at daycare or picking her up because i wasn t able to curtis said with the hours i have now i can pick her up and my son i can see him every day now chaka smith recently transitioned from a call center position to technical apprentice and credits discover with allowing her the opportunity to pursue a new path in the business technology group everything i need to know to work in the call center they trained me to do it smith said everything i need to know now about doing my job as a technical apprentice they re training me to do it to be able to wake up and have a financially stable career with a great company and i only got to go three minutes it s almost life changing in addition to drawing from the community for its workforce discover scaled their service needs to allow them to contract with small local businesses like chatham based rb pest services myself and the other businesses we just want the opportunity said rb pest solutions owner robiar smith we don t want any handouts we don t want anyone to give us anything pro bono we just want you to point us in the right direction and we ll pull up our sleeves and we ll show you that we re capable of doing work on this magnitude and even bigger the chatham center also features a community center which local nonprofits can use at no cost for meetings and events the rotating selection of art filling the space comes from i paint my mind which curates art from local artists for businesses they re getting this incredible art in their space so they get value and that incredible service from us said evan laruffa i paint my mind executive director but also knowing that that helps i paint my mind deliver much needed and often underfunded arts programs to local schools is way more than the cherry on top for us discover leadership says this model of community investment as a business decision has created a new blueprint for future endeavors that s what allows us to translate that into good business for us to make sure that thrive and through that they take really good care of our customers in return said gathings it s really transformed us as a company i like to say we actually get more out of this than the people of chatham said hochschild i think the business results speak for themselves again as i said this is our top performing call center and so we are committed to chatham for the long term and one year in the employees we spoke with say they re all in on discover too so often bigger companies are scared to come into communities like this right they re scared that they won t get the right talent or just they won t be successful said bland i think discover said well we re going to take that chance it s a lot of untapped talent and communities just like this but you don t know about it until you re actually doing it and that s what discover did said curtis and smith encourages other companies to emulate discover s approach why not bank of america why not chase what s up american express jump on board discover s got the right idea and the numbers are showing it it s the right idea smith said i can t wait to see like a year from now how it s changed the community and the people within it thanks to our sponsors view all sponsors
germany is not going through the best patch currently with germans protesting against their government for its lack of action regarding inflation in the country as germany experiences a cost of living crisis thousands of germans march through berlin demanding that food prices be controlled and that the wealthy pay higher taxes social media thousands took to the streets in berlin on saturday to protest rising food prices calling for the cooling of the red hot expenses and for the rich to face higher taxes in light of the ongoing cost of living crisis in germany the protestors had many demands to ask from the government in berlin and with many banners raised during the protests one of them demanding the redistribution of wealth through the word redistribute l the protests took place after several left wing organizations called on their supporters to take to the streets and demand action from the government to mitigate the rising food and rent prices the police as well as organizers said at least 3 000 people attended the protest in criticism of the economic system that puts profits over people s needs as another banner put it the popular demonstration came at a time when inflation in germany is at its highest level in more than 70 years reaching 10 4 in october figures released on friday said price hikes are affecting households and corporations in europe s largest economy as the government forecasts a 0 4 contraction in gdp next year amid aspirations in berlin to mitigate the rising energy prices like by imposing a partial cap on the prices of gas and electricity which will come into force in 2023 meanwhile most of the other mitigating measures including subsidized rail travel have already ended in a similar vein as the aforementioned protestors german economic experts proposed on wednesday that berlin raise taxes on higher earners as a means of helping households that are struggling with the continuously rising energy prices the suggestion was immediately dismissed by the country s finance ministers this comes just a week after german federal network agency head klaus müller said that though germany has decent stockpiles of gas the winter can be quite the long one for the country we have stored a lot of gas but the winter can last a long time müller said on twitter to avoid a gas shortage we must save gas set up lng terminals and secure our infrastructure german president frank walter steinmeier said a week earlier that german citizens would need to learn to be modest and accept the sacrifices and losses they are going through during the current crisis it is clear that over the coming years we will need to accept that sacrifices must be made most have already felt the effects we all must contribute to whatever we can this crisis demands that we relearn to be modest the president said addressing the country over the ukraine crisis and the challenges it has triggered for the german people meanwhile alternative for germany party afd co chair tino chrupalla underlined that germany won t be europe s gas hub for the sale of hydrocarbons instead it will have to purchase russian fossil fuels from other countries including turkey this comes despite germany announcing in mid october that its gas reserves have been filled up to 95 faster than anticipated the biggest economy in europe was largely reliant on russian gas and scrambled to increase its supplies before winter after exports from russia were stopped following the start of the war in ukraine storage levels today surpassed an average level of 95 percent the economy ministry said in a statement that shows that regulation is having an effect and supply is strengthened for the coming winter berlin set a number of objectives in july to ensure that gas stocks would be 95 full by november economy minister robert habeck referred to his country filling its gas stockpiles as an important milestone he said government measures had managed to regulate a market that was largely unregulated in the past decades so that we could fill the storage facilities faster than expected despite the halt in deliveries via the nord stream 1 pipeline from russia the administration said that recent energy saving initiatives and sizable gas purchases from other providers had resulted in important advancements berlin has also implemented policies that permit the use of more coal based energy and lower energy consumption in public structures additionally it has invested 1 50 billion euros 1 46 billion in the purchase of liquefied natural gas from qatar and the united states two of its key suppliers five new lng terminals are also being developed for the purpose of importing lng by sea
i prefer to stay out of politics those were elon musk s words when the tech exec was forced to respond to a claim by texas governor greg abbott that he supported the state s anti abortion laws if so mr musk has a funny way of showing it over his decade plus of public fame as the chief executive of tesla spacex and now twitter the south african born tycoon has attacked everyone and everything from donald trump and bernie sanders through individual regulatory officials to covid rules trade unions and pronouns in november the day before the us midterms he urged his 115m twitter followers to vote republicans into congress in order to balance against a democratic presidency and curb worst excesses advertisement advertisement it came after his announcement in june that he had voted republican for the first time ever in a special congressional election in texas as well as suggesting that he would support the florida s gop governor ron desantis should he run for the white house yet despite these outright shows of support mr musk still claims to be an independent who is willing to vote for either party when the occasion demands it the 51 year old tech entrepreneur has donated often to both democrats and republicans while variously declaring himself a moderate a socialist and socially liberal and fiscally conservative when he bought twitter for 44bn in october he declared that it must be a politically neutral space where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner advertisement advertisement so what does elon musk really believe and given that he is both the world s richest person and the owner of one of the world s largest social networks what does that mean for the rest of us embracing the republican party let s start with mr musk s recent support for the us republican party which has been clear and unambiguous in the past i voted democrat because they were mostly the kindness party but they have become the party of division and hate so i can no longer support them and will vote republican he said in may in the past i voted democrat because they were mostly the kindness party but they have become the party of division hate so i can no longer support them and will vote republican now watch their dirty tricks campaign against me unfold elon musk elonmusk may 18 2022 it came after months of criticism of us president joe biden such as hammering his flagship infrastructure and social spending bills for granting unnecessary subsidies to the electric car industry and increasing the insane federal budget deficit mr musk later called the president a damp sock puppet in human form advertisement advertisement in june mr musk went further revealing he had voted for republican congressional candidate maya flores in a special election the first time he claimed that he had ever cast a vote for the gop i voted for mayra flores first time i ever voted republican massive red wave in 2022 elon musk elonmusk june 15 2022 massive red wave in 2022 mr musk tweeted though it was unclear if he meant this as a prediction or a rallying cry responding later mr desantis joked about the south african born billionaire s comments i m focused on 2022 but with elon musk what i would say is i welcome support from african americans what can i say advertisement advertisement nevertheless mr musk has stopped short of declaring is permanent support for the party as a whole following his tweet about the special election one twitter user asked i assume republican for president mr musk replied what are you leaning towards he was asked in a follow up question desantis he said similarly the mogul s endorsement on the day before the us midterms in november was somewhat qualified to independent minded voters shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties he said therefore i recommend voting for a republican congress given that the presidency is democratic hardcore democrats or republicans never vote for the other side so independent voters are the ones who actually decide who s in charge hardcore democrats or republicans never vote for the other side so independent voters are the ones who actually decide who s in charge elon musk elonmusk november 7 2022 who has elon musk donated money to mr musk s descriptions of his own politics have occasionally been confusing the most consistent theme has been that he is socially liberal and fiscally conservative or even socially very liberal he has claimed to be registered as an independent and said to be clear i am not conservative advertisement advertisement in april he posted a stick figure cartoon on twitter that depicted political moderates including himself standing still on the political spectrum while the left accelerates away into extremism dragging the centre ground away and making moderates appear right wing by comparison in 2018 though he described himself as a utopian anarchist of the kind best described by iain banks referring to the late scottish sci fi author who wrote longingly if sceptically of a space faring anarcho socialist civilisation called the culture which has no money no poverty no wage labour no police no prisons no standing army and nearly infinite abundance of basic goods at another point he claimed to be a socialist but not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive he later said we should not take it too seriously advertisement advertisement instead let s put mr musk s money where his mouth is and look at his political donations according to data gathered by the non profit lobbying watchdog open secrets elon musk has given a total of 1 2m to politicians parties political action committees pacs and referendum campaigns since 2002 that money went almost equally to democrats with 542 000 and republicans with 574 500 with another 85 000 going to two broadly left wing referendum campaigns in california the balance has fluctuated over the years in 2006 2013 and 2017 he donated overwhelmingly to republicans while in 2015 he gave exclusively to democrats he has also given a total of 30 000 to a pac set up by spacex which donated 54 per cent of its total to democrats and 46 per cent to republicans many of the individual politicians he gave to were state legislators in california where tesla was formerly based and texas where spacex has long maintained rocket testing and launch facilities meanwhile spacex itself has spent about 9 7m on lobbyists and tesla has spent 5 5m the former company relies on government contracts for much of its revenue while the latter is subject to plenty of regulation spacex s campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated wrote the sunlight foundation in 2013 advertisement advertisement the way mr musk explains it these donations do not really signal much about his own personal beliefs instead he describes them as simply the cost of doing business in america in order to have your voice be heard in washington you have to make some little contribution he told the huffington post in 2013 but i haven t found washington to be as corrupt as a lot of people think it is meaning it s not as coin operated as some people may assume and i m very actually grateful for that because if it were we would have zero chance socially very liberal musk has sent mixed signals what about mr musk s social views he clearly has a strong libertarian streak favouring direct democracy over representative democracy and proposing that future martian colonies should allow any law to be overturned by a vote of 40 per cent of the citizens advertisement advertisement he has also advocated releasing people imprisoned in the us for cannabis offences before the drug was legalised and indeed partaken in it himself during an interview with podcast host joe rogan direct democracy by the people laws must be short as there is trickery in length automatic expiration of rules to prevent death by bureaucracy any rule can be removed by 40 of people to overcome inertia freedom elon musk elonmusk june 16 2018 selling weed literally went from major felony to essential business open during pandemic in much of america yet many are still in prison doesn t make sense isn t right elon musk elonmusk june 6 2020 mr musk has donated to more individual democratic politicians than to republicans and often praised specific democrats in a way he has rarely done with their opponents way back in 2005 he gave 10 000 to california s proposition 82 a proposal to increase taxes on the rich to pay for universal pre school for four year olds although it did not pass advertisement advertisement when donald trump was a candidate for the republican nomination mr musk said of him i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy he doesn t seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states on the other hand mr musk s statements about social issues have rarely been as vociferous or clear as his economic views indeed he has often sent contrary signals and occasionally seemed to flirt with social conservatism last spring for instance he told followers to take the red pill a phrase used by white supremacists and anti feminists to describe the process of being radicalised into their worldview at the time he was engaged in a crusade against california s covid lockdown policies which he described as fascist he had declared early in the pandemic that the coronavirus panic is dumb and that there virus would be gone from america by the end of april that july he tweeted the statement pronouns suck which was interpreted by many as a dig at transgender people since pronouns themselves are a fundamental and inescapable part of the english language his then girlfriend claire boucher aka the electronic musician grimes certainly read it that way responding i love you but please turn off ur phone or give me a call i cannot support hate please stop this i know this isn t your heart pronouns suck elon musk elonmusk july 25 2020 in december 2020 he tweeted a meme likening cisgender people who state their pronouns on their twitter profiles which is a common way of expressing solidarity with trans people to oppressive redcoats in colonial america he later clarified i absolutely support trans but all these pronouns are an aesthetic nightmare and in september texas governor greg abbott to whom mr musk donated 10 000 in 2014 claimed in a cnbc interview elon had to get out of california because in part of the social policies in california and elon consistently tells me that he likes the social policies in the state of texas mr musk rebuffed him but ambiguously and mildly with nothing like the fire and brimstone he has mustered against trade unions or tax proposals in general i believe government should rarely impose its will upon the people and when doing so should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness he said that said i would prefer to stay out of politics in general i believe government should rarely impose its will upon the people and when doing so should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness that said i would prefer to stay out of politics elon musk elonmusk september 2 2021 pro capitalist and anti union far more consistent has been mr musk s belief in free market capitalism declarations of socialism notwithstanding he is an ardent economic liberal who is deeply skeptical of government interventions in business that was the basis of his attack on mr biden s build back better act on monday saying the bill s tax rebate of up to 12 500 for people who buy electric cars is an unnecessary handout for an industry that is already taking off he backed that up with a revealing philosophical argument about the difference between corporations and nation states framing them as different methods for allocating capital that is money and other resources needed to produce goods and services to useful ends it does not make sense to take the job of capital allocation away from people who have demonstrated great skill in capital allocation he said meaning business leaders and give it to an entity that has demonstrated very poor skill in capital allocation which is the government government is simply the biggest corporation with a monopoly on violence and where you have no recourse so how much money do you want to give that entity you can see this thinking all through mr musk s history he has strongly opposed trade unions especially in his own companies as a barrier to efficient operations and skirmished repeatedly with bernie sanders over his proposals for an income tax on billionaires he claimed in october that mr biden seems to be controlled by unions and in 2018 tweeted that tesla employees who attempted to unionise would lose their stock options which regulators have claimed was illegal when he does endorse government intervention he tends to favour measures that minimise government bureaucracy and avoid officials picking winners rather than subsidies for green industry he wants a carbon tax and says he lobbied the biden administration to create one his argument is that the price of fossil fuels doesn t properly reflect their cost to the environment meaning companies are basing their decisions on false information taxing carbon would correct that balance allowing the free market to figure out in its own way how best to cut their emissions that said none of this stopped him from accepting billions of dollars in government subsidies for both tesla and spacex similarly mr musk has long argued for a universal basic income to support human workers whose jobs he believes will soon be replaced with artificial intelligence ai in some ways that s a pretty left wing idea since it would involve spending enormous amounts of taxpayer money yet it has also been favoured by some conservatives such as richard nixon and free market economists such as milton friedman who felt it would prevent government bureaucrats deciding who deserves benefits and avoid punishing recipients for finding work green power has often been musk s red line another point of real consistency has been global warming and clean energy back in 2006 mr musk gave one of his biggest ever single donations 75 000 to proposition 87 a california referendum campaign to impose a special tax on fossil fuel extractors since then emissions have often been his red line in the early years of donald trump s presidency he joined a white house advisory council saying that the more voices of reason that the president hears the better but when mr trump withdrew the us from the paris climate agreement mr musk quit saying climate change is real leaving paris is not good for america or the world and when mr musk was persuaded to get into bitcoin recently a natural fit given his libertarian outlook and his penchant for technological solutions for political problems to say nothing of his fondness for controversy it was the currency s prodigious carbon emissions that led him to rethink tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using bitcoin he said in may we are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions especially coal which has the worst emissions of any fuel cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future but this cannot come at a great cost to the environment where mr musk has supported mr biden that too was connected to carbon just after the inauguration he told fortune i m super fired up that the new administration is focused on climate i feel very optimistic about the future of sustainable energy with the new administration a technocrat with astral ambitions through all these issues there is one strain of mr musk s politics that does not easily map onto traditional left right devices technocracy back in the 1930s and 40s mr musk s grandfather joshua haldeman was the canadian leader of the original technocratic movement which believed in replacing both politicians and bankers with whoever had the most expertise elon musk capitalist extraordinaire does not exactly take over his grandfather like the movement s founder william henry smyth though his statements suggest a strong underlying belief that scientists and engineers can solve political problems that are intractable to others as the historian jill lepore has argued mr musk inspires numerous followers with an exotic brand of techno capitalism that she calls muskism she says that many of its ideas are drawn from science fiction sometimes very old science fiction meaning that alongside rockets and cars it is also selling visions of the future he thinks we may live in a simulation he regularly references scottish sci fi author iain m banks and he is especially preoccupied with the dangers of ai which he calls the most serious threat to the survival of the human race he is worried not only about mass automation of white collar jobs but also the rise of a theoretical hyper intelligent ai that is too powerful for humans to restrain with artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon he said in 2014 in all those stories where there s the guy with the pentagram and the holy water it s like yeah he s sure he can control the demon doesn t work out both that and global warming feed into mr musk s conviction that colonising other planets becoming a multi planet species is crucial to humanity s long term survival however seriously you take that it is clearly an important goal that shapes the rest of his politics i am accumulating resources to help make life multiplanetary extend the light of consciousness to the stars elon musk elonmusk march 21 2021 two things are notable here one is that these issues are not very well known outside the tech industry and to prioritise them suggests that you believe everyone else is missing a trick the other is that musk is not attempting to meet that future through government action or massive collective institutions like formal movements or trade unions instead he wants to solve it himself through hierarchical top down for profit companies run by him where he decides how to allocate capital in other words he is his own kind of technocrat a talented engineer and huge nerd who thinks engineers and nerds can design better systems of government and economics than currently exist for evidence look at his troubled hyperloop project which is trying to build a new form of public transport while eschewing any input from traditional transit experts who say that he has essentially invented very inefficient buses it is also among the beneficiaries of mr biden s infrastructure bill whentime magazine named mr musk its 2021 person of the year it described him this way the man from the future where technology makes all things possible is a throwback to our glorious industrial past but many of the people who actually lived in that past reviled its industrialists as robber barons and their misdeeds inspired regulations and social policies that are still in place today that is why prof lepore describes muskism as containing a lot of feudalism saying it s like there are these lords and the rest of us are the peasantry and our fates are in their hands because they know best the presumption that jeff bezos and elon musk the two wealthiest people in the world get to decide the extraterrestrial fate of humankind is a bizarrely regressive notion mr musk has his own bullish answer to such claims to anyone i ve offended i just want to say i reinvented electric cars and i m sending people to mars in a rocket ship he said on saturday night live in may did you think i was also going to be a chill normal dude view comments

winter is coming whether we like it or not here in new jersey it s a toss up when it comes to our desire to see snow some of us want it while others do not at this point predictions of snowfall are hitting us from all angles some are calling for a more mild winter with less snowfall while others are calling for a very snowy season the farmer s almanac for example is one of those predicting a snowy outcome but as most of us have probably figured out by now we should take all of these long range forecasts lightly however there are a few things we apparently must plan for when snow arrives across the great garden state of course these plans may vary from person to person but in general history and general trends tell us what we need to prepare for ap rock salt for your walkways rock salt is one of those essentials when it comes to keeping your walkway slip free it also helps out a lot when it comes to your driveway and why wouldn t it be necessary after all our road crews use it heavily to keep us moving along seems like a no brainer for a lot of us but as much as this seems like a necessity it doesn t fall into this common new jersey trend so for now we ll leave the rock salt aside fotoduets snow shovels some new jerseyans may not like to use rock salt but still work on keeping their walkways clear this is where snow shovels come into play much like the rock salt many home improvement stores may stock up on these and keep them at the front of the store so you can make a quick purchase should the need arise however if the snow is light some might skip this altogether and when it comes to this trend they also don t make the cut bud mccormick via canva so what does new jersey need to plan for when it comes to the state of new jersey we tend to be creatures of habit when it comes to snow yes we will work on keeping our walkways clear and yes we ll either shovel them or throw some salt or dirt down so what could it be that we apparently must prepare for abluecup well it s something most of us deny doing but yet our supermarket shelves tell a different story see where this is going credit thinkstock every time snow is forecast to fall in new jersey we seem to suddenly get the urge to wipe out the milk bread and eggs it s without fail every year and yet most of us will deny we ever do this are we embarrassed to say we enjoy eating french toast on a snow day or maybe we just like to have eggs with some toast and a glass of milk regardless of what anyone says somebody is contributing to wiping the shelves clean of these items getty images with that said it s important to start strategizing now your plan of attack for these items so you re prepared when snowflakes begin to fall across the garden state maybe a milkman is a way to go for milk a little outside the box thinking there kristin duvall getty images and for the eggs well maybe become friends with someone who raises chickens the eggs will be much fresher anyway so why not incorporate that into your plan whatever it is you need to start planning now as we all know from experience and past trends these items will be wiped clean come the first snowfall erol ahmed via unsplash this is why new jersey must start planning for these three essentials now before it s too late first flakes when does snow season start in nj

monica dutton bravely helped discover a rapist and murderer of native american women in this sunday s yellowstone the unnamed man who had been preying on reservation women turned out to be a white natural gas worker who would offer them a ride when their cars broke down making white people and energy companies look evil is a two fer in the liberal hollywood playbook but it was impossible to tell if the producers were smearing patriotic americans or using the american flag tucked into the truck visor as a symbol of american oppression of native americans at large two episodes earlier a girl named sila went missing from broken rock reservation after she was found murdered tribal chairman thomas rainwater asked monica to lead a council focusing on violence against native women this week she helped him and the reservation police set a trap and execute the killer monica staged a car breakdown and got picked up by a man in a truck that reads turek natural gas he said he d take her to town but instead veered off the main road claiming to know a place with cell phone service once there he ordered monica out of the truck she ran across a field clearly terrified but he caught up and pinned her obviously intending to rape her just in time rainwater s driver mo who is apparently also a sniper put a bullet through the man s head when they combed the area for more evidence of the dead man s crimes police found multiple sets of remains finding justice is rarely so straightforward violence disappearances and murder of native american women is a true crisis it s a complicated one hindered by remote locations lack of legal protections competing jurisdictions lack of sufficient data and neglect domestic violence against them is also widespread in 2016 the national institute of justice found that more than half of native women experienced physical violence by an intimate partner rates of psychological aggression by an intimate partner were even higher 66 the trump administration launched a federal task force in late 2019 to try to improve coordination and data collection between federal agencies to address the crisis congress also introduced two new bills in 2019 also in this week s episode i killed a man the fight between beth dutton and market equities ceo willa hayes got uglier beth had been shorting market equities stock so long it influenced new york traders and the hedge fund was suffering hayes hit back this week gobbling up shares of the investment firm beth works at as the two tried to destroy each other after beth lost she finally told her father john that the only options are to sell market equities the land it wants or the company will succeed in getting montana to condemn the land and sell it under eminent domain and then others will continue to do the same until the ranch is gone or property taxes have taken all their savings and forced them to sell the ranch off anyway and just like that seven generations of our family legacy will be carved into little ranchettes where people will spend the summer wondering what this place looked like before they got there when it was ours she lamented john said he didn t doubt her assessment but he can t sell because he promised his father he wouldn t
ah the dreaded dry turkey syndrome here s how to make sure to avoid that culinary catastrophe i m not a big meat eater but usually on thanksgiving i ll partake of the turkey although often i end up not finishing the little bits on my plate if the turkey turns out to taste like accidental jerky or worse like dusty feathers no thank you i ll just have extra green bean casserole and dressing please my favorites anyway occasionally i ll have some turkey that tastes like turkey what i mean is the way i d imagine turkey was meant to taste it s moist flavorful and delicious rarely is this the case though if you ve struggled with perfecting what has traditionally been considered the main dish at many a thanksgiving day feast let s hear from the experts on how to make sure your turkey is worth all of the effort and time you put into preparing it unsplash get our free mobile app get our free mobile app the main thing that is often overlooked that leads to a dry turkey forgetting to brine the turkey the experts at the daily meal say that whether you choose to oven roast air fry or deep fry your turkey this year the one step you should start with is to brine the bird brine is really just a synonym for salt water it s easy to do and can even be done the day before you re ready to prepare your turkey i ve used this method many many times in the past when preparing chicken breasts and it makes all the difference in the world albeit on a much smaller scale give yourself at least 12 hours to brine 24 is better for optimal turkey deliciousness not surprisingly the main ingredients in brine are salt and water but there s plenty of room for creating your own special recipe by adding in other ingredients you may consider a holiday poultry favorite like rosemary of course other options include bay leaves garlic or even brown sugar get ideas for different brine formulas from alton brown here or from martha stewart here unsplash once you ve decided on your brine get a large stockpot steel or enamel that will hold both the brine and the turkey leaving out the turkey put your brine ingredients in and heat to high but just long enough to start it simmering you do not want to boil it into a frenzy too much heat and you ll break down the flavors not our goal once the brine is simmering turn off the heat and let it cool completely then prepare your turkey for cooking by removing giblets which you ll want to save for making stock later then add the turkey to the brine making sure there s enough to cover it you ll want to add water if there s not enough so be sure and make plenty of brine so you don t have to do this then it s time to refrigerate give it at least 12 hours and make sure to turn it twice at reasonable intervals ok now drain the brine pat the turkey dry and then cook the bird according to your recipe i promise you it s worth the extra time what other holiday meal hacks could you share with the class let us know in the comments tyler residents reveal their favorite holiday spots for hosting larger groups of people whether you re looking for a place for 20 or 100 tyler has several options i d never known despite having lived here for many years you were right and i m in love just pies in tyler is just amazingly yummy just a little tour of just pies in tyler if you ve not made your way over there yet do yourself a favor and go calling all pie lovers

plant based meat heralded by many as the death knell to big meat appears at this moment to have dealt only a flesh wound the promise of high tech meat substitutes prompted a frenzy of celebrity investment and red hot ipos in 2019 the pandemic saw significant consumer curiosity and a stampede of newcomers in the category including entries from the world s largest food and meat companies with tyson smithfield perdue hormel nestlé and others leaping into the fray analysts wrote about the hunger for meat dairy and egg substitutes among flexitarians non vegetarians looking for easy swaps to do less harm to the environment animals and their health executives poured in from other multinational food companies to nab top jobs in the nascent industry fast food giants added plant based offerings with much fanfare advertisement but then things slowed down meteoric growth in 2020 flattened in 2021 and retail sales have dropped more than 10 percent in the past year beyond meat the los angeles based purveyor of plant based burgers crumbles nuggets and such saw its stock prices plunge nearly 80 percent from its peak and last month the company announced it would lay off about 19 percent of its workforce it s not just beyond meat giant jbs sa announced in early october it was shuttering its two year old planterra business in the united states and closing its 190 000 square foot colorado facility and mcdonald s has tabled its idea to roll out the mcplant burger nationally the industry s troubles come despite mounting evidence that people should for health and environmental reasons reduce their consumption of beef lamb pork and poultry produced via traditional animal agriculture the stockholm environment institute recently issued a report that found the production of animal based foods responsible for as much as 20 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions if meat consumption continues along current trends it will be impossible to keep global warming below the goal of 1 5 degrees celsius and difficult to stay below 2 degrees celsius its authors said the report also found the animal based food system a key driver of biodiversity loss the past few years have also seen an avalanche of reports about the ills of a meat heavy diet for human health for planetary health for workers health and for the habitat of the planet s animal species advertisement meanwhile the world s appetite for meat continues to grow the global consumption of meat has more than doubled since 1990 reaching over 339 million metric tons in 2021 and the united nations food and agriculture organization predicts that will rise to 374 metric tons by 2030
despite donald trump led republicans strong campaign against inflation us president joe biden is emerging as the first president in american history to lose the least number of seats in a midterm election as the senate sits precariously with both republicans and democrats split at 49 seats each with the latter requiring just one more seat to get majority that could come from either arizona or california or nevada or the georgia runoff in the senate the democrats have wrested one seat from the republicans even if both parties split the ticket democrats stand a good chance of winning the run off in georgia where sitting senator pastor raphael warnock is much ahead of the footballer anti abortion activist herschel walker hounded by abortion scandals of his ex girlfriends or even before if they get california the general trend in the midterms is that the incumbent president always loses and trump have lost a huge chunk of seats but biden has bucked the trend so far they have lost none but gained one in the senate and set to retain the upper chamber and lost only about 11 seats in the house of reps in the house democrats have now won 199 seats and republicans 211 seats with the gop requiring just seven more to retake the house from the democrats at present democrats have 220 against republicans 212 seats even if republicans retake the house they will still have only a wafer thin majority in the 435 member house media reports say the party in the white house has gained seats in a midterm only three of 40 times since the civil war jim kessler the executive director at the center left think tank third way told abc news since the direct election of senators in 1914 it s happened in seven of 27 midterms gaining seats in the house is not going to happen but losses will be small a draw or one seat pickup in the senate is within grasp for comparison in barack obama s first term democrats lost 63 seats in the house during the midterms republicans lost 40 seats in the house during the 2018 cycle when donald trump was president former president bill clinton lost 53 seats in the house in his first midterm elections biden has lost only 11 seats despite predictions of a red wave or a red tsunami with most of trump s handpicked candidates flopping in the elections in the senate democrats depend on the georgia runoff to gain a majority as neither candidate could muster the 50 per cent threshold of the popular vote to win calling for a runoff election on december 6 between the candidates democrats are favoured to win and retain control of the senate as the main plank of the trump campaign inflation and high prices has been knocked out inflation for october declined to 7 77 per cent from projected near 8 per cent house rentals have declined markets have soared and grocery prices climbed by only 0 4 per cent nobel laureate paul krugman and noted economist jeremey siegel have both predicted that with inflation showing trends of coming down though groceries prices are high but gasoline prices have dipped by a dollar markets have begun to soar by 4 per cent and the stocks could rally round by the year end ians ash pgh 570 words 2022 11 12 23 18 03 ians

s is home to thousands of advisors that can meet your specific needs based on the methodology outlined below smartasset identified these financial advisor firms as among the top 5 financial advisor

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure

criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please carefully review the methodologies employed in the vanguard whitepaper to receive a copy of the whitepaper please contact compliance smartasset com the value of professional investment advice is only

winter is coming whether we like it or not here in new jersey it s a toss up when it comes to our desire to see snow some of us want it while others do not at this point predictions of snowfall are hitting us from all angles some are calling for a more mild winter with less snowfall while others are calling for a very snowy season the farmer s almanac for example is one of those predicting a snowy outcome but as most of us have probably figured out by now we should take all of these long range forecasts lightly however there are a few things we apparently must plan for when snow arrives across the great garden state of course these plans may vary from person to person but in general history and general trends tell us what we need to prepare for ap rock salt for your walkways rock salt is one of those essentials when it comes to keeping your walkway slip free it also helps out a lot when it comes to your driveway and why wouldn t it be necessary after all our road crews use it heavily to keep us moving along seems like a no brainer for a lot of us but as much as this seems like a necessity it doesn t fall into this common new jersey trend so for now we ll leave the rock salt aside fotoduets snow shovels some new jerseyans may not like to use rock salt but still work on keeping their walkways clear this is where snow shovels come into play much like the rock salt many home improvement stores may stock up on these and keep them at the front of the store so you can make a quick purchase should the need arise however if the snow is light some might skip this altogether and when it comes to this trend they also don t make the cut bud mccormick via canva so what does new jersey need to plan for when it comes to the state of new jersey we tend to be creatures of habit when it comes to snow yes we will work on keeping our walkways clear and yes we ll either shovel them or throw some salt or dirt down so what could it be that we apparently must prepare for abluecup well it s something most of us deny doing but yet our supermarket shelves tell a different story see where this is going credit thinkstock every time snow is forecast to fall in new jersey we seem to suddenly get the urge to wipe out the milk bread and eggs it s without fail every year and yet most of us will deny we ever do this are we embarrassed to say we enjoy eating french toast on a snow day or maybe we just like to have eggs with some toast and a glass of milk regardless of what anyone says somebody is contributing to wiping the shelves clean of these items getty images with that said it s important to start strategizing now your plan of attack for these items so you re prepared when snowflakes begin to fall across the garden state maybe a milkman is a way to go for milk a little outside the box thinking there kristin duvall getty images and for the eggs well maybe become friends with someone who raises chickens the eggs will be much fresher anyway so why not incorporate that into your plan whatever it is you need to start planning now as we all know from experience and past trends these items will be wiped clean come the first snowfall erol ahmed via unsplash this is why new jersey must start planning for these three essentials now before it s too late first flakes when does snow season start in nj

ftx was engulfed in more chaos on saturday when the crypto exchange said it had detected unauthorized access and analysts said hundreds of millions of dollars of assets had been moved from the platform in suspicious circumstances ftx filed for bankruptcy on friday one of the highest profile crypto blowups after traders rushed to withdraw 6 billion from the platform in just 72 hours and rival exchange binance abandoned a proposed rescue deal ftx chief executive john j ray iii said on saturday that the company was working with law enforcement and regulators and was making every effort to secure all assets wherever located among other things we are in the process of removing trading and withdrawal functionality he said the exchange s dramatic fall from grace has seen its 30 year old founder sam bankman fried morph from being the poster child of crypto s successes to the protagonist of the industry s biggest crash bankman fried who lives in the bahamas has also been the subject of speculation about his whereabouts on saturday he told reuters that he was in the bahamas denying speculation on twitter that he had flown by private jet to south america the turmoil at ftx has seen at least 1 billion in customer funds vanish from the platform sources told reuters on friday bankman fried had transferred 10 billion of customer funds to his trading company alameda research the sources said new problems emerged on saturday when ftx s u s general counsel ryne miller said in a twitter post that the firm s digital assets were being moved into so called cold storage to mitigate damage upon observing unauthorized transactions cold storage refers to crypto wallets that are not connected to the internet to guard against hackers blockchain analytics firm nansen said it saw 659 million in outflows from ftx international and ftx u s in the last 24 hours elliptic a separate blockchain analytics firm said that about 473 million worth of crypto assets were moved out of ftx wallets in suspicious circumstances early this morning but that it could not confirm that the tokens had been stolen crypto exchange kraken said we can confirm our team is aware of the identity of the account associated with the ongoing ftx hack and we are committed to working with law enforcement to ensure they have everything they need to sufficiently investigate this matter ftx was not immediately available for comment about the outflows or kraken s statement a document that bankman fried shared with investors on thursday and was reviewed by reuters showed ftx had 13 86 billion in liabilities and 14 6 billion in assets however only 900 million of those assets were liquid leading to the cash crunch that ended with the company filing for bankruptcy in its bankruptcy petition ftx trading said it has 10 billion to 50 billion in assets 10 billion to 50 billion in liabilities and more than 100 000 creditors ray a restructuring expert was appointed to take over as ceo the collapse shocked investors and prompted fresh calls to regulate the crypto asset sector which has seen losses stack up this year as cryptocurrency prices collapsed bitcoin fell below 16 000 for the first time since 2020 after binance abandoned its rescue deal on wednesday on saturday it was trading around 16 831 down by more than 75 from the all time high of 69 000 it reached in november last year btc btsp we believe cryptocurrency markets remain too small and too siloed to cause contagion in financial markets with an 890 billion market cap in comparison to u s equity s 41 trillion citi analysts wrote over four years ftx raised 1 8 billion from venture capital and pension funds this is the primary way financial markets could suffer as it may have further minor implications for portfolio shocks in a volatile macro regime the u s securities regulator is investigating ftx com s handling of customer funds amid a liquidity crunch as well its crypto lending activities a source with knowledge of the inquiry said
before elon musk took over twitter it was hardly a gangbusters business the company is only occasionally profitable its userbase and advertising revenue is puny compared to social media rivals like facebook and tiktok yet the possibility of a looming twitter bankruptcy was not a fate anyone ever seriously discussed now however under the chaotic leadership of musk the mercurial billionaire has reportedly told staff that bankruptcy could be nigh if twitter does not start making more money how could this be the case and what exactly has changed in taking the company private in his 44 billion purchase of twitter musk cashed in some of his tesla stock and also saddled the social platform with 13 billion in debt which is a massive obligation for a company the size of twitter for context the debt equals about seven times the company s projected earnings for 2022 it s essentially a huge credit card and the annual payment is 1 billion and that s a problem for twitter considering that its cash flow last year to pay for things like debt payments was just 632 million so where s the rest of the money going to come from why bankruptcy could be in twitter s interest it s hypothetically possible that he could use more of his tesla stock to bail out twitter or turn to his cadre of co investors who would probably have no trouble finding the money said andy wu assistant professor at harvard s business school who has studied the musk takeover but if musk and his backers deem that twitter is not worth sinking more money into the eye popping debt payment could help make the case that bankruptcy is the best way forward for the company wu said the saying if you owe the bank 100 that s your problem but if you owe the bank 100 million that s the bank s problem might apply here said wu explaining that the investors and other lenders could take over the company if twitter went through a bankruptcy proceeding with musk still serving as its chief executive bankruptcy would also allow musk to refinance the debt which would make the company more financially stable since musk closed the deal to buy twitter financial analysts have pointed out that he vastly overpaid musk s attempts to wriggle out of the deal shows that he had misgivings about the 44 billion price investment firm wedbush securities said the deal represented one of the most overpaid tech acquisitions in history pegging twitter s fair value at closer to 25 billion knowing this pushing twitter into bankruptcy could at least help musk restructure the debt in a way that is more favorable to him adding even more pressure on the company is the mayhem unfolding internally with the departure of a slew of top executives some of whom were responsible for things like the safety of the platform and complying with federal regulations the personnel turmoil plus the fact that major advertisers like general motors pfizer and united airlines have paused advertising in the midst of the chaos has heaped additional stress onto the company this despite musk s assurances to companies that he would not let twitter morph into a free for all hellscape about 90 of twitter s revenue comes from advertising however rocky musk s ownership continues to be harvard s wu is skeptical musk and his investors are ever going to let twitter completely fold even if there is a bankruptcy twitter itself would likely operate pretty much as normal he said in addition to potential financial returns my sense is that musk and his co investors are ideologically driven that they re really driven by values wu said musk has described himself as a free speech absolutist and he has often been critical of speech policing on platforms like twitter that he says limits the marketplace of ideas wu said it s his sense that musk and his backers are willing to lose money for the sake of that fight eight dollars is not cost prohibitive for scammers questions about twitter s long term financial viability are real musk has previously estimated that the company is losing 3 million a day musk has gone to drastic lengths to make twitter a cheaper place to run like laying off half of the company s staff or about 3 700 jobs but that did not change what musk sees as a core problem at the company which is that it has just one primary way of making money online advertising it is an unfortunate reality for the company right now considering it is a miserable time to be in the online advertising business a substantial pullback in ad spending has convulsed the tech industry facebook owner meta has laid off 11 000 people snap let go of 20 of its staff other ad reliant tech companies like spotify and google s youtube are feeling the squeeze so musk s solution is revamping a service called twitter blue by charging 8 a month for the once coveted blue check this way musk has argued being verified on twitter is no longer reserved for the elite and more people using the service will be authenticated so far the program s launch has had the exact opposite effect a flurry of accounts impersonating star athletes like lebron james former president trump and companies including eli lilly and pepsi put a spotlight on just how quickly the blue check for sale option could be used to spread deception in an effort to tame the proliferation of impersonators twitter appears to have paused twitter blue the service is no longer available for purchase and on its website twitter notes that accounts created on or after november 9 2022 will be unable to subscribe to twitter blue at this time twitter which does not appear to have any communications staff in the wake of the mass layoff did not respond to a request for comment at the moment twitter blue is far from the money making initiative musk had hoped it would be but to rachel tobac who runs social proof security a firm focused on preventing the manipulation of social media sites if twitter blue is revived the money generated from the new service is the least important thing eight dollars is not cost prohibitive for scammers she said it is essential that twitter figures out this whole official or not issue imagine tobac said if an emergency service account with a blue check was opened by an impersonator and began dispending harmful advice about say where to seek shelter during a natural disaster tobac also fears disinformation agents paying 8 to sow confusion and discord in connection with an election something fresh on her mind as the country awaits the final outcome of a number of key midterm election races right now we have people making jokes impersonating the president impersonating nintendo and elon musk is laughing at those jokes because he thinks they re funny right now she said what s not going to be funny is someone impersonating an election official and meddling and causing interference within the election results copyright 2024 npr to see more visit missing some content care to comment check the source

over the past five years the united states largest independent oil and gas company exxon mobil nyse xom has mostly focused its exploratory activities in south america last month the oil major announced that it had made two new discoveries at the sailfin 1 and yarrow 1 wells in the stabroek block offshore guyana potentially adding more barrels to one of the most closely watched new oil discoveries exxonmobil has now made more than 30 discoveries on the block since 2015 and has ramped up offshore development and production at a pace that far exceeds the industry average in contrast exxon s exploits in africa have been few and far between with its last discovery on the continent coming nearly two decades ago but exxon has now announced that it has together with its partners discovered hydrocarbons in block 15 off angola in the bavuca south prospect this was the block s 18th discovery but the first since 2003 according to exxon the valaris ds 9 drillship drilled the bavuca south 1 well 365 km northwest from the coast at luanda in 1 100 m 3 608 ft of water encountering 30 m 98 ft of good quality hydrocarbon bearing sandstone exxon owns a 36 interest in the block with bp exploration angola 24 eni angola exploration 18 equinor angola block 15 12 and sonangol p p 10 being its partners africa s oil gas opportunities the last big fossil fuel discovery on the continent dates back to 2010 after texas based anadarko corp now a subsidiary of occidental petroleum corp and italian energy giant eni s p a nyse e discovered approximately 180 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves equivalent to 29 billion barrels of oil in mozambique s supergiant offshore basin of rovuma immediately catapulting the south african nation to a potential global lng superpower as you might expect there was a stampede by oil and gas majors including exxonmobil totalenergies nyse tte shell nyse shel and china national petroleum corp nyse snp coming in to stake their claims unfortunately widespread terrorism and the growing menace of piracy have constantly held back progress with mozambique fast joining the league of african nations grappling with a resource curse the security crisis in the northern region of cabo delgado had displaced hundreds of thousands of people created a humanitarian crisis and even forced totalenergies to declare force majeure on its massive natural gas investment in the country but the tides have now turned and mozambique has managed to get its act together just in time the country is now poised to ship its first cargo of liquefied natural gas lng overseas in november at a time when europe is desperately trying to cut energy ties with russia experts have estimated that mozambique can earn in excess of 100b from its natural gas assets over the next 30 years related oil on track for another weekly loss despite price spike bp has already inked a deal to buy all of the output from eni s 7 billion coral sul project capable of producing 3 4 million metric tons of lng per year for the next 20 years meanwhile totalenergies has announced plans to resume its massive 20 billion project toward the end of the year with the terminal expected to churn out 13 1 million tons of lng annually in addition exxonmobil says it will make a final decision for an even larger project in the near future meanwhile the european union has planned a five fold increase in financial support to 15 million to fight militants near mozambique s gas projects the eu has already pledged to provide the country s army with an additional 45 million euros 45 million of financial support and has so far given a sadc mission in the country 2 9 million euros of funding on its part mozambique has laid out plans to set up a sovereign wealth fund toward the end of 2022 with 50 of the fund s revenues to be reinjected into the fund while the remaining 50 will go to the government s budget during the first 20 years of lng production mozambique has the potential to move up the ladder and become a middle income nation over the next two decades if it plays its cards right vijaya ramachandran director for energy and development at the breakthrough institute says germany and europe should look to africa if they are serious about achieving energy security ramachandran notes that the continent is endowed with substantial natural gas reserves and new discoveries in the process of being tapped very little of africa s gas has been exploited either for domestic consumption or export algeria is already an established major gas producer with substantial untapped reserves and is connected to spain with several undersea pipelines germany and the eu are already working to expand pipeline capacity connecting spain with france from where more algerian gas could flow to germany and elsewhere libyan gas fields are connected by pipeline to italy in both algeria and libya europe should urgently help tap new fields and increase gas production new pipelines under discussion currently focus on the eastern mediterranean pipeline project which would bring gas from israel s offshore gas fields to europe but the biggest african sources lie south of the sahara including nigeria which has about a third of the continent s reserves and tanzania senegal has recently discovered major offshore fields ramachandra says europe should not ignore these opportunities for instance the proposed trans saharan pipeline will bring gas from nigeria to algeria via niger if the project is completed the new pipeline will connect to the existing trans mediterranean maghreb europe medgaz and galsi pipelines that supply europe from transmission hubs on algeria s mediterranean coast the trans saharan pipeline would be more than 2 500 miles long and could supply as much as 30 billion cubic meters of nigerian gas to europe per year equivalent to about two thirds of germany s 2021 imports from russia for comparison purposes the yamal europe pipeline one of the major routes for russian gas to europe is 2 607 mile long on its part nigeria is enthusiastic about exporting some of its 200 trillion cubic foot reserves of gas with nigerian vice president yemi osinbajo arguing in favor of natural gas critical role both as a relatively clean transition fuel and as a driver of economic development and foreign exchange earner unfortunately the trans saharan pipeline will likely take a decade or more to complete and lng shipments to europe would bring quicker relief unfortunately europe s biggest gas importer germany has not built a single lng import terminal as part of its policy to make the country dependent on russian gas and in turn make russia more dependent on germany but there s hope berlin has already renounced its old ways and says it will now build lng infrastructure luckily for germany and other stranded eu nations ramachandran says lng loading ports can be built reasonably quickly in africa with the greater tortue ahmeyin field an offshore gas deposit straddling the maritime border between senegal and mauritania a prime example when the field comes online next year it will place the two west african nations among africa s top gas producers floating liquefaction plants above the offshore gas field produce liquefy store and transfer the gas to lng tankers that ship it directly to importing countries while the initial production from this field will be small it is slated to double in a few years and the field sits within a larger basin of natural gas with substantially greater reserves advertisement elsewhere in africa too gas production will continue to expand as projects in tanzania mozambique and other countries come online in the next few years developing a gas pipeline as big as the trans saharan pipeline will likely present many challenges as it runs through regions plagued by conflict and insurgency but these kinds of projects could alleviate europe s energy crisis while also helping africa to develop and integrate economically by alex kimani for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com elon musk s decision to lay down his sword and purchase twitter allowed the delaware court of chancery to resume its work out of the national spotlight while we miss out on learning if the court of chancery would compel specific performance and order the world s richest man to pay 44 billion for a company he ostensibly didn t want the court continued to issue many important decisions in october highlighted below members of an allegedly manager managed llc still owed fiduciary duties jung v el tinieblo international inc c a no 2021 0798 del ch oct 31 2022 the defendants hired jung to be the chief marketing officer of a tequila importing business the defendants also gave jung a 2 ownership interest in the underlying limited liability company llc the defendants terminated jung s contract six months later but never bought out her 2 ownership interest the llc s members later caused their delaware company to acquire 100 of the llc s interests jung sued the members the llc and the delaware company for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duties the defendants moved to dismiss jung s fiduciary duty claims first the defendants argued the llc was manager managed and thus the llc members did not individually owe her fiduciary duties members of a manager managed llc do not typically owe fiduciary duties the court analyzed the llc s operating agreement the operating agreement appointed a person as manager but only afforded that person the power to sign checks the court concluded the llc s operating agreement otherwise vested the members with all management responsibility the court allowed jung s claims against the members to proceed second the court dismissed jung s claims against the llc because the company itself owed her no fiduciary duties and third the court found the members delaware company could have plausibly aided and abetted the fiduciary duty breach so that claim survived key takeaway a threshold question for many llcs is whether they are member managed or manager managed founders wanting to insulate themselves from fiduciary duty claims must clearly vest the llc s management with a manager in the operating agreement otherwise members remain exposed to fiduciary duty claims in delaware appraisal action challenges discounted cash flow analysis and

the discounted cash flow dcf model and how they should be calculated the experts valuations ranged from 5 000 share to over 30 000 share in a dense 86 page opinion the court analyzed all relevant factors focused on a an estimate of future cash flows b the discount rate c the future cash flow s terminal value and d costs and interest the court concluded that the plaintiff s per share fair value was 11 464 57 as of the valuation date the plaintiff was awarded 1 7 million key takeaway the opinion is a must read for any business or consulting expert utilizing dcf for purposes of valuation the

abetting a fiduciary duty breach atlantic nwi llc v the carlyle group inc c a no 2021 0944 del ch oct 31 2022 atlantic nwi and redco formed a joint venture jv to pursue real estate investment opportunities atlantic nwi later discovered that redco was competing with the jv by offering investment opportunities to carlyle in ways that breached redco s contractual and fiduciary duties atlantic nwi settled its claims against redco then asserted third party claims against carlyle for a tortious interference with the jv s llc agreement and b aiding and abetting redco s breach of fiduciary duty vice chancellor glasscock s decision illustrates that the differences in two related claims often plead together in similar circumstances atlantic nwi s tortious interference claim required carlyle s knowing interference with a contractual right the court found this allegation was adequately pled in light of the plaintiff friendly inferences available at the motion to dismiss phase atlantic nwi s equitable claim for aiding and abetting required carlyle s knowing assistance in redco s breach of a fiduciary duty with a specific pleading of facts indicating the required scienter the court found atlantic nwi could not make sufficient non conclusory allegations of fact from which the court could infer carlyle s knowledge of redco s fiduciary duties and dismissed the aiding and abetting claim key takeaway tortious interference with contract claims need only allege generally that a defendant acted with a specific state of mind such as knowledge aiding and abetting claims requires a heightened scienter pleading with the burden on the plaintiff to plead specific facts from which court could reasonably infer that the defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of its

the court found delaware had jurisdiction over each the court found p3 health s general counsel impliedly consented to jurisdiction in delaware through her role as a senior manager of a delaware llc and her direct involvement in the underlying transaction as p3 health s general counsel and chief legal officer the court concluded that the general counsel participated materially in the management of p3 health and the underlying transaction by directing latham watkins work the court ruled that the founder of the spac consented to jurisdiction in delaware chicago pacific used the spac to raise public capital through an initial public offering and subsequent merger with p3 health as the court summarized an individual who causes the formation of a delaware entity for the purpose of engaging in a transaction must expect to be subject to suit in delaware for claims based on the resulting transaction the court held that one of the chicago pacific principals sameer mathur who oversaw the fund s investment in p3 health was subject to delaware s jurisdiction mathur was not a manager and held no official role with the company such as an officer title or a position as an employee nevertheless the court found jurisdiction was proper under concepts of de facto management mathur made decisions on behalf of the company directed the company s management to take action instructed

r ussia s lightning attack on ukraine s capital kyiv was a failure its creeping artillery war to seize the eastern region of donbas has ground to a bloody halt it has lost a chunk of stolen territory south of the city of kharkiv and this week announced a retreat from kherson the only provincial capital it had captured since its invasion in february with each setback vladimir putin russia s president has sought new ways to torment ukraine the latest is a relentless bombardment that seeks to wreck ukraine s infrastructure residents of the capital have been told they may have to evacuate if the power grid collapses halting water and sewage services listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element power cuts have not sapped ukraine s will to fight but they are a reminder that eight months after his unprovoked invasion mr putin keeps looking for ways to raise the stakes some worry he might blow up a dam on the dnieper river as stalin did in 1941 to slow his adversaries advance the ever evolving russian assault also raises an awkward question how long will america and europe keep providing ukraine with the billions of dollars worth of military and economic aid it needs every month to fend russia off for as long as it takes say western leaders but many of their citizens reject the idea of bankrolling an indefinite conflict with russia tens of thousands of people took to the streets of rome on november 5th calling for an end to the fighting we don t want war no weapons no sanctions where is diplomacy read one placard wary washington in america too questions have been raised hard left democrats recently issued a call swiftly retracted for negotiations gains by america first republicans in the midterm elections on november 8th although smaller than expected are a reminder that american politics might change dramatically after the next presidential election in two years time and with it policy on ukraine jake sullivan mr biden s national security adviser made an unannounced trip to kyiv on november 4th to promise unwavering support but he also urged ukraine to think about future peace terms it has since emerged that he has been in touch with his russian counterparts to warn them not to use nuclear weapons on november 9th mr biden said russia and ukraine would lick their wounds after the battle for kherson and might then be ready for compromise he insisted he would not tell ukraine what to do in private western and ukrainian officials are starting to ponder what a stable outcome might look like will ukraine become a new finland forced to cede land to its invaders and to remain neutral for decades or another west germany with its national territory partitioned by war and its democratic half absorbed into nato a much discussed template is israel a country under constant threat that has been able to defend itself without formal alliances but with extensive military help from america the precise terms of any negotiated settlement depend on what happens on the battlefield there is likely to be a lot more fighting before either side is ready to end the war russia and ukraine have each lost by one estimate roughly 100 000 soldiers killed and wounded but both still hope to manoeuvre to a more favourable position the retreat from kherson is a humiliation for mr putin but it will give russian forces a more easily defended line along the dnieper river mr putin shows no sign of throwing in the towel he has mobilised hundreds of thousands more recruits some have been rushed into battle with little training or equipment to hold the line the rest may be used for a renewed push next year ukraine for its part hopes to maintain its momentum its army is getting reinforcements this winter in the form of thousands of recruits trained by britain and other western countries western arms continue to arrive on november 4th the pentagon announced another arms package worth 400m including 45 refurbished t 72b tanks and 1 100 drones the first new nasams anti aircraft batteries were deployed this week the west s stocks of weapons are not unlimited european armies have eaten deep into theirs even mighty america worries about eroding its own ability to fight future wars it is russia however that seems to face the most immediate shortages it has used up most of its precision bombs and missiles and is struggling to replace them because of sanctions it is obtaining fresh weapons from the likes of iran and perhaps north korea china has so far heeded american warnings to stay out of the war cold calculation mr putin is hoping his campaign to destroy ukraine s electricity grid will freeze the country into submission or at least turn it into a weak failing state but the evidence of past conflicts is that aerial bombing of civilians in the absence of an effective ground campaign rarely secures victory nearly 90 of ukrainians want the country to keep fighting in russia according to the levada centre a pollster only 36 want to press on with the war whereas 57 favour peace talks at the same time support for mr putin remains at 79 russians it seems would like the war to end but starved of impartial news do not blame mr putin for it still the more he tries to dragoon them into fighting the more he risks losing popular support ukraine s more avid western supporters think that with time ukraine will become stronger and russia weaker but mr putin is hoping that general winter will somehow revive his fortunes if not by weakening ukraine s will to fight then by gnawing at the west s readiness to support it as the heating bills balloon in europe mr putin claims that he is ready to negotiate from the starting point that the west should recognise his theft of ukrainian territory but that ukraine s western masters have prevented it from talking the two sides held lengthy talks after russia seized the crimean peninsula and part of donbas in 2014 they talked again in the spring as russia besieged kyiv but ukraine set its face against further negotiations after russia s retreat from kyiv in april revealed widespread atrocities against civilians volodymyr zelensky ukraine s president suggested this week that talks could be revived but only if russia was willing to give back ukrainian land pay compensation and accept responsibility for war crimes the west is vague about its own aims mr biden has at times mused about wanting to see mr putin ousted from power at others he has talked about finding off ramps for the russian leader he defined his goals most clearly in a guest article in the new york times in may a democratic independent sovereign and prosperous ukraine with the means to deter and defend itself against further aggression notably that left out the question of ukraine s borders western leaders say this is for ukraine to decide their aim is to strengthen its negotiating hand more recently though ukraine s backers have sounded more specific in a statement on october 11th leaders of the g 7 group of industrialised countries offered their full support to ukraine s independence territorial integrity and sovereignty in its internationally recognised borders they demanded that russia completely and unconditionally withdraw from all seized lands among other things they pledged to find ways of using seized russian assets to help fund ukraine s reconstruction in need of a break the g 7 statement is basically a demand for total russian surrender which is not a plausible diplomatic outcome diplomacy by definition involves give and take the expectation should not be another treaty of versailles says samuel charap of the rand corporation an american think tank referring to the punitive terms imposed on germany at the end of the first world war the west ukraine and russia he argues should start talking if only to set the groundwork for more substantive negotiations in future fighting and talking at the same time should be the norm many disagree keep up the pressure don t be in a hurry to draw lines on a map it would be bureaucratic suicide somebody will put it up on twitter alongside the molotov ribbentrop pact retorts dan fried of the atlantic council another american think tank alluding to nazi germany s and the soviet union s carve up of poland in 1939 few western leaders question ukraine s ambition to recapture the territory lost since russia invaded in february many would support efforts to reclaim the parts of donbas seized in 2014 but opinion is more divided when it comes to reconquering crimea many worry that the prospect of losing the peninsula might prompt a dangerous escalation from mr putin to some in the biden administration the war is a matter of principle territory should never be seized by force so all russian gains must be reversed others doubting ukraine s ability to reconquer much more think the time for diplomacy is soon either way america is in no rush to spell out diplomatic positions that might cause rifts in the pro ukraine camp another pressing concern is the nature of future western security guarantees for ukraine they will need to be robust given that russia will probably remain a threat to ukraine for as long as mr putin is in power if not longer several central and eastern european countries favour ukraine s rapid admission to nato on the grounds that the alliance s commitment to mutual defence would firmly deter russia for all its nuclear menaces it has so far refrained from overtly striking nato territory the biden administration though is wary of having to extend its nuclear umbrella to a country in a state of latent or actual conflict with russia throughout mr biden has been careful to minimise the risk of a direct nato russia conflict for fear that it would lead to world war iii several nato members in western europe are similarly sceptical so attention has turned to interim or alternative arrangements in september anders fogh rasmussen a former secretary general of nato and andriy yermak mr zelensky s chief of staff proposed a kyiv security compact which would offer security assistance short of a mutual defence pact some in ukraine considered it a betrayal modelled on western support for israel about which mr zelensky has spoken the compact would strengthen ukraine s armed forces in effect turning the current ad hoc support into a systematic long term commitment ukraine s partners would promise multi decade investments in the country s defence industry massive weapons transfers training joint exercises and intelligence support the compact would require neither russia s assent nor ukraine s neutrality it would not preclude nato membership in some circumstances there could be military intervention to help ukraine if it were attacked the signatories would use all elements of their national and collective power and take appropriate measures which may include diplomatic economic and military means a wider group of countries including asian allies would reinforce such military assistance with sanctions on russia including provisions to snap back any of the current penalties that may be lifted as part of a deal even this may be too ambitious for team biden some ask for instance what commitments ukraine would take on by way of reforms to strengthen democracy say or to fight corruption the parallel with israel is imperfect among other things israel is a nuclear power and occupies arab land for mykola bielieskov of the national institute for strategic studies a think tank in kyiv the israeli model is not only about mobilising our partners externally it s also about explaining to people what it means to live next door to a crazy neighbour to existential threats the sky must be the limit whatever the diplomatic template russia s blitz has proved that the west will need to help ukraine create a properly integrated and layered air defence system mixing fighter aircraft surface to air batteries and shoulder launched weapons at the moment weapons are arriving piecemeal and often cannot exchange data there are also worries about ukraine running out of certain types of air defence munitions if that were to happen russia could then deploy much more air power in support of ground troops uncertain harvest ukraine s mix and match weapons a mr potato head arsenal as some call it cause problems elsewhere for instance it has no fewer than 14 different types of artillery pieces with an average brigade operating four different sorts this is a logistical nightmare for them especially when we talk about ammunition says nick reynolds of rusi a british think tank some of the weapons are wearing out badly and europe s defence industry sapped by decades of low spending is poorly placed to produce spare parts red lights are flashing in terms of that support being available adds mr reynolds how long the war goes on depends mainly on mr putin he is in a bind both in ukraine and at home moderate technocrats are worried about the strains on the economy national patriots such as yevgeny prigozhin who commands the wagner mercenary group have called for purges of supposedly treacherous generals a pause to play at diplomacy may suit mr putin for a time particularly if it allows him to consolidate some territorial gains that may explain his recent toning down of nuclear rhetoric and his sudden casting of ukrainians as victims of western aggression the west is throwing ukrainians into a furnace russia in contrast has always treated ukrainian people with respect mr putin declared on november 4th his propagandists and officials though still talk of de satanising ukraine the shift fits another of mr putin s guises as the champion of a global movement to cast off western dominance in all this mr putin is seeking to woo waverers especially in the global south he also wants to reassure friends such as china and india which have made plain their disapproval of his nuclear recklessness above all mr putin is interested in reaching one rich world listener donald trump whose allies in congress question american aid to ukraine and who may soon announce another run for president for all his setbacks mr putin is not yet out of options to persecute ukraine and try to divide the west militarily he could commit more of his air force and mobilise more troops in the covert grey zone he could sabotage undersea gas pipelines and internet connections to the west conduct bigger cyber attacks interfere with communications satellites and step up disinformation campaigns he could also sink ships carrying grain from ukraine ultimately he could use tactical nuclear weapons all this though would come at heavy cost it would make russia even more of a pariah weaken him at home and might provoke harsh retaliation the stakes are higher for mr putin than for the west but they are highest for ukrainians many of whom mistrust the very idea of talks with russia and see military victory as their only option even if it takes years to achieve the more land it can regain ukraine reckons the greater the chance of getting rid of mr putin yet that same prospect alarms many in the west a rout of the russian army might be what pushes mr putin to go nuclear that is one reason why team biden long ago stopped talking about helping ukraine win as it has often done with israel america may at some point try to limit ukraine s ambitions it need not do so overtly it can simply withhold the arms ukraine needs as it already does to an extent it declines to provide western aircraft patriot air defence missiles and longer range atacms strike missiles for fear that they might goad russia to use nuclear weapons all this explains why some ukrainians have been circulating a bittersweet message issued to finnish troops in 1940 at the end of the winter war with the soviet union by their commander carl gustaf mannerheim the vastly outnumbered finns had inflicted heavy losses on soviet forces but nonetheless had to cede territory because help from their friends had dried up mannerheim wrote signing off with the words we are proudly conscious of the historic duty which we shall continue to fulfil the defence of that western civilisation which has been our heritage for centuries but we know also that we have paid to the very last penny any debt we may have owed the west ukraine s fate depends not just on the valour of its soldiers or resilience of its people but also on external factors it cannot control the inscrutable calculations of russia s despotic ruler and the fortitude of its friends the benefits to the west of the war are already clear russia has been enormously weakened making europe s flank much easier to defend for ukraine which has suffered horrific losses the outcome looks much less certain visit our revised ukraine hub to read the best

over the past five years the united states largest independent oil and gas company exxon mobil nyse xom has mostly focused its exploratory activities in south america last month the oil major announced that it had made two new discoveries at the sailfin 1 and yarrow 1 wells in the stabroek block offshore guyana potentially adding more barrels to one of the most closely watched new oil discoveries exxonmobil has now made more than 30 discoveries on the block since 2015 and has ramped up offshore development and production at a pace that far exceeds the industry average in contrast exxon s exploits in africa have been few and far between with its last discovery on the continent coming nearly two decades ago but exxon has now announced that it has together with its partners discovered hydrocarbons in block 15 off angola in the bavuca south prospect this was the block s 18th discovery but the first since 2003 according to exxon the valaris ds 9 drillship drilled the bavuca south 1 well 365 km northwest from the coast at luanda in 1 100 m 3 608 ft of water encountering 30 m 98 ft of good quality hydrocarbon bearing sandstone exxon owns a 36 interest in the block with bp exploration angola 24 eni angola exploration 18 equinor angola block 15 12 and sonangol p p 10 being its partners africa s oil gas opportunities the last big fossil fuel discovery on the continent dates back to 2010 after texas based anadarko corp now a subsidiary of occidental petroleum corp and italian energy giant eni s p a nyse e discovered approximately 180 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves equivalent to 29 billion barrels of oil in mozambique s supergiant offshore basin of rovuma immediately catapulting the south african nation to a potential global lng superpower as you might expect there was a stampede by oil and gas majors including exxonmobil totalenergies nyse tte shell nyse shel and china national petroleum corp nyse snp coming in to stake their claims unfortunately widespread terrorism and the growing menace of piracy have constantly held back progress with mozambique fast joining the league of african nations grappling with a resource curse the security crisis in the northern region of cabo delgado had displaced hundreds of thousands of people created a humanitarian crisis and even forced totalenergies to declare force majeure on its massive natural gas investment in the country but the tides have now turned and mozambique has managed to get its act together just in time the country is now poised to ship its first cargo of liquefied natural gas lng overseas in november at a time when europe is desperately trying to cut energy ties with russia experts have estimated that mozambique can earn in excess of 100b from its natural gas assets over the next 30 years related oil on track for another weekly loss despite price spike bp has already inked a deal to buy all of the output from eni s 7 billion coral sul project capable of producing 3 4 million metric tons of lng per year for the next 20 years meanwhile totalenergies has announced plans to resume its massive 20 billion project toward the end of the year with the terminal expected to churn out 13 1 million tons of lng annually in addition exxonmobil says it will make a final decision for an even larger project in the near future meanwhile the european union has planned a five fold increase in financial support to 15 million to fight militants near mozambique s gas projects the eu has already pledged to provide the country s army with an additional 45 million euros 45 million of financial support and has so far given a sadc mission in the country 2 9 million euros of funding on its part mozambique has laid out plans to set up a sovereign wealth fund toward the end of 2022 with 50 of the fund s revenues to be reinjected into the fund while the remaining 50 will go to the government s budget during the first 20 years of lng production mozambique has the potential to move up the ladder and become a middle income nation over the next two decades if it plays its cards right vijaya ramachandran director for energy and development at the breakthrough institute says germany and europe should look to africa if they are serious about achieving energy security ramachandran notes that the continent is endowed with substantial natural gas reserves and new discoveries in the process of being tapped very little of africa s gas has been exploited either for domestic consumption or export algeria is already an established major gas producer with substantial untapped reserves and is connected to spain with several undersea pipelines germany and the eu are already working to expand pipeline capacity connecting spain with france from where more algerian gas could flow to germany and elsewhere libyan gas fields are connected by pipeline to italy in both algeria and libya europe should urgently help tap new fields and increase gas production new pipelines under discussion currently focus on the eastern mediterranean pipeline project which would bring gas from israel s offshore gas fields to europe but the biggest african sources lie south of the sahara including nigeria which has about a third of the continent s reserves and tanzania senegal has recently discovered major offshore fields ramachandra says europe should not ignore these opportunities for instance the proposed trans saharan pipeline will bring gas from nigeria to algeria via niger if the project is completed the new pipeline will connect to the existing trans mediterranean maghreb europe medgaz and galsi pipelines that supply europe from transmission hubs on algeria s mediterranean coast the trans saharan pipeline would be more than 2 500 miles long and could supply as much as 30 billion cubic meters of nigerian gas to europe per year equivalent to about two thirds of germany s 2021 imports from russia for comparison purposes the yamal europe pipeline one of the major routes for russian gas to europe is 2 607 mile long on its part nigeria is enthusiastic about exporting some of its 200 trillion cubic foot reserves of gas with nigerian vice president yemi osinbajo arguing in favor of natural gas critical role both as a relatively clean transition fuel and as a driver of economic development and foreign exchange earner unfortunately the trans saharan pipeline will likely take a decade or more to complete and lng shipments to europe would bring quicker relief unfortunately europe s biggest gas importer germany has not built a single lng import terminal as part of its policy to make the country dependent on russian gas and in turn make russia more dependent on germany but there s hope berlin has already renounced its old ways and says it will now build lng infrastructure luckily for germany and other stranded eu nations ramachandran says lng loading ports can be built reasonably quickly in africa with the greater tortue ahmeyin field an offshore gas deposit straddling the maritime border between senegal and mauritania a prime example when the field comes online next year it will place the two west african nations among africa s top gas producers floating liquefaction plants above the offshore gas field produce liquefy store and transfer the gas to lng tankers that ship it directly to importing countries while the initial production from this field will be small it is slated to double in a few years and the field sits within a larger basin of natural gas with substantially greater reserves elsewhere in africa too gas production will continue to expand as projects in tanzania mozambique and other countries come online in the next few years developing a gas pipeline as big as the trans saharan pipeline will likely present many challenges as it runs through regions plagued by conflict and insurgency but these kinds of projects could alleviate europe s energy crisis while also

editor s note on march 4 russia enacted a law that criminalizes public opposition to or independent news reporting about the war in ukraine the law makes it a crime to call the war a war rather than a special military operation on social media or in a news article or broadcast the law is understood to penalize any language that discredits russia s use of its military in ukraine calls for sanctions or protests russia s invasion of ukraine it punishes anyone found to spread false information about the invasion with up to 15 years in prison the director general of the russian international affairs council on how the midterm elections in the u s exposed a split in the society if european political tradition associates the color red with leftist radicals and revolution in american tradition to the contrary it belongs to conservatives and stands primarily for the republican party which has positioned itself to the right of center on the political spectrum the democratic party situated more to the left is usually depicted as blue many experts and politicians predicted a red wave or a red tsunami that is a decisive victory for the republicans and a crushing defeat for the democrats prior to the nov 8 midterm elections it seemed there were good reasons to expect such an outcome including a vast range of social and economic problems the democrats had not solved from high inflation to street crime from uncontrolled immigration to the decline of financial markets that was in addition to a not very charismatic and not very popular president suffering from dwindling public support who was unable to unite the country in the first two years of his term there was also a deep internal and almost unsolvable conflict in the democrats camp between moderate centrists aligned with the respected clans of hillary and bill clinton and barack obama and radical progressive supporters of the restless senator from vermont the democratic socialist bernie sanders political tradition in the united states in recent decades is that the minority party usually has the upper hand over the party whose leader resides in the white house during midterm elections however there was no red wave the republican gains in the house appear to be more modest the democrats will most likely manage to hold the senate vote counts will continue over several more weeks but it s already clear that in the next two years we won t see the classic divided government the gap between the two parties is too small and there is serious doubt about the republicans ability to maintain a unified front with respect to the issues on the domestic and global agenda besides president joe biden spent 36 years in congress and is recognized as a master in forming two party alliances and coalitions still a republican majority in the house can draw a lot of blood from both the democratic administration and their democratic colleagues on capitol hill so why did the republicans suffer such a relative failure in the midterms it probably isn t the strength of their opponents it is the party s own weakness and tactical errors in their struggle against liberals american conservatives shifted too far to the right for a good example take very controversial supreme court decision on june 24 that removed abortion from the list of constitutional rights the republican camp is also split from within just like the democrats divided between committed trumpists and those who are just as committed to rejecting the 45th president accordingly the republicans were unable to attract the political center to their cause during the election and got far fewer votes than the experts predicted the results of the midterm elections with all their ambiguity attest to a personal victory for biden the president who many considered an obvious lame duck has won two more years to put his plans and programs into action given the current balance of power the republicans in congress will hardly be able to firmly block executive initiatives so the probability of biden running for a second term in 2024 has risen significantly if his health holds up donald trump despite celebratory rhetoric after the elections is in a worse position of course the republicans with added strength in the new congress will try to end the investigations into the former president but the recent election was not just a referendum on biden it was a test of trump s popularity now his standing as the one undisputed leader of the republican party is in question many of the former president s proteges lost in swing states it will be hard for trump to win his party s presidential nomination in 2024 harder than it seemed just a month ago it s likely that trump will face a constant struggle with ron desantis the republican governor of florida who was triumphantly reelected it s worth noting that desantis is more than three decades younger than trump but the main takeaway from the midterm elections is not in the victory of some american candidates and the defeat of others the vote showed that the u s remains split and this split apparent for a considerable while continues to widen so far neither the republicans nor the democrats have a coherent strategy to resolve this divide anytime soon editor s note the final votes in several races remained undecided and thus the majorities in the house and senate were not final at the time this article was originally published

your request please try again later if you continue to have this issue please contact customerservice slackinc com back to healio philadelphia the understanding of long covid its symptoms and even its definition continues to rapidly change amid a flood of data according to leonard h calabrese do and alfred kim md phd at acr convergence 2022 the story within the story of covid 19 is trying to get our head around this concept of long covid calabrese professor of medicine at the cleveland clinic lerner college of medicine of case western reserve university rj fasenmyer chair of clinical immunology at the cleveland clinic and chief medical editor of healio rheumatology said in his presentation this is not a 10 minute discussion the story within the story of covid 19 is trying to get our head around this concept of long covid leonard calabrese do told attendees at acr convergence 2022 source adobe stock kim assistant professor in the division of medicine at the school of medicine at washington university in st louis meanwhile noted the rapidly evolving field of covid 19 research leonard calabrese alfred kim it is moving at a breakneck speed he said the two experts cohosted a virtual community hub on long covid at the acr meeting according to calabrese and kim the body of research into covid 19 is keeping pace with the virus which means that a flood of studies in long covid is also beginning to emerge we are starting to learn how to identify it a little bit better kim said early epidemiology suggests that between one third and 40 of patients with covid 19 experience some lingering subjective symptoms at 3 months or longer after acute infection according to calabrese however he added that as time stretches on it is possible that some patients may continue to experience long covid symptoms for up to 18 months after acute infection another challenge is that the definition of long covid itself remains elusive there are at least 50 and maybe more than 200 that have been attributed to long covid according to calabrese it is a lot of symptomatology to weave ourselves through he said one consideration is that it is important to differentiate between types of long covid calabrese added on one hand there are clearly defined sequelae such as myocarditis hypercoagulability pulmonary scarring and stroke for these conditions the mechanism is understood on the other hand there are also medically unexplained symptoms calabrese said that is dominated by chronic fatiguability he said adding that cognitive complaints and dysautonomia also fall into this category poor sleep and post exertional malaise that can put a patient into crash and burn mode for extended periods have also been reported according to calabrese along with poor executive function compromised vision and issues multi tasking kim added that understanding circadian dysfunction may aid rheumatologists in identifying and defining these sleep and fatigue related outcomes he noted that the presence of tau in the cerebrospinal fluid which is also seen in rheumatic diseases like lupus could be an area of future research in this population regarding risk factors for long covid severe acute infection tops the list however patients with mild or asymptomatic disease have also reported ongoing symptoms women are more likely to report long covid symptoms as are older individuals protection from long covid can start in one place don t get covid 19 calabrese said vaccination is also likely to reduce the risk for these complications meanwhile more recent data are suggesting that prompt use of antiviral therapy may palpably decrease risk according to calabrese treatments targeting long covid do not exist as yet thus many clinicians find themselves in the difficult position of managing a condition that is poorly defined and has no clear therapeutic options with that in mind calabrese urged empathy i tell people that this is not in their head that this is a real condition he said it is not their fault i tell them i hear you although empathy is not a substitute for effective therapy validating patients can be beneficial in managing whatever symptomatology any given patient is experiencing for kim it is important to understand that many other infectious diseases have demonstrated post infectious sequelae he suggested that other viruses and previous epidemics could ultimately hold clues to the management of long covid this is not a new concept he said

in an era of rampant wildfires tropical cyclones and the worst floods in a decade the outcome of this year s un climate conference cop27 is set to determine the fate of millions of africans the 17 day event held in the sinai resort of sharm el sheikh in egypt comes as african governments grapple with spiralling debt a global food crisis and the fallout of an acceleration of existential climate induced natural disasters cop27 the 27th conference to be held under the auspices of the un framework convention on climate change provides a forum for world governments to discuss how to deal with the effects of climate change although africa only contributes about 4 of all global emissions scientists say it is the world s most vulnerable region to climate change the implementation cop cop has been criticised in the past for being all talk and no action african negotiators went to cop26 in glasgow last year with an ambitious list of demands to fight climate change but experts say the summit failed africa and efforts to avert a climate crisis this year the egyptian presidency has set out the goal of making cop27 the implementation cop where commitments are transferred into action related article the conference is focusing on four main areas mitigation adaptation finance collaboration the event began with two days of addresses by world leaders which are being followed by thematic days that include panel discussions roundtables and side events an important victory for developing countries in the lead up to the conference was managing to place the contentious issue of loss and damage on the agenda this goes beyond discussion of ways to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change to examining the ways in which the world s poorest countries have already suffered great human and economic losses through climate change and how they should be compensated for it day 1 sunday egypt s foreign minister sameh shoukry was formally elected as the cop27 president during the opening plenary following which he called on countries to show faith in multilateralism over the next two weeks as they negotiate to deliver on the goals of the climate convention and the paris agreement addressing climate envoys and delegates he said it comes as no surprise to anyone that the cop is being held this year in a world which is witnessing political turmoil that cast a long shadow on all our nations and has resulted in energy and food crises however these challenges should be no reason for delaying our collective effort to fight climate change it is inherent on us all in sharm el sheikh to demonstrate our recognition of the magnitude of the challenges we face and our steadfast resolve to overcome it day 2 monday as global leaders opened the summit with speeches on monday macky sall president of senegal and chair of the african union au laid out the continent s stall we have come as africans to sharm el sheikh in order to save our planet we are determined to make history rather than simply being victims he said even if africa only contributes less than 4 of greenhouse gas emissions africa subscribes to the ultimate goal of carbon neutrality but within the framework of a concerted fair and equitable energy transition instead of unilateral decisions that harm our development processes including universal access to electricity of which 600m africans are still deprived sall said senegal s president macky sall leaves the stage after addressing the leaders summit on 8 november 2022 photo mohammed abed afp for sall the development of a fair and equitable transition will be no less than an acceptance that africa be allowed to continue its development of gas reserves as he has pointed out in a number of speeches during his tenure as chair of the au but the issue remains a fraught one with some environmentalists arguing that establishing gas industries will only distract from the crucial embrace of renewables like solar wind and hydro as one of several african countries that could play host to a major emerging lng industry senegal has every reason to put gas firmly on the agenda while the debate will continue to rage many african leaders will see the issue of gas as a major test of whether richer world powers will allow poorer nations to balance their development with climate commitments or set one rule for themselves and another for the rest solving the gas conundrum could be key to a solid outcome from the talks day 3 tuesday in his address on the second day of national declarations by global leaders president nana akufo addo of ghana criticised the failure of developed countries to make good on their 13 year old pledge to make 100bn available annually to developing countries to fight the effects of climate change it is critical in this regard that the developed world makes good its long delayed pledge to mobilise and make available 100bn annually to the poorer countries to assist in the fight against climate change and commit as agreed at cop26 in glasgow to doubling resources for adaptation he said the president of host country egypt abdel fattah al sisi together with the norwegian prime minister jonas gahr støre attended the commissioning ceremony for the continent s first green hydrogen plant located in the suez canal economic zone in egypt sisi also witnessed the signing of an agreement to develop one of the world s largest onshore wind projects in egypt alongside the president of the united arab emirates uae the memorandum of understanding was penned between the uae s state backed renewable energy firm masdar egypt s main renewable energy developer infinity and hassan allam utilities a statement on news agency wam said tuesday s proceedings also marked the launch of the africa carbon markets initiative acmi a bid to support the production of african carbon credits while also ensuring that carbon credit revenues are transparent equitable and channelled towards job creation day 4 wednesday wednesday was the first of the conference s thematic days focusing on finance climate proofing the continent s most vulnerable communities and ensuring the continent has the cashflow to deal with the fall out of natural disasters has dominated the agenda at cop27 the international capital market association icma which sets the rules in the bond market laid out plans for countries hit by climate induced natural disasters such as flooding and hurricanes to automatically freeze debt payments the icma introduced new climate resilient debt clauses or cdrcs specifically targeting low income countries that governments can plug into soveriegn bonds they sell to raise money on global capital markets with many african countries on the brink or knee deep in a debt crisis the mechanism will allow them to pause debt payments for a maximum of 2 years to free up cash flow to provide aid and assistance to battle climate disasters also on wednesday a group of over 85 african insurers unveiled the african climate risk facility acrf to help climate proof the continent s most vulnerable communities the commitment will provide protection for 1 4bn people against floods droughts and tropical cyclones by providing 14bn in climate risk insurance to 2030 to african sovereigns cities aid agencies and ngos both measures will help to bridge the gaping climate risk financing gap on the continent as rich nations continue to shrug off demands for compensation for countries due to loss or damage caused by global warming in addition the african union the african development bank group and africa50 in partnership with several global partners launched the alliance for green infrastructure in africa agia an initiative to help scale and accelerate financing for green infrastructure projects on the continent related article day 5 thursday day 4 of cop27 brought science to the forefront of the discussions around climate change at the event unified global scientific research academics stressed the need for science to consistently guide the response to the climate crisis and highlighted the vital importance of data sharing within the scientific community for that to happen in africa unlocking finance for the continent s research centres and universities is crucial since 1990 african scientists have received less than 15 of the funds allocated to global climate change research even when research funding focuses on african topics 78 goes to researchers based in the united states and europe scientists based in africa have long stressed that funding needs to be rebalanced if they are to take their place in the frontline on the battle against climate change as well as this key discussion several africa related climate financing announcements were made on thursday the us government s millennium challenge corporation mcc along with usaid announced that they will work together to expand the use of green financing in low and lower middle income countries especially targeting mozambique and zambia through a joint green finance pilot program in total mcc has invested roughly 1 5bn in climate related activities between 2015 2020 and expects to invest an additional 1bn between 2021 2024 the african finance corporation and the islamic development bank through the islamic corporation for the insurance of investment and export credit say they will cooperate in promoting joint action in the origination financing and execution of climate action projects through credit and investment insurance support in african member states day 6 friday panel discussions around pathways to decarbonise the highest emitting economic sectors gathered high ranked personalities such as john kerry us special presidential envoy for climate and dr amani abou zeid commissioner for infrastructure energy and digitalisation at the african union us climate envoy john kerry gives a press conference at cop27 on 12 november 2022 photo ahmad gharabli afp the debate is of significant importance for african economies in countries prone to economic instability and inflation and where the funding of public services is constantly challenged reducing emissions is not always the number one priority especially as the continent contributes less than 4 of the greenhouse gas emissions however the transition in the developed world as currently conceived cannot be realised without the natural resources wind sun water and raw materials from the african continent africa thus stands to benefit greatly from developing its renewable resources the question for african leaders therefore is how to enable fast growing renewables developments that will help africa itself and the rest of the world to reduce emissions while at the same time fostering economic development at home as the ceo of the africa finance corporation said at the africa renewables forum which took place on thursday the crisis we are facing now is about resources and africa is instrumental to the solution we must focus on exporting value added products for the structural transformation of our economies no african countries can reduce their carbon footprints alone or ignore the crucial importance of economic development however they can create value and livelihoods by helping the world decarbonise and realise huge financial gains from it it s a win win situation day 8 monday one week into the conference and pressures are mounting over the myriad details of a potential climate deal and an agreement to shield and compensate climate vulnerable countries from the fallout of global warming day 8 of the conference was a watershed moment as the un published a text outlining funding arrangements for addressing loss and damage for countries hit by natural disasters the plan which aims to have a decision no later than 2024 may include a fund that would allow parties to launch a process for compensation the same day the g8 launched a plan called global shield which aims to rapidly mobilise pre arranged insurance and disaster protection finance after events such as floods droughts and hurricanes now starting the globalshield high level launch at thecvf and v20 pavilion cop27 pic twitter com wee9eamlvs v20 finance ministers v20group november 14 2022 the launch of the global shield initiative at cop27 on monday over the next few months the scheme intends to rapidly mobilise pre arranged insurance and disaster protection finance after events such as floods droughts and hurricanes in places like pakistan ghana fiji and senegal global shield will be backed by 175 million in funding from germany and 41 million from other donors including denmark and ireland but given that the plan is based on insurance payments as opposed to grants sceptics have raised fears that this could add to the spiralling costs of already cash strapped governments other climate activists fear that wealthier g7 countries are pushing the plan as a substitute for a loss and damage fund adding to tensions is anxiety among negotiators about resolving the byzantine details of a climate deal in time for the summit s scheduled close on friday stay tuned as we watch the week s events unfold day 9 tuesday as talks in sharm entered their final week tuesday marked an energy themed day with efforts to expand access to clean electricity dominating the discussion two new initiatives were launched as ministers and industry leaders met for the 9th day the global renewable hydrogen council initiative aimed at accelerating green hydrogen projects in africa and the africa just affordable energy transition initiative to facilitate affordable energy for at least 300 million people on the continent bloomberg also released the 2022 edition of its annual climatescope survey providing critical and timely insights into the state of africa s energy sector the good news is that the total installed power generating capacity on the continent jumped from 111gw in 2006 to 249gw in 2021 an impressive 123 increase however this represents just 3 of installed global capacity a share which has remained stable over the past 15 years despite the continent s burgeoning power hungry population but the report shows signs that decision makers are starting to grasp the opportunities offered by renewables in 2021 36 out of 42 markets in africa had policies targeting renewable energy the survey shows but the missing ingredient is legislative frameworks to put pressure on governments and translate policy to action only if financial and regulatory barriers are addressed can solar energy in sub saharan africa reach over 400gw in 2050 and close the continent s electricity gap as bnef s new energy outlook predicts cop27 provides the right platform to launch progressive initiatives to electrify africa now it s the job of legislators to act on them additional reporting by david thomas leo komminoth and charles dietz

in addition to the ongoing hilarity of elon musk s attempts to stop people from making fun of him by turning the verification process into an unverifiable nft that ended up costing brands billions of dollars in stock value through grassroots pr manipulations it seems that nü twitter has also been censoring some articles that criticized elon musk and his ownership of twitter from mediaite twitter deemed a mediaite article that is critical of the company s new owner elon musk as potentially spammy on friday night and diverted users to a warning page when they click the post the warning had been removed as of saturday morning after multiple media outlets including this one reported on it twitter users who clicked on the article in their timelines were taken to a page telling them the link violates the company s url policy and that it may be unsafe the link you are trying to access has been identified by twitter or our partners as being potentially spammy or unsafe in accordance with twitter s url policy the message read this link could fall into any of the below categories in addition to the obvious overall irony of elon musk claiming to care about free speech read his privileged individual right to misgender people and say racist shit without being criticized it s worth noting that this is also essentially the same sort of censorship that befell the new york post s early reporting on the hunter biden laptop scandal and to be fair that was a dumb idea on the part of twitter and facebook et al yet somehow i don t think that elon musk s twitter censoring elon musk s twitter for criticizing elon musk s twitter is going to become a constant topic of high profile right wing punditry for the next two years remember folks parody on twitter is bad even though twitter itself is a parody of itself going forward accounts engaged in parody must include parody in their name not just in bio elon musk elonmusk november 11 2022 twitter flags mediaite post critical of elon musk as potentially spammy i m not saying that there was actually any information of value in the post s reporting on the laptop nor that the decision to publish the information was made in good faith but rather that the decision to censor a story that was essentially a nothingburger in some supposedly overly cautious effort to avoid amplifying propaganda or disinformation was not a great choice

prof ndi okereke onyiuke is a former director general of the nigerian stock exchange she tells babatunde tugbobo about her life career and other issues you studied business administration finance and computer science what informed your career choice i met a friend at city university new york united states of america who is now my best friend her name is europa gay i initially thought she was a student because of her petite stature but it turned out she was my lecturer i told her that women were not given a lot of opportunities to excel i told her i wanted to be like the men go to the university and have my phd and she was impressed i told her i wanted to study a course that men studied so that i would learn from them and beat them so she guided me she gave me a list of courses that were studied by many men business administration finance and computer science were part of them and they caught my fancy did your parents influence the choice of your career not at all my father wanted me to be a doctor but i could not stand the sight of blood so i did not go in that line he actually refused to send money to me after my first year of studying business administration so i had to train myself my friend gay taught me how to study full time and also work full time what was your career trajectory before you joined the nigerian stock exchange now ngx i started my career on wall street new york i was interested in the amount of money they reported every evening on the new york stock exchange news so i told my friend about it and she informed me that the industry was dominated by men and i would not be given a chance i then wore my traditional attire went to a firm on wall street and demanded to see the third person in command i was allowed in and he was mesmerised by my boldness i eventually got the job 14 years later i moved to nigeria my movement to the nse was prompted by the plan by the then council to recruit a technical person to assist the market in setting up trading it was during the era of the late sir mobolaji bank anthony as the president of the exchange the man and his team were instrumental to my joining the organisation you rose through the ranks to become the director general of the exchange how were you able to surmount the pressure of working in a male dominated environment and excel working at the new york stock exchange was completely different from the nse in new york i was treated the same way as the male staff however the situation was different in nigeria at the time the only women who worked there were typists i was chosen to come to the nse because of my competence the president of the new york stock exchange and the third person in command were the ones who recommended me so i was in no small position for the men at the stock exchange to look down on did you envisage that you would get to the position of the director general of the nigeria stock exchange i did not really envisage that i would become the director general because i just came to set it up and go back to my job in the usa which i took a leave of absence from but god has been kind to me i was able to excel in my job and the council had confidence in me when my boss the late apostle hanford alile retired in 1999 the council did not have any issue with me succeeding him having worked under him it was not difficult to work with my colleagues to move the exchange to the next level the stock market is a field on its own it is highly technical and the chief executive officer must be knowledgeable about the market s architecture one good thing about the exchange during our days was the premium placed on staff training we exposed our staff to international training at various levels the exchange was blessed with a crop of talented staff in all departments we partnered with our stockbrokers to achieve many goals without stockbrokers there is no market they are multidimensional professionals some of them were former bank chief executives we tapped into the talents of our stockbrokers to implement enlightenment programmes as the dg of the nigerian stock exchange what were the notable roles you played i did not do anything different when i was the dg because from the first day i set it up i trained a lot of people i came to help nigeria have the number one stock exchange in the world and i kept doing that the system runs an organisation we had put a proper structure in place to ensure that the system was up and running whether the ceo was around or not the same applied to departmental heads we spot highly talented staff engaged them with tasks and rewarded them accordingly there was no dull moment for anyone you were one of the most powerful women in business circles during your tenure as the nse dg how were you able to properly channel the influence you had only god is powerful laughs we are mere mortals if one is in a powerful position where one has to supervise practically the whole economy including banks stock broking firms investment houses real estate and oil and gas companies one needs to thread softly if one is in the midst of men one has to make sure that one is friendly with all of them i worked that way and made sure i achieved results many times i actually forgot i was a woman because every day i was surrounded by men as a woman in such position one should not antagonise men or rub it in their faces that one has the power of office to deal with them rather one ought to show them friendship and at the same time be firm and do one s work accordingly so i got along with all of them how were you able to record laudable achievements having worked at the new york stock exchange before i came to nigeria i was already used to working with men i looked at the way people related to the stock exchange in usa if one went to the trading floor one would identify everybody by their first names what i did here that i am proud of was that i brought many women into the financial system i talked to them counselled them and also talked about how to handle men every month i used my personal money to have lunch with them i would call their bosses to say we were going to have a women s meeting we would have lunch and discuss we always used the opportunity to share problems women faced in their respective offices including the ones who had male bosses and a few who supervised men i really accomplished that among women bankers insurers corporate individuals and those in the oil sectors i set an example by behaving well so women were not afraid anymore among men at the time i came there was hardly any female ceo however i never let it get into my head i saw it as a call to serve and it was the same discipline i set for my staff we worked as one family with a unity of purpose when an employee works with an ownership mentality the organisation will thrive that was our story what was the toughest decision you took as the chief executive officer of the nse we prevented a breach of our listing requirements by turning down an application by a prominent nigerian to buy a quoted company without disclosure of identity i also believe that one of the toughest decisions i made was to get the board members of the exchange to accept that women could sit with them on the trading floor and become stockbrokers laughs running a stock market requires many tough decisions what was your most memorable moment as the dg of nse that would be the day i became the director general of the exchange i was just doing my job and i never envisaged that i would reach the pinnacle of my career i was excited on that day because it became clear to me that the exchange had met all the criteria to be admitted into the world federation of exchanges it was a great day for me and my colleagues we struggled to meet their requirements including their rules regulations trading style market and a whole lot more i was glad we succeeded the demutualisation of the exchange started during your tenure in 2001 what informed that decision and what were the envisaged challenges what informed the decision was simple if one does not demutualise the public will not feel the effects because they do not understand what it is but if one demutualises it becomes a public limited company if one does that one would get full membership and worldwide recognition from the wfe we started the process and the council approved it the stockbrokers who are members of the exchange that is the stock broking firms not the traders themselves also approved it the owners of stock broking firms are the members of the exchange who constitute the shareholders so it was approved and all the documentation was done before i retired that was the last assignment i wanted to finish before leaving the exchange how did the idea start i borrowed from what i learnt at the new york stock exchange and from capital market teachers at the university i won t say it was my own making i reproduced what i was taught as a student and that is what being a good student is about one should learns and not just regurgitate what one has been taught just to pass an examination but years later one can reproduce the same thing and that is what i did however i must also recognise that it was a collective effort of the board management staff market regulators and operators the market was more than mature already if people were not afraid to let go i would have listed the nigerian stock exchange since 2000 at the beginning of the new millennium i made the proposal for listing the nigerian stock exchange on the nigerian stock exchange and to take it further for about five years to list it on the london stock exchange united kingdom new york stock exchange usa and the johannesburg stock exchange south africa which the council more or less had approved before i left it was a project i wanted to start as far back as 2005 so that not only would i finish listing it on those stock exchanges but also watch it stabilise was there any concern of regulatory approval at the initial stage the only aspect i did not support and which i consider illogical was for the management of the exchange to go to the national assembly in abuja to seek permission to go public if one wants to list one s company would one go to the national assembly to seek permission no it is a company and we had done all we needed to do we notified the securities and exchange commission which is a government organ set up to oversee from a distance so that they can report to the government whatever is happening in the stock market they were not to supervise the market but to oversee it so that they can report to the government that is what secs do all over the world if a bank wants to raise money in the stock market or wants to go to the market does it go to report to the national assembly no they would only notify the central bank of nigeria and the cbn would look at their books to see whether they qualify for the listing requirements before i left we had already notified the cbn notification is different from going to defend and answer questions about why the exchange shares should be listed on its platform what are the benefits of demutualisation liquidity is not usually cited as a primary reason for demutualisation rather it is implied the benefit is however very explicit demutualising the nse will result in the exchange s ability to generate increased trading volumes this trading volume translates into significant inflows of capital hence liquidity for investors it also translates into profits for the exchange as an independent company examples of transactions that will attract liquidity include exchange services for derivatives trading clearance and settlement the prominence of the exchange traded fund as well has attracted high trading volumes in most exchanges exchanges demutualise in reaction to competition and technological innovations on the competitive front the nse would be run as an efficient business enterprise in this environment the promise of demutualisation is that along with the capital necessary for investment in technology the boards of newly demutualised exchanges provide a new corporate governance structure that is more effective in managing conflicts among participants in corporate lingo the new exchange would be designed to maximise the residual value of the enterprise that accrues to the shareholders the financial sector has always been excited by new technology it should therefore come as no surprise that changes in the structure of stock exchanges have coincided with periods of greater technological upheaval as a business responding to competition from other exchanges there is an ever present need to stay ahead of the game on the technological front innovation in communication and data processing technologies hold a strong appeal to investors who now understand that data is king how does a demutualised market benefit foreign investors there is a lot of value in our market because it has been fully tapped and many stocks are trading below intrinsic values foreign investors need to be assured that our market is transparent listing the exchange on its own market means it can also get listed on the other exchanges on our plan list we are already members of the wfe so it makes it easier for us to list in london once we have the london listing it will be much easier to get new york or germany or any other country that is what we should be gunning for luckily during my tenure i took a lot of the stockbrokers to the london stock exchange they made personal contacts with stockbrokers there a lot of the fund managers such as jp morgan and morgan stanley met us because the ceo of the new york stock exchange at the time dick grassol who was once my boss had hosted us at the new york stock exchange they hosted us jointly with the united nations he encouraged the united nations to give us that exposure and we held that meeting at the place where the united nations security council holds its meetings not the ordinary board room it was grassol who liaised with the person at the united nations that was in charge of the african business group that we got the security council of the united nations to tell them about the nse many people were invited by the new york stock exchange on our behalf and a lot of those fund managers were there so it would make our listing much easier when we go to talk to them some of them that are still there will remember even if grassol is not there tomorrow they would know that on such a date something like that happened he invited some people including the number one insurance company in france which now operates in nigeria because of that outing one of the issues in the nigerian stock exchange is the failure of companies to adhere to post listing requirements how were you able to tackle them we tackled them with love and enforcement of post listing rules we sanctioned when necessary investor protection is at the core of our functions at one point granting margin loans to stock broking firms became controversial but today some stockbrokers are calling for margin loans as one of the strategies to boost transactions in the securities market what is your advice it should have been done a long time ago it is a good way of empowering our dealing member firms margin loans should not be stopped because some people had defaulted there are rules guiding the loans it is good for market operators because it is tax deductible it has its own challenges but it is a normal loan to drive activities in the market after your exit from the nse you have continually shown interest in stock broking what is the reason behind your sustained interest it has become a part of me stockbrokers are wealth creators women have made serious contributions to the growth and development of the capital market by removing the stigma of gender inequality in many professions they have achieved this by using their god given sixth sense the chartered institute of stockbrokers should work towards holding a forum to encourage those who have derived wealth from the market to support the millennials who lack the wherewithal to participate in the market during the inauguration of the president of the cis you canvassed that the nnpc should opt for an initial public offering and seek a quotation on the securities market can you expatiate on your position i canvassed vigorously that nnpc should go for an initial public offering to raise huge funds with ease and make nigerians part owners it should consummate this with listing on the securities market as quoted companies attract investors because of terms and conditions attached to the listing investors have more confidence in such companies if nnpc is listed its accounts would be accessible to the investing public i tell nigerians not to shy away from raising money from the stock market governments take money to build factories and they die they build trains but because of lack of supervision they die if it is quoted on the stock market and nigerians buy shares the managers will sit up and play according to international business rules do you believe that the federal government is fully utilising the capital market to finance the economy no that is what i will keep saying never we have always told the government to raise funds from the market to provide infrastructure rather than going on a borrowing spree the market option is a win win affair between the government and the capital market stolen funds should not be used to develop other economies they should use such funds to grow their own economy by investing in the stock exchange oil and gas and other sectors that will benefit them and the country the stock market has been more on a bullish run in recent times what are the opportunities for investors in a period like this yes for investors that have money this is the best time to buy because the market is down but the companies fundamentals are still strong before it becomes bullish again it will take a little while every investor must work closely with a stockbroker this will help the investor to have a clearly defined investment objective and understand his risk tolerance time horizon and other determinants of the type of portfolio he needs many got their fingers burnt in 2008 because they wrongly mistook the capital market for the short term although there are speculators who take the highest level of risk investment in the capital market is basically for the medium and long term are there policy measures that the government can put in place to attract investors into the capital market of course there are ways by which government can attract companies into the securities market aside from the patronage of the market to raise long term funds as a demonstration of confidence in the market there are policy measures that can be deployed for instance a tax holiday of about three years is a carrot that can galvanise companies into a listing the government s patronage of products and services among others can encourage companies to seek quotations during your tenure at the nse emphasis was placed on investor education why was that investor education is a continuous exercise as people across diverse backgrounds should be exposed to the benefits of investment in the securities market it is one area that every management of a stock market must pursue investor education and financial literacy are major projects that should involve both the capital market regulators and operators the continuous deployment of technology in the market implies a new method of doing things and all stakeholders should be empowered during my tenure we started education visits whereby we encouraged pupils in primary schools and students in college and tertiary institutions to visit the market we did this to let them see firsthand what they watched on television but more importantly we exposed them to the elementary principle of savings and investment they watched trading on the floor and interacted with stockbrokers called city gentlemen we encouraged them to become shareholders we later commenced an essay competition and used lagos state as a pilot it was highly successful and we extended it to other states as well as abuja we gave out shares as prizes for the winners we also leveraged sports to create awareness of investment in the securities market there was a year we bought shares for all under 17 football players investor education can take place in schools clubhouses churches and mosques it is said that no economy can survive during a conflict how is the insecurity in nigeria affecting the stock market the state of insecurity is preventing a lot of indigenous and foreign investors from investing because they do not trust the country other issues such as inflation exchange rate challenges and forex scarcity are headwinds that impact negatively on investment you played a key role in the formation of the transnational corporation of nigeria what can you tell us about the background of the company i was invited by the then president olusegun obasanjo to write the blueprint for the company the original concept was that transcorp would be a conglomerate similar to the south korean chaebol conglomerate transcorp has gone through many corporate transformations and it is currently doing well who are your role models the late sir mobolaji bank anthony and my friend europa gay laughs what do you consider to be the most memorable moment of your life i thank god that i have had many memorable moments in my life and career let me mention just two laughs the day the exchange went live in 1986 and the day women started trading as stockbrokers did you at any point in your career feel like quitting absolutely not i loved my job many nigerian youths want to travel out of the country to seek greener pastures what advice do you have for them i would advise them to think of nigeria first if they are going to work or broaden their horizon they should go there and make nigeria proud and come back to better the country with the knowledge gained how and where did you meet your husband we met at a party in the us laughs i was a very good dancer he noticed and asked some friends about me and they told him that at the time my father was the speaker of eastern nigeria he used that as an avenue to speak to me because he is a very shy person his father was also a minister in eastern nigeria so he asked me to dance what endeared him to you he could keep a conversation he is a very tall and handsome man and he was also very serious with his studies how are you enjoying your retirement i am now fully involved in consulting business i have been well exposed to the financial district and i can help to teach others i now train people in areas such as the stock market stock brokerage and the capital market i lecture people outside the stock market banking and capital market as well the more knowledge there is about the capital market the better for nigeria everything is not about the government the government does not create wealth the private sector does the government spends money and does not create wealth people should deemphasise government i do international consulting and reach out to lots of friends who are happy that i have retired i have more time to do consulting work i teach people how to make money everybody has acumen and mine may not be to make money but to teach others how to make money and then i benefit a little what is your favorite colour my favourite colour is purple what is your favorite food i particularly enjoy rice and plantain how do you unwind i do not unwind laughs i do not have the time for that i do not even watch movies i usually have a lot of visitors how do you like to dress i love dressing up fashionably even when i m home
amanda esposito of greenwood and anne sheehan of norway met by accident but they hit it off immediately kind of like well two geese pals as a gift to her mom sheehan s daughter put an ad in the newspaper looking for someone to help her mother clean around her new property amanda responded sheehan recalls then i found out she raised geese and we just clicked right away she still comes but we probably spend more time talking about our geese it turns out that s the way it often goes with the large fowl they re off the radar screen for most people even the most ardent animal lovers but those who give ownership a try often end up gushing about their geese wilton s eileen adams has had a geese gig for over 20 years and wrote many a sun journal column starring her finny a toulouse and sebastopol cross adams said geese first sparked her interest at the farmington fair where a breeder would bring some of his flock to show i don t know why i liked them so i got them and i ve had people ask why geese they re so grouchy you ve got to know how to handle them that s the thing you ve got to understand them they re just so fun sheehan started raising geese shortly before the pandemic began intrigued by her neighbor s flock esposito started shortly after esposito got her first goose a male named beaker over craigslist and committed her reluctant husband to help juggle the new responsibility while also keeping watch over new chickens and their hatchlings in progress advertisement this was definitely a covid whim we got the chickens then we got the ducks then we got the geese said esposito then i read geese should not be alone geese are companion animals usually mate for life and they need to socialize geese are also stellar parents and will take orphaned goslings under their wings so the espositos got another a female before their move to greenwood unfortunately the fowl were greeted by a bobcat which took the female goose but spared the rest of the birds in esposito s flock esposito said she loved the two geese together so she tracked down a guy in oregon who bred a variety called lavender ice american luckily a local breeder bought some of his stock so esposito took a female male pair and named them arwen and aragorn after characters in the lord of the rings though she wanted to even things up with a second female she adopted frank from a woman in vermont who was selling her home and could not bring her goose with her sheehan started off with a male and a female she got from her neighbor across the street i said really like your geese so she gave me two they were young and they were great and then the male got mature and then it got un great for instance getting the goose inside at night was a task he would flap and bite and do anything he could to drive sheehan away and waddle around at his leisure he would come after me and i d get my fingers out and hold his beak shut and literally lead him into the stall by a shut beak my neighbor and this is why the goose is no longer with us would get the backs of his legs chewed up if you went anywhere near any of them that s what he would do i didn t eat him because i couldn t bring myself to but i m pretty sure where he went did adams said geese can indeed be grouchy as their stereotype suggests but they are not always that way advertisement these are sebastopol said adams showing off her flock and they can be grouchy during the mating season but they re very unique each one of them they have their own personality it s like with any animal or person esposito s flock are approachable but 23 year old frank can be crotchety he sometimes socializes and keeps watch over the flock and other times meanders and wants to be by himself beaker has a crooked upper beak that makes it hard for him to bite but that doesn t take the ferocity out of his protective nature when he needs to show it particularly to the ducks when they get on his nerves as for arwen and aragorn they get along fine but it is aragorn and beaker who have become soul mates giving esposito plenty of entertainment beaker and aragorn are kind of in love and arwen gets left out all the time the boys have spent a lot of time mounting each other they re ridiculous but they were attached as babies i would bring them into the house at night to sleep in crates because i was worried about something eating them they would come marching into the house every night and get into their crates from the start they would go into the same crate together and always slept together for whatever reason they liked each other and they do everything together unfortunately for arwen frank is not an interested suitor over 20 years her senior frank is just too old said esposito frank really tries but he gets cranky his feathers get a little ruffled his eyes get a little squinty and i m like oh you re feeling mean today aren t you what i d like is a couple more females but you never know what you re getting before hatching sheehan took her neighbor s whole flock of fowl when the neighbors were no longer able to care for them that meant six geese and 13 ducks including her own sheehan has two embden two chinese and two toulouse geese the toulouse are two years old and the eldest of the flock and the others are under a year the female toulouse is not laying eggs due to the season which is typically between february and may and the others are too young but sheehan s ducks lay year round and that means plenty of eggs advertisement goose eggs are richer and huge compared to chicken eggs said sheehan they re good for custard and stuff like that the duck eggs are also richer my grandson insists they taste different i don t think they do but they do go further sheehan also used to keep chickens but they were all taken out by owls in their place much to sheehan s chagrin are three interloping raccoons which remain undeterred by sheehan s efforts to oust them from her barn they steer clear of the geese though she said all three geese owners acknowledged there is work and some challenges to raising geese sheehan said one thing you might want to have if you plan on raising geese is a pair of earplugs especially during mating season when they can get both noisy and mean the combination can be overwhelming the women said and then there s the day to day care like bedding bales of hay usually and an enclosed area predators cannot get into and protecting your garden they re great weeders but they re not discerning they would eat my vegetable garden if i let them says sheehan esposito puts the bottom half of a dog crate because her geese can t fit into a regular nesting box in a secluded spot so the geese have some privacy their needs are minimal esposito agreed shelter from night predators fresh water correct food the food is important but other than that they re low maintenance they don t get sick often they like grass and dandelion greens when you can find them they also graze down the grass but they re also selective about what they graze on sheehan said two challenges she s faced with her geese is the price of grain which has nearly doubled and providing the geese with water in the winter since it must be brought out in gallon jugs last year i had one of those tiny premade garden ponds that we dug a hole for and i set up this whole drainage system and i had a stock tank heater in there and the damn geese never went in it once last winter advertisement the women agreed that if you have the space the money to feed them and get to understand their basic needs you re all set as sheehan said since their personalities can be so different once you tune into their individual quirks they are well worth putting up with for the pleasures and entertainment they give back one time a couple of them got out somehow adams said they marched down the road to the next house and my husband went after them in the car gathered them back with the geese marching in front of the car and got them back home it was so funny they re great entertainment and i love them to pieces their loving and protecting nature makes them great pets said esposito the geese will always be the first to respond to commotion around the house and property just the other day i was cleaning something out on the patio and they came out to help me and help break down boxes and all of that said esposito they re curious super curious and they play with everything trying to figure everything out for the most part they re pretty mellow they re super easy to take care of the ducks need water constantly the geese not so much all i have to do is take a couple of sleds and fill them with water and they will be so happy with that the ducks will complain about it all winter long sheehan said she plans on trying chickens again if she can figure out how to keep them safe from the owls she will continue raising ducks even though they lay eggs everywhere get all muddy and splash around to clean themselves but the geese are where it s at she says they re so different they re just so stinkin cool noted esposito they re not for everybody i think you ve got to have the personality to match the goose i was outside with them every afternoon when they were babies i d just go sit out there read a book and they d sleep on my feet i d bring treats all the time so they re pretty well bonded to me to me it s worth the investment in time raising geese is not much different from owning any other pet you have to be devoted and give them attention every day adams said you have to be really constant they can get used to you and may even like you in their own goose way send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

impressive if you consider that we are now fully accounting for pro farm which is initially a negative ebitda contributor which we intend to quickly turn around in a positive contributor on this last point and as we discussed in our september call we have finalized the pro farm merger on july 1 and we have started the integration process during the reported quarter this transaction figure has changed to u s dollars as a function of guarantee in our main subsidiary in argentina which we believe will help us better reflect the reality of this business in our consolidated financials enrique will expand on this in his part of the presentation we will report on hb4 crop status in a few minutes hb4 soy planting underway and hb4 wheat harvest to start in the next few weeks finally we would like to use today s presentation to discuss the long term agreement we have recently released with syngenta seedcare to accelerate the expansion of our investment internationally discuss why we did it what is the expected benefits what is included and what is not included in the agreement before we move to the next slide to more deeply address each key highlights we also would like what else the completion of our share buyback program the program was launched back in march of 2020 and we have seen stocks approximately 570 000 shares with an average acquisition price of 8 77 cents we have new program opportunistically where we observe significant dislocation in the market and intend to continue to restore by refreshing the program for another 5 million on a volume basis please now turn slide 4 this slide shows the year over year growth of trailing comparable revenues for the last six quarters and the growth reported in the current quarter it is obviously not the same to grow at a 71 rate if you re coming from a flat year that when you re running at a 62 growth rate from the fiscal year immediately before we re very proud of this quarterâ s performance and enrique can further address each in his part of the presentation moving to slide 5 as we have already discussed we have completed the merger with pro farm and now have an unmatched platform for future growth in biological ag inputs positioning our company as a clear leader in sustainable solutions for the agriculture of the future with the integration of pro farm we now have an existing portfolio â or pipeline of products designed to replace or significantly reduce the use of synthetic chemicals in most functions for which they are required in high productivity agriculture where we can most immediately achieve this substitution is in the seed care segment of the industry as we will describe shortly when we discuss the long term collaboration agreement reach with one of the segment leaders syngenta before we do that let s review the status of hb4 crops in the next three slides severe drought conditions in argentina may transiently slow down sales in our second quarter the current quarter however and at the same time the drought is creating a unique opportunity to showcase hb4 technology with the country wide wheat crop decline expected to be at the 40 level compared to last yearâ s harvest as you know hb4 crops are drought tolerant not drought prone so we expect to lose some fields where the conditions have been too extreme and the crop will not be taken to harvest we think that 86 of the field will be harvested and provides good indication of the benefit of hb4 we believe also that we have enough inventories to stay on track and meet our fiscal year 2023 goal for wheat crop positioning us to reach the guidance provided for fiscal year 2024 in the next slide you can see the significant difference observed for one of our second generation materials when compared to isogenic non hb4 system line which is currently a top selling conventional variety in argentina we are looking forward to see these differences translate into yield benefits and report this in more detail in our next earnings call in the next slide we will provide a brief update on hb4 soy we re making good progress with the hb4 soy breeding and multiplication efforts with early season plantings well under way and with two varieties being scaled in brazil for an upcoming launch with multipliers next season importantly we have onboarded the four new licensees or germplasm providers covering genetics for argentina brazil the united states and south africa where we recently obtained feed and food clearance for both hb4 wheat and soy we re doing this while advancing our historical collaborations for instance we expect variety from grupo don mario to become available to multipliers next year in argentina and the following year in the united states let me now move to the next slide to discuss the announced long term collaboration with syngenta seedcare first what is seedcare it is a 4 billion to 5 billion segment in ag input market in which biologicals are currently at 20 of the segment with one third penetration resulting from inoculants our product categoory where we have achieved significant success in argentina and are starting to do so internationally biologicals in this segment are expected to reach 1 6 billion by the end of the decade and we believe it can be a clear winner in capturing that growth turning to the next slide to do this to be a clear winner we partnered with a segment leader syngenta seedcare we have been collaborating with syngenta seedcare for 20 years in argentina have jointly achieved and held the number one position for our inoculants bio fungicides and syngenta molecules for a long time this new collaboration creates the right structure to expand this success internationally at an accelerated pace we expect the international revenues generated by our inoculants alone to at least double in the next two years while syngenta will now cover working capital needs as well as sales and marketing activities we have secured minimum profits that average 23 million on a per year basis over the life of the agreement and this is not including an upfront fee of 50 million in exchange for the different rights granted for the collaboration on top of these annual minimum profits we will receive between 50 and 30 of the incremental profits generated by the collaboration depending on the geography and the year the collaboration is not just designed to maximize our commercial reach but it is also focused on accelerating our r d efforts with syngenta covering 70 of the r d investments required for early pipeline products and new products that we may opt to develop jointly within this framework finally and turning to the next slide we have not sold our inoculants business to syngenta we have partnered with syngenta to make this business far more relevant over the next 10 years the current agreement does not include profile portfolio it is retaining rights for us to use seed treatment solution in our hb4 farming as a service channel or hb4 program and we are also making sudden rights nonexclusive in the united states for the overall top solutions derived from products within the agreements we want to thank syngenta seedcare leadership for their trust and hard work to get to this point and reassure them of our full commitment to the success of this joint endeavor enrique all yours enrique lopez lecube thank you federico and thank you to everyone for joining us today we are delighted to have kicked off a new fiscal year with such a strong performance the result that we re reporting today built on top of outstanding growth achievements throughout the previous six quarters so i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank our sales and operational teams for doing a fantastic job at getting our technologies and products to market with relentless execution i will address the drivers behind our quarterly financial performance in the next few slides as federico outlined this was predominantly a very important quarter from a strategy standpoint we started the fiscal year on a strong note by completing the merger with pro farm then continue to make considerable progress on our integration efforts and synergy in the quarter simultaneously we executed an ironclad agreement with syngenta seedcare that created value on multiple fronts it provides a long term profitable growth path for our inoculants it broadens the scope of our research and development activities around featuring biologicals by having syngenta core funds 30 of investment and it also strengthened our balance sheet by bringing in 50 million in the context of global term loan in which liquidity has become an increasingly important lever to have a handle these two milestones put us in a unique strategic position to structurally benefit from the secular growth trend and high profitability profile that biologicals offer before i dive further into the quarterly results i would like to call your attention to a couple of important changes we have introduced the most relevant aspect relates to a switch in functional currency of our main argentine subsidiary which is addressed on slide 12 the merger with pro farm and the subsequent business integration triggered the need to adopt the u s dollar as the functional currency in our main operational subsidiaries in argentina starting in the first quarter of this fiscal year despite starting our operations mostly in u s dollars this subsidiary has historically used the argentine peso as a functional currency and their financial statements were therefore subject to ias 29 accounting adjustments that need distortions in our reported results and forced us to provide compelling metrics to better assess our underlying performance the merger with pro farm has enabled this long standing shift which now eliminates the need for ias 29 inflationary adjustments and as a result comparable to years were no longer represented except in reference to past quarters long term this change will simplify our financial reporting and provide our shareholders with a much clearer picture of our products on a high note to allow a fair comparison of our organic topline growth year over year we have taken the extra step to provide pro forma comparisons for fiscal year 2022 revenues and gross profit two metrics that would otherwise benefit from the addition of pro farm in our fiscal 2023 results pro forma comparable figures reflect the addition of pro farm to historical numbers and isolate any ias 29 distortions from fiscal 2022 figures to favor a cleaner comparison of our results to past performance otherwise as reported results from prior reporting periods will be used for other line items to the income statement and balance sheet including adjusted ebitda we recognize there will be a bit of adjustment as we go to the 2023 fiscal year but again we believe this change more accurately reflects our revolution as a company i will turn now to slide 13 please our first quarter is dominated by sales in the southern hemisphere where the growing season started in earnest summer crops planting in latin america for fiscal year and there will be exceptional job of anticipating locking in at 71 growth in the first quarter in the face of dry weather particularly in argentina as i mentioned revenues from pro farm are incorporated into our sales results which gives you a like for like comparison of our total business first quarter to first quarter a 71 increase in revenues has been a strong start and provides us with comfort on the average for the first half of the fiscal year even as we navigate rough words on what has now been confirmed as a historical drug in argentina let s please move to slide 13 for more detail on the revenue breakout by segment compensation was the main contributor to growth in the quarter we saw continued strong adoption of our microwave fertilizers in an environment of tight and costly fertilizer supplies the expansion was driven by the winter season and preseason summer sales in latin america inoculant sales also expanded across multiple regions these gains were somewhat offset by lower sales pro farm biostimulants on a comparative basis because of the timing of sales last year all of the biostimulants for the pro farm portfolio are now included into a crop nutrition segment while all the food products that come from the legacy pro farmsâ biocontrol portfolio have been incorporated into a crop protection segment sales of crop production products increased by 54 even as whoever face dry weather conditions in key latin american markets and in the united states while dry conditions in the western united states continue to curtail specialty crop sales u s low crop sales of pro farm bio protection product adjuvant sales in brazil and argentina also delivered solid performance with higher b2b sales finally sales of seed treatment packs ahead of planting were higher in both latin america and south africa we anticipate dry conditions will likely come from the planting and growing seasons in latin america but on the other hand we will have the added benefit of total revenues which we expect to rebound with growth as we move through the fiscal year if you turn to slide 15 revenue growth translated into a 52 increase in gross profit also led by our crop nutrition segment which delivered an impressive 85 growth in gross product with a 15 gross margin growth in seed treatment packs was also achieved with a healthy 50 gross margin overall gross margins of 40 5 were down roughly 500 basis points from the same period last year because of the mix of products sold in each segment dampening margins across the board we like our industry experienced higher input and price costs in the first quarter which also played a role including pressure on margins of some products that require raw materials involving international logistics such as adjusted ebitda for the quarter reached a record high 24 5 million as shown on slide 16 the increase in gross profit growth improvement and more than offset higher operating expenses within healthy operational leverage sg a increase in the quarter was mainly driven by the addition of pro farm operating expenses and by transitory costs related to the integration efforts such as severance and higher than usual trailing expenses baseline business operating expenses were also higher than explained by bearing our sg a costs on higher sales even with these additional one timers sg a as a percent of sales after deducting 2 8 million in merger transaction expenses was roughly 23 in line with the first quarter of last year despite what benefiting from the pro forma as far from historical 2022 numbers the adjusted ebitda margin remained relatively stable at 19 3 year over year slide 17 gives you a slightly different look at what brought the adjusted ebitda improvement its confronting to see that our baseline business was strong enough to absorb the net ebitda contribution on pro farm and still allow us to report an impressive 24 5 million result it is also important to note that within the first quarter we made meaningful progress on achieving cost synergies from the merger which also contributed to minimizing the net impact on ebitda for pro farmâ s results within the next two quarters we expect to fully achieve the cost synergies we targeted at the time of the merger and believe that by year end pro farm assets will have turned into positive ebitda contributors which should be the basis on which we continue to build sales synergies in the next 12 to 18 months same as mentioned when describing sales having achieved such an impressive ebitda we saw in the first quarter gives us great comfort on the outlook of profitability for the first half of our fiscal 2023 if you turn to slide 18 let me wrap up by covering briefly on balance sheet total financial debt increased to 228 million related to the execution of the two financing agreements in connection with the pro farm merger part of the proceeds were allocated to paying off all existing pro farm financial obligations and the remaining were used to reinforce working capital at pro farm and our overall cash position our net interest ratio remained relatively flat at 2 76x ltm adjusted ebitda with a healthy balance of cash term and long term debt cash equivalents rose to 51 3 million at the end of the quarter including cash used to fulfill our 5 million share repurchase commitment subsequently to the close of the quarter we received the 50 million upfront payment from syngenta which brings our cash position to over 100 million in completion we have had an exceptional start to the 2023 fiscal year and despite severe weather conditions in some key markets our strong first quarter results and the revenue diversification we gained from pro farm make us feel confident about the growth outlook for the full fiscal year and allows us to remain focused on executing our hb4 strategy and making pro farm assets ebitda contributors before year end with that i would like to turn the call back over to federico federico trucco thank you enrique i don t want to take much longer but i do want to finish with some looking forward remarks for the remainder of fiscal year 2023 if you turn to the next slide i think we expect to see sustainable double digit growth in our core business year over year and this is the spike coming out of a terrific fiscal year 2022 and also after the volatility that we might be experiencing due to the weather conditions in latin america so we are highly confident on this continued growth trajectory for the company for the fiscal year 2023 obviously the pro farm integration process is an important aspect for the fiscal year where we expect to reduce that negative ebitda contribution from pro farm and turn that into a positive number by the end of the year and also take advantage of the r d capabilities that exist within pro farm to make them available not only to other internal customers but also to external clients so that we can utilize this in full we will fully launch hb4 wheat in argentina we will have data coming out from the current harvest in the next earnings call and use that to evaluate and promote hb4 technology for the next season and we continue to scale hb4 soy breeding and multiplication in argentina and brazil with inventory levels set in place and the performance achieved to meet the fiscal year 2024 2025 guidance we have already provided and to recap on those we expect hb4 wheat to contribute between 15 million to 20 million of ebitda in the next fiscal year and soy to do that at the 20 million to 25 million level by fiscal year 2025 it is important that during fiscal year 2023 we met the initial kpis that we set in place for the syngenta collaboration and scale up our production capacity for biologicals in argentina and also for adjuvants in brazil hoping to finish the new facility by the end of the fiscal year and have that fully operational in fiscal year 2024 so these are some of the sort of expectations for the current fiscal year where we wanted to finish the call with we can now open up the floor for q a question and answer session operator and our first question today comes from bobby burleson from canaccord bobby your line is open go ahead bobby burleson yes thank you for taking my questions not sure exactly what time it is for you guys but good morning if it s still morning for you obviously so i guess the first one is just if we think about pro farm formerly marrone they had nice growth they had pretty healthy gross margins but they always seem to struggle a little bit with the opex â and i know you guys are targeting reducing that negative ebitda drag and then turning that positive so maybe just walk us through some of the low hanging fruit there that will help you kind of achieve that objective this fiscal year enrique lopez lecube hey bobby this is enrique good to have you on call for the first time so thanks for taking the opportunity to ask questions it is still morning for us so you are right federico trucco not as early as for you bobby enrique lopez lecube well you re right on your comment i mean that s right on thought there s obviously the low hanging fruit that we had identified at the time of the merger and that was mostly related to the sort of the business scheme of the company and that was what we achieved first so not having the costs or the cost of two publicly listed companies is something that gave us a quick win at the beginning there were obviously some restructuring measures that we took that were a bit harder to do but we already accomplished those as well so we are probably today about 80 of the cost synergies that we have targeted what we expect is certainly in the next couple of quarters we will execute the remaining and that plus growth coming from the sales deals in the next three quarters should allow us to put to pro farm as ebitda positive contribution or the asset coming profile bear in mind that the way that we structure the business and that we announced at the time of the merger we will no longer be looking at performance single standing entity there will be business units and there s cross selling there so at some point this will begin to be sort of one company what we wanted to do today is give you some sort of notion of how we re targeting and tracking those operating expenses synergies and then on top of that if we get to year end and look back on a trailing last 12 months basis and pro farm has become a positive ebitda entity that should set the basis for us to continue executing on the medium term synergies that were related to sales remember that we targeted between 5 million to 15 million in synergies that take a bit longer to be executed mostly because it requires some work on the registration front so ready some of the pro farm products in geographies where we have sales muscle takes a bit of a time but that s what we re looking for a strong basis on which then to add those synergies bobby burleson great very helpful and then just â maybe just a quick follow up or a slightly different question i guess if we think about all of the supply chain concerns and export issues for grain out of ukraine et cetera obviously over the past few years and it looks like it will continue to be so south america is becoming a major â has become a major export source for the world s food in certain areas in particular and i m wondering with the gm seed and trade capability you guys have developed with hb4 is there an increasing acceptance maybe for gm seeds and produce in regions of the world that maybe were resistant to gm europe et cetera what are your thoughts on that environment and how it s maybe broadening the scope of your opportunity there for hb4 enrique lopez lecube thank you for joining the call today i think that the situation that you just described has created a shift in focus from sort of the way gm technologies may be perceived by some groups to sort of more important focus on food security all of a sudden we see the importance of food production and technologies that can help us increase productivity while preserving natural resources become center stage regardless of sort of the tools that we use to achieve this type of solutions so yesterday for instance we received notice from indonesia of doing hb4 wheat for and that is on top of nigeria coming from a continent where there was a high level of reluctance to gmo approval perhaps highly influenced by the historical european position i m not saying within that we are ready to but today we re much closer much much closer than we ever were in trying to get these technologies become accepted even by the more sort of skeptical or reluctant consumers this is an opportunity we are seeking after the approval in argentina and we saw our approvals cascaded in very meaningful geographies for wheat and soy wheat obviously is more of a challenge because we are the only company today with the gm wheat and wheat has been historically for human consumption unlike soy and corn which were more dedicated to animal feedings and biofuels but we re taking advantage of the situation i think the current drought in latin america will make this even more relevant and we expect to see many more approvals cascading down in the upcoming months bobby burleson fantastic thanks for taking my questions congratulations on such a strong quarter federico trucco thanks bobby operator the next question from ben klieve from lake street capital ben please go ahead your line is open benjamin klieve all right thanks for taking the questions and yes congratulations on just another exceptional quarter across the board here two quick ones for me my first question is on the quarter itself enrique i m wondering if you saw any kind of lumpiness that benefited the quarter either revenue getting pushed from q4 into q1 some revenue getting pulled from q2 into q1 or any kind of outside the orders or the success was just kind of broad across the board enrique lopez lecube thanks for joining us well i think that the way we tend to look at the performance in the first quarter is all together with the second quarter if you think about it the first and the second quarter of our fiscal year are basically where all of the summer crop planting activities take place in latin america that remains an important market to us with argentina we will so i would say that we are looking at this as a part of the summer crop planting season that we ll go up with that â there is some bit of sales that transcended from winter crops in micro beaded fertilizers but that s not as meaningful as it is in terms of looking at the first half as a whole that s what i would say and that s why i think it s so important that we re seeing this growth early in the season that makes us feel comfortable as we look to the full fiscal year growth outlook we remain positive about that even as we transition with mostly readdress that has paid in the last and argentine is an important market to us benjamin klieve got it that s helpful and that kind of helps a bit my second and last question here and that the around is drought conditions i mean you guys have been very vocal about this and reports widespread around just the terrible dynamic that argentinian farmers are facing a couple of years ago there was a similar dynamic underway and i m wondering if you can help characterize the kind of your outlook here into the second quarter and the chemical fertilizer application this coming period relative to similar conditions that arose a couple of years ago are you looking for more as material of a headwind as you faced two years ago do you think that s going to be offset by other variables help us kind of frame the outlook here for the next quarter relative to the experience a couple of years ago federico trucco hi ben this is federico thank you for joining us once more and thanks for the question i think that we are better prepared than what we were back then first because we have a more diversified base today so we will have i think we expect more meaningful contribution from pro farm in north america and europe in the quarter in terms of the fertilizer impact that is mostly related to corn planting and that depends on the rain event that might happen in the upcoming days or weeks so i think if those rain events that occur and sort of there is a transition from last season corn to layer season corn we might see a slowdown in the fertilizer sales but i have to say that we are much better positioned than what we were two years ago when we faced a similar situation and having had sort of this great start i think gives us enough of a cushion to deliver the first half revenues and results that we expected to deliver for fiscal year 2023 benjamin klieve got it okay very good plenty more to talk about but i ll pass up the time here congratulations on a great quarter and i ll get back in line thanks guys federico trucco thanks operator next question comes from brian wright from roth capital partners brian please go ahead your line is open brian wright thanks good morning first of all just wow that s all i got to say commentary question on the global minimum targets with the syngenta agreement where you said the average is 23 million on a yearly basis of the life â is that over the first four years five or the 10 year period and how to think about like maybe how that minimum target kind of moves from the beginning to the end enrique lopez lecube hi brian great to have you in the call and thank you for your initial comments we feel the same way so the 23 million average is basically the 230 million that are contractualized at minimum profit overnight of the agreement divided by 10 years so initially that number â so what we expect in the initial years while we are still pursuing some of the business ourselves so this is not starting all at once and it s probably be over 23 million average and then as we move to the later years it s going to be above that 23 million average so that s the guaranteed profitability under the agreement obviously a format on top of that if we have sales from the collaboration that exceed those minimum targets we will be sharing profits at a 50 to 40 rate depending on the geography and the year so that is basically what we are reflecting with an average number in terms of the syngenta collaboration brian wright great and then just a follow on if i could the cash position post the agreement it s robust i know you completed the 5 million share buyback there seems to be room for potentially more just any kind of comments along those lines federico trucco in terms of the buyback you mean brian wright correct federico trucco yes i think we would like to continue to do what we have done in the past which is take advantage of dislocations in the market and opportunistically exercise the buyback program if we need to refresh on a monthly basis because we are sort of meeting the 5 million capped every month we will pass to our board permission to do so but this is kind of a capital allocation decision that needs to provide a level of return that is attractive compared to the other capital allocations that we might have in our business so this is not something that we re going to support the price of the stock this is an investment opportunity or something we really know well when the market gives us sort of an opportunity to do so i don t know enrique if you want to add anything to that enrique lopez lecube i think that also helps us potentially minimizing dilution coming from the commercial notes remember that we have issued convertible notes that have a strike price of 18 and this is a fantastic way if we are positive about the outlook of the company to minimizing the potential dilution federico trucco okay great thank you so much operator the next question comes from kemp dolliver from brookline capital markets kemp please go ahead your line is open brian dolliver great thank you and good morning so two questions first is where do we see multiplication efforts you ve discussed in the presentation put you relative to the fiscal 2024 and 2025 ebitda goals essentially thinking of it as a percentage of target where will this put you enrique lopez lecube hi kemp thank you for joining us and thank you for the question i think â obviously we re not halfway in terms of fiscal 2024 the key here is to make sure we have enough inventories to reach those numbers in fiscal 2024 i think that even though the yields will be lower because of the significant drought we will have those inventories in place probably the top of mind aspect today in all partners in argentina so i don t think we ll have an issue placing those inventories in the current year so that we can reach the 15 million to 20 million next year from an ebitda viewpoint the only caveat if you will is that we might rely a little heavier or we might be depending a little more on the first generation materials compared to a second generation material which was the material that we were just starting to multiply this season so we have limited inventories and sort of the reduced yield because of the drought in a way it doesn t allow us to go full speed ahead of those this is not an issue that we are facing drought because the structuring of materials have shown terrific benefit but it is something we need to clean up in the value of normal years or years where yields are expected to be high so that we avoid any kind of a drive in the overall performance so that s the only thing i would say we need to readjust in the current season but not affecting what we need to be the 15 million to 20 million guidance for fiscal 2024 brian dolliver my second question is what is the status of the joint venture talks between trigall and s w in australia federico trucco a great question so we moved forward with that joint venture process we are now finalizing the definitive agreements it took us a little longer but we expect to have this closed by the end of the year and we are starting to coordinate bringing activities to them this has been ongoing since september already we have not included this in the back but it continues to be an important aspect of the trigall opportunity in australia brian dolliver very good thank you and i will ask a third question which is are you going to miss doing the ias 29 adjustments enrique lopez lecube that s a great question no we are not and actually it s even hard to federico trucco we re not going to miss that at all enrique lopez lecube i can if you want me to brian dolliver i will not thank you operator and the next question comes from steven ralston from zacks steven please go ahead your line is open steven ralston good morning and congratulations on a great quarter my first question concerns your collaboration with syngenta could you expand upon that and clarify some specifics especially towards product lines as i understood it it was a very symbionic relationship in argentina where you distributed syngenta s fungicides and insecticides the maxim family and the actellic family of products and in return syngenta distributed rizobacter s seed treatment products how is that changing i know it s global and in some cases exclusive ex ing out the u s and could you also get into the specifics of the potential you see in china and brazil federico trucco great so thanks a lot steven for joining the call and for the great question regarding the syngenta dynamics so as you described in argentina we have achieved 100 success we are by far the leaders in the inoculant business and also in the biofungicide side of our business in the seed treatment and i believe syngenta has obtained in argentina a level of molecule penetration that is at much anywhere in the world i think when we consider both channels export close to 40 to 50 so that s something syngenta was not ever â was not able to replicate in other geographies for their active ingredients so the question was how do we scale this up internationally in a way that is attractive to both parties and that s why we went into this long term distribution collaboration and have an r d component as well so the footprint that we have in argentina we don t have that footprint in europe we don t have that footprint in the united states let alone asia like china or australia so being able to build that ourselves organically it will take a long time being able to use the syngenta s existing footprint i think can give us an opportunity to quickly penetrate those markets with a one product category where we have done this jointly in a very successful way so we are initially doing this only with inoculants and we selected part of the seed treatment portfolio and this is not saying that we re the opportunity to use syngenta footprint for the that s come out of but that is not today so that s something that we might discuss in the future we might even consider other opportunities but this was kind of a starting point for us to fully penetrate that 4 billion to 5 billion market where biologics are already at the 20 level significant part of that because of the plate we are global leaders and where we believe we can be at 1 6 billion market wide in biologicals as in general by the end of the decade that s kind of the thesis behind syngenta collaboration we are not going into a blinded relationship we ve known each other for 20 years the positive and the negative so this is what we are sort of now deciding to jointly on a forward going basis steven ralston now turning to ebitda it seems like the major contributor was crop nutrition and that s related to your micro beaded fertilizer plant and i ve noticed well last quarter and this quarter you have not given out the 12 month trailing capacity utilization in your press release it must be very high at the current time can you share that now and what are your plans there in the future because you should be getting very close to maximum capacity enrique lopez lecube hi steven this is enrique thanks for joining the call and thanks for the question yes you re right i mean we have been ramping up the use of total capacity we have used that metric of used installed capacity to basically on an asset that was â asset that is most industrial in nature the rest of our pipelines are not heavily relying on industrial assets or manufacturing facilities by our contracts that s the reason why we use that metric we are standing today 38 use of installed capacity we can still use an additional 20 but that requires investing in working capital because this is a highly seasonal product so we are already looking and we discussed this on our last earnings we are already looking into expanding capacity in that plant we feel about how this product has rolled out in the market in argentina in the southern states of brazil and we re looking at opportunities maybe in our markets maybe in the northern space of brazil and why not be in the u s at some point so yes we will need to do some investment now it s not the thing to start from scratch than to add capacity on what we already have so to continue expanding latin america we will start doing module investments to ramp install capacity up as we see that there s still demand for the product steven ralston thank you and i want to congratulate you all on that â your strategy on that plant because basically it was a wasting asset with very low capacity utilization and through your strategies you ve made it into a true cash generator thank you for taking my questions federico trucco we know you ve been tracking that part very closely so it s great to see you we could place the progress there and we are also very proud to see that happening operator we have no further questions so i ll hand it back to federico for any concluding remarks federico trucco okay i want to thank everyone for joining us today for those that woke up at 5 a m particularly thank you because it s very early we are really proud of the quarter we just finished the progress that we re making and hope to continue to sort of bring these type of results on a forward going basis it s going to be challenging because the bar is high and the weather is not helping so maybe a little bit of rain might help in argentina despite our

contagious insanity read on for article it is well known that viruses are contagious and now it seems that a new variant is rampant among certain sections of the body politic irrational insanity has always infected those for whom hating jews and israel is second nature following israel s just concluded elections the ripple effect of knee jerk hypocrisy has reached epidemic levels once mainly but by no means exclusively confined to international groups it has now also resurfaced in our own domestic left wing elites add in the roll call of diaspora jewish leadership and you have a perfect recipe for the diagnosis of trembling jews syndrome the common theme which unites all of them is the apparent to them calamitous repercussions following the expected formation of the most right wing and religious coalition in israel s history despite president herzog telling doomsday prophets to accept the democratic will of the israeli electorate this has largely fallen on deaf ears it seems axiomatic that only leftist voters can be democratic while right wing voters are racist to the core and threaten democratic values as i mentioned in my previous op ed this has been a long standing contention by our own leftist politicians going back long before the re establishment of sovereignty what really takes first prize for chutzpah and unhinged reactions however must go to the biden administration closely followed by the uk media including the jewish chronicle in its lead editorial the jc stated britain s bond with israel will outlast the far right what a patronizing chutzpah that has been echoed by various lords of the trembling jewish establishment no wonder the anti israel mob in the uk and further afield in the eu feel emboldened to criticize the israeli voters choice it has taken the white house a week to congratulate netanyahu and during this inexplicable delay there were non subtle hints from various sources that the usa expects the new israeli government to respect an open democratic society just think about this for a moment for seventy five years israel has been a model democratic country in a neighbourhood renowned for not respecting democracy and human rights during this time we have had left wing centrist and right wing coalitions none of them posing any sort of remote threat to the values espoused by the biden white house or genetic jewish american voters the hypocritical insanity however gets even weirder and more evident the closer one looks at inconvenient truths pushed under the state dept carpet if respect for an open democratic society is indeed a vital us requirement why have heavy handed hints already been dropped that one of the incoming coalition s prospective cabinet ministers may be boycotted in their hasty eagerness to display virtuous political correctness and no doubt to reassure the left wing progressives of the democratic party these inane utterances merely highlight a far more hypocritical stance if indeed democracy and respect for human rights are a requirement how come the biden administration continues to cozy up to one of the biggest abusers of these values why has the us embraced abbas and the pa the last elections took place there so many years ago and abbas continues to rule by decree critics of the corrupt regime continue to be targeted and incarcerated murderers of israelis continue to receive stipends while those deemed martyrs receive pensions from the pa the president for life and the media churn out daily hate diatribes while school textbooks continue to extol the illegitimacy of israel and jews my question is very simple why is the us still embracing abbas and reassuring him that the mirage of a two state solution is still a viable option why is the state dept not boycotting this serial denier of democracy and human rights is the answer perhaps something to do with blatant double standards whereby threats to democracy and hints of boycotts only apply to israel the same questions can also be posed to all those others who have convulsed post election day jewish establishment spokespersons overseas have also been notable in their varying reactions to the results of the elections the further left on the political and religious progressive spectrum the more strident and doom laden their pronouncements my question to these so called guardians of political correctness is this where were you when the previous coalition governed with the help of an arab party which has warned that jews praying on the temple mount will ignite a war where were your voices of outrage when terrorists murdered israelis and arab mks in the knesset called them martyrs israel s possible incoming police minister who is viewed as an irredeemable racist has stated that he does not hate arabs he only hates terrorists but as 99 of terrorists are arabs that apparently labels him as beyond the pale likewise his proposal to deport terrorists and their families if they are found to have aided them after due process of law resonated with large swathes of the israeli electorate why should the israeli taxpayer support terrorists in jail while they gain university degrees apparently this is all too much for the delicate and trembling liberals ensconced in their make believe bubbles of exile recently the pa boasted that over 100 babies were conceived using the liberated sperm of jailed terrorists if this is not a case of immaculate deception then it is yet another reason why these murderers of israelis should be expelled from the country lock stock and barrel never to either be a drain on our prison system or ever again pose a physical threat to our citizens an increasing number of israeli voters want a much firmer policy and this is something the declining excusers of arab terror have yet to internalize i suspect that the politicians in washington and elsewhere are terrified that the contagious insanity might infect their own constituencies if this occurs then it will merely confirm that voters have had enough of current failed and hypocritical policies nothing epitomizes the out of reality syndrome which has enveloped masses on the left more than today s fiasco in israel surrounding the commemoration of the anniversary of kristallnacht on 9 november the far left rosa luxemburg foundation named after a german revolutionary extremist socialist which today receives funding from germany decided to hold an evening dedicated to the theme of comparing the shoah with the nakba the tragedy of israel s rebirth hosted by the goethe institute another irony this obscene comparison equating the two historical events on kristallnacht was initially called out by the simon wiesenthal centre in los angeles closely followed by a storm of derision and condemnation from israeli officials realizing their foot in mouth own goal the goethe institute called off the 9 november event and unbelievably rescheduled it for 13 november the organizers obviously still don t get that the theme of the evening is so insulting and toxic for most sane israelis that s the tragedy of today s leftist breast beating guilt laden critics who are convulsing over the fact that israelis are fed up with this sort of woke nonsense apart from the wiesenthal centre where are all those progressive religious voices and defenders of the oppressed they are conspicuously mute as usual blaming arab leaders for their own self inflicted tragedies and condemning the ongoing daily outpouring of delegitimisation is not part of their agenda it is obviously far easier to give unsolicited advice to israel s incoming pm as to who he should choose to be part of his coalition if they think that it will earn them brownie points from the us administration they are as usual mistaken all it will do is confirm to most israelis that far too many living in their countries of exile are detached from reality regarding real threats facing israelis political insanity is certainly contagious and is running rampant michael kuttner is a jewish new zealander who for many years was actively involved with various communal organisations connected to judaism and

the company s quarterly results released earlier this month showed it continued to make excellent progress in improving its financial position net debt has fallen for 10 successive quarters and is now a third lower than at the time of our recommendation last year its net debt to equity ratio is just 30pc which suggests it is well placed to overcome a sustained period of interest rate rises bp s recent financial performance has been buoyed by an elevated oil price which surged to a high of more than 120 a barrel this year and currently stands at around 90 this has produced vast amounts of free cash flow that have enabled the business to buy back a lot of shares during the year including a 2 5bn programme announced earlier this month it plans to buy back shares worth 8 5bn in questor s view this is an excellent use of surplus cash while the shares trade at extremely low levels income seeking shareholders have not been overlooked by the company which expects to raise its dividend by 4pc a year over the next three years in combination with 4bn in annual share buybacks encouragingly these figures assume an oil price that is a third lower than its current level when combined with the stock s 3 8pc dividend yield this suggests it offers highly attractive income prospects of course bp is in the process of making major albeit gradual changes to its portfolio of assets as it seeks to transition from fossil fuels to renewables this process is being made far easier by its strong financial performance which provides more than enough cash for the company to make large acquisitions to ultimately align itself with net zero opportunities
