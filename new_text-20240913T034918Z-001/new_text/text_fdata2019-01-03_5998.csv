apple admits lower iphone sales will hurt q1 2019 apple announced a lower than expected guidance for the upcoming quarterly report this isn t unprecedented but it might come as a bit of a shock to those investors that ve seen quarter after quarter of big iphone sales and revenue aplenty across the board for the company apple released a brief report today that showed expectations of revenue at 84 billion with a gross margin of approximately 38 percent today we re taking a look at apple s new revised fiscal 2019 first quarter expectations this is the quarter that ended on december 29th 2018 this is also the fourth quarter of the year for 2018 but again the first financial quarter for apple for 2019 as an apple representative wrote while it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now apple suggested they d likely have around 8 7 billion in operating expenses and other income expense of around 550 million this quarter will likely show a tax rate of approximately 16 5 percent before discrete items apple also suggested that they expected the number of shares used in computing diluted eps to be around 4 77 billion usd apple suggested that two points led the company to reduce revenue guidance to suggest they probably didn t do quite as well as expected over the last three months one reason was economic weakness in some emerging markets and the other was fewer iphone upgrades than the company anticipated

democrats around the country are gearing up for what will likely be a crowded 2020 presidential race and washington state s gov jay inslee is expected to throw his hat in the ring of electoral hopefuls so far only sen elizabeth warren d ma has officially announced her run but inslee could also run he told the atlantic in an article published on jan 2 that we re laying the groundwork that would make this a feasible thing in the relatively short term the other indication is his political action committee called vision pac which was created last october raised 112 600 in contributions between oct 4 and nov 26 according to the federal election commission however inslee has not officially announced his political media representative jamal raad said in an email governor inslee believes we need a presidential candidate who will put fighting climate change front and center in our national dialogue and is seriously considering running no final decision has been made yet this number of financial contributions to vision pac is likely even higher after more than a month but current contributions data was not available as of jan 2 the next step for an inslee campaign would be the creation of an exploratory committee similar to what warren recently announced the atlantic article said inslee who was elected as washington s governor in 2012 has pursued one of the greenest agendas in the country with fields of solar panels fleets of electric buses and massive job growth to show for it however sound publishing political columnist jerry cornfield has noted that inslee s track record is long on preaching and short on accomplishment there are more electric vehicles on the road and utilities are getting more power from alternative sources but greenhouse gas emissions aren t tumbling and every attempt by inslee to compel a reduction of carbon emissions through taxes fees or executive order has failed it may be that if inslee runs for president it will be on his green credentials motivated by a push for national climate change reform central to this cornfield argues is whether inslee will be able to push through his legislation and budget in the 2019 state legislature in a year when democrats control both the state house and senate he can miss on a couple things but he cannot come up empty too many times next session with his own democratic party controlling both chambers of the legislature cornfield wrote that would be embarrassing and invite questions out loud about inslee s ability to carry out a legislative agenda with partisans in congress in inslee s 2019 21 budget he proposed a new capital gains tax on the sale of stocks bonds and other assets increasing the state business and occupation tax on services and changing the state s real estate excise tax from a regressive flat rate to a graduated rate that would lower the tax on sales of lower value properties inslee is also proposing an initiative to reduce emissions in the state s building sector and to promote clean energy projects and research included in this is 57 5 million for the state s clean energy fund for projects to modernize the electric grid and the development of clean technology in total inslee hopes to push through more than 273 million in green energy spending and reforms seattle weekly has reached out to both inslee s campaign for comment and political researchers and will update this story when more information becomes available other names which have attracted speculation over potential presidential bids include rep beto o rourke d tx who ran against sen ted cruz in the 2018 election narrowly losing against the incumbent republican in a deeply red state sen kamala harris d ca has also been floated as a candidate as has sen bernie sanders i vt historically 17 presidents previously served as governor but only four since the end of world war ii george w bush bill clinton ronald reagan and jimmy carter

bloomberg warren buffett has a questionable track record investing in technology companies it s only getting worse with apple inc which had already lost more than 350 billion in market value since october diving wednesday after famously avoiding tech stocks for decades saying he didn t understand them well enough the billionaire s berkshire hathaway inc stashed more than 10 billion into international business machines corp starting in 2011 he completely exited the stake about a year ago admitting his analysis had been flawed a rare black mark in a career spent building one of world s biggest piles of wealth now buffett s bet on apple which amounted to about 252 million shares at the end of september or more than 5 percent of the total looks shakier the stock fell late wednesday after apple slashed its revenue forecast blaming an economic slowdown in china and saying fewer people upgraded their iphones than anticipated apple dropped to as low as 144 51 in extended trading trimming the value of berkshire s stake by about 3 billion to be sure buffett bought most of the shares at lower prices so he may still be ahead on the overall investment when describing companies he was looking to acquire buffett once wrote that he prefers simple businesses adding if there s lots of technology we won t understand it buffett s assistant didn t immediately return a message seeking comment to contact the reporters on this story nick baker in chicago at nbaker7 bloomberg net katherine chiglinsky in new york at kchiglinsky bloomberg net to contact the editors responsible for this story michael j moore at mmoore55 bloomberg net dan reichl alan goldstein for more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg com 2019 bloomberg l p
apple cut its sales forecasts for its key end of year period on wednesday citing the unforeseen magnitude of the economic slowdown in china trading in the company s shares was temporarily halted as tim cook apple s chief executive issued a letter to shareholders explaining the reason for the change when selling started again apple shares fell by 7 45 wiping 55bn 44bn off its value while we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration particularly in greater china he said he cited falling sales of iphones mac computers and ipads the news sparked a flash crash in currency markets as investors rushed to less risky assets with the japanese yen soaring against most major currencies in a matter of seconds us stock futures pointed to another rough start on wall street with nasdaq e mini futures down 2 2 and s p 500 e mini futures off 1 3 msci s broadest gauge of asia pacific shares outside japan fell 0 4 after an early attempt at a bounce japanese markets were closed for holidays but nikkei futures dropped 1 9 shares in china and hong kong see sawed between gains and losses as investors waited for beijing to roll out fresh support measures for the cooling chinese economy china s central bank said late on wednesday it was adjusting policy to benefit more small firms that are having trouble obtaining finance in its latest move to ease strains on the private sector a key job creator apple s statement was its first profit warning since 2002 and its first of the smartphone age it is also one that will further rattle investors already worried about the slowing chinese economy the unusual move came on a day when it was reported that factory activity in china contracted for the first time in 19 months in december china s economy has been pinched by the ongoing trade war with the us which is spilling over into other asian economies china is apple s third largest market after the us and europe china s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018 the government reported gdp growth during the september quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years wrote cook we believe the economic environment in china has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the united states as the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets the effects appeared to reach consumers as well with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in china declining as the quarter progressed and market data has shown that the contraction in greater china s smartphone market has been particularly sharp donald trump and china s president xi jingping agreed to a 90 day temporary ceasefire in their bitter trade war last month but as yet no long term resolution appears close despite these challenges cook said we believe that our business in china has a bright future however the company s woes in the country have been exacerbated by a court decision that could potentially ban iphone sales there chip maker qualcomm won a preliminary injunction in december that would ban sales of older models that it claims violated its patents apple is appealing against the decision apple said it now expects sales revenue of about 84bn down from an earlier estimate of 89bn to 93bn analysts had been expecting revenues of about 91bn according to market analyst factset apple endured a bumpy 2018 in august it was the world s biggest firm and became the first publicly traded company to be valued at 1tn but it ended the year with its market value down close to 7 its worst performance since the 2008 financial crisis apple is now the third largest public company behind microsoft and amazon apple remains hugely profitable and is sitting on 237bn in cash in november the company announced record sales and profits but iphone sales were flat heightening investor fears that its glory days are coming to an end sales of iphones have so far failed to pick up despite apple launching more variations of the device and analysts have worried that the market has become saturated and cheaper rivals are taking market share the price of a new iphone can now exceed 1 000 in the us and 999 in the uk last year apple temporarily cut the price of replacement batteries for older models and more customers chose that option instead of upgrading their phones the iphone which launched in june 2007 has been an extraordinary success for apple more than one billion were sold between 2007 and 2017 while sales of its other devices and services such as itunes and apple pay are growing sharply the iphone is still its most important product accounting for 59 of its revenue in its previous quarter apple s poor performance was echoed by its fellow faang companies facebook apple amazon netflix and google which all performed poorly in 2018 their collective stumble helped drag down us stock markets which had been driven to new highs by their rise slowing iphone sales have also compounded fears that apple s record breaking run is coming to an end and china s weakening economy worried investors that international markets would not pick up the slack
arkansas gov asa hutchinson announced the rollback of more than 800 outdated or unnecessary regulations including unenforceable rules regulations enacted by commissions no longer existing and other duplicative codes as provided for in act 781 state agencies proposed 800 rules for deletion by the arkansas legislative council alc a joint legislative committee responsible for executive branch oversight the alc referred the proposals to legislative subcommittees which approved the recommendations the rules will be gone after the changes are formally approved by the alc the 800 rules represent 15 000 pages of regulations or 25 percent of all state rules said hutchinson in september making a list taking stock of existing regulations was a necessary first step to determine which were unneeded says arkansas state rep jim dotson r bentonville sponsor of act 781 and a co vice chairperson of alc the original idea was to have the governor divide all of these rules in the state into six roughly equal sized groups with one group every four years coming up for review dotson said without finding out what the baseline was the governor couldn t practically divide them into groups like that working backwards from that point was the end goal we had to first establish the baseline one stop rules shop dotson says he wants to create a central online clearinghouse for arkansas regulations so members of the public can read the code for themselves one of the top things from a regulatory standpoint is actually having an online database where all agency rules and regulations are housed dotson said regardless of what agency you are subject to you go to one location and find a universal storehouse if someone is subject to multiple agency jurisdictions they should just have one area to go to find out what rules they are subject to arkansas is one of the few states that does not have an online rules registry so there is no one place to define what our current status is dotson said owen macaulay writes from hillsdale michigan official connections arkansas gov asa hutchison arkansas state rep jim dotson r bentonville

by sonam rai and nick carey reuters tesla inc on wednesday cut u s prices for all its vehicles to offset lower green tax credits and fell short on quarterly deliveries of its mass market model 3 sedan sending shares of the electric vehicle maker down nearly 7 percent on worries of future profitability analysts questioned whether the 2 000 price cut on all models signaled lower demand in the united states and ultimately whether the move would undermine nascent profitability at the silicon valley automaker which has never posted an annual profit in our view this move could suggest that what many bulls assume to be a substantial backlog for tesla may be less robust wrote bank of america analyst john murphy in a client note chief executive elon musk who has often set goals and deadlines that tesla has failed to meet surprised investors by delivering on his pledge to make tesla profitable in the third quarter for only the third time in its 15 year existence but the company is unprofitable for the first nine months of 2018 and cash flow remains a concern for investors musk has been under intense pressure to deliver on his promise of stabilizing production for the model 3 which is deemed crucial for easing a cash crunch and achieving long term profitability it said it was churning out almost 1 000 model 3s daily broadly in line with musk s promises but slightly short of wall street expectations the company said it would begin delivering model 3s to europe and china in february the price cut of 2 000 beginning on wednesday on the model 3 as well as on its higher priced model s and model x took the market by surprise and weighed on the stock pushing it down 6 8 percent to close at 310 12 after falling as much as 10 percent during the session the lower price comes as automakers expect u s new vehicle sales to weaken in 2019 and amid increased competition from new electric vehicle entrants tesla sales benefited from a 7 500 federal tax credit on electric vehicles throughout 2018 but that full credit expired at the end of 2018 and new buyers will now receive only half that amount under a major tax overhaul passed by the republican controlled u s congress in 2017 tax credits that lower the cost of electric vehicles are available for the first 200 000 such vehicles sold by an automaker the tax credit is then reduced by 50 percent every six months until it phases out the price cut is what s driving the stock lower as it openly acknowledges the sunset of subsidy dollars is a material headwind said craig irwin an analyst with roth capital partners but some said fears of eroded demand were overblown gene munster of loup ventures calculated that the lowered tax credit equaled on average a 3 percent discount on a tesla if tesla had a demand issue therefore the company would have cut its prices by more than 3 percent he wrote in a note general motors sold its 200 000th electric vehicle in the united states in 2018 similarly triggering a phase out of the federal tax credit a source said on wednesday gm declined to comment effect on profit hargreaves lansdown analyst nicholas hyett estimated in a client note that if tesla continues to deliver cars at the current rate the price cut will mean 700 million in lost revenue in 2019 wedbush analyst daniel ives meanwhile said the price cut was a potential positive for demand but not what the bulls wanted to hear on the impact to profitability and ultimately the bottom line tesla delivered 63 150 model 3s in its fourth quarter falling short of factset estimates of 64 900 tesla said that based on its own compilation of analysts forecasts its delivery numbers were in line with market expectations bank of america analyst john murphy wrote that the numbers were in line with market consensus though below the bank s estimate of 71 500 model 3s total deliveries rose from the third quarter to 90 700 cars but missed forecasts which had been influenced by analysts expectations of a surge in buyers looking to cash in on the tax credit before year end reuters calculated that tesla s third quarter pretax profit was around 3 200 per vehicle delivered that would mean a 2 000 price cut could eliminate more than half of that gain for the first nine months of 2018 the company suffered a third quarter loss per vehicle delivered of 8 019 overall total production rose 8 percent to 86 555 vehicles the company churned out 61 394 model 3s up from a total of 53 239 model 3s in the third quarter tesla disappointed the market the deliveries are below our estimates and the consensus estimates i don t expect that tesla operates in the black in 2019 said frank schwope an analyst with nord lb reporting by sonam rai and akanksha rana in bengaluru nick carey in detroit and alexandria sage in san francisco editing by nick zieminski and matthew lewis
brazil s stock market closed at a record high on wednesday one day after new president jair bolsonaro took office and in anticipation of economic reforms his government is expected to implement the ibovespa index in sao paulo s stock market finished 3 56 per cent up at 91 012 points markets were closed on tuesday for the january 1 holiday hopes of a turnaround for latin america s biggest economy which has been limping ever since exiting its worst ever recession two years ago were spurred by promises that bolsonaro s team will cut spending and debt new economy minister paulo guedes said wednesday that reforming the country s unsustainable pension system was the government s biggest challenge as it made good on those pledges guedes said brazil had to be re made after suffering years of expanding public spending and statist decision making brazil was corrupted by excessive spending and stopped growing because of excessive spending he said reforming pensions is the key to correcting this problem in brazil workers can often take retirement in their mid 50s earlier than in comparable countries and with pensions that are often around 70 per cent of their final salaries maintaining that system consumes around a third of government spending a proportion that will only go up as brazil ages and increases its debt analysts say that without reform the system will push the country to insolvency even though his ministry is taking on added responsibilities for industry trade labour and planning guedes rejected the notion that he was heading up a superministry no one can resolve all of brazil s problems alone we need all three government powers to be involved he said he listed his priorities as opening the economy simplifying taxes privatizing decentralizing resources and focusing as well on social issues investors are anticipating a substantial privatization program shares in state power firm eletrobras jumped 20 7 percent on expectations some of its assets would be sold off guedes 69 is a magnet for investor optimism in bolsonaro s cabinet the us trained economist is a strong advocate of free market values which stands in contrast with brazil s history of protectionism speaking as he took up his functions guedes hailed the decision by the outgoing center right government to freeze public spending for 20 years but he said more reforms were needed to create a virtuous circle observers were uncertain just how far bolsonaro will let guedes go in privatizing state companies while the new president agrees in principle to liberalizing the economy he has voiced wariness about selling off core assets of eletrobras or state oil company petrobras also seven of the government s 22 ministries are now held by ex military officers who may be opposed to a sale of brazilian national assets and for any cuts to pensions that former military personnel do well from
wall street had higher expectations for tesla photo getty images shares of tesla fell by more than 6 per cent during the first trading day of 2019 after the electric car company released its delivery figures for the end of 2018 which modestly fell short of wall street expectations compiled by factset the missed expectation is especially noteworthy because the fourth quarter of 2018 was the last period during which customers could earn a major federal tax credit for buying an electric vehicle which would have boosted sales in a news release tesla said it would cut the price of its model 3 model x and model s vehicles beginning wednesday to partially cover the reduction of the federal tax credit for electric vehicles the full us 7 500 nz 11 330 tax credit for tesla customers was cut in half to 3 750 at the start of the new year the company said the remaining tax credits combined with not having to fuel up at the gas pump and lowered maintenance costs means our vehicles are even more affordable than similarly priced gasoline vehicles tesla said it produced and delivered a record number of vehicles the company s production grew to 86 555 vehicles up 8 per cent from the high set in the past quarter in total tesla produced 61 394 of its model 3 25 161 of its model s and 14 050 of its model x its deliveries also increased by 8 per cent the company said factset which compiled an average estimate from nine analysts projected that tesla would deliver 2 000 more vehicles than it did including 1 750 more model 3 vehicles in sum this was a strong quarter for tesla but model 3 deliveries missed street expectations and this will be a cloud over the name until the company reports earnings in late january and gives initial guidance for european model 3 demand in 2019 said daniel ives an analyst at wedbush securities ives added that tesla shares are hypersensitive to any issue around model 3 and that it will remain a stock that is guilty until proven innocent until it discloses quarterly earnings figures next year ross gerber the president and ceo of gerber kawasaki said tesla s latest figures prove that its production line is consistent with high quality but that the stock is down because of the price cut which was unexpected the mission is to get electric vehicles on the road at the lowest price point without sacrificing margins he said adding that he sees unlimited demand for the more affordably priced 35 000 model 3 even without the government rebate the model 3 tesla s mass market car saw sales of more than 145 000 last year the company said the vehicle has been delivered only to north american customers and in its mid to higher priced configurations deliveries to customers in europe and china will begin in february the company said there remain significant opportunities to continue to grow model 3 sales by expanding to international markets introducing lower priced variants and offering leasing tesla said tesla delivered 99 394 of its model s and x vehicles in 2018 just shy of its 100 000 goal
menafn dailyfx talking points dow s p500 and nasdaq finish positive after being down 1 5 percent at session lows us politicians to resume congressional session tomorrow with democrats taking control of house american economic growth could be hindered if government shutdown lingers us equities finish in positive territory after a choppy session for the first trading day of the new year as bulls and bears wrestle with their sentiment hangover from a dismal end to 2018 over the last several weeks investors have been plagued with fear over slowing global growth this has sparked one of the largest stock selloffs in a decade which may continue with anti risk sentiment still lingering highlighted on every trader s risk radar is the drama in d c over the current us government shutdown which looks to extend to its thirteenth day ahead of democrats officially taking majority control of the house tomorrow congressional leaders met discussing the government shutdown with president trump today for the first time since the shutdown began on december 22 however expectations were muted since democratic leader nancy pelosi aims to promptly pass two separate stopgap funding bills when her party takes control of the house tomorrow take a look at ig s real time client sentiment tracker to see the bullish and bearish biases of traders despite having enough leverage to pass a bill that would reopen the government trump s veto power remains a likely possibility if any legislation comes across the president s desk without funding for border security this threat poses the largest risk to an extended government shutdown especially after considering trump s comment last month that he would be proud to shut the government down even for a very long time while some economists and analysts suggest that government shutdowns should be overlooked by investors as noise since the s p500 average return during a shutdown of 0 6 percent is not as bad as one might initially think but diving deeper into the data reveals a strong inverse correlation between the length of a government shutdown and stock market returns in other words the longer a government shutdown endures the worse the performance is for the broader stock market as the us government shutdown appears to continue with no current resolution stocks could continue hemorrhaging if an agreement is not reached quickly this is especially the case since investors have grown increasingly sensitive over economic growth seeing that a 2014 congressional report estimates that every week the government is shut down costs the u s economy at least 0 1 percent in gdp growth written by rich dvorak junior analyst for dailyfx follow on twitter richdvorakfx check out our education center for more information on currency forecast and trading guides dailyfx
that would help close a yawning coverage gap in small business savings coverage a major leap forward for a workplace system that has grown over the past 40 years to become a vital element in most americans lives yet few of us and far too few top policy makers fully grasp how much workplace savings have achieved or imagine how much more this system can contribute four decades after the creation of the 401 k the new congress that convened this week will have the chance to pass the most significant retirement savings reform in years multiple bills that will be introduced early this year could open on the job savings options for millions more workers by allowing multiple employer retirement plans to form across industry lines by companies as diverse as hair salons and oil rig leasing firms advertisement the truth is that retirement savings in america do far more than just help provide post retirement income workplace savings have become an indispensable source for american capital formation generally paycheck by paycheck tens of millions of workers fuel the world s most robust capital markets power driving innovation and growth what s more anything we do to increase access to workplace savings promises to yield vast fiscal benefits for the government itself over the long term consider this over the past two generations through 401 k s iras defined benefit pensions and other savings vehicles working americans have compiled over 28 trillion in retirement savings that is well over one third of the 72 trillion capitalization of all stocks and bonds in the country these savings form the largest dedicated asset pool on earth no other nation s retirement savings even come close in fact the sheer scale of americans retirement assets spurs envy among competing nations around the world who are struggling with aging populations and still depend mainly on tax based pay as you go retirement systems most of them facing severe fiscal and political crises just in the next few years advertisement so despite the well known and very serious shortfalls in american retirement finance the buildup of these assets is a huge success story better still 40 years of 401 k experience gives us all the insights we need to identify what works spread those best practices systemwide and actually solve our savings challenges job one is to provide all american workers access to payroll deduction savings plans on the job by law secondly these plans should be made fully automatic with an opt out option from enrollment to annual reenrollment automatic savings escalation of 10 percent or more and access to advice and guaranteed lifetime income options on retirement these basic reforms would optimize what private workplace savings can achieve and set most workers on a path to lifetime income security the good news is we are moving in that direction savvy politicians in washington increasingly recognize two highly motivating facts first that americans are worried very worried about their retirement futures second voters love proposals that make it easier and more rewarding for them to save this means that 2019 and coming years will surely see a wave of legislation provide access to job based payroll savings for tens of millions more workers who will bring trillions more into workplace savings plans over time this will take america closer to a true people s capitalism in which nearly every worker can earn a tangible growing equity stake in our free enterprise system advertisement legislation soon to come before congress would take us far along that road and the benefits would be striking here s why we can already see that mass investing by over 80 million current workplace savers has made america s capital markets the deepest and most liquid on earth and having such powerful capital markets qualitatively lifts our capacity to innovate and win in global markets that s because capital markets are far more nimble in funding innovation than the bank centered financial systems that dominate most of europe and north asia for example banks can t risk making loans to 10 startup companies in the hopes that one of them will multiply 20 times in value even if the others fail but those are precisely the kinds of bets that capital markets make possible across the full spectrum from angel investors to venture funding to ipos and bond market issues the hundreds of billions of dollars that flow into and out of capital markets from workplace savers play a vital if indirect role in keeping our equity markets liquid enough to absorb a steady flow of initial public offerings which are far more common in america than most of the world this option to go public is what angel and venture financiers invest to achieve the pot of gold at the end of the venture rainbow absent the depth and liquidity that workplace savers fund america s capital markets would be far less able to fund innovation i would suggest that america s capital market strength is why the most innovative technology companies of the past generation have been born and raised in the united states not in bank centered financial systems like those found in japan germany korea or france advertisement as understanding of this savings innovation link grows more and more far sighted policy makers recognize that higher retirement savings can not only lift economic growth rates but also raise government revenues and mitigate long term fiscal pressures after all every dollar of retirement savings is one less dollar that an individual or family will ever ask from the government in the future so although the american people s 28 trillion in retirement assets belong to them personally these assets also protect the government from future claims on means tested assistance programs like medicaid personal solvency and national solvency actually reinforce each other congress the media and thought leaders should look at retirement savings policy through a new lens and see these savings as a vital element in a larger national growth strategy too few even now realize what we ve achieved but america s globally unique workplace savings system has become a dynamic engine for capital formation growth and american competitiveness starting thursday the incoming congress has the chance to take it to the next level robert l reynolds president and ceo of putnam investments and great west financial is the author of from here to security how workplace savings can keep america s promise

occur for example when some or all of the money that you invested in the fund is paid back to you a return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the fund s investment performance and

gold looking back looking ahead 2019 â how low can gold price go each year we are treated to calls for gold s next big move we heard it last year and the year before too and the year before that it may not be a broken record but it is the same song predictions for gold s price are more than guesses but they might as well be just guesses that s unfortunate because no small amount of time is spent trying to analyze gold and it is time wasted the analysis is faulty not only is it faulty it is sometimes overly complex the complexity exacerbates the problem how do you analyze something that cannot be analyzed this type of investment assets that will never produce anything requires an expanding pool of buyers who in turn are enticed because they believe the buying pool will expand still further owners are not inspired by what the asset itself can produce it will remain lifeless forever but rather by the belief that others will desire it more avidly in the future warren buffett feb2012 buffet is both right and wrong he is wrong in characterizing gold as an investment but then of course so is nearly everybody else gold is not an investment but he is right that it will never produce anything and that it will remain lifeless forever the claim that owners are inspired by the belief that others will desire it more avidly in the future is more telling it points up the critical flaw in nearly all analysis about gold even those who recognize gold s role as money miss the boat on this one no matter how much others desire it more avidly in the future gold s value will not increase the value of gold is stable and unchanging gold is not subject to traditional laws of supply and demand its value is in its use as money as money it is the measure of value which has been used historically to price other goods and services analysts and investors who expect to profit from large increases in the price of gold do not understand this if they did they would temper their expectations a higher gold price is a reflection of a weakening u s dollar it does not mean that gold is more valuable that is because as the dollar continues to weaken over time it requires more and more dollars to pay for goods and services for owners of gold the higher price compensates for the higher cost of living but what if gold prices were to decline what could bring that about and how low could gold go there is only one reason for declines in the price of gold and it is the exact opposite of the only reason that gold prices go up declines in the price of gold are a reflection of increasing strength in the u s dollar in other words the price of gold reflects inversely the strength or weakness of the u s dollar some people assume that somewhat higher gold prices over the past several weeks are at least partially attributable to money fleeing stocks and moving into gold it is possible that some investors may have acquired gold with proceeds from the sale of stocks but there is no correlation between lower stock prices and higher gold prices see gold vs stocks ratios do not imply correlation some think that a weakening economy will somehow translate to higher gold prices it won t and regardless of the direction of interest rates there is no impact on the price of gold trade tariffs no world war iii no it is all about the u s dollar fear of a credit implosion is another reason that some expect higher prices for gold wrong again a credit collapse would wipe out trillions of dollars of worthless debt and clip asset prices of stocks bonds real estate commodities and gold by anywhere from fifty to ninety percent there would be less dollars available for use to have and to hold and with which to purchase the goods and services that we need and want but the remaining dollars would be more valuable they will purchase more than they would before the collapse however there will be less of them to go around do you think the dollar is about to tank fine then move your dollars into gold but don t expect to get rich the worse it gets for the dollar the more you will need gold just to survive on the other hand if you think the u s dollar will remain relatively stable or even increase in value as a result of deflation then don t expect higher prices for gold so if the dollar were to increase in value significantly just how low might the price of gold go gold prices 100 year historical chart as you can see in the chart above there is a long term forty eight year uptrend in gold s price dating back to december 1970 when gold was priced at 36 00 per ounce if gold s price were to decline back to that uptrend line within the next couple of years then the price range indicated is roughly between 850 1000 00 per ounce that may sound distressing to some but it could be a lot worse the chart below is the same one hundred year history on an inflation adjusted basis the possible downside target changes to somewhere between 550 600 00 per ounce how low can gold go a lot lower than most want to admit under reasonably normal conditions maybe 850 00 900 00 per ounce 850 00 was the january 1980 high point there is the possibility that it could go lower or it might find a floor at 1000 00 per ounce there are several scenarios but there is only one thing you need to focus on the u s dollar if the dollar heads lower and accelerates its long term decline then the price of gold will reflect that by moving higher if on the other hand the dollar continues to stabilize and strengthen then gold s price will reflect that by moving lower my best guess for 2019 stronger dollar lower gold prices also see gold and the need to explain price action kelsey williams is the author of two books inflation what it is what it isn t and who s responsible for it and all hail the fed by

bob corker leaves office thursday after 12 years as u s senator supporters say corker hit his stride as senator when the u s was grappling with the great recession and auto industry crisis when looking back on his work in the senate corker said he has hopefully gotten my uniform dirty on every play although corker has frequently praised trump he s been a vocal critic after 12 years in the u s senate bob corker is set to exit the limelight and an office where he ascended from the lowest rung on the totem pole of washington politics to a voice with global influence but he s far from calling it quits on thursday the 66 year old chattanooga republican will hand over the reins as tennessee s junior senator to marsha blackburn marking the end of his career in the upper chamber where he has challenged and worked with presidents of both parties and taken on a host of complex issues while his future remains uncertain corker certainly sounds like a man a self described independent unafraid to tackle tough issues and members of his own party determined to remain in a position of influence corker debate running for governor and senate today corker has become one of the most closely watched lawmakers in washington frequently making news on a near nightly basis despite his looming departure but not long ago he was on the outside looking in corker unsuccessfully ran for the u s senate in 1994 when he was one of a half dozen republicans a group that became known as the six pack seeking to nab the party s nomination to challenge democratic incumbent jim sasser the campaign famously took a nasty turn notably after the campaign manager for bill frist who eventually won the seat referred to corker as pond scum despite the acrimony corker eventually gained the respect of his onetime competitor the two had become friends during corker s time as tennessee s finance administration commissioner under gov don sundquist and then as mayor of chattanooga when frist knew he wouldn t be seeking a third term in the u s senate where he became majority leader in 2003 he talked with corker about his options the one term chattanooga mayor had significant experience in the public and private sectors and was mulling whether to run for governor or take another shot at the u s senate the pair hiked for several hours up mount le conte in the smoky mountains and then back down talking about what should be next in corker s political future i think the scope and the vision and the opportunity to affect the entire country and indeed the world is what attracted him to the united states senate ultimately rather than running for governor frist said jimmy haslam brother of gov bill haslam ceo of pilot flying j and owner of the nfl s cleveland browns had similar conversations with corker whom he met at the university of tennessee when the two fraternity brothers lived together their families corker s wife elizabeth and haslam s wife dee are distant relatives from sevier county were vacationing in hilton head south carolina when corker was weighing which statewide office he should seek we walked miles and miles and debated the pros and cons jimmy haslam said it was a ton of fun haslam said corker shifted between running for governor one day and a senate bid the next because of corker s executive experience he was drawn toward running for governor haslam said after that bob started thinking about what it might be like to play on a national stage and impact not just one state but 50 states haslam said corker seeks us senate seat in 2006 twelve years after his first run for the senate corker ran once again this time besting former u s reps van hilleary and ed bryant in the 2006 republican primary in the general election corker faced former u s rep harold ford jr a memphis democrat the campaign famously featured a controversial ad from the republican national committee with an actress pretending to be a playboy bunny encouraging ford to call me it was a race corker nearly lost recalls tom ingram a longtime republican political strategist brought in to help close the gap in late september 2006 ingram rebuilt the campaign nearly tripling the staff working out of corker s headquarters and overhauling strategy and media he was running on a liberal conservative theme and it wasn t sticking because he wasn t that conservative and harold wasn t that liberal ingram said besides changing the messaging to harold s of d c and bob s of tennessee the campaign had to quickly work to secure the backing of his primary opponents hilleary and bryant ingram said corker was viewed as kind of a johnny come lately ingram said he was mayor f a commissioner but other than that he hadn t been particularly involved in the party despite ford having an early and significant lead corker ultimately beat his democratic challenger by 2½ points in what became the closest u s senate race in tennessee history corker was the only republican to win election to the u s senate in 2006 a year democrats secured control of congress diving into key issues when he was sworn into office in january 2007 corker flanked by frist sen lamar alexander and former u s sen howard baker jr took the oath from vice president dick cheney using a bible he brought with him on a mission trip to haiti in the 1980s after being named to the senate s committee on foreign relations corker began participating in public hearings and private briefings with president george w bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice on the war in iraq just over a month after being sworn in corker made his first visit to iraq where he met with then u s army lt gen david petraeus after being unfulfilled by the white house s briefings later in the year he returned to iraq for another visit with petraeus alexander said corker bounced around for a few months before he really found his footing as the nation began to see the impact of what later became known as the great recession of 2008 and an auto industry crisis corker began to hit his stride his supporters say jimmy haslam recalled one day calling corker the world champ at calling you back and asking what he was up to corker was at one of the big investment banks meeting with one of its analysts who followed automobile stocks he was getting a seminar on the car business amid bailout negotiations i don t know that many senators but i just don t think that many people would take that step to literally become a student at something like that at that stage in his life to help him make a difference so he could make a better decision haslam said i think that typifies and i know he did a lot of the same thing with the banks really who bob is alexander said corker quickly showed he was a workhorse when we got into the problem with the auto companies bob learned as much about general motors as any director of general motors alexander said corker pushed for wage and benefit concessions for union workers to be part of the auto industry bailout in the throes of the auto and financial crises corker would head back to his washington apartment at night and sometimes stay on the phone with auto and banking executives until midnight recalled ingram ingram said it was obvious that corker was often the only one who had done his homework including senate staff members i remember somebody across the room would ask a question and there wouldn t immediately be anybody who d have an answer said ingram alexander s chief of staff at the time somebody would say where s corker and corker would stand up and give the answer it occasionally created tension for corker with members of more relevant committees he didn t care ingram said it was america s business and he was going to learn everything he could learn about it union criticism over volkswagen vote beyond his work on the auto bailout corker faced criticism from some in the automotive industry because of his efforts to fight against unionization efforts at the volkswagen plant in chattanooga in 2014 the united auto workers said corker and others unfairly influenced a vote at the volkswagen plant in which workers rejected an effort to join the union he s also faced criticism from many within his own party for the role he played in working on president barack obama s nuclear deal with iran a point that president donald trump recently noted additionally corker has faced scrutiny including inquiries by the fbi and the securities and exchange commission for not properly disclosing assets and income on his personal financial disclosure statements corker laid blame on his former accounting firm for what he called technical oversights and welcomed investigations the fbi and sec have not released any evidence to suggest any wrongdoing by corker push for fiscal restraint and reducing the debt beyond his work on the financial crisis and auto bailout corker is also known for pushing reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac as a member of the senate banking committee he s attempted to rein in federal spending and has been among the most vocal lawmakers advocating for the end of human trafficking and slavery during his final months in office he has continued to wield significant influence in december 2017 corker was the only republican senator to vote against an earlier version of a tax reform bill after citing concerns that it did not adequately address the national deficit he later supported the legislation leading his critics to suggest he was receiving some benefit for his reversal a point that corker denied last year corker spent months working to secure the release of a u s citizen who had been held in a venezuelan prison for two years the prisoner was released in may after corker met with venezuelan president nicolas maduro as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee he s also pushed to hold foreign governments accountable for adverse actions including russia over election interference and later saudi arabia for its role in the murder of a washington post columnist when looking back on his work in the senate corker said he has hopefully gotten my uniform dirty on every play in a recent interview with the usa today network tennessee he said on almost every big issue the united states has dealt with he s been in the middle trying to move our country ahead corker s ongoing relationship with trump lately corker has perhaps become best known for his rocky relationship with trump who once considered him for roles in his administration including vice president secretary of state and ambassador to australia although corker has frequently praised trump he s been a vocal critic publicly drawing the ire of the president including as recently as dec 23 that s when corker went on cnn s state of the union and called the partial shutdown of the federal government a purposely contrived fight trump responded on twitter by slamming corker over his work regarding the iran nuclear deal the president also suggested that corker asked for his endorsement to run for a third term but trump refused despite widespread reports to the contrary corker replied on twitter criticizing the president over his claims that mexico would pay for a wall along the southern border of the united states adding alertthedaycarestaff in 2017 corker famously likened the white house to an adult day care center after trump attacked the tennessee senator on twitter alexander said corker s relationship with trump a former new york real estate mogul is akin to the way contractors and developers talk to one another i know them both well enough that down deep they have a lot of respect for each other they still talk alexander said the president respects bob s advice corker noted that while he has been critical of trump he s also worked with him on issues just as he did when obama and bush were in office he said many of his colleagues have tended to stay in their own camps while failing to use their political capital to take on issues to me the people in washington that have courage are the people who stay out of the right or left ditch and are willing to reach across the aisle and to solve our nation s problems and in doing so know that they re burning up capital as they do that he said from frist s perspective corker has struck an important balance of working often behind the scenes to get the job done the team playing at the same time being a strong independent voice is unusual in this day and time in the united states senate frist said gov bill haslam said corker has shown he is not afraid to do the homework and take on difficult issues i think bob had this fierce commitment to find the right answer and then do it kinda regardless of the politics he said deciding not to seek a third term when corker who had said years earlier he would serve only two terms in the senate was trying to decide in 2017 whether he would seek a third term he again looked to a team of trusted advisers and friends while corker knew his value in the senate and wondered whether he should stay after all there were plenty of downsides that solidified his initial instinct to leave washington after 12 years being in the senate meant living away from his family and hometown of chattanooga he was frustrated with the tumultuous relationship he had with the president for every plus there was a minus and at the end of the day it just had to be his personal decision ingram said as for whether he would have been re elected those close to him in the political arena say there is little question corker would have emerged victorious had he run again as the incumbent corker hasn t given much of an indication of what will come next for him my instincts are bob doesn t know jimmy haslam said i know he ll do something where he makes a difference whether that s in public service or the private sector i don t know i predict he ll do something substantial frist who has encouraged his friend to take six months and make no commitments estimates corker will remain active in national and global politics either through appointments to commissions or work with a think tank he also believes corker could return to his roots some type of job creation business a run for president as he closes out his time in the senate corker has repeatedly stoked speculation that he might run for president in an interview with msnbc s kasie hunt in mid december corker responded to a question about whether trump should face a primary challenger in 2020 saying i do think that we ve got to remember what the republican party is when asked by the usa today network tennessee if he is considering challenging trump corker said i have absolutely no idea what the future holds frist said corker has proved himself to be a public official who speaks from the heart and mind while being centered around integrity america is hungry for that frist said although he remains unclear about what he wants to do next corker s rhetoric can at times be reminiscent of a presidential candidate he frequently talks about the polarization of the country and the continued need to reach across the aisle he admits that the nation is facing difficult times politically but is quick to offer a reminder of america s status on a global level we are a great nation corker said i think our greatest days are in front of us

apple on wednesday fed fears that the global economy could be slowing faster than anticipated by announcing it would miss its first quarter revenue estimate a rare misfire that the company blamed on unexpected challenges in the chinese economy and the trade conflict between the united states and china months after unveiling two new iphones in time for the holiday season apple ceo tim cook said in a note to investors that the company had lowered its revenue guidance to us84 billion 121 billion compared to its previous estimate of revenue between us89 billion and us93 billion the news sent apple s stock plunging 7 per cent after hours in explaining the change cook said apple did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deterioration in markets including greater china cook said that most of the revenue shortfall to the company s initial guidance occurred in greater china across iphone mac and ipad along with slowed growth there in the second half of last year cook said that the economic environment in china has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the united states

when chrysler first offered their 300c platform back in 2005 it was as a solid performing sedan that offered excellent people moving skills as the sedan evolved it was offered with more performance oriented things the top level carrying the label srt8 this special performance package included a 6 1l hemi engine producing 425 hp at 6 200 rpm and 420 lb ft of torque at 4 800 rpm and a performance suspension package in chrysler advertising materials the car was capable of 0 to 60 mph in 4 9 seconds advertisement for most folks that would be plenty fast right but for albert villalobos that wasn t nearly fast enough to take his daily transportation to the stratosphere with regards to power villalobos stopped off at spankin time motorsports and worked with owner adam montague to design a package that would make his 2005 chrysler 300c one of a kind in its current form the sedate sedan delivers timeslips of 10 01 seconds at 143 mph and dyno sheets proclaiming 850 plus horsepower at the rear tires in the beginningbut the road to such sterling performance didn t come all at once as a high school freshman villalobos fell in love with the newest generation of the 300c when it first arrived in 2005 unfortunately he wasn t in a position to own one at the time but the hook was set and when he had the means he purchased a used one as his daily driver at that time he wasn t versed in the ways of the srt8 lore but he did feel that his hemi v 8 definitely needed a boost and installed high performance intake and a set of flowmaster mufflers just to make it different from the rest as luck would have it villalobos had the chance to meet montague at spankin time motorsports where they talked about potential next steps in the 300c s evolution villalobos spotted a car equipped with a procharger at montagues shop and shortly thereafter the procharger p1 supercharger found it way on to villalobos mopar while the power increase was huge it just whets his appetite for even greater future power upgrades not long after the first power adder upgrade villalobos and montague began preparations for full tilt gen3 mopar powertrain that would include the much larger procharger f1d supercharger and a completely new engine transmission and suspension makeover over the next three years villalobos would pay montague on the installment plan montague buying specific pieces as the money came in with all of the new parts in hand montague dug in pulled the 300c apart and built the creation we see here including the stroker 401 cid engine getting seriousto deliver the most power potential the 300c was converted to e85 fuel to take advantage of the high octane fuel that would allow more latitude with regards to performance changes next came the reworking of the engine and an slight enlargement of the engine from 5 7 liters this was not an srt8 originally to 6 6 liters 401 cid and installing a package of montague approved components that include molnar 4 080 inch stroker crankshaft molnar turbo rods and cp carrillo 9 2 1 compression pistons and blower ring set the valvetrain was enhanced through the use of crower components including a high lift custom camshaft but using stock rocker arms and shafts advertisement while the change in fuel and the reworked engine were clearly capable of some high horsepower outputs all on their own the crowing touch was the installation of a procharger f1d supercharger and front mounted intercooler that deliver 15 8 pounds of boost these highly efficient superchargers are designed to fit underhood a key request by villalobos who wasn t interested in letting his competition see just why this 300c could so easily spin the rear slicks add to that the highly modified fuel system a host of big fuel flow components including an ati 17 percent overdrive balancer 80mm throttle body five o motorsports 1 400cc black ops injector system billet fuel rails fore innovations triple billet hat and three ti 465 fuel pumps programmed to deliver progressive tip in of the fuel flow by rpm level the key here is the tuning which montague has developed through massive amounts of trial and error on his in house dyno and in the field drag testing the procharger f1d package fit perfectly into the forward section of the driver s side of the engine compartment using the factory beltdrive system and mounts while the car has well over 160 000 miles on the clock the new performance package is just getting started and now has a little over 6 000 of roadwork with a few quarter mile trips in between so far short of a few tuning adjustments everything is working just fine villalobos is careful to change the oil in the procharger supercharger every other engine oil change or about every three months comfort and safetythe interior of the 300c looks very much as it did from the factory with one glaringly obvious change a 10 point rollcage that serves two purposes to protect the driver in case of an accident and to tie the chassis together allowing the suspension to be that much more efficiency by keeping the tires and related components in place amazingly the ride quality is improved from stock even if the ability to find your way into the front seats is more challenging than before on either side to aid in driver exit and entry the sidebar is pinned and can be released and then repined once the occupant is in place full five point harness restraints are included to keep everyone safe advertisement clearly villalobos plan to run quietly around town with his stealth cruiser is intact with a couple of small details that tell the locals that this isn t a stock chrysler 300c for one villalobos runs hoosier rear slicks most of the time around southern california since it doesn t rain from march through to november and with 870 rwhp on tap villalobos is in the club a card carrying member of the team spankin time where members must have two things they must be built by montague and achieve a minimum of 750 rwhp frankly villalobos was almost there running 91 octane pump gasoline but the biggest red flag that signals something s up is the sound of the procharger supercharger that wines loudly when the throttle goes down regardless the exterior which exhibits some wear to the paint and the front spoiler definitely plays the part of a sleeper of course those who happen to go down to the local fontana california dragstrip know much better advertisement 2005 chrysler 300calbert villalobos ca riverside ca engine advertisement type 5 7l chrysler hemi stroked to 6 6 liters 401

the roller coaster ride on wall street resumed on wednesday the first trading day of the new year as stocks plunged early on then slowly recovered and finished with a slight gain wall street tumbled earlier but recovered to finish just in the black credit ap the dow jones industrial average dropped as much as 398 points in the first few minutes of trading after more shaky economic news from china but it gradually recouped those losses and a small rally over the last 15 minutes of trading left major indexes a bit higher than where they started that kind of whiplash was typical during the last three months of 2018 and many strategists think it is likely to continue a chinese government survey and one by a major business magazine showed manufacturing in china weakened in december as global and domestic demand cooled that weighed on big exporters with tech companies like microsoft and industrials like boeing taking sharp losses early on only to bounce back
democrats around the country are gearing up for what will likely be a crowded 2020 presidential race and washington state s gov jay inslee is expected to throw his hat in the ring of electoral hopefuls so far only elizabeth warren d ma has officially announced her run but inslee could also run he told the atlantic in an article published on jan 2 that we re laying the groundwork that would make this a feasible thing in the relatively short term the other indication is his political action committee called vision pac which was created last october raised 112 600 in contributions between oct 4 and nov 26 according to the federal election commission however inslee has not officially announced his political media representative jamal raad said in an email governor inslee believes we need a presidential candidate who will put fighting climate change front and center in our national dialogue and is seriously considering running no final decision has been made yet raad said this number of financial contributions to vision pac is likely even higher after more than a month but current contributions data was not available as of jan 2 the next step for an inslee campaign would be the creation of an exploratory committee similar to what warren recently announced the atlantic article said inslee who was elected as washington s governor in 2012 has pursued one of the greenest agendas in the country with fields of solar panels fleets of electric buses and massive job growth to show for it however sound publishing political columnist jerry cornfield has noted that inslee s track record is long on preaching and short on accomplishment there are more electric vehicles on the road and utilities are getting more power from alternative sources but greenhouse gas emissions aren t tumbling and every attempt by inslee to compel a reduction of carbon emissions through taxes fees or executive order has failed it may be that if inslee runs for president it will be on his green credentials and to push for national climate change reform central to this cornfield argues is whether inslee will be able to push through his legislation and budget in the 2019 state legislature in a year where democrats control both the state house and senate he can miss on a couple things but he cannot come up empty too many times next session with his own democratic party controlling both chambers of the legislature cornfield wrote that would be embarrassing and invite questions out loud about inslee s ability to carry out a legislative agenda with partisans in congress in inslee s 2019 2021 budget he proposed a new capital gains tax on the sale of stocks bonds and other assets increasing the state business and occupation tax on services and changing the state s real estate excise tax from a regressive flat rate to a graduated rate that would lower the tax on sales of lower value properties inslee is also proposing an initiative to reduce emissions in the state s building sector and to promote clean energy projects and research included in this is 57 5 million for the state s clean energy fund for projects to modernize the electric grid and the development of clean technology in total inslee hopes to push through more than 273 million in green energy spending and reforms seattle weekly has reached out to both inslee s campaign for comment and political researchers and will update this story when more information becomes available other names which have attracted speculation over potential presidential bids include rep beto o rourke d tx who ran against sen ted cruz in the 2018 election narrowly losing against the incumbent republican in a deeply red state sen kamala harris d ca has also been floated as a candidate as has sen bernie sanders i vt historically there have been 17 presidents who had previously served as governor but only four have been elected since the end of world war ii and include george w bush bill clinton ronald reagan and jimmy carter
apple inc plunged to its lowest price in a year and a half after the company cut its revenue outlook for the first time in almost two decades citing weaker demand in china chief executive officer tim cook said sales will be about us 84 billion in the quarter ended dec 29 down from earlier estimates of us 89 billion to us 93 billion apple posted sales of us 88 3 billion in the fiscal first quarter a year earlier so the new forecast would mean apple is reporting a holiday quarter slowdown for the first time since cook became ceo in 2011 apple shares fell 10 per cent to us 142 19 the biggest drop in almost six years in new york thursday the revenue revision which came late wednesday led markets lower around the world and also triggered a slump for asian suppliers and a wave of lower price targets from wall street the announcement made in a letter from cook to investors comes after weeks of signals from inside apple and its supply chain indicating the cupertino california based company is struggling to sell the latest iphones released in september the flagship product earns apple about two thirds of its revenue and allows the company to generate more money from attached products like apple watches airpods and services like apple music tim cook s letter to shareholders about sales slowdown full text read tim cook s memo to employees about iphone sales slowdown while we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration particularly in greater china cook wrote greater china a region that includes the mainland hong kong and taiwan accounted for most of the revenue shortfall but iphone upgrades also weren t as strong as the company anticipated in some developed markets cook said weigh in which of these tech names is the best buy right now results total results 0 suppliers in europe and asia slumped on the news several key apple suppliers overseas had cut their revenue estimates during the past few months suggesting something was amiss in november the company said it would stop reporting unit sales of iphones ipads and macs beginning in fiscal 2019 that sparked concern apple wanted to avoid disclosing weak growth numbers apple s stock had fallen 32 per cent from an october peak to its close of us 157 92 wednesday amid growing concerns about the iphone in december bloomberg news reported the company was facing a fire drill to boost iphone sales that led apple to aggressively market the iphone xr on its website for us 449 about us 300 less than its official sticker price the deal required customers to trade in an iphone 7 plus a high end handset from two years earlier still the market seemed to be caught off guard we were surprised about the magnitude of the miss and the negative impact of china demand for iphones wrote citigroup global markets inc analyst jim suva at least six wall street firms including btig and rbc lowered their share price forecasts by more than 15 per cent after cook s letter cook said the new iphone models were released earlier than the flagship iphone x last year which created a difficult year over year comparison the iphone x launched in november 2017 while the iphone xs and xs max were released in september cook also noted supply constraints to new models of the apple watch ipad pro and airpods iphone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be he said meaning the sales of new models to current customers replacing their old phones the ceo attributed much of the company s shortfall in its outlook to struggles in china that he pinned on the economy and rising trade tensions with the u s as the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets the effects appeared to reach consumers as well with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in china declining as the quarter progressed cook said apple isn t the only company facing difficulties in a slowing chinese economy and escalating trade tensions fedex corp starbucks corp tiffany co and daimler ag are also finding it harder to sell their wares in the world s second largest economy there are likely many others too that will be forced to announce lower than expected earnings according to the chairman of the white house council of economic advisers it s not going to be just apple cea chairman kevin hassett said in an interview on cnn there are a heck of a lot of u s companies that have sales in china that are going to be watching their earnings being downgraded next year until we get a deal with china the timing of apple s announcement blaming its shortcomings partly on president donald trump s trade war with china may increase pressure on american officials to ease the tensions quickly mid level officials from the trump administration are scheduled to travel to beijing for talks early next week while iphone revenue accounted for the forecast cut apple s other product categories including the ipad and services grew a combined 19 per cent year over year he said services generated us 10 8 billion in revenue for the quarter a 27 per cent increase from a year earlier apple s decision to cut its sales outlook isn t a huge shock at this point said shannon cross of cross research it will be interesting to see how apple shares react if there s a china trade agreement

updated at 9 39 a m et thursday apple is cutting billions from its revenue estimates for the just ended holiday season citing sharply slower iphone sales in china while we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration particularly in greater china ceo tim cook said wednesday in a letter to apple investors cook lowered the company s revenue guidance for the three months that ended dec 29 to about 84 billion from as much as 93 billion the announcement of weakness from one of the world s largest companies offers fresh evidence of a global economic slowdown which has sent stock markets sliding in recent months cook said that in its earlier projection apple had expected economic weakness in some emerging markets this turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected the company also saw fewer iphone upgrades than we had anticipated he said in august apple became the first private sector company worth 1 trillion but its stock has dropped more than 30 percent in the past three months leaving its market cap at below 750 billion apple s stock fell an additional 9 3 percent thursday morning cook said the slowing in china s economy was made worse by rising trade tensions with the united states slumping financial markets seemed to hurt consumer confidence in china he said with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in china declining as the quarter progressed copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
betting on banks is a macro call in a recent article i made a case for buying bank stocks and explained the relationship between bank stocks and the broader economy my thesis can be summarized in three parts a recession likely won t materialize in 2019 the cyclical sectors that have been hit the most on recession fears will have the strongest recovery in 2019 bank stocks are extremely cheap after selling off into bear market territory bank stocks will benefit from a recovery in the overall stock market as well as a steepening of the yield curve i won t be rehashing the full argument here if interested i recommend readers check it out here the key takeaway is that if you believe the us economy won t immediately head into a recession in 2019 it s probably a good idea to load up on bank stocks bank of america is a best of breed bank of the hundreds of bank stocks to choose from bank of america nyse bac stands out as a solid choice here because it is extremely well run and has a rock solid balance sheet bac is led by ceo brian moynihan who was appointed to the role in december 2009 after serving as ceo of merrill lynch where he was appointed ceo in september 2008 after it was merged with bank of america moynihan navigated the bank through the repercussions of the financial crisis which principally involved raising capital to meet new regulatory standards notably moynihan raised 5 billion in tier 1 capital from warren buffett in 2011 which improved investor confidence in the bank s stability moynihan is more than just a war time leader he has been able to return the bank to profitable growth despite a much tougher regulatory environment the company s total revenue is now above where it was in 2010 despite significant divestitures of non core and toxic loan portfolios bac has undergone significant restructuring and cost cutting resulting in higher operating margins since 2011 bank of america has cut its total operating expenses by 29 despite revenue rising 9 5 the company has also repurchased shares further helping to juice eps and bvps growth bank of america s financial recovery under moynihan has been outstanding as noted in the above table the cost reductions have been achieved through a combination of investments in technology shrewd expense monitoring and recent regulatory tailwinds bac has been net cutting its total branch count and back office staff however due to increased usage of its mobile app consumer deposits and wealth management aum have grown robustly bac has still added branches in under served markets and net grown front office employee headcount this is to say that the company has still invested in growth despite heavy expense reductions overall as we can see from the above table bank of america has improved on all of its quality metrics and shows strong overall health today nonperforming loans as a of total loans have declined every year since 2010 and are not likely to rise much in an economic downturn due to the bank s conservative underwriting policies leverage and interest coverage ratios are at healthy levels despite significant capital spent on share buybacks dividends and rising interest rates the tier 1 capital ratio is at a healthy 12 9 currently which implies that bank of america is unlikely to face significant liquidity issues most importantly return on common equity has steadily risen and is at a 9 year high of 8 9 roe is the best measure of capital efficiency for a bank similar to return on invested capital for non banks as roe continues to rise bac will churn out more and more cash flow which can be invested in additional interest bearing loans or returned to shareholders ample academic research has demonstrated a strong historical relationship between bank roe and valuation multiples this implies investors should benefit from both rising earnings and a rising valuation multiple if roe continues to move higher bank of america s valuation comparing bac to its large cap banking peers the company is cheaper on a forward p e basis as well as on a p tangible book basis however bac currently turns out a lower return on equity and is expected to grow eps next year at a lower rate this implies that bac is likely fairly valued when compared against its peers however in absolute terms the stock is extremely cheap trading at 8 9x forward p e and only 1 4x price to tangible book usually when stocks are this cheap they either have distressed balance sheets or are value traps with declining earnings bank of america is neither making the stock a screaming buy in my opinion furthermore the company has been buying back stock and increasing dividends paid to investors at a nice clip in the past 12 months bac repurchased 19 7 billion in stock the stock currently offers a 2 5 dividend yield over the past 5 years the company has increased dividends per share at a 72 compound annual rate from 0 04 to 0 60 currently this past year dividends per share were increased by 54 bac s payout ratio is currently around 30 there is plenty of room for dividends to increase from here while maintaining the company s healthy balance sheet and investment plans concluding thoughts with the stock market crash we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018 investors appear to be throwing out the baby with the bath water well run banks with solid balance sheets like bank of america will fare well if we experience an economic downturn at the same time if we do not head into a recession in 2019 as i continue to believe bank stocks will be amongst the strongest performing groups therefore the risk reward on bank of america is skewed to the upside reader note this is a continuation in my series covering financial stocks click here if you would like to read my prior article making a macro call on the banks

tom krisher the associated press detroit shares of electric car and solar panel maker tesla inc tumbled wednesday after the company cut vehicle prices by 2 000 and announced fourth quarter sales figures that fell short of wall street estimates the company said in a statement before the markets opened that it delivered over 245 000 electric cars and suvs last year nearly as many as all previous years combined but tesla also said it would cut prices of its three models by 2 000 to help customers handle the gradual phase out of federal electric vehicle tax credits on jan 1 the federal credit for tesla buyers dropped from 7 500 to 3 750 it will gradually be phased out this year fourth quarter the company s deliveries for the full year matched wall street estimates but its figures for the fourth quarter didn t reach expectations tesla said it delivered 90 700 vehicles from october through december analysts polled by data provider factset expected 92 000 tesla said fourth quarter deliveries were 8 percent higher than its previous quarterly peak in the third quarter of 2018 tesla shares fell 7 2 percent in midday trading to 308 94 in the past year they have traded from a low of 244 59 to a high of 387 46 the company now is moving into an important phase of its business and will have to decide whether to cut production to match what appears to be waning demand or discount its vehicles to stimulate sales like other automakers do gartner analyst michael ramsey said they have for a long time had more demand than supply ramsey said it s becoming apparent that that dynamic is changing shift tesla will try to disguise the price cuts with the disappearing tax credit or discounts for buyers who refer other customers to tesla ramsey said the cars are quite expensive and they re still electric vehicles they don t appeal to everybody he said adding that not everyone is interested in the limited range or having to pay extra for a home charging unit for the full year tesla said it produced 254 530 vehicles which is 9 290 more than it delivered the company wouldn t say how many vehicles it had in inventory at the end of the year but it reported enough to supply 20 days of sales at the end of september our inventory levels remain the smallest in the automotive industry the company said wednesday in late december the associated press spotted dozens of teslas stored in a lot on chicago s north side and mark spiegel a hedge fund manager who bets against tesla s stock price reported hundreds of vehicles stored at other locations across the u s falling short tesla s 2018 production fell far short of a goal set nearly three years ago of manufacturing 500 000 vehicles for the year that goal was announced in may of 2016 based on advance orders for the model 3 it s not clear how the delivery figures will affect tesla s fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings which likely will be announced in february ramsey said the company s stock price rose despite past losses because investors always thought tesla had to spend money to increase production to meet high demand if demand fades then well documented financial problems such as high debt start to become very very serious ramsey said tesla s 2018 deliveries included almost 146 000 model 3 lower priced cars and another 99 000 of the model s sedan and model x suv both of which can easily top 100 000 the model 3 starts at 35 000 but still can t be purchased for under 45 000 profit in the third quarter of 2018 tesla delivered on ceo elon musk s promise to make a net profit after years of losses the company earned 311 5 million during the three months ending in september swinging from a loss of 619 million at the same time last year it was only the third time that tesla has posted a quarterly profit in its eight year history as a public company and the first time in two years musk has promised to post sustained quarterly profits as of the end of september the company reported 9 7 billion in long term debt and another 3 6 billion in accounts payable owed to parts suppliers and other companies tesla ended september with 2 9 billion in cash moody s investor service downgraded the company s debt into junk territory last march warning that tesla won t have cash to cover 3 7 billion for normal operations capital expenses and debt that comes due early this year moody s predicted the company would have to raise more capital

save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q3 hedge fund letters conference scoops etc 2 a friend who s lived and invested in china for many years sent me these interesting comments in response to an article i sent to my china email list china s economy slows sharply in challenge for xi jinping yes things here are challenging though more it seems from a general sentiment perspective than the day to day actual financial results folks are experiencing that being said poor sentiment and future outlook could over time become self fulfilling especially if the current trade nationalistic rhetoric actions continue to deteriorate in the manufacturing related businesses that we are close to like those discussed in the article we have actually seen strong results to date with much of their 2018 businesses being dramatically front loaded in anticipation of a worsening trade situation essentially they have completed their year s work early and in most cases with significant gains over last year in terms of total expected 2018 revenues and profitability while 2018 looks quite good there is a great deal of concern for 2019 and many of these companies have been focused on developing implementing alternative plans for the coming year to manage their business either through diverting production to factories outside china or markets other than the united states for more domestically focused businesses we have seen mixed results definitely a slowdown in large scale discretionary purchases like autos or homes though day to day consumption continues to expand significantly for example has experienced substantial mid high teen growth this year at retail including through 3q with significantly higher growth in terms of online revenues overall there continues to be quite robust consumption growth and a relatively positive outlook going forward that being said the capital markets have been off dramatically since the mid january 2018 highs and this has taken its toll on overall domestic sentiment important to keep in mind that 2017 was a big year for china with the equivalent of nearly 1 2 trillion in additional gdp the highest level of absolute economic growth ever experienced to date in china equivalent to the size of the entire mexican economy the china related capital markets had a banner year in 2017 as well in early 2018 the chinese government felt things were getting overheated and started their deleveraging campaign to calm things down the resulting capital markets decline and rmb depreciation were well on their way when the trade war united states china relations challenges started gathering momentum in the summer while i m generally optimistic over the medium long term for continued economic growth here in china i am quite concerned that the rhetoric on both sides of the trade dispute and more generally overall united states china relations is misguided and getting out of control this is not in either country s interest and most unfortunate given all of the areas that the two countries need and should be working more closely together trade energy environment public health regional security we certainly live in interesting times 3 some very long and insightful articles over the weekend let s start with the wsj ge powered the american century then it burned out excerpt the leadership

helped build china s artificial islands in the south china sea a major point of military tension with the united states its clients have included saudi arabia s absolute monarchy turkey under the autocratic leadership of president recep tayyip erdogan and corruption plagued governments in countries like south africa in ukraine mckinsey and paul manafort president trump s campaign chairman later convicted of financial fraud were paid by the same oligarch to help burnish the image of a disgraced presidential candidate viktor f yanukovych recasting him as a reformer 5 the rise lean and fall of facebook s sheryl sandberg buzzfeed excerpt it wasn t until november and the new york times investigation that sandberg became the focal point for external and internal blame she reportedly pushed for others to take the fall for actions she d approved or overseen including opposition research intended to slime various and sundry detractors as kara swisher put it including george soros so now come the calls for her comeuppance the logic makes sense why blame zuckerberg he s just a kid blame the adult in the room blame the unicorn but optics make that blame difficult or at least difficult to act on as one anonymous facebook employee explained one does not simply fire the author of lean in and pretty much the sole female executive in top leadership and so sandberg soldiers on even as employees increasingly turn against her however privately externally swisher and others have interpreted the critical pile on against sandberg as sexist or ammunition for those retrograde few arguing that this is what happens when women attempt to have it all others have pointed to the ways in which her fate exemplifies the hollowness at the heart of leaning in sandberg s advice has always centered on getting a seat at the table molly roberts argues and then keeping everything exactly the same from how silicon valley conceives of women to how facebook considers its responsibility to society at large within this paradigm leaning in is fundamentally about abdicating responsibility or desire for substantive change back in 2013 one of sandberg s former professors was trying to

become a major source of profit and pride for berkshire and as a citizen matt has been an exemplar for corporate leadership matt rose less is not better excerpt i think we re at a tricky time now the street i m talking about sell side analysts has been extremely aggressive with the publicly traded railroads they re saying that less is better less capital is better fewer market opportunities are better fewer unit trains are better it s all about lowering the operating ratio i disagree with almost all of that i truly believe that every industry every business needs growth vantuono so you would say less is not better matt rose absolutely it s not let me tell you why if you go back to the 1980s you saw where some railroads had a singular focus on operating ratio and the easiest way to reduce operating ratio is to take out track and reduce maintenance expenses that s really not the covenant if you will we have with our regulator the stb and even public policy makers the staggers act wasn t railroads haul only what you want to haul on your network it s haul everything and you have the ability and the flexibility to differentially price on your network that s the deal and it s in the public s best interest to move more tons to the railroad network not to move tons off the railroad network so i think we re going into an interesting period where that will all be sorted out i can t tell you how it s all going to work out but there s going to be a lot of activity bnsf s mission has simply been to provide a great service through the heartbeat of the railroad capital investment expand the railroad you see every year that we do expansion in our company and then provide service that s going to get more customers to use our railroad in more locations vantuono how do you view
